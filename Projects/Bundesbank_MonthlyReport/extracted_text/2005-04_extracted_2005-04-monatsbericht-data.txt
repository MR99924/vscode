5CommentariesEconomic conditions
IndustryIndustrial activity held up quite well in the
first two months of 2005, although the out-look for the subsequent period has fallen offsomewhat. In the two-month period of Janu-ary and February, orders were only slightlydown on the fourth quarter, which had beenparticularly favourable owing to a number oflarge-scale orders. However, orders weresomewhat weaker in February than in Janu-ary. The year-on-year figure went down to1
1/C252% at the end of the period under review.
Whereas exports, particularly of capitalgoods, were still tending to rise, domestic de-mand again generated no stimuli.
In the first two months of 2005 overall, sea-
sonally adjusted industrial output was notice-ably higher than in the fourth quarter of2004. However, output in February wassomewhat down on the extremely strongJanuary level in seasonally adjusted terms.There was a year-on-year increase of 4% inthe first two months of 2005. In particular,the chemicals industry, manufacturers of of-fice machinery and computers, and of radio,television and communication equipment,stepped up their production significantly.
ConstructionFollowing favourable weather conditions in
January, construction activity declined sharplyin February with the onset of cold winterweather. The year-on-year fall increased from7% in the fourth quarter of 2004 to 12

6in the first two months of 2005. In January,
which is the latest month for which informa-tion is available at present, the constructionindustry received noticeably fewer ordersthan it did on an average of the fourth quar-ter. This was 14
1/C252% down on the same
month last year. The fall in demand was espe-cially pronounced in the case of non-residential construction, which had still beenbenefiting from large orders at the end of2004.
Economy as a wholeAfter adjustment for seasonal and working-
day variations, real gross domestic product(GDP) is likely to have grown perceptiblyagain in the first quarter of 2005, thus morethan offsetting the statistical fall in the fourthquarter of 2004. The cyclical upturn in theGerman economy, which had been disruptedin the second half of 2004, therefore con-tinued after the start of the new year. Onceagain, a crucial factor for renewed growthwas demand from abroad, which led to ex-ports rising more sharply than imports in thefirst two months of 2005 as a whole andto an increase in net exports. By contrast,domestic demand remained weak overall.
Labour marketOn the labour market, both employment and
unemployment continued to rise. The season-ally adjusted number of persons in workreached 38.97 million in February, an increaseof about 215,000 persons, or
1/C252%, on the
year. The rise was sustained largely by mini-jobs, one-euro jobs and one-person busi-Economic conditions in Germany*

7nesses. Over the past two months, however,
the number of new approvals of businessstart-up grants has gone down considerablyas the long-term unemployed no longer be-long to the group of persons who are entitledto them. The number of employees subject tosocial security insurance contributions wentdown to 26.25 million in January. However,the year-on-year fall slowed down to
1/C252%. In
seasonally adjusted terms, the month-on-month figure even showed a rise for the firsttime since spring 2001.
The seasonally adjusted number of persons
officially registered as unemployed rose by90,000 to 4.97 million in March. This signifiesan increase of almost half a million on last De-cember. Around four-fifths of this figure is dueto the introduction of unemployment benefitII, which, mainly in January and February, ledto an influx into the official statistics of personsnot previously registered who were receivingsocial assistance but able to work. In March,the effect of Hartz IV was confined to anincrease of some 20,000 persons. Further-more, the onset of winter contributed to theseasonally adjusted rise in unemployment. Theseasonally adjusted unemployment rate, ascalculated by the Federal Employment Agency,went up to 12.0% at the end of the reportingperiod. The standardised unemployment ratewas 9.4% in February.
PricesPrices in recent weeks have again been af-
fected by oil prices rising to new highs. Theprices quoted for Brent North Sea Oil went upto US$57 in early April, which meant theywere roughly two-thirds up on the year. The
rise in prices was, in fact, more than 50% ineuro terms, the single currency having appre-ciated considerably over 12 months. Oil priceswere somewhat lower again at the end ofthe period under review.
Influenced by the higher crude oil prices, sea-
sonally adjusted consumer prices went up byno less than 0.4% in March. The cost of fuelwent up by 6.2% on the year, while the priceof heating oil rose 36.8% and that of gas7.5%. For the first time in 12 months, food inMarch 2004 was also more expensive in year-on-year terms. Overall, price inflation re-mained quite subdued. According to the na-tional Consumer Price Index (CCPI), the an-nual rate amounted to 1.8%, as in March.Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)inflation went up by 1.7%.
The renewed rise in the price of crude oil as
early as the beginning of the year was reflect-ed in sharply rising import prices in February,too. The prices of intermediate goods alsowent up further. However, there was hardlyany movement in the prices of capital andconsumer goods. Overall, the prices of im-ported goods went up by 3.7% on the yearand by no more than 0.7% if energy sourcesare excluded. German domestic industrial fac-tory gate prices also rose again sharply in sea-sonally adjusted terms in February. There wasan overall year-on-year increase of 4.2%, or3.1% if energy sources are excluded. Where-as intermediate goods prices went up by al-most 6%, increases in the prices of capitaland consumer goods remained within signifi-cantly narrower bounds.

Indebtedness of central, state and
local government
In February the indebtedness of central, state
and local government increased by 33.7 bil-
lion. The Federal Government accounted for32.1 billion of this amount. Whereas its liabil-
ities on the money market rose by 33.1 bil-
lion, its capital market debt declined by 31
billion. This was mainly due to the fall in theoutstanding amount of five-year Federalnotes (Bobls). Following the scheduled re-demption of a maturing security from 1999with a coupon of 4.25%, the outstandingvolume of Bobls declined by 36.8 billion. By
contrast, the amount of Federal bonds(Bunds) in circulation increased by 34.7 bil-
lion. In this context, the second topping-up ofa ten-year Bund from November yielded 35.9
billion. In the course of market managementoperations, 31.2 billion worth of Bunds were
repurchased on balance.
State government increased its indebtedness
by31.3 billion in February. The borrowing re-
quirement was largely covered by taking uploans from banks against borrowers’ notesamounting to 31.1 billion. By contrast, treas-
ury notes issued by state government – theirpercentage of overall state government debthas been constantly rising in the last fewyears – went up only marginally by 30.3 bil-
lion. The indebtedness of local governmentprobably again increased moderately.Central government borrowing
In March central government lowered its in-
debtedness by 36.1 billion in total, whereby
32.4 billion was redeemed on the money
market and 33.7 billion on the capital market.
The decline in central government debt was,however, accompanied by a stronger fall in itsmoney market deposits (- 37.8 billion). Above
all, Federal Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze) were re-deemed (- 34.4 billion). Although the issue of
a two-year Schatz yielded 36.9 billion and
market management transactions raised afurther 30.7 billion, these were offset by a
scheduled redemption of 312 billion. At
2.47%, the yield on the new issue comparedwith the last issue of the maturing securityfrom 2003 was almost unchanged. Bankloans were reduced by 31 billion. By contrast,Net borrowing in the market

9the amount of Treasury discount paper
(Bubills) in circulation increased by 31.5 bil-
lion. Whereas 35.9 billion was redeemed on
schedule, the monthly tender allotmentraised 35.7 billion. A further 31.7 billion
accrued to central government as a resultof market management transactions.
In the first quarter, net central government
borrowing amounted to 320.8 billion in total,
compared with 335.0 billion in the same
period of 2004. However, it should be bornein mind that the Federal Government concur-rently ran down its money market deposits by35 billion, whereas in the first quarter of
2004 they had gone up by almost the sameamount. New borrowing on the money mar-ket amounted to 311.1 billion. In the case of
the increase in capital market liabilities ( 39.7
billion), the focus was on the issuance ofBunds, the outstanding amount of which in-creased by 312.3 billion. The financing condi-
tions in the long-term maturity segment con-tinued to be very favourable. The yield on theten and thirty-year Bunds issued in Januarywas 3.67% and 4.04% respectively; by con-trast a Bund from 1995 which matured in thesame month had an interest rate of 7.375%.Compared with 2004, too, the yields for ten-year Bunds declined further. Whereas the lastissue from February had a coupon of 3.75%and was issued at a marginal premium, theissue yield of a ten-year Bund from February2004 had amounted to 4.09%. At the shortend, however, the issue yield on Bubills roseby around 14 basis points compared withMarch 2004 to 2.07%.Securities markets
Bond marketIssuing activity in the German bond market
eased slightly in February. Gross sales of do-mestic bonds and notes declined from3126.9 billion in January to 3106.5 billion
(market value). After deducting redemptionsand changes in issuers’ holdings of their ownbonds and notes, sales of domestic debt se-curities amounted to 316.8 billion compared
with 328.6 billion in January. By contrast,
sales of paper issued by foreign borrowers in-creased ( 320.9 billion). Hence more than half
of the total net sales of bonds and notes onthe German market ( 337.7 billion) was attrib-
utable to bonds issued by non-residents.Net borrowing in the market by central

10Among domestic issuers, credit institutions,
in particular, sold a large volume of paper inFebruary. They issued debt securities worth314.1 billion net ( 33.2 billion in January). Spe-
cialised credit institutions accounted for 38.9
billion of this, while other bank debt secur-ities yielded the similar sum of 38.7 billion.
The outstanding amount of mortgage Pfand-briefe increased for the first time since Octo-ber of last year ( 31.9 billion). By comparison,
public Pfandbriefe were redeemed on bal-ance (- 35.4 billion).
Non-financial corporations tapped the Ger-
man bond market to a greater extent in Feb-ruary ( 35.4 billion). They again increased their
borrowing mainly through the issuance ofmoney market paper ( 34.4 billion).After traditionally heavy borrowing in January
(323.4 billion), the public sector reduced its
capital market debt by 32.7 billion in Febru-
ary. Central government redeemed debt se-curities in the amount of 32.9 billion net. This
applied particularly to five-year Federal notes(Bobls) (- 37.2 billion). It placed Federal bonds
with a ten-year maturity (Bunds) worth 34.7
billion and sold two-year Federal Treasurynotes (Sch/C228tze) for 31.2 billion. On balance,
state government issued 30.3 billion worth of
bonds and notes.
In February, residents and non-residents in-
vested nearly equal amounts on the Germanbond market ( 319.8 billion and 318.0 billion
respectively). Domestic credit institutions pur-chased debt securities totalling 312.6 billion
(314.1 billion in January), 311.1 billion alone
of which was invested in foreign securities.Domestic non-banks bought 39.8 billion
worth of foreign debt securities ( 31.9 billion
in January). They also purchased 35.1 billion
worth of bonds and notes issued by privatedomestic borrowers. Foreign investors werethe sole purchasers of public debt securities(37.3 billion) on balance, while domestic
credit institutions (- 32.2 billion) and particu-
larly domestic non-banks (- 37.7 billion) sold
this type of paper. Furthermore, foreign in-vestors purchased 310.7 billion worth of debt
securities issued by domestic private borrow-ers.

11stitutions and non-banks ( 35.7 billion and
33.0 billion respectively) sales of domestic
equities were, on balance, attributable entire-ly to foreign investors. Resident investors pur-chased exclusively foreign shares ( 33.8 bil-
lion).
Mutual fund sharesSales of mutual fund shares presented a
mixed picture. On the one hand, domesticfunds open to the public again experienced aconsiderable outflow of funds (- 32.3 billion),
after having sold fund shares for 30.9 billion
in January, which was possibly due to the re-investment of sizeable dividend payments.The outflow concerned mixed funds andopen-end real estate funds, and to a lesserextent, share-based funds. On the otherhand, special funds, which manage institu-tional investors’ monies, and foreign funds re-corded inflows of 32.2 billion and 35.4 billion
respectively. On balance, sales of mutual fundshares were down by half on the month at35.3 billion. These shares were sold in nearly
equal amounts to domestic credit institutions(32.7 billion) and non-banks ( 33.1 billion).
Foreign investors redeemed 30.5 billion
worth of domestic mutual fund shares.
Balance of payments
The German current account closed with a
surplus of 38.4 billion in February, up 31.6 bil-
lion from January. This can be attributedmainly to a noticeable decline in the deficiton invisible current transactions, which com-prise services, income and current transfers.However, there was hardly any change in the
trade balance.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the foreign trade sur-plus amounted to 313.5 billion in February,
slightly ( 30.2 billion) above the previous
month’s figure.
1After adjustment for season-
al variations, the trade balance was almostunchanged at 313 billion. In seasonally ad-
justed terms, exports of goods were 3%down on the previous month’s high figurewhile imports of goods were down by 3
1/C252%.
In the three months from December to Febru-ary, neither exports nor imports quitematched the high level reached in the com-parable period from September to November(just under 1% and 1
1/C252% lower, respectively).
The deficit on invisible current transactions
fell month on month by 30.8 billion to 34.3
billion. This can be attributed mainly to thedeficit on services falling by 30.6 billion to
32.0 billion. At the same time, the deficit on
current transfers also fell by 30.2 billion to
32.4 billion. By contrast, the surplus on
income declined slightly to 30.1 billion.
There were net outflows of funds ( 312.6
billion) in Germany’s statistically recordedfinancial transactions with non-residents inFebruary. This was also true of portfolio in-vestment, which – in significantly increasedturnover – resulted in net capital exportsamounting to 33.2 billion (following inflows

12of32.2 billion in January). German investors
bought foreign securities worth 330.1 billion
in February, the largest amount for five years.Their investment in – predominantly euro-denominated – foreign bonds and notes wasparticularly marked ( 322.1 billion, up from
313.5 billion). In addition, they bought mu-
tual fund shares ( 35.4 billion) and shares
(33.7 billion) whereas they sold money mar-
ket paper on balance ( 31.2 billion). However,
foreign investors also invested more money inGerman securities in the period under review(326.9 billion, up from 318.3 billion), focus-
ing on bonds and notes issued by public andprivate sector borrowers ( 39.4 billion and
36.2 billion, respectively). German shares
were also very much in demand by foreigninvestors in February ( 39.5 billion). Non-
residents sold only German mutual fundshares on balance (- 30.5 billion).
As in the case of portfolio investment, direct
investment also resulted in net capital exports(32.9 billion). German enterprises invested
32.2 billion in their foreign branches, half of
it on acquiring and expanding participatinginterests ( 31.1 billion). By contrast, foreign
direct investment stocks in Germany con-tinued to decline in the period under review(-30.7 billion). This was solely as a result of
transactions, namely the redemptions ofloans.
In the field of non-securitised credit transac-
tions, the financial operations of enterprisesand individuals led to net inflows of 30.7 bil-
lion. Furthermore, general government im-ported 33.6 billion in foreign funds. However,

15The changes to the
Stability and Growth
PactAt its spring meeting on 22 and
23 March 2005, the European Councilagreed to fundamental changes to theStability and Growth Pact which cru-cially weaken the pact’s rules for asound fiscal policy. The outcome ofthese decisions will jeopardise the aimof achieving sustainable public fi-nances in all EU member states par-ticipating in monetary union. Not onlydo stable underlying fiscal policy con-ditions make a contribution to sus-tained economic growth, they are alsoneeded to cope with future problemsstemming from demographic develop-ments. A particular worry from theperspective of a central bank is thatpublic finances which are not lastinglysound make a stability-oriented mon-etary policy difficult. It is now a matterfor the national governments, by pur-suing a prudent fiscal policy, to dispelfears that the amendment of the pactimplies effectively abandoning the ob-jective of sustainable governmentfinancesy.
At a special meeting on 20 March 2005, the
Ecofin Council adopted a report to the Headsof State or of Government entitled “Improv-ing the implementation of the Stability andGrowth Pact”. This document was approvedby the European Council at its spring meetingin Brussels on 22 and 23 March 2005. Theonly matter that is undecided is the technicalimplementation of the decisions within thefiscal framework. That is to be done in thenext few months up to the end of June 2005.

16The changes to the pact affect three areas, al-
though the implications of these are by nomeans of equal significance. The improve-ment of economic policy cooperation be-tween the European Commission, the Coun-cil and member states does not pose anyproblems. From the Bundesbank’s point ofview, it is disappointing that the preventivearm of the pact was not substantiallystrengthened. The weakening of the exces-sive deficit procedure is a cause for concern.
Change to the preventive arm of the pact
The concept of a budget that is “close to bal-
ance or in surplus” is replaced by country-specific “medium-term budgetary object-ives”. These are to be determined on thebasis of the debt ratio and potential growthand to be revised after no more than fouryears. Adjusted for cyclical effects and the im-pact of “one-off” measures, medium-termdeficits of up to 1% of gross domestic prod-uct (GDP) may be specified for countries withhigh growth rates and low debt ratios. Tar-gets are set only for euro-area countries aswell as countries pegged to the euro in theEuropean Exchange Rate Mechanism.
An annual consolidation of 0.5% of GDP , ad-
justed for cyclical effects and “one-off” meas-ures, is required of member states that fail toachieve the medium-term objective. The rateof consolidation may be smaller during eco-nomically “bad” times. However, the mem-ber states undertake to consolidate their gov-ernment budgets more vigorously in “good”times and to use unexpected revenues to re-duce deficits and levels of debt. “Good
times” are defined as periods in which outputexceeds potential. Any deviations from theadjustment paths are to be explained, and, ifnecessary, the Commission may issue recom-mendations for further action.
The member states are permitted to diverge
temporarily from their given medium-termbudgetary objective or path of adjustment. Inthis context, account may be taken of re-forms which lead to an improvement in thelong-term sustainability of public finances.The necessary cost-benefit analyses are to besubmitted by the member states as part oftheir stability and convergence programmes.Particular consideration is to be given to re-forms of the pension systems.
Changed implementation
of the deficit procedure
Article 104 (2a) of the EC Treaty allows the
reference value for the deficit to be exceededif the excess is only exceptional and tempor-ary and the ratio of the government deficit toGDP remains close to the reference value.Pursuant to Article 104 (3) of the EC Treaty,the Commission, in its report on initiating anexcessive debt procedure, is required to con-sider the ratio of the deficit to public invest-ment, the medium-term economic andbudgetary position of the member state aswell as “all other relevant factors”.
In contrast to the earlier arrangement, excep-
tional economic circumstances are now al-ready constituted by a negative growth rate

18or a considerable accumulated loss of output
during periods of below-average growth.
For the Commission’s report on initiating the
excessive deficit procedure and for the subse-quent Council decisions, “other relevant fac-tors” are potential growth, the prevailingeconomic conditions, the implementation ofmeasures in the context of the Lisbon Strat-egy, and measures to promote research anddevelopment as well as innovation, efforts atbudgetary consolidation in “good times”, thesustainability of the level of debt, public in-vestment and the “quality of public fi-nances”. Moreover, due account is to betaken of other objections by the deficit coun-try concerned given, say, strains resultingfrom “financial contributions to fosteringinternational solidarity” and “to achievingEuropean policy goals, notably the unificationof Europe”.
Pension reforms introducing a multi-pillar sys-
tem that includes a mandatory, fully fundedpillar are to be taken into account in theCommission’s and Council’s considerations.When assessing under Article 104 (12) of theEC Treaty whether the excessive deficit hasbeen corrected, the Council will also take intoconsideration the net cost of the reform tothe publicly managed pillar. The percentageof the costs to be considered will be reducedin stages over a period of five years from100% to 20%.
The Council is to make a qualitative assess-
ment of the reduction of high debt ratios andmay issue recommendations.The deadline for the Council to establish the
existence of an excessive deficit under Art-icle 104 (6) of the EC Treaty is being extendedto four months following the half-yearly fiscalnotification. In future, the member states willbe given six months to demonstrate that ef-fective measures have been taken to correctthe deficit. Furthermore, the deadlines be-tween the Council’s decisions under Art-icle 104 (8) of the EC Treaty, ie establishingthat no effective action has been taken anddeciding to make its recommendations oncorrecting the deficit public, and the Council’sdecision pursuant to Article 104 (9) of theEC Treaty to give notice to the member statefailing to put the recommendations into prac-tice to take remedial measures, are to be ex-tended to two months. In future, the memberstate in question will have four months todemonstrate that effective measures havebeen taken after being given notice pursuantto Article 104 (9).
In case of “special circumstances”, the dead-
line for correcting the deficit may be extend-ed to two years following its identification.The decision as to whether special circum-stances exist will include an assessment of the“other relevant factors” pursuant to Art-icle 104 (3) of the EC Treaty.
In the event of unexpected adverse economic
events during the current excessive deficitprocedure, the recommendations under Art-icle 104 (7) of the EC Treaty, ie the first rec-ommendation on correcting the deficit, andthe recommendations associated with givingnotice pursuant to Article 104 (9) of theEC Treaty, may be repeated and reformulated

Assessment of the envisaged changes
In connection with the proposals to amend
the Stability and Growth Pact, the EuropeanCouncil referred to its Declaration on ArticleIII-184 which is annexed to the future Euro-pean Constitution. The declaration itself es-tablishes a link between the Lisbon Strategyof raising potential growth and the amend-ment of the Stability and Growth Pact: inphases of weak economic growth, budgetarypolicies are to set the key priorities for pro-moting reforms, innovation, competitivenessand investment as well as consumption. Thisis to be reflected in the framing of budget de-cisions, with budgetary discipline to be safe-guarded in accordance with the constitutionand the Stability and Growth Pact. Neverthe-less, the Deutsche Bundesbank considers thatthe changes to the pact weaken the commit-ment to pursue a sound fiscal policy. No bind-ing commitments are required of the memberstates to consolidate government budgetsduring an economic upturn or to reduce highlevels of debt. There was initially discussionabout the instrument, albeit a weak one, ofan “early warning” by the Commission in theevent of failure to meet the medium-termbudgetary objective, as well as the possibilityof quantitative requirements for reducing thelevel of debt. However, these proved to be in-capable of gaining acceptance.Our criticism of the proposed changes to the
pact starts with the idea of taking account ofcountry-specific circumstances. Not leastamong the stated reasons for this is the het-erogeneity of the Community following therecent EU enlargement, for which the prin-ciple of “one rule for all the member states”is said to be no longer appropriate. This argu-ment could make it easier for the new mem-ber states to qualify for introducing the euro.A single monetary policy is predicated on themember states accepting the rules of theCommunity and being in a position to obeythose rules. For that reason, legal and eco-nomic convergence are examined as criteriafor accession. It should by no means be thecase that the well-founded rules for safe-guarding sound finances be modified to ac-commodate a lack of readiness or ability tointegrate on the part of individual states.
Hitherto, the rules of the Stability and Growth
Pact have stipulated that budget positions inthe EU member states must be close to bal-ance or in surplus in the medium term, ieover the economic cycle. In this connection,there was a consensus that “close to bal-ance” was to be understood as a deficit of nomore than 0.5% of GDP . Now, medium-termdeficit targets of up to 1% of GDP are envis-aged. In itself, this represents a considerablerelaxation of the commitment to budgetarydiscipline. Added to this is the possibility ofdeviating from the targets in order to financereforms. The implication of this is that thebudget positions of the member states willedge closer to the 3% reference value. How-ever, this means there will be a growing riskof overstepping the reference value in a

20cyclical downturn. The reduction of the debt
ratios, too, could be considerably delayed.
Moreover, country-specific provisions also
make the rules more complex and will resultin increasing scope for discretion in their ap-plication. Budgetary surveillance will be lesstransparent and the enforceability of the pro-visions weakened. This will be all the morethe case since the possibility of making ad-justments to the objectives means thatbudgetary discipline will become a “movingtarget”.
Above all, it is the envisaged changes to the
excessive deficit procedure that will play apart in making the fiscal framework consider-ably weaker, more complicated and lesstransparent. As “economic weakness” in it-self will be deemed to be an exceptional cir-cumstance in future and a large number of“other relevant factors” will be introduced,the scope for discretion available to the Com-mission and the Council when assessing thedeficit will be significantly expanded. A fur-ther aggravating factor is that the treaty spe-cification that the deficit must be “close tothe reference value” when permitting deficitoverruns has not been quantified. The 3%reference value as the maximum figure forthe annual government budget deficit is thusde facto called into question, and an exces-sive deficit procedure is likely to be initiatedby the Commission and the Council only incases where the limit has been overshot by avery large margin. This is all the more worry-ing as the decline in trend growth in themajor EU economies – given the implicationsfor the development of the debt ratios –should actually suggest tightening the refer-
ence value.
A large number of possible reasons for justify-
ing higher deficits – which, moreover, may beadvanced by the member states themselves –and longer deadlines for correcting deficitswill ease adjustment pressure on the deficitcountries and weaken their readiness to con-duct sound fiscal policies. Moreover, the pos-sibility of ending initiated excessive deficitprocedures by referring to the costs of pen-sion reforms will make an early introductionof the euro easier for a number of newEU member states since the requirement offiscal convergence will be satisfied if no ex-cessive deficit procedure has been initiated.
An argument against any special treatment of
particular expenditure categories in the exces-sive deficit procedure or in setting medium-term budgetary goals is that debt-financing isper se not justified for most of these categor-ies – nor indeed for any other types of ex-penditure. Added to this are problems of def-inition and assessment. For example, govern-ment investment and structural reforms aredifficult to define and/or categorise and to as-sess in terms of their impact. This means thatthe risk of manipulations cannot be discount-ed. Forgoing debt financing does not, how-ever, present an obstacle to far-reaching struc-tural reforms and does not lessen the positiveimpact of government measures.

21creates additional, open-ended scope for in-
terpretation in justifying deficits above thereference value. In the case of Germany, thecurrent net payments to the EU budget andthe costs of unification will be eligible forconsideration in future when assessing thedeficit. This, too, is not justified from an eco-nomic point of view. For example, a debt fi-nancing of these net payments to the Com-munity budget, which ultimately benefitother EU countries, would mean shifting thefinancing of current payments to future gen-erations in the net payer country. This appliesequally to offsetting spending on Germanunification, which largely consists of con-sumption transfers.
Conclusion
In the Bundesbank’s view, the new rules se-
verely weaken the Stability and Growth Pact.They diminish both the incentives to pursue asound budgetary policy and the binding im-pact of the rules and also send the wrong sig-nals to those countries, which have not yetintroduced the single currency. By differenti-ating among countries, the pact will becomeless transparent, more complex and, there-fore, ultimately even more difficult to en-force.The Bundesbank is especially concerned by
the decision to relax the general governmentdeficit ceiling of 3% of GDP by modifying theexcessive deficit procedure. Severe budgetaryproblems already exist in many countries ofthe EU. These are partly due to the fact thatthe requirements of the Stability and GrowthPact have not always been observed appro-priately in the past. The changes which havenow been adopted do not solve this problemof implementation. The goals of symmetricbudget management over the business cycleand a reduction of high debt ratios are notanchored credibly in the new rules. On thecontrary, there is a risk that budget deficitsand debt ratios will increase further in themedium to long term.
Adapting the budgetary rules to a looser fis-
cal regime is therefore the wrong course tohave taken. As the Bundesbank sees it, it isan especially serious matter that the under-lying conditions for the single monetary pol-icy may deteriorate and that conflicts with fis-cal policy will become more likely. The Euro-pean Commission, the Council and the mem-ber states should now be aware of theirresponsibility for the Community and applythe rules in a manner that achieves andsafeguards the goal of attaining structurallybalanced budgets in the medium term.

23Deficit-limiting
budgetary rules and
a national stability
pact in GermanyThe public finance situation in Ger-
many is marked by high deficits andsharply rising debt levels. The 3% Euro-pean ceiling for the deficit ratio wasovershot for the third year in succes-sion in 2004. The debt ratio, at 66%,climbed even further above the 60%reference value. Central and state gov-ernment, in particular, are recordinglarge deficits. There have been numer-ous clashes with national budgetaryrules.
If deficit-limiting rules are to be effect-
ive, it is essential that, as well as beingstringent, they are transparent, com-prehensible and unambiguous. Onlythen can the general public assess thebudget plans and the fiscal outcome.This is not sufficiently the case in Ger-many. National and international rulesare not aligned. In practice they haveproved to be inadequate.
To ensure sound public finances a re-
form of the national budgetary ruleswould be necessary – not least in orderto anchor more firmly the obligationto achieve structurally close-to-balancebudgets. As part of a comprehensiverevision of the fiscal constitution, theindividual accountability of the differ-ent levels of government would needto be increased and the link betweengovernment expenditure and revenuemore clearly emphasised.

24Rules for limiting the government deficits
in Germany
Government can finance its expenditure dir-
ectly using “regular” revenue (above all taxesand social security contributions). It can, how-ever, also postpone the financial burden to alater date by financing expenditure throughborrowing. Politico-economic analyses indi-cate that the latter alternative is particularlyattractive to fiscal policy makers. To preventthe risk of excessive recourse to the capitalmarkets, deficit-limiting budgetary rules havebeen established in Germany – as in mostcountries.
These include national rules which are part of
the German fiscal constitution and are de-signed above all to restrict net borrowing bythe individual levels of government. Thenthere are the European provisions laid downin the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability andGrowth Pact designed to prevent excessivegeneral government deficits and high debtratios in the European Union and the euroarea, in particular.
The national rulesThe German fiscal constitution allows exten-
sive borrowing leeway in particular for centraland state government, which enjoys exten-sive budgetary autonomy. By contrast, localgovernment has comparatively narrow scopefor borrowing owing to the more restrictivemunicipal budgetary rules. The social securityfunds are not permitted to finance their ex-penditure through debt. If deficits cannot befinanced by depleting existing reserves, theyhave to be balanced by raising the contribu-
tion rate (or through Federal grants).
1
On balance, central government (includingthe off-budget special funds) has accountedfor the lion’s share of the general governmentdeficit since 1970. State government has alsorecorded extensive deficits, whereas localgovernment deficits have been relatively lowand the social security funds have mostlygenerated a surplus.
2This deficit pattern of
the last few decades is similarly reflected inthe breakdown of government debt ( 31.4 tril-
lion at the end of 2004). Central govern-ment’s share amounted to just over 60%,while that of state and local governmentwas almost 40% (see chart on page 25).However, per capita indebtedness varies con-siderably between the individual sates. InBaden-W/C252rttemberg, Bavaria and Saxony (in-cluding local government) it was well belowthe average level of the states, while in thecity-states, in particular, the figures weremuch higher (see table on page 26). The eastGerman states, which were mostly debt-freein 1990, are now – with the exception ofSaxony – exceeding the average of the westGerman states.
Central and state government’s deficit-limit-
ing budgetary rules are enshrined in article115 of the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz)
1Nevertheless, the statutory health insurance institutions
had accrued debts totalling just over 38 billion (gross) by
the end of 2003. These must be redeemed by the end of
2007 at the latest.
2In all other euro-area countries the state and local gov-
ernment deficits are far smaller. Over the past ten years,
they have amounted to less than1/C252% of GDP in all cases
whereas a level of 1% was reached in Germany (accord-
ing to the national accounts of each of the countries).Budgetary rules

26and in the constitutions of the individual
states. The details of the rules are defined inthe Budget Principles Act (Haushaltsgrund-
s/C228tzegesetz) and the respective budgetary
regulations. It is laid down that borrowingshall be limited to the level of investmentexpenditure less any investment grants re-ceived. A (planned) overshooting of this ceil-ing is permitted only if it serves to avert a dis-ruption of the overall economic equilibrium.

These provisions basically follow the “goldenrule” according to which a government def-icit or the accumulation of government debtis acceptable only if accompanied by an in-crease in assets so that the government’s netasset position does not deteriorate. This as-sumes that the future burden arising from theborrowing is offset by a corresponding bene-fit from the assets accumulated and that the
government activities financed in this waywill not result in an intertemporal redistri-bution of burdens.
Government investment can stimulate private
investment and increase productivity. However,such effects are very difficult to quantify. Theyprobably depend to a large degree on the typeof investment and the existing level of capital-isation, among other things. But certain non-investment spending by government may alsobe regarded as an important requirement forgrowth (eg education expenditure, spendingPer capita indebtedness and deficit of state government (including local government)

27to achieve legal stability). Given the major
methodological problems involved, however,there is a danger that a very broad definition ofinvestment may prove far too elastic.
Even if the “golden rule” appears essentially
plausible, serious reservations must be voiced,in particular with regard to its practical imple-mentation within the framework of a bindingbudgetary rule – especially given its structureand implementation in Germany.
4
The first problem is that the ceiling for newborrowing in Germany is, as a rule, based onbudgeted figures and not the fiscal outcome.This creates up the possibility of extendingthe borrowing authorisation by overstatingplanned investment expenditure. If, in thecourse of implementing the budget, someflexible investment projects are cut, actualnew borrowing may exceed the deficit ceilingspecified by the “golden rule”. Burdens canalso be shifted to off-budget special funds (oragencies and institutions outside the govern-ment sector), whose borrowing does nothave to be restricted to the level of invest-ment expenditure. If such debt is later incorp-orated into the government accounts, thisleads to a rise in the debt level and the needto finance the debt servicing through thecore budgets which is not counterbalancedby an increase in government assets. One ex-ample of this is the debt assumption follow-ing the reform of the German railways.
The exemption clause which permits net bor-
rowing to exceed investment expenditure ifthis serves to avert a disruption of the overalleconomic equilibrium also offers considerableleeway. There is no requirement to offset
such borrowing in times of favourable cyclicaldevelopments. Moreover, the current inter-pretation of the exemption clause encom-passes a very broad definition of a disruptionof the overall economic equilibrium. Thescope for borrowing established by this hasbeen exploited extensively in recent years, inparticular.
5Breaches of budgetary law also
remain largely without consequence. Courtrulings are not usually passed until years aftera budget has been concluded. If a court rulesthat the budget was unlawful, this does notentail any direct consequences.
One particularly problematic aspect of imple-
menting the “golden rule” is the definition ofthe term investment. This is so broad in Ger-many that it does not accord with the basicidea underlying the rule. Investment coversthe acquisition of non-financial assets (build-ings and equipment) and financial assets (par-ticipating interests, loans), investment grantsto the private and public sector, and guaran-

28tees granted and utilised.6As a rule, invest-
ment grants received from other levels ofgovernment or third parties are deducted.
Investment grants to the private sector lead
to a decline in net government assets whichat most may be accompanied by asset forma-tion in other sectors and indirect revenue in-creases as a result of possibly higher tax re-ceipts in the future. The possibility of simplyrechannelling cannot be excluded and thesubsidy nature of these grants means thatthere is a danger of resources being misallo-cated. In the case of credit-financed invest-ment grants destined for recipients outsideGermany – for example, within the frame-work of development aid – the resultantincurrence of debt is not accompanied by acorresponding increase in domestic assets. Es-sentially, there are strong incentives to label“current” payments as investment expend-iture in order to extend the permitted bor-rowing limits.
Moreover, no allowance is made for the
depreciation of government tangible assets(or of the assets acquired in other sectors inconnection with investment grants) throughdeductions from gross investment, nor aredisinvestments resulting from asset disposalsoffset against new investments. Asset dis-posals include the sale of tangible assets, pri-vatisations, repayments of loans and guaran-tees. This means that a loan (and the associ-ated growth in assets) may currently be debt-financed, yet the repayment (or, if applicable,the waiver) of the loan does not entail the re-quirement to redeem the debt. In the case oftangible assets, replacement investmentswhich serve merely to maintain the existing
capital stock may also be used to justify add-itional borrowing. Consequently, the debtlevel may rise continuously without being ac-companied by a corresponding growth inassets (some examples of problematic aspectsof the way in which the budgetary rules areimplemented in Germany are listed in the boxon page 29).
Even if one only considers government fixed
capital formation and the associated depreci-ation, the ongoing high level of new borrow-ing still breaches the “golden rule” in Ger-many on a major scale. As a simplified analy-sis within the framework of the national ac-counts shows, in the past thirty years govern-ment deficits often exceeded governmentgross fixed capital formation (see chart onpage 30).
7If the consumption of fixed capital
is also taken into account, the discrepancy iseven more starkly evident. For example, in2004 a deficit of 3.7% of GDP was accom-panied by negative net capital formationamounting to 0.2% of GDP . Over the pastfew decades, the stock of government assetsin Germany has fallen considerably in relationto GDP .

(Bundesverfassungsgericht) called for a more detailed
definition of the term investment (see Bundesverfas-
sungsgericht 79, 311). The expenditures listed corres-
pond to the main categorises 7 and 8 in the common
classification system for the budgets of central and state
government.
7In the national accounts acquisitions and sales of finan-
cial assets are recorded as financial transactions that have
no impact on the deficits, which means they are not in-
cluded in this calculation.
8In accordance with a rule designed to keep the stock of
net assets constant, the deficit may be slightly higher
than net capital formation if the price level is rising

29Some problematic aspects of the way the budgetary rules are implemented
in Germany
A mere glance at the key data of the Federal
budget for 2005 reveals the problems involved in
using a very broad definition of investment expend-
iture as the ceiling for government deficits. Planned
net borrowing of 522 billion is accompanied by in-
vestment expenditure (calculated on the basis of
classification numbers 7 and 8) of just over 5221/C252bil-
lion and thus the constitutional limit, which was in-
spired by the “golden rule” of matching assets and
liabilities, is deemed to be observed. This definition
of investment expenditure includes 57 billion in in-
vestment grants to the non-government sector, 52
billion of which relates to projects outside Germany.
Furthermore, disinvestments of 5211/C252billion due to
the sale of equity stakes, loan repayments and the
disposal of tangible assets are not being deducted
from the new investments. Moreover, on the ex-
penditure side, temporary relief of 551/C252billion is
planned through the sale of Post Office pension
fund claims. Finally, no allowance is made for the
consumption of fixed capital, which really should
be offset by a pro rata redemption of the loans
used to finance the assets in question. According to
the national accounts, last year, the depreciation of
central government’s tangible assets alone amount-
ed to roughly 561/C252billion.1Thus, overall, central
government should be recording significant sur-
pluses if the “golden rule” is applied consistently.
State government recorded a total deficit of just
over 525 billion in 2004. This was partly matched by
self-financed investment expenditure of 211/C252bil-
lion. In addition, non-financial and financial assets
to the tune of just over 531/C252billion were sold to fi-
nance the state budgets. If the consumption of
fixed capital (data from the national accounts)
amounting to 561/C252billion is also taken into account,
state government’s financing gap vis-/C224-vis the
“golden rule” was wider still.
Even though the German budgetary rules already
provide for considerable leeway with regard to in-
curring debt, this is being stretched even further in
some cases. For example, investments are some-
times financed from transfers labelled as current
revenue. When it comes to setting the ceiling for
borrowing, current transfers, unlike investment
grants, do not have to be offset against the invest-
ment expenditure which they are used to finance,
and so the resulting extra credit facilities can beused to finance additional consumption expend-
iture. For example, state government in eastern
Germany was given a considerably higher upper
borrowing limit by recording as current income spe-
cial supplementary Federal grants of 5101/C252billion,
which were awarded primarily to finance the con-
struction of the infrastructure. The policy objective
behind this was not, however, to permit higher cur-
rent expenditure whilst concurrently financing the
improvement of the infrastructure in eastern Ger-
many through new borrowing. Some state govern-
ments are also extending their borrowing limits by
recording the subsidy repayments – which certain
Landesbanks have been ordered to make by the
European Commission – as current income while
simultaneously classifying their recapitalisation of
the Landesbanks in the same amount as investment.
It is doubtful whether some of the payments which
are defined as investment under budgetary law
really merit that title. For example, in 2001, a grant
of51/C252billion awarded by Lower Saxony to EXPO Ge-
sellschaft – which was in liquidation at the time –
for the purpose of offsetting losses was declared as
an acquisition of equity interests. In Berlin’s state
government budget, the entitlement to pay 5300
million a year to Bankgesellschaft Berlin to avert
risks as part of its restructuring is not recorded as loss
offsetting but as (investment) calls on guarantees.
A further example is the recording of shipyard sub-
sidies as investment expenditure in the Schleswig-
Holstein government budget, which was criticised by
the state’s Regional Court of Auditors back in 2002.
According to the current state of the budgetary
plans for 2005, the Federal states of Berlin, Bremen,
Hesse, Lower Saxony and Saarland will all exceed
the upper borrowing limits (although a narrower
definition of investment is applied in Hesse). Some
of the other west German states are attempting to
formally comply with the budgetary rules by
stretching the limits or using the proceeds from
asset disposals. The east German states (with the
positive exception of Saxony) will probably manage
to keep within the upper limit by virtue of record-
ing the special supplementary Federal grants as
current income. Despite the relatively favourable
course of macroeconomic developments assumed in
the November 2004 tax estimate, the state govern-
ment budgets – like the Federal budget – remain
structurally considerably underfinanced.
1Allowance should also be made for the depreciation of
non-government assets relating to credit-financed invest-ment grants if the latter are included in the definition of
investment expenditure.

30clined in relation to GDP in recent years espe-
cially, the debt ratio has risen sharply (seechart on page 31).
Thus, at the end of the day, the national
budgetary rules have not been able to haltthe depletion of government assets. The gen-eral government debt ratio has reached 66%without being accompanied by a correspond-ing increase in assets. Even an increase ingovernment investment expenditure, whichmay be desirable, does not change the factthat under this approach there is still a com-prehensive need to consolidate current ex-penditure or revenue.
Furthermore, quite apart from the numerous
methodological problems involved, even ifthe “golden rule” were to be applied proper-ly, it needs to be borne in mind that it relates
only to part of the intergenerational redistri-bution of burdens. It does not take into ac-count implicit liabilities in connection with thepay-as-you-go social security systems, which– given the demographic trend – suggest theneed for a more ambitious fiscal policystance. Moreover, a conflict may occur withregard to the sustainability of public financesif a high debt ratio associated with extensivegovernment investment in the past leads to arisk that the high interest expenditure can nolonger be financed.
The European rulesThe budgetary rules agreed at the European
level are laid down in the Maastricht Treatyand the European Stability and Growth Pact.The Maastricht Treaty sets ceilings for thegeneral government deficit and debt ratios(essentially as defined in the national ac-counts) which may be exceeded only in ex-ceptional cases. The excessive deficit proced-ure provided for in the Treaty specifies sanc-tions for the member state concerned in theevent of an ongoing breach of the rules. TheStability and Growth Pact spells out the de-tails of the rules and the surveillance proced-ure. An early warning system for undesirablefiscal developments has also been estab-lished. Under this, deficit goals for the me-dium term (ie over the economic cycle) wereset for the individual EU states. Even after theamendments to the Stability and GrowthPact, at least in Germany’s case, this meansthe obligation to achieve a structural generalgovernment budgetary position which is atleast close to balance or in surplus in the

position allows budgetary flexibility over theeconomic cycle, also enabling other greatershocks to be absorbed without the absolute3% ceiling for the unadjusted deficit ratiobeing exceeded.
The lack of political determination to consist-
ently apply the rules has ultimately led to therecently agreed reform of the Stability andGrowth Pact. Formally, the reform makes littlechange to the targets and ceilings for thegeneral government deficit and debt ratios.However, the envisaged extensive exemptionshave severely weakened the pact’s credibilityand binding nature.
9To ensure that the ob-
jectives of the European fiscal rules are none-theless achieved, they should be firmly an-chored in German budgetary legislation.
The discussion on a national stability pact
The implementation of the European budget-
ary rules raises considerable coordinationproblems in countries with a pronounced fed-eral structure, where the subordinate levels ofgovernment also have extensive opportun-ities for borrowing. At the time the Maas-tricht Treaty was adopted, it had already beennoted that there was a fundamental need forcoordination between central and state gov-ernment in Germany with regard to the gen-eral government deficit.
10However, intensive
discussions on a national stability pact onlystarted in the mid-1990s when it became ap-parent that Germany would have consider-able problems complying with the 3% ceilingfor the government deficit in 1997, the yearwhich was decisive for entry into monetary
union. Particularly controversial issues werethe legal implementation, the vertical alloca-tion of the deficit ceilings to the governmentlevels, the horizontal allocation to the individ-as % of GDP, year-end figures

32ual federal states and sanctions if the ceiling
is breached.11
A national stability pact represents an en-croachment on the existing budgetary auton-omy of central and state government andcalls for a statutory provision which requiresthe agreement of both government levels.However, despite several detailed proposals,no result was achieved at first, not least be-cause there was also considerable dishar-mony among the state governments them-selves concerning the specific shape of such apact. Since central government is legally ac-countable to the EU for complying with thedeficit ceilings, there was little incentive forstate governments to restrict their ownbudgetary autonomy. Furthermore, given adeficit ratio of less than 1
1/C252% (excluding
UMTS proceeds) and the expected continu-ation of the favourable macroeconomicdevelopment, the financial situation of gen-eral government appeared to be relaxed in2000, so that the discussion on a nationalstability pact was initially discontinued.
However, after the situation of public finan-
ces had worsened again dramatically in 2001and the deficit edged dangerously close tothe 3% ceiling once more, the discussion onanchoring the European rules at all budgetarylevels was resumed. In March 2002 the Finan-cial Planning Council proposed measures –often referred to as the “national stabilityCompliance with budgetary discipline

On this basis, the Financial Plan-ning Council shall discuss the com-patibility of budgetary develop-ments, particularly the expenditureand financial balances of the cen-tral and state governments includ-ing local government and local au-thority associations, with the provi-sions laid down in Article 104 ofthe Treaty establishing the Euro-pean Community and in the Euro-pean Stability and Growth Pact.
(3) If the budgetary discipline of cen-

33pact” – which were then adopted by parlia-
ment.12The measures notably included an
amendment of the Budget Principles Act withthe aim of reducing new borrowing by cen-tral and state government until a balancedbudget is achieved. The Financial PlanningCouncil – where the federal and state minis-ters of finance meet to coordinate theirbudgetary policies – is also to be given great-er importance. Its recommendations on thedevelopment of expenditure and the deficit,in particular, are to be upgraded. Moreover,the various levels of government are obli-gated to comply with the European agree-ments (see box on page 32).
Attempts to incorporate European budgetary
provisions in German budgetary law andlegally anchor the goal of balanced budgetsfor central and state government are to bewelcomed. On the whole, however, the newprovisions are largely ineffective. The pro-visions are at odds with the unchangedconstitutional rules, the (inconsistent) imple-mentation of which permits considerable bor-rowing. The cooperative approach adoptedlargely entails imprecise and non-binding ob-ligations. For example, reference is made toan “objective” of balanced budgets which –except for the states of Bavaria and, to a cer-tain extent, Saxony – no level of governmenthas envisaged in its current medium-termbudget plan. Even the planned reduction ofnet borrowing remains small in many casesand the budgetary goals are clearly orientedmore to the constitutional limit. Even afterSelected agreements of the Financial

34the amendment of the Budget Principles Act,
the Financial Planning Council’s recommen-dations regarding the deficit targets and bal-anced budgets have played only a limited rolein the political process, although the unex-pected tax revenue shortfalls also need to betaken into account. The regularly recom-mended expenditure ceilings were sometimesbarely heeded and their binding character forindividual states contested. The failure toachieve these targets resulted in neither sanc-tions nor an increased obligation to justifythis failure. To date there is little sign of theFinancial Planning Council enjoying a moreprominent status or playing a more active rolein fiscal policy discussions in Germany than inthe past.
Principles of an effective national
stability pact
In Germany there is a discrepancy between
the European commitments to reduce thegovernment deficit enshrined in the Maas-tricht Treaty and the Stability and GrowthPact, and national budgetary law. Not least,this impairs transparency and makes it harderfor the general public to monitor the provi-sions – an important prerequisite for the bind-ing effect of the rules. With regard to the ob-ligations of general government, in particular,the respective responsibilities of the variouslevels of government are not clearly defined.In view of the insufficient national borrowinglimits and the actual high deficits of centraland state government, a fundamental reformof German budgetary law as part of an ef-fective national stability pact appears to benecessary.In principle, central, state and local govern-
ment have acknowledged their joint commit-ment to the European rules. The target of bal-anced budgets for central and state govern-ment included in the Budget Principles Actand the decision to give a more prominentstatus to the Financial Planning Council arealso steps in the right direction. However,these objectives have not been rigorously im-plemented. Significantly more extensive stepsappear to be necessary. Most of central gov-ernment’s proposals in this regard have beenrejected by the state governments in thepast.
A systematic reform of national budgetary
law would require a constitutional amend-ment. This would be in line with the Euro-pean provisions if instead of the regulationanchored in Article 115 of the Basic Law – asalso at state level – the requirement of achiev-ing a structural budget position that is closeto balance or in surplus were to be enshrinedin the constitutions. This appears warrantednot least in view of the – presumably long-term – increase in the private provision andfinancing of investment previously carried outby general government and of the demo-graphic changes. On the basis of a soundbudgetary position, the automatic stabiliserscould then take full effect.

Such a fundamental decision would necessi-tate more specific implementation provisions

35for which the Budget Principles Act could be a
suitable vehicle. It could define, in transparentand comprehensible form, the framework fortaking account of cyclical influences. Further-more, the individual levels of governmentshould be committed to providing detailed evi-dence as to why they were unable to achievea balanced budgetary position and how sucha position can be reached again in the future.Not least in the light of past experience, itshould be ensured that the plans are based oncautious macroeconomic assumptions.
Ceilings for expenditure growth can be an im-
portant component of a national consolida-tion strategy. However, they are no substitutefor setting targets for the budget balance be-cause sound public finances also depend cru-cially on developments on the revenue side.Medium-term expenditure goals must be ad-justed if a persistently weaker revenue trendis evident and an increase in the structuraldeficit is to be prevented. There would be aneed for adjustment, for example, in the caseof tax cuts, a prolonged lowering of the taxassessment base or an ongoing decline innon-tax revenue.
Moreover, the accounting leeway for record-
ed expenditure is likely to be much more ex-tensive than for deficits. For example, out-sourcing parts of the budget (for exampleoutsourcing of fee budgets or shifting activ-ities off the main government budget) maylead to a decline in recorded expenditurewithout entailing any real consolidation pro-gress. The same applies to replacing expend-itures by tax relief measures (eg child benefitby the children’s tax allowance, the directgrant to home buyers by tax concessions) and
intra-government transfers by shifting taxrevenue.
If central and state government were to com-
ply with the requirement to achieve a struc-tural budgetary position which is close tobalance or in surplus, the currently hotly dis-puted issue of how to apportion the deficitceiling laid down in the Maastricht Treaty be-tween the individual levels of governmentwould lose much of its significance. Sincethere would then be a considerable safetymargin below the 3% ceiling, cyclical fluctu-ations would not generally endanger its com-pliance. Irrespective of this, fixed nominaldeficit ceilings are a necessary component ofa set of national budgetary rules in order tooffer a clear point of reference for possiblesanctions as the ultimate disciplinary element.Any breaching of these limits (which are notto be misinterpreted as targets) by individualgovernment entities would have to be limitedto rare and unambiguously defined excep-tional situations.
The (albeit not legally binding) breakdown of
the deficit ceiling of 3% of GDP by allocating45% to central government and the socialsecurity funds, and 55% to state and localgovernment as decided by the Financial Plan-ning Council for the years 2004 to 2006 ap-pears to be inappropriate. It should be bornein mind that central government’s budget ismore volatile than those of state and localgovernment because, in addition to cyclicalfluctuations in tax revenue, it is affected espe-cially by the cyclical deficits of the Federal Em-ployment Agency. Owing to this higher cyclic-

36al sensitivity, in principle a larger share of the
deficit should therefore be allocated to cen-tral government. This should, however, becounterbalanced by a requirement to achievecorrespondingly higher surpluses when theeconomic situation is more favourable.
14
At the state government level (including localgovernment) a horizontal allocation accord-ing to the number of inhabitants seems to beappropriate, not least for pragmatic reasons.Whereas in the case of general governmentGDP is considered the relevant indicator offinancial strength (and thus the ability to bearthe future burdens arising from the deficits),this is currently not the case in Germanyfor state and local government. The intra-government allocation of taxes and the stategovernment revenue-sharing scheme ensurea comparatively strong levelling of tax rev-enue per inhabitant, which means that thenumber of inhabitants is a better point ofreference for the (potential) financial strengthof the states and municipalities.
The transparency and public accountability of
budgetary plans and outturns on the basis ofverifiable rules are extremely important forensuring their binding effect. Progress to-wards achieving this goal could be made, forexample, by upgrading the importance of theFinancial Planning Council. Furthermore,clearer and stricter rules will make it easier forfinance ministers to implement a soundbudgetary strategy in the political process.One idea that could be considered is theintroduction – on the lines of the Europeancommitments – of standardised stability pro-grammes for central government, each socialsecurity scheme and each state government
(including local government) detailing the lat-est annual accounts, current developmentsand the medium-term plans. The FinancialPlanning Council could then verify compli-ance with the required goals and publish theresults. The global findings and decisions ofthe Financial Planning Council should then begiven particular consideration in the budgetpreparation process.
The goal of ensuring that all levels of govern-
ment are committed to achieving sound pub-lic finances according to budgetary lawwould be facilitated by a fundamental reformof the fiscal constitution in Germany. Inthis context, numerous calls have beenmade to modify the current provisions underwhich most laws require the approval ofthe Bundesrat (upper house of parliament)and to more clearly define the tasks of the in-dividual levels of government, coupled with arespective allocation of revenue sources andaccompanying legislative powers. This wouldgive rise to regional distinctions and an in-creased responsibility of each individual levelof government for the development of publicfinances in its respective area.
For example, an income tax surcharge for the
federal states is conceivable (without suchrevenue having to be included in the intra-state revenue-sharing scheme). This wouldgive individual state governments the oppor-

37tunity to make allowances for special prefer-
ences of their population on the expenditureside by introducing differing tax rates on therevenue side. In view of the mutual supportobligation in place between the differentlevels of government (“federal principle”), itseems logical that if the deficit ceiling is over-shot the relevant entity should be obliged toincrease the income tax surcharge.
15This
would underline the direct link between ex-penditure and the need to ensure soundfinancing, particularly for the voters. It iscrucial for fiscal discipline to avoid giving theimpression that the government can providebenefits that entail no costs.
Public finances in Germany are in a critical
situation. High structural deficits and sharplyincreasing debt levels necessitate comprehen-
sive fiscal consolidation. Another require-ment, given the likely demographic develop-ment, is to avoid burdening future gener-ations further with an excessive level of gov-ernment debt. A comprehensive reform ofthe national budgetary rules – which aremanifestly too lax – as part of a national sta-bility pact in connection with a reform of thefiscal constitution could be an integral part ofa reliable consolidation strategy and therebymake an important contribution to resolvingthe budgetary problems.

answer to an issue which, over the pasttwo decades, has been dealt with onthe financial markets under the head-ing “one-stop finance” or – dependingon the perspective – more specifically“bancassurance” for bank-dominatedfinancial groups or “assurbanking” forinsurance-dominated financial groups.Changes in market conditions have in-duced banks and insurance corpor-ations to engage in many differentforms of cooperation.
However, this cooperation is of supervisory
relevance only if cross-sector banking and in-vestment services as well as insurance servicesare provided within a single group of enter-prises. The significance of such corporategroups which are active in various sectors dif-fers quite considerably from one Europeancountry to another. In Germany, financialconglomerates are of greater importance inthe insurance sector, where they account fora total of 52% of the gross premiums writ-ten. By contrast, with a market share of only15.5% of deposits, they play a less significant

new supervisory regime is now on layingdown specific capital requirements at a finan-cial conglomerate level and subjecting therisk concentrations as well as the intra-grouptransactions of such conglomerates to separ-ate supervision.
One-stop finance
The dynamic developments and lasting
changes in financial market structures overthe past 20 years have increasingly blurredthe dividing line between banking and insur-ance business. Banks and insurers alike con-sider, above all, the area of long-term invest-ment and provisioning products – which canbe flexibly adapted to changing customerneeds or greater customer demands with re-gard to terms and conditions or yield – to bea growth market. Moreover, suppliers, by di-versifying the financial products they offerand increasing flexibility in meeting custom-ers’ wishes and needs, aim to broaden andstabilise the earnings base across the existingrange of business. In addition, they attemptto tap new and attractive sources of incomein a capital-preserving manner through usingother distribution channels.
In contrast to the insurance industry, the
banking industry has found it difficult to de-velop new distribution channels, as experiencehas shown that it is easier to sell insuranceproducts at bank branches than bankingproducts via insurance field service staff. Thebanking industry has therefore focused its at-tention on exploiting the opportunities onoffer in the area of private old-age pension
provisioning in both the savings phase andsubsequent asset management, and reducingthe dependence of the results on the netinterest received by increasing commissions.At the same time, attempts have been madeto offset income volatility to a certain extentthrough the fact that, according to experi-ence, the earnings of banks and insurersreact differently to cyclical fluctuations – atleast in part. Banks have also endeavoured touse their own products to make inroads intoareas which have so far been the exclusivedomain of insurance corporations, for in-stance, by developing and deploying suitablecredit derivatives to gain a foothold in a mar-ket segment hitherto dominated by credit in-surance. The term “one-stop finance” there-fore signifies a strategy of providing custom-ers with comprehensive financial services be-yond the original field of activity within a sec-tor and strengthening customer ties throughoptimising customer orientation, thus gener-ating a more sustained and steadier income.
This business strategy has been implemented
in many different forms with varying degreesof intensity depending on the level of integra-tion of the new business areas, ranging fromforms of loose, open cooperation to com-plete integration in a group. Open cooper-ation is typically characterised by the broker-ing of products provided by changing part-ners. The idea here is to be able to offer,where possible, tailor-made products de-pending on need and in a customer-orientedmanner. However, such open cooperation isoften characterised by the absence of a uni-fied market presence, such as the formulation

41and pursuit of joint strategic goals. Instead,
the goals pursued by each of the cooperationpartners prove to be factors derived from thestrategic orientation laid down for the origin-al business line.
The formalised forms of cooperation are the
next higher level of cooperation in terms ofintensity. They are usually based on contract-ual agreements containing an – at least limit-ed – exclusivity clause. These forms are oftenbacked by mutual cross-shareholdings on thepart of the cooperation partners. Such for-malised cooperation has the advantage ofallowing a unified market presence and,moreover, requires only a modest level of fi-nancial strength and capital input on the partof the partners. However, formalised cooper-ation provides only rather limited opportun-ities to significantly influence another cooper-ation partner. In the strategic orientation, it istherefore probably typical, in the event of aconflict of aims, for greater importance to beattached to the partners’ self-interests in theirusual areas of activity than to the jointly for-mulated goals of cooperation.
Open or guided architecture approaches have
hardly played a role as alternative cooper-ation models in the area of one-stop financeso far. Such strategies – which have alreadybeen used in the sale of fund products forsome time – give customers the opportunityto choose between the products offered byall or certain suppliers, for instance, a varietyof investment companies. Although these ap-proaches provide the incentive for all cooper-ation partners, including intra-group or net-work enterprises, to face broad-based com-petition, the predominant trend in one-stop
finance strategies is still to concentrate on asingle partner or very few permanent part-ners.
In principle, at least, associations in the sav-
ings bank and cooperative bank sectorsshould also be regarded as formalised co-operation models. However, they each exhibitnetwork-specific features and, in some cases,a higher degree of mutual connection thanother conventional forms of formalised co-operation. For instance, in the savings banksector, insurance corporations are, as a rule,owned by the various savings bank associ-ations. In the cooperative bank sector, the in-surance corporation is a subsidiary of theleading institution.
The formation of cross-sector groups can be
broken down according to the foundationstrategies applied, ie joint or individual estab-lishment and takeover strategies. A groupstrategy ensures a unified presence in themarket and promotes coordinated financialproducts from the various sectors in the bestpossible way. In comparison with cooperationarrangements, however, a group strategyexacts a far higher demand for capital. In cer-tain market environments, the lower flexibilitymay also appear to be a disadvantage. In-deed, dependence on the quality of a groupenterprise is much greater than in the case ofthe cooperation models. The problem ofstrong interdependence also arises in theassociations, however. In some cases, suchinterdependence may have considerablerepercussions for the way in which an enter-

ness.
Owing to the various advantages and disad-
vantages of the different one-stop financestrategies, no one strategy has hithertoemerged as being the clearly superior one inpractice. According to a study
3by an invest-
ment bank, one-stop finance strategies aremost successful if the insurance products arebroadly tailored to banks’ needs and the in-surance corporation’s presence in the marketalso corresponds to that of the bank. Al-though this strategy is best put into practicein a group, the trend in recent years has againbeen to move away from one-stop financialservices groups. A change in strategy is cur-rently discernible in the banking industry. Insome cases, banks are selling off their partici-pating interests in insurance undertakings
and instead seeking and agreeing on formal-ised cooperation. This is a sign of a reversal ofthe trend towards cross-sector mergers andacquisitions which has prevailed over the pastfew decades and which has caused vastchanges such as the repeal of the specialisedbanking system in the United States owing tothe passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.
Customers, too, have recently been showing
less need for a “one-stop financial” strategy.New technologies and the high density of in-formation on financial services have dimin-ished the weight of the argument of comfortassociated with one-stop finance strategies.Customers are now more willing to switchbrands and will look for the best deal beingoffered by the best service provider. At thesame time, the wide range of productsoffered by one provider, from residentialmortgage loans to option transactions tobaggage insurance, is often regarded asbeing too large and not exactly a seal of qual-ity. In addition, whereas customers generallysolicit extensive advice for investment andprovisioning products, property insurance isoften no longer regarded as a financial servicebut only as a protection against risk. From thecustomer’s point of view, an overextendedrange of services ultimately calls the seller’scompetence into question. It threatens towater down the core competence of a brandname. This means that customers regard one-stop finance strategies as making sense par-ticularly in those cases in which a product-neutral, customer-oriented advice can be im-

ports customers and relieves them of some ofthe effort involved in processing the flood ofinformation. This is increasingly shining aspotlight on “open architecture” and“guided architecture” approaches, which aremost conducive to the implementation ofsuch a one-stop finance strategy.
Significance of financial conglomerates
In the past few decades, financial groups pro-
viding services and selling products in differ-ent financial sectors have been appearing onthe financial markets. Credit institutions, in-vestment firms and insurance undertakingsbelonging to such conglomerates, however,have to date not been subject to consolidatedgroup supervision, even though some ofthese conglomerates are among the largestplayers on the financial markets and provideservices across the globe. Were such con-glomerates to encounter serious financial dif-ficulties, this could jeopardise the stability ofthe financial system and cause considerabledamage to individual savers, insurance under-takings or investors.
The application of the Financial Conglomerates
Directive in Germany will probably be focusedon eight financial conglomerates. Given that atotal of roughly 2,400 credit institutions, 450insurance undertakings (excluding pensionschemes and burial funds) and 830 financialservices enterprises are licensed to do businessin Germany, this number seems rather small –especially since the frequent use of “bancas-surance” in the media would suggest thatfinancial conglomerates are more widespread.
In actual fact, the types of one-stop finance inGermany described above represent a muchwider spectrum of cross-sector links than sug-gested by the narrow definition in the FinancialConglomerates Directive, which is confined tothe integration of banks, insurance undertak-ings and investment firms in a single group.The new provisions cover neither contract-based sales and distribution cooperation be-tween banks and insurance undertakings,which is relatively frequent in Germany, nor un-qualified minority shareholdings betweenthese two sectors.
Despite their small number, the eight (prob-
able) financial conglomerates in Germany,cover a considerable market share; their im-portance is very much greater in the insur-ance sector than in the banking sector. In2003, these eight groups accounted for 43%of the gross premia written in German life in-surance, damage/accident insurance, reinsur-ance and health insurance business. In de-posit business with domestic non-banks, theirmarket share was 12% in December 2004. Ifthe analysis is extended to include banks andinsurance undertakings active in Germanywhich belong to non-resident financial con-glomerates based in western Europe, it in-creases the market share in insurance busi-ness held by financial conglomerates by a fur-ther 9 percentage points to 52% and theshare in deposit business by 3.5 percentagepoints to 15.5%. Within the group of con-glomerates, however, market share is distrib-uted rather unevenly. The two largest Ger-man conglomerate groups already accountfor 33 percentage points of the 52% market

44share in all insurance premia and just under 8
percentage points of the 15.5% share in de-posits. It is not only the different significanceof the individual groups that is striking butalso the fact that the market shares in insur-ance business far exceed those in bankingbusiness. However, this is less a reflection oftypical features of one-stop finance and morea reflection of structural concentration fea-tures in the two sectors. Because of the mar-ket position of savings banks and credit co-operatives, in particular, the five largest Ger-man banks account for a market share ofonly 18% in deposit business with domesticnon-banks (as at December 2004). By con-trast, the market shares of the five largest in-surance undertakings range from 28% to74% depending on the business line.

There is a certain heterogeneity in the type ofbusiness conducted by German financial con-glomerates. Whereas insurance services areoffered by all conglomerates on a broad base,the banking services offered by some groupsare restricted to the business of building andloan companies. In this confined market, inturn, the financial conglomerates have an im-portant position, accounting for 45%.
5Not all
financial conglomerates offer investment ser-vices. For the groups active in this businessline, it is often not even necessary to establisha subsidiary of their own because membercredit institutions with a full banking licencecan render the investment services themselves.
For the most part, the heterogeneity of Ger-
man financial conglomerates has simplyevolved and is reflected in each company’shistory. Three types of conglomerates can beidentified: those established prior to the
Second World War, those from the 1960s and1970s, and those formed in the past tenyears. In older groups, the “foreign” elementtends to have evolved organically fromscratch. Younger conglomerates, by contrast,are also the result of mergers and acquisi-tions, and this, even after allowing for the ne-cessary costs of integration, makes it possiblefor them to overcome barriers to marketentry more quickly. Finally, it is striking thatnone of the eight financial conglomerateshas given up focusing on its core activities infavour of its more recent business lines.
The small number of financial conglomerates
in Germany in absolute terms is not specificto this country. Even in those EU-15 countrieswhose financial systems are characterised toa much greater extent by the definition ofone-stop finance, such as Italy, Spain andFrance, the number of conglomerate groupsis no higher, either. More extensive compari-son within the EU-15 is possible only to alimited extent for two reasons. One is thatconglomerates have not been fully identifiedin all countries, and the other is that smallergroups, in particular, do not publish consoli-dated figures. If one therefore confines one’sattention to large financial conglomerates,
6it

est German companies accounted for percentage shares
of 33% in life insurance, 51% in health insurance, 28%
in damage and accident insurance and 74% in reinsur-
ance (source: BaFin).
5The building and loan associations belonging to finan-
cial conglomerates held 45% of non-banks’ building and
loan deposits as at December 2004, with the two largest
conglomerates accounting for no more than just under
5 percentage points.

45is striking that particularly the relative deposit
volumes in banking business and, in somecases, also the relative volumes of insurancepremia of the foreign EU-15 groups
7are far
higher than those of German conglomerates(see chart on page 46). This is due not only todifferences in the distribution of domesticmarket shares but, above all, to the fact thatmany foreign groups – particularly fromsmaller countries – are far more active acrossborders. Banking business, and naturallywholesale banking above all, is regularly af-fected more strongly by this trend than the in-surance arm of a financial conglomerate. Bycontrast, bancassurance has been focusedmostly on the life insurance sector, and, as atypical example of retail business, the sale oflife insurance has remained closely confinedto national markets owing to cultural, linguis-tic and legal differences among countries.
The vast majority of large financial conglom-
erates in the EU-15 originated in the bankingindustry – in contrast to those in Germany.More attractive potential for cross-selling, es-pecially in countries with a small percentageof tied insurance agents, and higher marketshares of many banks in retail business maybe the reasons. Whereas only one-quarter ofnew life insurance contracts were soldthrough banks in Germany in 2003, in someEU-15 member states banks acted as a distri-bution channel for 50% to 75% of this busi-ness.
8Another difference between foreign
conglomerates and their German competitorsis that many foreign conglomerates onlycame into being in the past 15 years follow-ing the lifting of legal barriers separating theindividual financial sectors. As in the Germancase, most of the foreign financial conglom-
erates that came into being during this periodwere formed through mergers and acquisi-tions. Even if it is primarily the insurance armsof some EU-15 conglomerates that have en-countered particular strains in the past fewyears owing to developments in the capitalmarkets, the financial conglomerate organ-isational form has become entrenched inmany countries.

46several financial sectors and acquire increas-
ing importance in the market owing to theirsize. Diversification effects that enhance theimmunity of the group – and ultimately alsoof the overall system – to external shocks canalso create positive benefits. For one thing,the different maturity structures in the bal-ance sheet (long-term bank assets contrast-ing with long-term insurance technical re-serves) can reduce structural mismatches, andthis is likely to make the asset and liability
management of the conglomerates easier.For another, various studies based on shareprices and annual accounts figures
9indicate
that the diversification of business areas andcustomer groups can result in financial con-glomerates having a more stable profitabilityprofile than banking-only or insurance-onlygroups. However, the diversification effectsare tempered by the fact that banking and in-surance revenue are both dependent on ex-ogenous factors such as bond yields, shareprices and indicators of business activity.
Potential efficiency gains obtained through
the utilisation of economies of scale andscope also enhance financial conglomerates’ability to bear risk. This means that, for in-stance, more extensive opportunities forcross-selling might have helped the earningsof building and loan associations belongingto conglomerates to outpace those of therest of the market over the past seven years(see chart on page 47). However, various ex-amples over the past few years have shownthat the specific environment in which thecompany is active is the crucial factor indetermining whether the desired efficiencygains are actually achieved.

47factors include the greater complexity of con-
glomerates, their reduced transparency andsize-induced reduction in flexibility, and theopportunity of supervisory arbitrage. Otherfactors to be listed here include conflictingcorporate cultures and the similar vulnerabil-ity of banks and insurance undertakings with-in a group in the event of unfavourable cap-ital market developments. The formation of aconglomerate, moreover, also involves therisk of problems in one financial sector spillingover more quickly to other sectors – bothwithin the conglomerate itself and through-out the financial system in general. Potentialdiversification and efficiency gains thereforeoffset greater networking and homogeneityof the overall system, which could result invulnerabilities.
The supervisory approach
Since as far back as the early 1990s, the ques-
tion of supervising financial conglomerateshas been the subject of discussion in scholarlyliterature. The objective should be to compre-hensively capture the risks generated by thevarious types of business and their inter-actions, which contribute to creating a par-ticular structure of risk associated with finan-cial groups that are active across sectors. InApril 1994
10the Bundesbank also proposed
comprehensive consolidation of bancassur-ance enterprises in order to prevent doublegearing and to ensure adequate capitalisa-tion. The institutional reaction to the blurringof the boundaries between sectors in manyother countries, as well as in Germany, was tocreate an integrated supervisory authority.At the international level, the Joint Forum on
Financial Conglomerates, established in1996, addressed the issue. The Basel Com-mittee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), theInternational Association of Insurance Super-visors (IAIS) and the International Organiza-tion of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) worktogether in this Joint Forum. Following an ex-tensive consultation process, in 1999 theJoint Forum published several documents onthe supervision of financial conglomeratesthat had been compiled to form a compen-dium in 2001.

This work done by Basel, and the work of the
Mixed Technical Group – a European Com-mission working group composed of expertsfrom all three fields of supervision – formedthe basis for a Commission proposal of April2001 for a Financial Conglomerates Directive,which was adopted on 16 December 2002 asDirective 2002/87/EC.
12It is part of the Euro-
pean Commission’s Financial Services ActionPlan (FSAP) for completing the single marketfor financial services. This directive was thenimplemented into German law with effectfrom 1 January 2005 by a relevant imple-menting act.
13
The additional supervisory provisions for fi-nancial conglomerates are intended to closethe gaps in the current sector-related legalregulations and to ensure the sound supervi-sion of additional risks associated with finan-cial groups engaged in cross-sector financialactivities. The legal framework for each indi-vidual sector is often insufficient to supervisegroups active across sectors adequately be-cause of their different approaches. Only one-stop finance approaches based on the forma-tion of groups are covered by supplementarysupervision. The focus here is on assessingthe financial situation at conglomerate level,
especially solvency to the exclusion of mul-tiple gearing (ie the multiple use of capital).At the same time, risk concentrations andintra-group transactions are to be monitored.The Directive also made minimal adjustmentsto existing industry regulations for the super-vision of credit institutions, insurance under-takings and investment firms in order to pre-vent supervisory arbitrage between sectoralsupervisory requirements and the provisionsfor financial conglomerates. However, sincethis has by no means harmonised theindustry-specific supervisory provisions yet,the introduction of the supplementary super-vision of financial conglomerates pursuant tothis directive is only a first step.
Definition of a financial conglomerate
Financial conglomerates are defined as
groups of enterprises consisting of a parentcompany, its subsidiaries, and those enter-prises in which either the parent or one of thesubsidiaries has a stake. Groups of enterprisesthat are united to form a horizontal group arealso covered by this definition. The groupmust contain at least one insurance undertak-ing and one company from the banking/in-vestment sector. One of these enterprisesmust be subject to supervision. If there is nosupervised enterprise at the top, the groupmay be regarded as a financial conglomerate

49only if it is active mainly in the financial sector.
In that case, the companies active in the fi-nancial industry must account for at least40% of the entire group’s balance sheettotal.
Moreover, for a group to be classified as a fi-
nancial conglomerate, the enterprises musthave considerable aggregated and consoli-dated operations in both the insurance andthe banking or investment services sectors.The balance sheet total of the smallest sectorin the conglomerate must make up, on aver-age, more than 10% of the balance sheettotal and of the solvency requirements of allaffiliated financial services enterprises takentogether. Moreover, considerable cross-sectoractivity must be assumed to exist even if theenterprises’ balance sheet total in each sectoramounts to at least 36 billion.
It is the responsibility of the Federal Financial
Supervisory Authority ( Bundesanstalt f/C252r
Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin) to deter-
mine whether a group which is active in mul-tiple sectors is a financial conglomerate with-in the meaning of the Banking Act or the In-surance Supervision Act. BaFin currently as-sesses these cases and takes its decisions onthe basis of the annual accounts for the fi-nancial year that ended in 2003. In parallel tothe national procedures for determiningwhich units are financial conglomerates, na-tional supervisors are currently in the processof coordinating, at the European level, waysof identifying financial conglomerate operat-ing across sectors. Although the identifiedfinancial conglomerates have to be reportedto the European Commission, the BankingAct, pursuant to the provisions for banking
groups in section 10a, does not provide foran announcement of these financial con-glomerates.
Capital requirements
for financial conglomerates
Financial conglomerates must have an ad-
equate capital base at the conglomeratelevel. The superordinated company of thefinancial conglomerate, with its domesticdomicile, and its subsidiary enterprises in theconglomerate need to be included in the cal-culation of the capital. Own funds pursuantto section 10 of the Banking Act and section53c of the Insurance Supervision Act may beincluded as conglomerate-level capital com-ponents. Pursuant to the planned FinancialConglomerates Solvency Regulation,
14it will
be possible to apply two of the three envis-aged methods in the EU Directive or a com-bination thereof for calculating capital re-quirements in Germany.
In the “calculation on the basis of the consoli-
dated accounts” method, the additional cap-ital requirements of the financial conglomera-te’s supervised subordinated enterprises arecalculated on the basis of the consolidatedaccounts. Since, under German law (section10a of the Banking Act), consolidated bank-

The approach is as follows. First,the own funds (as defined in sections 10 and10a (6) sentences 3 to 9 of the Banking Act)of the enterprises from the banking and in-vestment services sectors are added up. Forthe enterprises from the insurance sector thatare to be included, the own funds are calcu-lated as defined by section 53c of the Insur-ance Supervision Act and by the relevantrules (for calculating adjusted solvency onthe basis of the consolidated accounts) laiddown in the Solvency Adjustment Regulation(Solvabilit/C228tsbereinigungs-Verordnung ). The
own funds of the financial conglomeratecalculated in this manner have to exceed thesum of the solvency requirements for eachsector according to its respective industryregulations.
The “deduction and aggregation method”
focuses on the own funds of each supervisedand unsupervised enterprise of the financialconglomerate that is active in the financial in-dustry. Here, the total recognised own fundsof these enterprises must exceed the sum ofsolvency requirements which these enter-prises have to meet and the book value ofparticipating interests held in other groupenterprises.
The methods are regarded as equivalent,
even if the consolidation method may bemore advantageous in that third-party sharesin the capital of subsidiary enterprises and
holding companies can only be includedusing this method. In agreement with theassociations of the credit and insurance in-dustries, the third method contained in theregulation, “book value/requirement deduc-tion”, was not implemented, since it is basedon the “equity method” of evaluating partici-pating interests, which is not in common usein Germany. Irrespective of the calculationmethod, there is no question given the rulesand regulations relevant for each sector,of the own funds of enterprises in a financialconglomerate included in the calculationbeing recognised more than once. Intra-conglomerate capital creation, such asthrough counter-financing between theenterprises in a conglomerate, has to be ruledout as well. Furthermore, the inclusion of un-supervised mixed financial holding companiesin the calculation of additional capital require-ments prevents excessive leveraging, ie theissuance of debt by the parent enterprise tocreate capital for the subsidiary.
As regards the method chosen, BaFin, after
consulting the parent financial conglomerateenterprise, determines the calculationmethod if
– a supervised financial conglomerate enter-
prise or reinsurance enterprise licensed todo business in Germany is at the top ofthe financial conglomerate
– or all supervised companies in the finan-
cial conglomerate are domiciled in Ger-many.

51Otherwise, the mixed financial holding com-
pany is free to choose the method of calcula-tion.
The additional capital requirements are to be
initially calculated on the basis of the annualaccounts for the business year beginning ei-ther on 1 January 2005 or during that calen-dar year. So far there is no telling whether theadditional capital requirements will increasethe need for capital for the probable financialconglomerates in Germany, too. Since, at sec-tor level, the capital requirements have beenmet, an additional need for capital can occuronly if the intra-group capital creation cannotbe offset by third-party-provided own fundsthat are not needed at the sector level. If,after the additional capital requirements arecalculated, it turns out that the existing ownfunds are insufficient, the shortfall can be off-set only by capital components recognised aspermissible capital components in accordancewith all sectoral regulations (cross-sector cap-ital).
If a group is not deemed to be considerably
active across sectors and is therefore not clas-sified as a financial conglomerate, a new de-duction arrangement applies to the group’sbanking and financial services institutions. Atthe individual institution level, they will haveto deduct, in future, the following elementsfrom the sum of their core capital and add-itional capital.
– Participating interests within the meaning
of section 271 (1) sentence 1 of the Com-mercial Code in primary insurance com-panies, reinsurance companies and insur-
ance holding companies.
– Direct or indirect participating interests
amounting to 20% of the capital or vot-ing rights of primary insurance companies,reinsurance companies and insuranceholding companies.
– Claims arising from participation rights
and subordinated liabilities vis-/C224-vis theseholding companies.
On request, however, BaFin can waive the
right to deduct these items if one of themethods described above is used to calculatecapital adequacy.
Risk concentration in the conglomerate
Risk concentrations within the meaning of
the Banking Act are all exposures of the en-terprises within a financial conglomerate thatare subject to default risk and are largeenough to jeopardise the solvency or the gen-eral financial position of the supervised finan-cial conglomerate enterprises. It makes nodifference here whether the threat of defaultis based on, or can be based on, counterpartyrisk, credit risk, investment risk, insurancerisk, market risk, any other type of risk, acombination of the above risks or an interplaybetween these types of risk.
The Financial Conglomerates Directive pro-
vides for the member states to develop theirown standards for quantitative limits on riskconcentrations or to allow their national

52supervisors to do so until there is further co-
ordination. The Banking Act takes this intoaccount by giving the power to issue a legalregulation that can define the type of riskconcentrations that are to be reported, thethreshold values for qualifying them as signifi-cant and the upper limits for such significantconcentrations of risk that have to be ob-served. Violations of these upper limits wouldhave to be reported immediately to BaFin andthe Bundesbank and, at BaFin’s request, to bebacked by capital. Until this legal regulationhas been adopted, the significant risk con-centrations to be reported are the counter-party, credit or investment risk exposure vis-/C224-vis a borrower unit which, individually or intotal, amount to or exceed 10% of theconglomerate-level capital requirement. Inaddition, insurance risk concentrations thatarise from the following factors and that havebeen identified by the internal risk manage-ment system as significant have to be report-ed.
– Major risks (see Article 10 (1) of the Intro-
ductory Act to the Insurance Contract Act(Einf/C252hrungsgesetz zum Gesetz /C252ber den
Versicherungsvertrag )).
– Cumulative risks (risks arising from the
accumulation of damages from variousinsurance sectors).
– Risks that take a long time to develop and
whose causes are difficult to pinpoint.
– Risks from a combination of or interplay
among the individual types of risk.For the transitional period, it was decided ini-
tially to forgo the setting of upper limits forsignificant concentrations of risk since thebanking sector’s large exposure rules and theinsurance industry’s investment rules are notcompatible. Following the Banking Act’s largeexposure rules for counterparty, credit or in-vestment risks would virtually nullify the exist-ing investment regulations in the insuranceindustry, whose regulations governing thespreading of risk are not geared to capital.
Intra-group transactions
In the future, superordinated enterprises in a
financial conglomerate will have to report sig-nificant intra-group transactions in the con-glomerate to BaFin and the Bundesbank. TheBanking Act defines intra-group transactionsas transactions in which supervised financialconglomerate enterprises directly or indirectlydraw on the support of other enterpriseswithin the same financial conglomerate tofulfil an obligation. It is immaterial whetherthis happens on a contractual basis or other-wise and whether this is against payment orfree of charge. These transactions include, forinstance, all intra-group loans, guarantees,warranties and other off-balance-sheet trans-actions, transactions involving own fundscomponents within the meaning of the Bank-ing Act or Insurance Supervision Act, or cost-sharing agreements.
Regarding intra-group transactions, too, the
Financial Conglomerates Directive providesfor the member states to develop their ownstandards for quantitative limits on risk con-

53centrations or to allow their national super-
visors to do so until there is further coordin-ation. This, in turn, is taken into account byway of an authorisation to issue a regulation.The type of transactions that need to be re-ported, the thresholds for categorising themas significant, the upper limits that have to beobserved and limitations on the type of suchtransactions are to be defined in the legalregulation. Significant intra-group transac-tions may be conducted by the stated enter-prises only on the basis of a unanimous deci-sion by all managers. If the upper limits arebreached, BaFin may order the violating partyto back the excess amount with own funds.Until the legal regulation has been adopted,it will be necessary to report individual trans-actions if they reach or exceed 5% of thecapital requirement at conglomerate level.Several transactions of one or more group en-terprises during a business year have to becombined for each counterparty, even if indi-vidual transactions do not reach the afore-mentioned threshold.
The same applies to significant intra-group
transactions for deposit-taking credit institu-tions, e-money institutions or investmentfirms within a mixed corporate group. Thesegroups consist of a mixed enterprise and itssubsidiaries. In this context, a mixed enter-prise is an enterprise that is neither a financialholding company, a mixed financial holdinggroup or an institution within the meaning ofthe Banking Act and whose subsidiaries in-clude at least one deposit-taking credit insti-tution, one e-money institution or one invest-ment firm.Internal risk management
One of the major challenges facing the man-
agement of financial conglomerates will beintegrating the management of risk acrossthe various sectors. Risk management is cur-rently focused on sector-specific risks. In fu-ture, it will also be necessary to introduce in-tegral risk management in order to managethe group. As regards managing the risks ofintra-group transactions and risk concentra-tions, the requirements that financial con-glomerates have to meet have been de-scribed as proper organisation and adequateinternal control methods. Whereas intra-group transactions within a mixed corporategroup are governed in detail by the BankingAct, the detailed requirements for financialconglomerates will still need to be specifiedin a legal regulation.
To this extent, the EU Directive requires that,
at the conglomerate level, appropriate riskmanagement and adequate internal controlmethods be in place, including a proper busi-ness organisation and proper accounting pro-cedures. Appropriate risk management in-cludes the following elements.
– Sound governance and management.– Approval and regular review of strategies
and policies concerning all incurred risksby the appropriate governing body at con-glomerate level.
– Adequate capital adequacy policies that

quirements.
– Adequate procedures which ensure that
the risk monitoring systems are properlyintegrated into the organisation.
– Measures which ensure that the systems
implemented in those enterprises subjectto supplementary supervision are consist-ent so that all risks can be measured,monitored and controlled at the level ofthe financial conglomerate.
Proper internal control mechanisms include
the following elements.
– Adequate mechanisms as regards capital
adequacy (to identify and quantify all ma-terial risks) and to appropriately relateown funds to risks.
– Sound reporting and accounting proced-
ures (to identify, measure, monitor andcontrol the intra-group transactions andthe risk concentration).
Coordination of the supplementary
supervision of financial conglomerates
In order to ensure the efficiency of supple-
mentary supervision, the Financial Conglom-erates Directive envisages the appointment ofa coordinator from among the competent au-thorities in several member states concerned.The coordinator would coordinate and exer-cise supplementary supervision over this fi-nancial conglomerate. The coordinator is tobe chosen by the responsible national/sector-
al supervisory authorities, with the choicebeing based on certain criteria such as thedomicile and size of the enterprises and therelative importance of each sector in the con-glomerate. However, the Financial Conglom-erates Directive does not give the coordinatorany decision-making or even implementationpowers which would affect the tasks and re-sponsibilities of the other competent super-visors. At the European Commission level, aworking group composed of representativesof the national supervisory authorities areidentifying such cross-border financial con-glomerates with the aim of appointing thecoordinator.
If BaFin is appointed coordinator, the German
Banking Act envisages the following tasks.
– The coordination of the collection and dis-
semination of pertinent information dur-ing ongoing monitoring and in crisis situ-ations.
– The general assessment and supervision
of a financial conglomerate’s financialposition.
– Assessment of compliance with provisions
governing capital adequacy, risk concen-tration and intra-group transactions.
– Evaluation of the structure, organisation
and internal control systems of the finan-cial conglomerate.
– Planning and coordination of supervisory
activities in cooperation with foreign au-
BaFin’s tasks as

55thorities and, within Germany, with the
Bundesbank where credit and financialservices institutions are concerned – bothduring ongoing supervision and in crisissituations.
Assessment and outlook
Financial conglomerates occupy a position of
special importance in Germany, especially oninsurance markets; this is evidenced by thesignificant market shares held by the twolargest German groups as well as by the not-able activities of major foreign financial con-glomerates in Germany. The implementationof the EU Financial Conglomerates Directivein Germany takes account of the growingeconomic importance of financial conglomer-ates. For the first time, supervisors have beengiven a tool to overcome the risks to the fi-nancial system associated with financial con-glomerates. It is particularly the supplemen-tary capital requirements for financial con-glomerates and the enshrined prohibitions onmultiple use of capital (“double gearing”), in-ternal capital creation and capital creationthrough an unsupervised parent enterprise is-suing debt (“excessive leverage”) which areintended to increase group solvency and con-tribute to financial market stability. The Bun-desbank’s comprehensive involvement in fi-nancial conglomerates’ reporting improves itsability, within the framework of its statutorytask of ongoing monitoring of credit institu-tions and financial services institutions, to as-sess the risks to enterprises within a conglom-erate and the risks to financial market stabilityposed by financial conglomerates.All the same, in group-wide supervision of fi-
nancial conglomerates, supervisors are chal-lenged by the fact that sectoral supervisoryrequirements address the relevant risks differ-ently and that there is still no integrated ap-proach to cross-sector supervision of equiva-lent risks. Supervisors are therefore still largelyconfining themselves to a form of monitoringthat informs them about risk concentrationsand intra-group transactions but does not yetset integrated supervisory upper limits acrossall sectors. This appears sensible and reason-able. It is therefore important, prior to creat-ing more extensive supervisory standards, tocompile information and gather experiencebased on incoming reports. Arrangements toresolve or at least disclose conflicts of interestresulting from business activity in different fi-nancial sectors have not been reached, either.The focus of the supervision of companies be-longing to a financial conglomerate will re-main on individual supervision that is supple-mented, but not superseded, by rules govern-ing group-wide supervision (solo-plus ap-proach). It remains to be seen whether theEuropean deliberations on an overhaul of theinsurance supervision system, titled “Sol-vency II”, will result in a supervisory approachthat will make integrated supervision acrosssectors possible through the envisaged in-corporation of elements from banking super-visory strategy.
Unique approaches need to be found for the
other one-stop financial strategies which werementioned at the beginning and which arenot covered by the aforementioned supple-mentary supervision because a “group” doesnot exist. It is precisely for the various types of

56more flexible and loose cooperation models
that conglomerate supervision, which isgeared to groups, would entail an unreason-able supervisory burden. Therefore, the focushere should be on close cooperation and anextensive exchange of information among thesupervisory institutions in the various sectors.This exchange of information should pursuetwo objectives. One is to help improve theevaluation of cooperation with enterprisesfrom the other financial sector in the case ofsectoral individual supervision of an enter-prise. The other is that it should also facilitatecoordination between competent nationalsupervisors in the deployment and evolutionof the surveillance toolkit in connection withsuch one-stop finance strategies.
The provisions of section 7 of the Banking Act
and section 84 (4) No 2a of the InsuranceSupervision Act on the exchange of informa-tion mean that Germany already has the
statutory basis for such close cross-sector co-operation between BaFin’s insurance andbanking supervisory wings, on the one hand,and the Bundesbank, on the other, whichmeans that these one-stop finance strategiesare also monitored. Furthermore, it must alsobe noted that the number of contact pointsbetween the banking and insurance indus-tries is growing constantly, whether via directcredit relationships, credit risk transfer, theconvergence of product markets or mutualdependence on the capital market. From thispoint of view, too, it is appropriate and neces-sary not only to focus on the joint supplemen-tary supervision of financial conglomeratesbut also to keep a watchful eye on all keyinterrelationships between these two sectorsin order to make an accurate assessment oftheir scope and relevance to the stability ofthe financial system.
