6OverviewTemporary sideways movement in the
fourth quarter of 2005
The German economy experienced a lull in
growth in the last few months of 2005. Ac-cording to Federal Statistical Office figures,real gross domestic product (GDP) in the finalquarter of 2005 was more or less on a parwith the preceding quarter after adjustmentfor seasonal and working-day variations.However, the persistently favourable ordersituation in German industry and the im-proved business climate – now also in thebusiness services sectors – indicate that thismay be only a temporary sideways movementand not a sustained interruption of thegrowth process. This is also suggested by therobust global economy, the German econ-omy’s vigorous participation in the rapidlyprogressing international division of labourand the ongoing favourable export expect-ations of German industry.
Exports continued to expand in the fourth
quarter of 2005 following strong growth inthe first three quarters of the year. At thesame time, however, imports rose even faster,which meant that the external sector’s netcontribution to GDP declined markedly. Thesharp rise in imports was probably related toincreased stockbuilding, which is unlikely tocontinue on this scale. Final domestic de-mand also failed to provide any considerablestimuli in the fourth quarter of 2005. Thegenerally positive trend recorded for pur-chases of machinery and equipment was sus-tained and construction investment – which,in the third quarter, had expanded sharply forthe first time in quite a while – recoveredGDP in 2005

7further in the final quarter of 2005. However,
the increase in investment activity was offsetby continuing restraint in household con-sumption. Private consumption fell further inthe fourth quarter after seasonal and work-ing-day adjustment. According to the con-sumer research institution, Gesellschaft f/C252r
Konsumforschung (GfK), however, consumer
confidence improved discernibly during thelast few months of the year. Evidently encour-aged by the frequently cited improvement inbusiness sentiment, households, too, beganto assess the cyclical outlook and their in-come prospects much more favourably. Atthe same time, the propensity to buy in-creased sharply right into January 2006.
Private consumer demand may gain some
support if the situation on the labour marketcontinues to improve. At all events, employ-ment stabilised during the final quarter of2005. The declining trend in jobs subject tofull social security contributions seems tohave largely halted. Registered unemploy-ment declined further in the final quarter of2005. There was a seasonally adjusted quar-ter-on-quarter fall of 130,000 persons to4.73 million. The unemployment rate fellfrom 11.7% in the third quarter to 11.4% inthe fourth quarter. In January 2006, therewas a seasonally adjusted month-on-monthincrease in the number of persons registeredas unemployed of just under 70,000. How-ever, this increase is probably largely the resultof the very cold winter weather since the endof December as well as of anticipatory effectsin connection with the reduction in theperiod of entitlement to unemploymentbenefit I, which came into effect in February.The fact that unit labour costs in the economy
as a whole are estimated to have declined byjust over
3/C254% in 2005 will have a positive
effect on further employment developments.This result was partly determined by the mod-erate growth in negotiated pay rates, whichincreased by no more than about 1% (calcu-lated on a monthly basis). Added to this wasa negative wage drift, which reduced theincrease in actual earnings per employee to
1/C252%. The modest expansion in labour costs
per employee is primarily the result of the ris-ing number of “one-euro jobs” (casual workperformed by recipients of unemploymentbenefit), which in purely arithmetical termslowers average earnings. Another factor wasthat the employer’s contributions to thestatutory health insurance scheme had beenreduced by 0.45 percentage point in mid-2005.
In 2006, there will be a large wage round in
the private sector as numerous pay agree-ments are up for renegotiation. In addition, insome sectors, the wage negotiators failed toreach an agreement in 2005. In view of thediverse situation in the various sectors andlabour market segments, the key need is forsettlements which allow sufficient leeway fordifferentiation and flexibility.
Consumer prices rose significantly in the last
few months of 2005, driven by the sharp in-creases in the prices of energy (+12.9% onthe year) and tobacco products (+13.4%).The overall year-on-year rate of consumerprice inflation in the fourth quarter of 2005was 2.2%; measured by the HarmonisedSituation on the

8Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), prices rose
by 2.3%.
The rate of price increases weakened some-
what at the turn of 2005-06. Especially largeprice discounts for industrial goods in thewinter sales at the beginning of 2006 wereaccompanied by a substantial increase in theprices of electricity and gas. As a result, boththe consumer price index and the Harmon-ised Index of Consumer Prices increased yearon year by 2.1% in January.
Despite higher energy prices, more optimistic
economic expectations began to emerge inthe international financial markets in thefourth quarter of 2005. This was especiallythe case for Germany and Europe as a whole,where economic growth has lagged behindthat of other regions. In this environment,international long-term interest rates in-creased significantly. However, by historicalstandards and in view of the increase in infla-tion risks, the interest rate level on theGerman and European capital markets isstill decidedly low at 3
1/C252% in the ten-year
segment.
In view of the changed overall setting, the
monetary policymakers scaled back theirhighly expansionary interest rate coursesomewhat in December 2005. Since then,the main refinancing operations have beenconducted with a minimum bid rate of 2
1/C254%.
The upward adjustment of1/C254percentage
point became necessary as not only the ex-cessive monetary and credit growth in theeuro area but also the non-monetary indica-tors, which are used in the economic analysisto assess price risks, pointed to longer-terminflationary risks.
The state of public finances in Germany im-
proved slightly in 2005. According to initialprovisional data, the general governmentdeficit amounted to 3.5% of GDP . It was thusslightly below the previous year’s level (3.7%)and noticeably lower than that expected bythe Federal Government, for example. Owingto the relatively favourable budgetary devel-opments towards the end of the year, whichhave not yet been fully incorporated into thepreliminary results, the deficit may even be re-vised downwards somewhat. Nevertheless,the 3% ceiling for the deficit ratio enshrinedin the Maastricht Treaty was overshot for thefourth year in succession. A decline in thegeneral government deficit may be expectedin 2006 provided tight fiscal discipline is exer-cised and no new measures which place astrain on public finances are introduced. Thismeans that the 3% criterion can be met thisyear.
Against the backdrop of European fiscal
rules, the continuous overshooting of thefiscal ceilings since 2002, the progress madetowards achieving the 3% limit in 2005 andthe favourable cyclical outlook, every effortshould be made to comply with the referencevalue for the deficit in 2006. This is all themore important now that the amended Sta-bility and Growth Pact stipulates that coun-tries with an excessive deficit must achieveannual structural consolidation of at least0.5% of GDP – something which has beenemphasised as an important new aspect ofthe Pact. The economic outlook is no obstacle

9to achieving a more evenly timed spread of
the deficit reduction measures originallyplanned for 2007. If sufficient efforts are notmade, Germany risks facing a tightening ofthe excessive deficit procedure.
Compliance with the 3% ceiling should,
however, not imply the termination of theconsolidation process. On the contrary, theEuropean and national budgetary rules re-quire a swift further reduction of the deficit.Both the Stability and Growth Pact and theGerman Budget Principles Act ( Haushalts-
grunds/C228tzegesetz ) specify the target of a
close-to-balance budget position; the Pactprescribes further annual structural consoli-dation of 0.5% of GDP until this goal isachieved. Moreover, even if the measuresoutlined in the coalition agreement are imple-mented, the Federal Government and severalstate governments will have to make add-
itional efforts in order to comply with theconstitutional budget principles – also beyond2007. A reduction in the deficit and debtratios is also necessary to ensure that Ger-many is better prepared to tackle futurebudgetary burdens, particularly in view of thedemographic developments. As well asboosting public confidence in a well-function-ing fiscal policy, this would also create scopefor the automatic stabilisers to take effectduring economic downturns. If, however, theconsolidation efforts were now to be scaledback in view of the likelihood of additionalrevenue on account of the more positive eco-nomic outlook, this would not least run coun-ter to one of the fundamental intentions ofthe amended Stability and Growth Pact,namely to step up consolidation during morefavourable macroeconomic phases.

10Global and
European settingWorld economic activity
In the last quarter of 2005, the global econ-
omy continued to grow briskly, although thepace probably dropped off a bit from thethird quarter. Slower growth in the industrialcountries was the key factor, with slumpinggrowth in the United States having had a par-ticularly pronounced impact. Overall econom-ic output in the euro area likewise grew moreslowly than in the third quarter. The slow-down in the USA and the euro area, particu-larly in the light of the strong growth thatpreceded it, was not offset by increasedmanufacturing activity in Japan. In the majorindustrial countries and economic regions,total Q4 real gross domestic product (GDP),according to as-yet provisional information,was up by a seasonally adjusted
1/C252%f r o m
the previous quarter, in which it had risen by
3/C254%. It was up by 23/C254% on the year. GDP
growth for all of 2005 amounted to 21/C252%,
compared with 3% a year earlier.
Price movements in industrial countries, after
having been affected in the summer monthsby soaring prices for petroleum products,calmed down somewhat when the energymarkets eased in the fourth quarter of 2005.Industrial countries saw consumer price infla-tion fall from 3.0% in September to 2.4% inDecember. Core inflation (excluding energyand food) inched up slightly over the sameperiod, from 1.4% to 1.6%. This reflects aslight strengthening of the indirect effects ofhigher Q3 energy prices on products with arelatively large energy component. The move-ment of overall inflation and core inflation inopposite directions reduced the gap betweenGlobal upswing

11the two, which had at times been much
wider; in December it was the same as inmid-year. For the industrial countries – ex-cluding Japan, which had seen slight defla-tion throught the period under review – thetwo rates stood at 2.7% and 1.8% respect-ively in December.
The trend decline in crude oil prices is the
main reason for the receding price pressure inthe industrial countries during the fourthquarter. The price of a barrel of Brent fellfrom its early September record high ofUS$67
1/C252,1which was the result of hurricane
damage, to US$571/C252in December, despite
high interim volatility. The price of Brentcrude oil averaged US$55 for all of 2005,compared to US$38 and US$28
1/C252respectively
in the two preceding years. However, priceshave gone back up, in some cases distinctly,since the beginning of 2006 – not least on ac-count of renewed geopolitical tensions in theMiddle East. Since the beginning of February,however, the price trend has pointed down-wards, coming to US$59 by mid-month. Thistranslated to a year-on-year rise of just over30%. Over the past half-year, the euro pricefor a barrel of Brent crude moved largely inlockstep with dollar prices owing to the rela-tive stability of the exchange rate. Due to theeuro’s depreciation against the US dollar inthe first half of 2005, the oil price, at 350,
stood around 45% higher in mid-Februarythan a year earlier. The sharp price increasesin oil markets in January and the forwardquotations for crude oil have shown onceagain that prices may be expected to remainvery high and volatile due to the continuingrise in the demand for crude oil, largely ex-hausted production capacities and recurring
political tensions.
Dollar prices for industrial raw materials have
gone up perceptibly since temporarily bot-toming out in June 2005. In January they roseby 13% from their already high level of a yearearlier. In euro terms, prices were up by nearlyone-quarter in the first half of 2005 owing tothe euro’s depreciation against the US dollar.Prices for iron ores and scrap metal rose par-ticularly sharply, by 38% in US dollar termson average for the year.

economies and have, in some cases, alsocaused inflation to increase distinctly. How-ever, this may hardly be said of the Chineseeconomy, which continues to run full speedahead and has been a key pillar of globalgrowth throughout the period under review.In 2005 Q4, total output was up by 10%.Real GDP likewise rose by an average of one-tenth on the year – as in the two precedingyears. At the same time, consumer price infla-tion remained moderate, averaging 1.8% onthe year.
Following the most recent recalculation of
GDP by China’s statistical office, which led toa 17% upward revision at constant prices for2004, the country’s weight in the world econ-omy has grown even further. On the basis ofthe new GDP information, in 2005 Chinaovertook the UK to become the world’sfourth-largest economy. Its nominal GDP , de-nominated in US dollars, has tripled since1995. At its present rapid rate of growth,China will probably pass Germany by 2007and become the third-largest economy be-hind Japan.
2In terms of purchasing power
parities, a measure designed to take accountof differences in price levels relative to the in-dustrial nations by directly comparing theprices of selected tradable and non-tradablegoods, China has already been in secondplace behind the United States for some time,according to IMF statistics. China’s surge inthe international GDP table, however, is tem-pered considerably by looking at the largepopulation across which the GDP result isspread. As a rough indicator of wealth, percapita income is far superior to absolute GDPlevels anyway. It serves to show that Chinaultimately still lags far behind the industrialnations (see adjacent chart). Per-capitaincome in China in 2005 was only 4% of thecomparable figure for the United States and5% of the relevant figure for Germany. In theNominal per-capita GDP

2Japan is a special case in this regard because overall
and per-capita nominal GDP fell between 1995 and

13mid-1990s, the gap was even larger. The
highly uneven distribution of income in Chinaalso needs to be taken into consideration.
The Latin American countries were on a
growth track throughout the reportingperiod; however, in some major countriesgrowth slowed down distinctly in 2005. Theongoing positive stimuli from exports ofcrude oil and raw materials were held incheck by a variety of different factors de-pending on the country involved. Growth inBrazil was curbed at times by high interestrates and political uncertainty. The Braziliancentral bank has since cut its key lending rateseveral times following a distinct easing ofprice pressures; it now stands at 17
1/C254%.
Overall output growth in Mexico suffered inthe first half of 2005 from weak exportgrowth and, in autumn, from the effects ofhurricane damage, especially to the tourist in-frastructure. In both countries, however, eco-nomic activity seemed poised to regain speedat the end of the period under review.
Russian industry is under rather strong real
revaluation pressure as a result of the rawmaterials boom. The diminishing price com-petitiveness of Russian industrial goods isamplifying the Russian economy’s depend-ence – which was already high to begin with –on exports of crude oil, natural gas and indus-trial raw materials. According to estimates byRussia’s economic ministry, real GDP grew by6
1/C252% in 2005 compared with 71/C252% in 2004.
Inflation, at 123/C254%, remained very high.
Most other oil-producing members of theCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS)are even more heavily dependent on oil.A balanced sectoral development has, for the
most part, not gotten off the ground yet.Average real incomes in the CIS are, in manycases, currently still below 1989 levels. Exten-sive market economy reforms are urgentlyneeded in order to sustainably enhance pros-perity in these countries.
According to as-yet provisional information,
total output in the United States in the lastquarter of the year was up by only
1/C254%o n
the quarter after adjustment for seasonal andworking-day variations. This was the lowestgrowth since end-2002. Year-on-year realGDP growth was 3% and averaged 3
1/C252%o n
an annual basis. The sluggish Q4 growth is at-tributable to a number of special factors andshould therefore not be interpreted as usher-ing in a lasting economic slowdown in theUnited States.
3In addition, the available lead-
ing indicators are pointing to a continuationof the strong upswing in 2006. For one thing,real private consumption grew relatively weak-ly in 2005 Q4, at a seasonally adjusted
1/C254%,
owing to a drop-off in car sales following athird quarter in which special offers haddriven sales up. The saving ratio, which hadfallen to -1
3/C254% in the preceding quarter,
went up to -1/C252%; even so, the average for
the year, at -1/C252%, represented a new low. For
another, government consumption fell owing
3The degree to which total output for the fourth quarter
was dented by the hurricane damage in the late summer
is difficult to assess. However, there are many signs that
rapid reconstruction in the oil industry considerably offset
the production shortfall and that, in fact, Q4 output may
have equalled its September 2005 level. This would mean
that the region’s quarterly GDP growth was diminished
only slightly, if at all. The reduced production therefore
had a relatively negligible impact on the US economy as a
whole because less than 1 % of US GDP is generated in
the affected region.Latin America

14to a perceptible decline in defence spending,
which is usually quite volatile. In addition,commercial investment growth, at
3/C254%,
failed to meet expectations. In view of mutedexport growth and a sharp increase in im-ports, foreign trade reduced real GDP growthby one-quarter percentage point in absoluteterms. The rise in imports, however, coincidedwith a turnaround towards inventory growth,which made a contribution to growth of one-quarter percentage point of GDP .
Owing to the easing of energy markets in the
fourth quarter, consumer price inflation re-ceded quite rapidly and distinctly, from 4.7%in September to 3.4% in December. How-ever, due to a renewed surge of oil prices atthe beginning of the year, the inflation rate isnot likely to continue its fall for the timebeing. Core inflation picked up slightly, from2.0% in September to 2.2% in December. Bycontrast, the personal consumption expend-iture (PCE) deflator excluding energy andfood, the US Federal Reserve’s preferred in-strument for analysing prices, was no higherin December (1.9%) than in mid-2005. Atthe beginning of the year, however, hourlynon-farm wages rose somewhat more sharp-ly, which means that domestically generatedprice pressures could rise.
In the fourth quarter of 2005, economic
growth in Japan rebounded following a dis-tinct slump in the third quarter. Real GDP wasup by a seasonally adjusted 1
1/C252% on the
quarter and 41/C254% on the year. Total econom-
ic output grew by 23/C254% on average for 2005.
In the fourth quarter of the previous year,growth was driven mainly by private domesticdemand, which was up by a seasonally ad-justed 1% on the quarter. Private consump-tion rose by
3/C254%, contributing1/C252percentage
point of GDP to growth. The improvement inthe labour market did much to increasehouseholds’ propensity to buy. In addition,nominal wages have continued to rise, andyear-end bonuses paid by companies weremuch higher than a year earlier. Private grossfixed capital formation likewise rose visibly.Real exports grew by a seasonally adjusted3%. With imports down by 1
1/C254%, foreign
trade made a contribution to growth of one-half percentage point. In the last quarter, con-sumer prices again fell a bit more sharply onthe year, by 0.5%, due mainly to falling foodprices. If this group of goods is excluded,prices remained virtually unchanged.
In the last quarter of 2005, real GDP in the
United Kingdom, according to initial esti-mates and after adjustment for seasonal andworking-day variations, was up by just over
1/C252% on the period, following just under1/C252%
a period earlier. Overall output was up by1
3/C254% on average for the year, representing
the weakest increase since 1992. Sectoraltrends remained uneven in 2005 Q4, too. Theproduction of services rose sharply in the finalquarter, at just under 1 % in seasonally adjust-ed terms, whereas output in the productionsector (excluding construction) fell by
1/C252%.
Since 2000, the services sector has grown by16%, yet the production sector has shrunk by5
1/C252%. Available information on demand ag-
gregates is only sketchy thus far. What isknown is that seasonally adjusted real retailsales rose rather sharply in the fourth quarter(+1

15the preceding quarters. Property prices, hav-
ing virtually stagnated in the second quarter,resumed their rise in the second half of theyear. Consumer price inflation – measured interms of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) –went down from 2.5% in September to1.9% in December as a result of the easing inthe energy markets. During that period, coreinflation fell by 0.2 percentage point to 1.4%.
The new EU member states maintained their
impressive growth in the fourth quarter of2005. In the October-December period, in-dustrial production grew by a seasonally ad-justed 3
1/C254% compared to the third quarter
and by 9% on the year. Growth for 2005 as awhole, at 5
1/C254%, remained well below year-
on-year growth; this was attributable mainlyto the slowdown in growth in the second halfof 2004. The sharp rise in production alsospurred employment growth, leading to amore pronounced decline in unemployment.The standardised unemployment rate, at aseasonally adjusted 13.0% in December, wasaround one percentage point less than at theend of 2004. Prices in the new member statescalmed distinctly over the course of thefourth quarter. Year-on-year consumer priceinflation fell from its last high in October by
1/C252percentage point to 2.0% in December.
The inflation rate averaged 2.5% for 2005,with considerable differences between indi-vidual countries.
Macroeconomic trends in the euro area
According to initial Eurostat estimates, sea-
sonally adjusted growth in the euro area inthe fourth quarter failed to reach third-quarter levels; real GDP was up by
1/C254%o n
the period, compared with just over1/C252%i n
the third quarter. GDP growth was up by1
1/C254% on the year. The annual average
growth rate likewise stood at 11/C254%. Momen-
tum seems to have picked up at the begin-ning of the year, though. According to theEuropean Commission’s short-term forecast,overall output growth will lie in the range of0.4% to 0.8% for the first quarter of 2006.In addition, the Consensus Forecast predic-tions for the euro area for 2006 have beenadjusted upwards since December, by anaverage of one-quarter percentage point tojust under 2%.
Seen from the output side, the slower growth
in the last quarter of the year was due in partto weaker growth in industrial production,which in the October-December period aver-aged a seasonally adjusted
1/C252% on the quar-
ter following 1% growth in the third quarter.However, in the fourth quarter of 2005 andthe beginning of 2006 the underlying trendin industrial activity was clearly growing, afinding which is backed up by a host of indi-cators. As a case in point, industrial capacityutilisation saw a noticeable rise between Oc-tober and January; at the end of the reportingperiod, it was nearly as high as a year earlier.
New orders seem to be indicating a similar
trend; in the October-November period theywere up by a seasonally adjusted 3% from analready high third-quarter level. Orders wereup in terms of value by 6
3/C254% on the year;
however, this result was influenced by largeorders, especially for transport equipment.New EU

16Export business appears to have been particu-
larly brisk: according to the quarterly EU sur-vey for October-January, export expectationssoared. This is consistent with a continuousimprovement in industry confidence in thepast few months, which in January reachedits highest level since the end of 2004.
On the demand side, households’ reluctance
to buy seems to have curbed GDP growth inthe fourth quarter. After seasonal adjust-ment, real retail sales were virtually un-changed from third-quarter figures. (Informa-tion on the expenditure components of realGDP for the fourth quarter of 2005 is not yetavailable.) In the meantime, however, privateconsumption, which has been the Achillesheel of the euro-area economy for sometime, is showing increasing signs of a recoveryof sorts. For example, consumer confidencein December-January was much higher thanin the previous months, though still slightlybelow its long-term average. Unlike house-holds’ purchases, (nominal) exports to non-euro-area countries picked up sharply in Oc-tober-November, rising by 1
1/C254% on the third
quarter and by 91/C254% on the year. However,
imports rose even more strongly, by a season-ally adjusted 2
3/C254% on the period and 141/C252%

17ised unemployment rate fell to 8.3%, having
been 8.8% a year earlier. Labour marketdevelopments were particularly favourablein Spain, France and Italy. In some smallereconomies (Austria and the Netherlands, forinstance), however, underemployment in-creased somewhat. At present, the standard-ised figures for Germany are virtually impos-sible to interpret in economic terms on ac-count of the breaks in the seasonal patterns.Euro-area labour costs were up by 2
1/C254%i n
the third quarter, the last quarter up to whichstatistics are available, compared with 2
1/C252%
in the second.
Consumer price inflation slowed down to a
seasonally adjusted1/C252% in the final quarter
of 2005. This translates to an annualised rateof 2%. Because of stronger inflation in thepreceding periods, the year-on-year rateremained unchanged at 2.3%. The muchweaker period-on-period increase in energyprices of 0.4%, following 4.5% and 5.6% inthe second and third quarters respectively,were key in curbing inflation. Unprocessedfood prices, by contrast, picked up againslightly after falling somewhat in the thirdquarter.
Excluding energy and unprocessed food,
quarter-on-quarter inflation rose to
1/C252%.
Although core inflation stood only at 1.5%on the year, it was still somewhat higher thanin the second and third quarters of 2005.Whereas services price inflation tailed offslightly, the prices of industrial goods exclud-ing energy went back up more sharply for thefirst time in a relatively long period of time.The prices for processed food, too, rose more
sharply than earlier.
For 2005 as a whole, euro-area consumer
prices rose by an average of 2.2% – as in2004. The relatively high rate of inflation wasinfluenced mainly by the sharp rise in oilprices in international markets, which causedenergy prices to soar by 10% on the year.Price trends in 2004, by contrast, wereshaped in large part by administered price in-creases. Energy accounted for only slightlyless than 9% of the HICP basket but two-fifths of the past year’s inflation. Excludingenergy and unprocessed food, inflation stoodonly at 1.5%. Owing to the non-stop rise inenergy prices, however, the core rate seems,if anything, to be understating the currentunderlying trend in consumer prices.Euro-area consumer prices

19Monetary policy and
banking businessInterest rate policy and the
money market
After having initially left the Eurosystem’s key
interest rates unchanged at their historicallylow levels over the autumn months, the ECBGoverning Council decided at its meeting inearly December to raise rates by a quarterpercentage point. Accordingly, since 6 De-cember 2005 the main refinancing operationshave been conducted as variable rate tenderswith a minimum bid rate of 2
1/C254%, the inter-
est rate for the marginal lending facility is3
1/C254%a n d11/C254% for the deposit facility. This
adjustment had become necessary followingan increase in inflation risks during recentmonths. This had been indicated by the accel-eration in monetary and credit growth overquite some time. In the last few months,however, non-monetary indicators – used ineconomic analysis to assess price risks – havealso pointed to stability risks.
For the most part, the ECB Governing Coun-
cil’s somewhat less expansionary policy wasable to be implemented smoothly and reli-ably, apart from the usual short-term fluctu-ations at year-end and the end of the reservemaintenance periods. The EONIA overnightrate was generally quite close to the min-imum bid rate in the main refinancing oper-ations. This may also be attributable to thenew monetary policy framework introducedin March 2004 which largely prevents marketparticipants’ expectations regarding impend-ing interest rate changes from affecting con-ditions on the market for overnight money.By contrast, developments in the somewhatlonger-term maturity segment of the moneyInterest rate

20Money market management and liquidity needs
In the three maintenance periods between 12 October 2005 and
17 January 2006, euro-area credit institutions’ need for centralbank money arising from the autonomous factors determining li-quidity increased by 525.3 billion in net terms. This was due main-
ly to the sharp rise in banknote circulation of 527.6 billion in the
euro area, particularly in December, as usual for the time of yearand to a similar extent to 2004, albeit at a lower growth rate. Li-quidity needs arising from general government deposits declinedby53.7 billion net. If, in order to eliminate valuation effects, the
changes in net reserve assets and other factors are taken together,these two items resulted in a liquidity absorption of 51.4 billion.
The minimum reserve requirement went up by 52.5 billion and re-
sulted in growing demand for central bank liquidity.
The greater need for liquidity was covered primarily by the main
refinancing operations (MROs) being topped up by 527.8 billion.
Although the volume of longer-term refinancing operations(LTROs) aimed for by the Governing Council of the ECB for theperiod under review remained unchanged, an erroneous bid inthe LTRO tender procedure on 22 December caused a liquiditygap of 517.5 billion for one day, even though it was immediately
corrected. Nevertheless, owing to the stabilising effect of meetingthe minimum reserve on average, the lack of liquidity led to theEONIA temporarily increasing by 6 basis points just on that day.Standing mostly between 7 and 9 basis points above the min-imum bid rate, the EONIA interest rate was at a slightly higherlevel in the period under review.
A special feature of the period under review was the ECB’s loose
allotment policy, particularly in order to narrow the spread be-tween the EONIA and the minimum bid rate after it had been in-creasing slightly in September/October 2005. The ECB thereforeallotted liquidity volumes above the benchmark, with the excep-tion of the last MRO in each maintenance period. However, theECB departed from this practice in the MRO being conducted dir-ectly before the Governing Council of the ECB put up interestrates on 1 December 2005. The increase in the allotment generallyamounted to 51 billion, although it was 53 billion immediately
before and after Christmas. Last year, too, the ECB supplied bankswith ample liquidity in the period from before the beginning ofthe run-up to Christmas through to the New Year, with the devi-ations from the benchmark allotment taking effect as early as Oc-tober 2005, one month earlier than in 2004.
Increases in the EONIA at the end of the month as well as devi-
ations following the last MRO in each reserve period were charac-teristic of all the reserve periods.
In the reserve maintenance period which started on 12 October,
market participants seemed to expect a slight liquidity shortagefollowing the allotment in the last MRO, with the result that theEONIA rose to 2.09% on 4 November and remained at this levelon the following day. However, as liquidity conditions were large-ly balanced on the last day of the reserve period, no fine-tuningoperation was necessary. The reserve period ended with theEONIA at 1.87%.
In the reserve period which began on 9 November, there was a
particular development in the EONIA in advance of the GoverningCouncil of the ECB raising interest rates by 25 basis points to2.25% on 1 December 2005. The EONIA had already gone up to2.19% one week earlier following comments by Jean-ClaudeTrichet, President of the ECB, despite banks having sufficient li-quidity. One reason for this is likely to be the fact that not all mar-ket participants had yet taken in the distinction which has beenenshrined in the new monetary policy framework since March2004 between banks’ interest rate expectations and liquidity con-ditions within an ongoing reserve period. Following the allot-ment of the last MRO – which was 51 billion above the bench-
mark on this exceptional occasion – the market anticipated excessliquidity, with the result that the EONIA fell to 1.80% on 2 Decem-ber. After a liquidity-absorbing fine-tuning operation of 57.5 bil-
lion was carried out on the last day of the reserve period, the EO-NIA rate stood at 1.85%.On 6 December, a reserve maintenance period, extended to43 days, began. Owing to the generous allotment policy and theextended reserve period, things went smoothly at the turn of theyear. At the end of the year, the EONIA stood at 2.42%, just17 basis points above the minimum bid rate. Following the allot-ment of the last MRO, the market initially assumed that there wasample liquidity, as a result of which the EONIA fell to 2.21% on13 January. When, in fact, a liquidity deficit became apparent, theECB conducted a liquidity-providing fine-tuning operation on thelast day of the reserve period amounting to 57.0 billion. On
17 January, the EONIA stood at 2.30% and the December/Januaryreserve period ended with a small net recourse to the deposit fa-cility of 5785 million. At the start of the new January/February re-
serve maintenance period, the EONIA rate stood at 2.33%, 8 basispoints above the minimum bid rate.

21market were marked by ongoing expect-
ations of interest rate increases in the periodunder review which persisted after the ratemove. Accordingly, there was a noticeablerise in the three-month forward rate; on anine-month view, the market had priced inan increase in the overnight rate of almostthree-quarters of a percentage point to about3%. In mid-February, the rate of interest fortwelve-month funds was more than half apercentage point higher than for overnightmoney.
Monetary developments
in the euro area
Following strong expansion in the two previ-
ous quarters, euro-area M3 growth weak-ened in the final quarter of 2005. Moneyholdings increased at a seasonally adjustedannual rate of only just under 3
1/C252% in Octo-
ber-December. However, they were still 7.3%up on the year at the end of 2005. Measuredin terms of the real money gap which is ad-justed for portfolio effects, the liquidity sur-plus in the euro area almost doubled fromaround 3% to 5% year-on-year. A principalcontributor to this is likely to have been thedecidedly low interest rates across all matur-ities, which supported the sharp rise in thedemand for credit in the private sector. Yet,recently, this rise has been set against consid-erable outflows of funds in foreign payments,strong monetary capital formation and amarked expansion in holdings of central gov-ernments, which are not assigned to M3 and,furthermore, are subject to substantial short-term fluctuations. Even so, monetary growthin 2005 was higher than it had been in thepast three years.
In particular, the especially liquid components
contained in M1 increased strongly again inthe quarter under review. Demand wasgreatest for overnight deposits, which con-tinued to grow robustly, at a seasonallyadjusted annual rate of just under 9%. Bycomparison, final-quarter annualised expan-sion in currency in circulation halved on thequarter to 6%. When measured againstlonger-term benchmarks, however, this stillrepresents a considerable rise. Overall, othershort-term bank deposits were only increasedby comparably small amounts in the lastquarter of 2005. This was mainly the resultof a decline in deposits redeemable with anotice period of up to three months which,Seasonally adjusted, annual percentage change

22given the rebound in short-term interest
rates, appear to have lost much of theirappeal. By contrast, short-term time deposits,which are largely remunerated at close tomarket rates, were increased significantlyagain in the period under review; alongsideother financial institutions, households alsocontributed to this development. Amongmarketable instruments, money market fundshares and repo transactions were reducedheavily towards the end of the year. In con-trast, there was a noticeable increase inshort-term bank debt securities.
Robust demand for credit in the private sector
remained the main driving force behind mon-etary expansion in the quarter under review.Non-securitised bank loans increased by aseasonally adjusted annual rate of 10% in thefourth quarter, a similarly sharp rise to that inthe third quarter. Broken down by sectors,loans were given mainly to households forhouse purchases and to non-financial corpor-ations. There was also a marked increase inloans to financial enterprises and for con-sumer credit. Demand was greatest for long-term loans, a reflection of low capital marketrates. According to the results of the quarter-ly bank lending survey in the euro area, muchof the lending was used to finance mergers,corporate and debt restructuring.
Lending to the public sector also expanded
considerably in the final quarter of 2005 withdomestic banks purchasing a large volume ofgovernment bonds, in particular. By contrast,the usual expansion in loans towards the endof the year was somewhat down on previousyears. The strong rise in central government€ billion, seasonally adjusted

23holdings also dampened the expansive effect
on M3 of government borrowing per se.
M3 expansion in the final quarter was also
contained by a recovery in capital formation.Long-term bank deposits and securities is-sued, which are not included in M3, andbanks’ capital increased of late to an annual-ised rate of just under 8%. Alongside sales oflonger-term bank debt securities, there wasmainly demand for longer-term time de-posits. However, banks’ capital and reserveswere also significantly increased of late. Thiswas compounded by outflows of funds in for-eign payments in connection with sizablepurchases of foreign securities by euro-arearesidents.
Deposit and lending business of German
banks with domestic customers
Growth in German banks’ deposits declined
somewhat more sharply than in the euro areain the fourth quarter of 2005. However, over-night deposits rose again strongly, with a sea-sonally adjusted annualised growth rate of6% of late, though this was down on thethird-quarter increase (14
1/C252%). The level of
investment by other financial institutions,which heavily reduced their overnight de-posits with domestic banks in the quarterunder review, was the principal dampener.
There was also a significant decline in de-
posits redeemable with an agreed noticeperiod of three months. Above all, short-termsavings deposits at a rate of interest abovethe minimum rate of return perceptiblyundershot their usual levels of year-endgrowth.
By contrast, longer-term time deposits (with
an agreed maturity of more than two years)were increased significantly. As well as em-ployed persons, such deposits attracted inter-est from insurance enterprises, in particular.This contrasts with longer-term savings de-posits (with an agreed notice period of morethan three months), which continued to fallconsiderably in the quarter under review.
The credit granted by German banks to do-
mestic non-banks fell slightly overall in thefourth quarter, following a noticeable in-crease in the previous quarter. German banksagain purchased a large volume of securitiesfrom domestic issuers, adding shares in Ger-Lending and deposits of monetary

24man enterprises as well as fixed-interest Ger-
man public-sector bonds to their holdings.Against this, however, there were sharp de-clines in loans to public borrowers, enter-prises and individuals.
Much as in the previous quarter, in the
period under review the trend among non-securitised loans to the domestic private sec-tor was strongly characterised by credit grant-ed to other financial institutions. After theseborrowers had taken up a high volume ofshort-term loans in the third quarter as partof large-scale securities lending transactionswith German banks, they reduced themagain towards year-end. Additionally, non-financial corporations scaled back their loansin the last quarter. Loans for consumer creditalso declined of late, whereas loans for housepurchases saw increased demand in the finalquarter of 2005, presumably owing to theabolition of the grant to homebuyers at thestart of 2006.
For the most part, German banks’ rates for
new lending rose slightly in the fourth quarterof 2005 in anticipation of and following therise in the ECB key interest rates. The cost ofloans to non-financial enterprises and loansto households for house purchases increasedover all periods of interest rate fixation. Ger-man banks were charging less than at theend of the previous quarter only for consumercredit. As a result, German non-financial en-terprises had to pay between 4.1% and 4.5%for new long-term lending depending on theloan amount; for housing loans with an inter-est rate fixed for more than ten years Germanbanks charged 4.3% and 7.8% for long-termconsumer loans.
The banks have also adjusted interest rates
upwards for deposit business. In particular,there was an increase in rates for time de-posits. Depending on the maturity, the bankswere paying between 2.0% and 2.4%.

25According to the results of the Eurosystem
Bank Lending Survey,2credit standards for
corporate and consumer loans at the Germanbanks polled were largely unchanged; therewas only a slight tightening for private hous-ing loans. At the same time, the banks report-ed a further modest cut in their margins foraverage loans; margins for higher-risk loansremained almost unchanged.
For the current quarter, German banks expect
a further increase in the demand for creditfrom enterprises and consumers in the lightof brighter sentiment in industry and amonghouseholds. By contrast, they anticipate a no-ticeable slowdown in demand for housingloans in the first few months of 2006 follow-ing the anticipatory effects in the fourth quar-ter of 2005 in connection with the abolitionof the grant to new housebuyers at the startof 2006. Moreover, they also expect a ten-dency for a slight loosening of credit stand-ards, particularly for corporate loans. Allthings considered, the results for Germany onthe supply-side and demand-side alike are inline with those for the euro area as a whole.

27Financial marketsFinancial market trends
Despite the higher energy prices, the autumn
and winter months saw the re-emergence ofmore optimistic economic expectations in theinternational financial markets. This was es-pecially the case for Europe, where economicgrowth has progressed more slowly than inother regions. Against this backdrop, long-term rates rose significantly worldwide. Giventhat its interest rate spread was slightly small-er at the end of the period under review, theUS dollar tended to depreciate against theeuro, and also against other currencies, upuntil the end of January. In the stock marketsthe positive economic indicators, which werealso reflected in the largely favourable quar-terly results and improved profit expectationsof enterprises, resulted in strong share pricegains, particularly in the euro area.
Exchange rates
At the turn of 2005-06, the sentiment in the
international foreign exchange marketsturned in favour of the euro for a while. Theeuro had tended to depreciate slightly againstthe US dollar in the fourth quarter of 2005and by mid-November was trading at a two-year low of less than US$1.17, but expansion-ary forces subsequently gained momentum.First, the market players seemed to be evermore convinced that an end to the cycle ofinterest rate rises by the US Federal Reservewas in sight. Second, following the change inkey ECB interest rates at the beginning of De-cember 2005, they considered that furtherkey interest rate increases are to be expectedFinancial

28during the course of 2006. The resulting ex-
pectation of a narrowing interest rate differ-ential between US and European investmentsled to the euro briefly rising above US$1.20again as early as mid-December.
The market players’ expectations of a conver-
gence of the central bank rates of both cur-rency areas were strengthened by some sur-prisingly positive economic indicators for theeuro area at the beginning of this year. Fur-thermore, the concerns regarding the long-term sustainability of the US trade balanceagain seemed to be more present, althoughthe deficit had fallen more sharply than pre-dicted in November (to US$64.2 billion). Atthe beginning of the year, the euro-US dollarexchange rate remained largely at aroundUS$1.21 before falling again at the beginningof February. Favourable labour market datafor the USA gave rise to renewed speculationof further interest rate increases by the USFederal Reserve. The euro was trading atUS$1.19 at the end of the period under re-view, slightly above its level at the start ofmonetary union.
As a result of the yield differential between
European and Japanese debt securities, theeuro – which had been appreciating againstthe yen since the third quarter – continued itsupward trend. Following the speculation ofmarket players that the Bank of Japan wouldcontinue its expansionary monetary policy forsome time to come in order to avoid jeopard-ising its economic recovery, the euro rose toover ¥143 in mid-December, its highest levelever. The Bank of Japan’s quarterly Tankansurvey did, in actual fact, confirm the favour-able economic outlook for Japan. The euroconsequently lost some of its gains againstthe yen again. However, the signs of more fa-vourable economic developments in the euroarea and the increase in key ECB interestrates had a stabilising impact. As this reportwent to press, the euro was quoted at ¥140.

29narrow bounds in the autumn and winter
months. Neither the current economic datanor the results published in the Bank of Eng-land’s inflation report in mid-November lastyear point to a lasting effect in the foreign ex-change market. Since the turn of the year,the euro-pound sterling exchange rate has re-mained at £0.68, with only modest fluctu-ations. The exchange rate is thus more than3
1/C252% below its value at the beginning of
monetary union.
During the period under review, the euro ap-
preciated on average against 23 currencies.As this article went to press, the effective ex-change rate stood at around the same levelrecorded at the beginning of this year andthus just over 2
1/C252% below the level at the
start of monetary union. In real terms – ie tak-ing account of the simultaneously prevailinginflation differentials between the euro areaand its major trading partners – the effectiveeuro exchange rate, which is also a measureof the price competitiveness of companies inthe euro area, was again clearly above itslonger-term average. By this measure, thecompetitiveness of euro-area enterprises as awhole against non-euro-area countries istherefore less favourable than that of Germanenterprises.
Securities markets and portfolio
transactions
On balance, there was an increase in yields in
the international bond markets in the fourthquarter. Given the largely improved leadingeconomic indicators, this development, inparticular, reflects a greater level of confi-dence in future economic developments onthe part of market participants. This was alsovisible from surveys which showed an im-provement in growth prospects for 2006,particularly in the euro area. The high oil pricehad only a limited effect on the buoyant eco-nomic expectations. The tension in the inter-national energy markets contributed to thefact that the short-term inflation expectationsof market players were revised upwards inpart. However, the long-term inflation ex-pectations for the euro area remained largelystable at the same time. This can be interpret-ed as an indication of confidence in the policyand competence of the European CentralBank in terms of maintaining price stability.
The yield on ten-year Federal bonds outstand-
ing (Bunds) rose in line with the worldwide in-crease in bond yields by around
1/C252percentage
point to 31/C252% by mid-November compared
with its low in September 2005. This levelwas last reached in the spring of 2005. How-ever, during the following two months, long-term interest rates fell by a further
1/C254percent-
age point before reaching 31/C252% again in Jan-
uary 2006 against the backdrop of improvedeconomic indicators. Given the largely un-changed long-term inflation outlook – asmentioned above – the nominal yield on ten-year Federal bonds moved closely in parallelwith the real yield of comparable inflation-linked bonds,

than 11/C254% at the end of the period under re-
view. The long-term real rate of interest for... and against

30the euro area calculated in this way has thus
increased almost as strongly as in the UnitedStates since September. Given the virtuallyunchanged long-term inflation expectations,the interest rate spread of ten-year US Treas-uries over the respective euro-area govern-ment bonds remained at well over 1 percent-age point. Thus, the interest rate spread iscurrently a relatively good reflection of theexisting differences in the analysts’ nominalgrowth expectations for the euro area andthe USA.
The interest rate premiums on BBB-rated cor-
porate bonds in the euro area gradually in-creased to almost 130 basis points in thefourth quarter of 2005. At the end of theperiod under review, they were up by ap-proximately 70 basis points on their lowreached in the spring of 2005. Nevertheless,the financing conditions for the corporatesector remained favourable on a longer-termcomparison. The increase in corporate bondspreads, which was especialty large in thecase of borrowers with a poor credit rating– particularly in the segment of high-yieldbonds – indicates that market players are be-coming less inclined to take risks and thatthey appear to attach greater significance todefault and liquidity risks overall. In addition,the widening of interest rate spreads couldreflect a certain credit rating deterioration ofthose enterprises included in the indices aswest European enterprises were increasinglydowngraded by rating agencies in the fourthquarter.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, gross sales ofdomestic debt securities were clearly belowthe issue volume of the previous quarters at3247

were also down on the year by just over 332

the fourth quarter, after taking account of re-demptions and changes in issuers’ holdingsof their own bonds. In the previous quarter,German borrowers had sold securities in thebond market to the net value of 316

Government – not least in view of the favour-able cash balance in the final quarter of2005 – and other public issuers reduced theirbond market debt by almost 31 billion and

32Net redemptions by credit institutions in the
amount of 3271/C252billion were the main reason
for the (negative) overall result from the issu-ance of German debt securities in the fourthquarter. In December 2005, in particular,more securities of these credit institutionsmatured owing to seasonal reasons thanwere newly issued. Thus, the trend amongcredit institutions since the middle of the yearto reduce their domestic capital market debtcontinued after they had borrowed a total of377
1/C252billion from the bond market during
the first half of 2005.3On balance, the credit
institutions redeemed other bank debt secur-ities and public Pfandbriefe for 316
1/C252billion
and 3111/C252respectively in the fourth quarter.
By contrast, they sold a small amount of debtsecurities issued by specialised credit institu-tions and mortgage Pfandbriefe.As in the preceding period, foreign investorswere the sole buyers of domestic debt secur-ities in the fourth quarter with net purchasesof314 billion. On balance, they only pur-
chased public sector securities ( 314
1/C252billion).
By contrast, domestic credit institutions andnon-banks resold domestic bond holdings tothe net value of 325
1/C252billion and 3111/C252bil-
lion respectively. The bulk of the net resalesby German credit institutions were bank debtsecurities ( 324 billion). Domestic non-banks
reduced their holdings of securities from Ger-man private and public sector borrowers by35 billion and 36
1/C252billion respectively. By
contrast, both credit institutions and non-banks invested in foreign debt securities(324
1/C252billion and 38 billion respectively).
The improved economic outlook was also re-flected in the stock markets. After a tempor-ary dip in October, the stock markets in Eur-ope and particularly in Germany resumed thefavourable development observed in the pre-vious quarter and experienced extremelybuoyant growth. Price developments in theUS stock markets, on the other hand – as inthe preceding months – were somewhatmore subdued. Measured against the broadDow Jones Euro Stoxx and CDAX indices,share prices rose by 10% and 14% respect-ively compared with the beginning of Octo-ber, thereby reaching the high levels last re-corded just over 4

33prices were the predominantly positive quar-
terly corporate earnings results, speculationon acquisitions and the ongoing improve-ments of the estimates of analysts regardingcorporate profits. Despite the marked rise inshare prices, European equities, which had aprice-earnings ratio of almost 13 at the endof the period under review, still had a relative-ly low valuation in a multi-year comparison.Thus, the risk premium on equity investmentcalculated from dividend discount modelswas at a high level. Against this backdrop,the key interest rate increase of 25 basispoints at the beginning of December did nothave a noticeable dampening effect on shareprices, but seemed to be assessed as reason-able and moderate by investors. Nor did thehigh oil price and the temporary abruptslump in prices in the Japanese stock markethave a lasting effect on share prices. The ro-bust condition of the stock market was con-sistent with a virtually unchanged and, in amulti-year comparison, relatively low level ofuncertainty about further share price devel-opments.

Issuing activity in the German share marketcontinued to pick up in the fourth quarteragainst the backdrop of the favourable stockmarket developments. Listed German enter-prises issued new shares worth 35 billion,
after issuing 33 billion in the previous quarter.
This increase was due to both capital in-creases of some already listed public limitedcompanies and to several initial public offer-ings. There is also a certain degree of confi-Intensification of direct investment
flows through acquisitions andrestructuring of multinationals
In the final quarter of last year, there was a
marked revival in cross-border financial transac-tions arising from direct investment. This wasshaped by fairly large acquisitions and restructur-ing of multinationals. In some cases, however,the associated quite considerable gross flows inthe individual months cancelled each other outover the quarter. There were net capital importsof520
1/C252billion through direct investment in the
period under review, compared with net capitalexports of 53 billion in the preceding period.
The inflows of funds can be put down primarily
to foreign direct investment in Germany, whichamounted to 514 billion. An acquisition in the
banking industry accounted for a considerableproportion of this. Moreover, the acquisition,which was financed by an exchange of shares,triggered an equal amount of capital flows inopposite directions through cross-border port-folio investment. While some of the buyer’sshares were acquired by German residents, whichled to a large net acquisition of foreign shares byresidents, free-float holdings of the acquired en-terprise’s shares were transferred abroad.
1For-
eign parent companies provided their Germanaffiliates with additional funds worth 510
1/C252bil-
lion through internal group credit transactions,predominantly in the form of long-term financialloans.
German firms also engaged in buoyant direct in-
vestment at the end of the year. Various acquisi-tions in the insurance and transport sectors aswell as in tourism and the metal-working indus-try played a crucial role in this regard. By con-trast, several foreign participating interests weresold in connection with the restructuring of aGerman enterprise, which, in turn, is itself for-eign-owned. This reorganisation led to the pro-ceeds of the sale being transferred from theUnited States to the French parent company. Fur-thermore, German proprietors took out loans –predominantly short-term – from their foreignsubsidiaries. In total, German enterprises with-drew 56
1/C252billion from their affiliates abroad.
1Total net capital exports through portfolio investment
amounted to 5471/C252billion between October to Decem-
ber. Share transactions accounted for just under half ofthis.

34dence among market players that the upturn
could continue, especially as further stimulusis anticipated for the primary market from in-vestment companies such as private equityfunds. On balance, German shares were pur-chased solely via direct investments by foreigninvestors ( 319 billion). Domestic credit institu-
tions increased their share portfolio by 31
1/C252
billion, whereas domestic non-banks soldGerman equities worth 312 billion (net). This
was primarily due to an exchange of shares inconnection with a major cross-border corpor-ate acquisition (see box on page 33).
In the fourth quarter, domestic investment
companies recorded inflows to the netamount of 310
1/C252billion, which was some-
what lower than in the previous three-monthperiod ( 312
1/C252billion). On balance, the re-
sources were channelled solely to specialisedfunds which are only open to institutional in-vestors ( 314 billion), whereas mutual funds
open to the general public had to redeemshares to the value of 33
1/C252billion on balance.
Among the latter funds, the outflows affect-ed money market funds ( 33
1/C252billion) and
open-end real estate funds ( 33 billion), in par-
ticular, one of which was closed during theperiod under review. In net terms, bond-based mutual fund shares were returned foralmost 3

and mixed funds sold share units worth a net31

36Economic conditions
in GermanyUnderlying trends
The German economy experienced a lull in
growth in the last few months of 2005. Ac-cording to Federal Statistical Office figures,which are still lacking in detail, real grossdomestic product (GDP) in the final quarterof 2005 after adjustment for seasonal andworking-day variations was more or less ashigh as it had been in the preceding quarter.Owing to the high degree of volatility fromquarter to quarter, monitoring developmentsover a six-month period seems more appro-priate. In this view, the underlying pace ofeconomic growth in the second six months ofthe year showed an annualised increase inGDP of 1
1/C252% after adjustment for seasonal
and working-day variations, which was al-most the same rate of increase as in the firsthalf of the year. After elimination of working-day variations the outcome was still 1
1/C252%u p
on the year. Owing not least to the weakstart to the year, the rate of growth in overalloutput for 2005 as a whole was no morethan 1.1% after adjustment for working-dayvariations, which was the same as in 2004.As the number of working days is different,however, the unadjusted figures produce aclear decline from 1.6% in 2004 to 0.9% in2005.
According to the available data, the external
growth stimuli, which had been very strongin the third quarter of 2005, did not prevailinto the fourth quarter. Although exports,which had gained momentum during theyear, continued to increase slightly, this wasdue to the fact that a slight increase in goodsexported to countries outside the euro areaGDP

37offset the decline in exports to euro-area
partner countries. By the end of the periodunder review, however, imports were expand-ing faster than exports. The greatest increasewas in goods imported from the euro areawhereas imports from non-euro-area coun-tries stagnated. However, the sharp increasewas probably due, at least in part, to an in-creased accumulation of inventories. Further-more, the price competitiveness of Germanexporters improved again in the second halfof 2005.
Final domestic demand exerted little econom-
ic stimulus in the fourth quarter. Althoughthe generally positive course recorded forpurchases of machinery and equipment wassustained, these purchases were increasingmore moderately towards the end of theperiod under review. Construction invest-ment, which in the third quarter of 2005 hadexpanded sharply for the first time in a while,recovered further in the final quarter of theyear. Even so, the level of investment was stilldown on the year.
The increase in investment was offset by con-
tinuing restraint in households’ consumption.After seasonal and working-day adjustment,there was a further fall in private consump-tion in the fourth quarter. The sharp declinein retail sales is characteristic of this. Sales ofpetrol and diesel oil also declined betweenOctober and December. The high fuel prices,in particular, probably had reduced car travel.Purchases of heating oil were likewise re-duced because many households had alreadyreplenished their depleted stocks to someextent during the summer. Nevertheless, ex-penditure on energy rose sharply and had a
detrimental effect on the demand for othergoods. The Christmas trade did not live up toexpectations either. Only new vehicle registra-tions exceeded their moderate summer level.
According to the consumer research insti-
tution, Gesellschaft f/C252r Konsumforschung
(GfK), however, consumers’ assessment ofthe economic situation improved discerniblyduring the last few months of the year. Evi-dently in line with the frequently cited im-provement in business sentiment, householdswere also assessing the cyclical outlook andtheir income prospects much more favour-ably. At the same time, the propensity to buyincreased sharply right into January 2006.This might also reflect the intention to bringforward sizeable purchases owing to the an-

was not quite so fast as in the period be-tween July and September. Furthermore, themomentum declined in the course of thefourth quarter. Even so, year-on-year growthincreased from 3
3/C254% in the third quarter to
approximately 51/C252% between October and
December. According to the Ifo surveys, cap-acity utilisation was much greater in Decem-ber than in September. The average medium-term capacity utilisation was again exceeded.This means that investment to expand cap-acity is also more likely to benefit now from afurther increase in output than before.
Intermediate goods and capital goods
showed the greatest growth in output. Bycontrast, manufacturers of consumer goodsdid not quite repeat their good third-quarterperformance. Output in the chemical indus-try, in mechanical engineering and in com-puters rose particularly fast. However, therate of output in the motor industry and inthe manufacture of basic metals, which hadincreased discernibly in the third quarter andalmost reached capacity limits, declinedsignificantly.
Exports of German industrial products were
more subdued towards the end of the year.Exports of goods in the fourth quarter wereonly slightly up on the level of the previousperiod which had seen a rapid expansion.While deliveries of inputs and consumergoods increased marginally, those of capital2000 = 100, seasonally adjusted, quarterly

39goods barely maintained their third-quarter
level. Exports of mechanical engineeringproducts actually fell. Imports, on the otherhand, were fairly buoyant. Their value in thefourth quarter exceeded that of the periodbetween July and September by 2
3/C254% in sea-
sonally adjusted terms. Growth was consider-able in real terms, too.
The situation in the construction industry
continued to improve slowly during thefourth quarter. The level of output was againslightly up on the previous quarter, but thiswas due largely to the fairly mild weather,which lasted well into December. Althoughno general turning point was reached in thefourth quarter, a certain degree of stabilisa-tion seems to have set in. In terms of thehours worked, the decline in housebuildingwas somewhat less pronounced than it hadbeen a year earlier but was slightly greater inthe case of public sector construction. In thecase of commercial construction the declinecontinued to be largely constant. Turnover inthe finishing trade in the third quarter – thelatest quarter for which statistics are available– did not decline year on year for the firsttime for a while.
Commercial service providers continued to
benefit from the favourable developments inindustry. According to surveys conducted bythe Ifo Institute and the Centre for EuropeanEconomic Research (ZEW), corporate assess-ments of the situation generally continued toimprove somewhat during the last fewmonths of 2005. The providers of IT services,in particular, became more optimistic. Man-agement consultants, tax consultants and au-ditors were also fairly confident about the
economic situation. In the advertising sectorthe firms surveyed were again more optimis-tic towards the end of the period under re-view than they had been in the third quarter.
The cyclical improvement in trade and in the
hotel and restaurant sector did not continueduring the last few months of the year, how-ever. If measured at constant prices, turnoverin the retail trade, in particular, was down.After elimination of the usual seasonal vari-ations, business in the fourth quarter wasdown on the third quarter, and the turnoverachieved a year earlier was not regained. Thisis particularly true of shops specialising in fur-niture and fittings and household appliances.Developments in the wholesale trade weremuch more favourable, but here, too, theForeign trade by category of goods

Employment and unemployment
Employment in Germany stabilised during the
final quarter of 2005. The decline in jobs fullysubject to social security contributions seemsto have ceased for the most part. There wasonly a slight increase in the number of self-employed persons, whose significance hadpreviously risen sharply owing to the promo-tion of one-person businesses (“Me plcs”).The number of persons in low-paid part-timeemployment (mini jobs) has fallen slightlysince the middle of 2005. Although therewas a great deal of movement in the area ofsubsidised employment, little changed in theend. For example, the number of casual workopportunities for recipients of unemploymentbenefit (one-euro jobs) increased sharply wellinto the third quarter of 2005 but fell againto some extent after that. The number of per-sons benefiting from the traditional job cre-ation schemes and structural adjustmentmeasures as well as the reintegration grantsremained largely constant. According to pre-liminary estimates by the Federal StatisticalOffice, a seasonally adjusted total of 38.78million people were in employment in thefourth quarter of 2005. That was approxi-mately the same number as in the third quar-ter but 0.3% fewer than a year earlier. Itmust be remembered when interpretingthese figures, however, that the underlyingdata on developments in the number of jobsfully subject to social security contributionsand of persons in low-paid part-time employ-ment are largely to be regarded as provisionaland have frequently been revised significantlyin the past.
The number of registered unemployed per-
sons declined further in the final quarter of2005. There was a seasonally adjusted quar-ter-on-quarter fall of 130,000 persons to4.73 million.
1The unemployment rate fell
from 11.7% in the third quarter to 11.4% inthe fourth quarter. Even so, there is still a riseof 330,000 in the number of registered un-employed persons year on year. However, thisincrease is due solely to the merging of socialassistance and unemployment assistance tocreate the new “unemployment benefit II”and the associated improvement in the statis-tical capturing of social assistance for recipi-ents able to work. Without this effect, thenumber of registered unemployed personswould be below the figure a year earlier. Themore rigorous criteria to be fulfilled beforedrawing benefits and the partial cuts in bene-fits subsequently led to certain groups of indi-viduals ceasing to report to the employmentexchanges.
In January 2006 there was a seasonally ad-
justed month-on-month increase of just

August 2005 were revised in January 2006. The effect of
including persons receiving social assistance although
able to work in the case of the municipalities with separ-
ate responsibility for the unemployed in September 2005
was brought forward to the beginning of 2005. This
means that the rise in the number of unemployed per-
sons previously shown does not recur in September.Employment

41under 70,000 in the number of persons re-
ported as unemployed. However, this in-crease is probably largely the result of thevery cold winter weather since the end ofDecember. Another factor was the relativelyearly reporting date in December, whichmeant that part of the seasonal increase inunemployment was not recorded until Janu-ary. Finally, anticipatory effects probably alsoplayed a role; for example, from February thedisproportionately long entitlement to un-employment benefit I has been significantlyreduced for persons over 45 years of age. Theunemployment rate rose from 11.2% in De-cember to 11.3% in January. A year-on-yearcomparison based on the data for January2005 and including the previous recipients ofsocial assistance then recorded for the firsttime results, on the grounds of this baselineeffect, in a fall of 75,000 persons comparedwith a rise of 140,000 in December.
Wages and prices
The sectoral information so far available indi-
cates that unit labour costs in the economy asa whole continued to develop favourably inthe final quarter of 2005. In the productionsector they averaged
1/C252% less after adjust-
ment for seasonal and working-day variationsbetween October and December than theyhad done in the third quarter. Not only thegross wages and salaries per employee butalso the level of output increased sharply.Owing to the generally moderate economicgrowth in the final quarter of the year, thistrend was probably less pronounced in othersectors.Seasonally adjusted, quarterly

42In 2005 as a whole unit labour costs through-
out the economy declined by just over3/C254%.
This result was partly determined by the mod-erate growth in negotiated pay rates, whichincreased by no more than about 1% (calcu-lated on a monthly basis). A negative wagedrift reduced the increase in the compensa-tion actually paid per employee to
1/C252%. The
marginal expansion in labour costs per em-ployee is primarily the result of the increasingnumber of one-euro jobs, which in purelyarithmetical terms lowers average earnings.Another factor was that the employer’s con-tributions to the statutory health insurancescheme had been reduced by 0.45 percent-age point in mid-2005.
In 2006 there will be a large wage round in
the private sector as numerous pay agree-ments may be terminated. In addition, insome sectors the wage negotiators did notreach agreement in 2005. While individualagreements, which provide for no more thanmarginal wage increases, have since beenconcluded in the retail trade, the IG Metalltrades union is demanding pay increases of5% for the metal-working and electrical en-gineering industry under an agreement run-ning for 12 months. In the public sector therehas so far been no agreement at local andstate government level on longer workinghours like the one that has already come intoeffect for civil servants. In view of the fairlydiverse situation in the various sectors andlabour market segments, the key need is forsettlements which allow sufficient leeway fordifferentiation and flexibility.As a result of the increased prices for crudeoil and ores in the international markets, Ger-man import prices again increased consider-ably in the final quarter of 2005. In seasonallyadjusted terms the increase amounted to1.2% quarter on quarter and 5.6% on theyear. These price increases were also reflectedin German producer prices, which rose by1.3% on the quarter and 4.9% on the year.In the case of imports, the price of energy in-creased by no less than 41% year on yearand at the domestic producer level – despitea smaller share of petroleum products – by asmuch as almost 18%. Ores were about 55%more expensive than a year before. If thesecategories of goods are disregarded, pricedevelopments remained moderate. In thecase of capital goods, import prices actuallydeclined by 1.7%; in the case of consumergoods, they increased by no more than1.0%. At the producer level the increase inthe price of German capital goods was 0.7%while that of German consumer goods (withthe exception of tobacco products which hadbeen affected by tax increases) was 0.5%.
At the consumer level, too, sharp price in-
creases for energy (+12.9% year on year) andtobacco products (+13.4%) were accompan-ied by only moderate movements in the caseof other components. Food was only 0.3%more expensive on an average of the lastthree months of 2005 than it had been a yearearlier. The prices of industrial goods (exclud-ing tobacco) did not change on average. Theprices of services rose by 1.5%, and those ofhousing rents by 1.0%. In seasonally adjustedterms the basket of goods on which the con-sumer price index is based increased in price

43by1/C252% on the quarter. This corresponds to
an annualised rate of about 2.0%. Owing tothe fairly sharp price increases in the secondand third quarters of the year, the actualyear-on-year difference was somewhat great-er, at 2.2%. According to the HarmonisedIndex of Consumer Prices (HICP), prices roseby 2.3%.
The rise in prices weakened considerably at
the turn of the year. After a decline inNovember, prices remained unchanged inseasonally adjusted terms in December andJanuary. While there were particularly sharpprice reductions for industrial products in thewinter sales at the beginning of 2006, therewas a substantial increase in the prices ofelectricity and gas. At more than 3%, theprice increase for electricity was hardly anyless than it had been in those years in whichthe electricity tax had been increased. Theconsumer price index increased by 2.1%from January 2005, as did the HarmonisedIndex of Consumer Prices.
Construction prices increased by 0.3% in the
final quarter of 2005. This gives an annualisedgrowth rate of +1.3%, the fastest rate of in-crease for ten years. It was due primarily tothe sharp rise in the price of constructionsteel. The price rise in the case of housebuild-ing was somewhat less steep, at 0.9%. Reno-vation work on existing buildings actuallycame down in price. According to the Bun-desbank’s price index for residential property,which is based on data provided by Bulwien-Gesa AG, the prices of newly built dwellingstended to stagnate.

Orders received and outlook
The positive trend in industrial orders con-
tinued in the last few months of 2005. Afteradjustment for seasonal and working-dayvariations, the inflow of orders in the fourthquarter was just over 3% faster than theaverage rate in the previous three months.That is equivalent to a year-on-year increaseof 8
3/C254% compared with one of approximately
7% in the third quarter. There was also anumber of large orders again. A whole seriesof orders were placed, especially for themanufacture of other transport equipment,which includes aircraft manufacture, in par-ticular, as well as shipbuilding. These ordersdeserve special attention in that their produc-tion takes place over a lengthy period. Iforders for the manufacture of other transportequipment were eliminated from the totalorders received, however, a slight downturnin the flow of orders emerges during thefourth quarter. There is likewise a slight decel-eration in growth on the quarter if the lastthree months are considered as a whole. Thisapplies not least to foreign demand. If all sec-tors are taken into consideration, however,foreign demand in the final quarter of 2005rose by almost 4
1/C252% in seasonally adjusted
terms over the earlier three-month period. Itwas up by approximately 15% on the yearcompared with 10
1/C252% in the third quarter.
Domestic orders were again unable to keeppace with this development although they,too, were as much as 1
3/C254% higher than three
months earlier. This represents a year-on-yearincrease of 2
3/C254%.
Orders received in the construction industryin November, which is the latest month forwhich figures are available, picked up againafter a decline in October. Although the totalorders received in October and Novemberwere about 2
1/C254% down on the third quarter,
the improvement in November augurs wellfor a stabilisation in demand. After all, theyear-on-year comparison also showed a slightimprovement for the first time in quite awhile. The main reason for this was the pro-longed upturn in industrial construction. Thesteady revival in construction which had beenobserved since the second quarter of 2005continued in both October and November.Housebuilding orders will probably benefit in2000 = 100, annual averages, log scale

to home buyers. At all events, the rate atwhich building permits were granted in No-vember rose substantially in seasonally adjust-ed terms. Work began on the construction ofsingle-family houses in particular.
Towards the end of the period under review
commercial service providers were fairly opti-mistic about the future. According to surveysconducted by the Ifo Institute and studiesundertaken by Reuters, business expectationsbrightened considerably at the end of 2005and the beginning of 2006. The Centre forEuropean Economic Research (ZEW) reportedthat telecommunications was the sector witha particularly large majority of firms that wereoptimistic about future demand. However,management consultants and tax and exter-nal auditors were not far behind.
By contrast, the prospects for retailers will
probably continue to be subdued for the timebeing. The reason is that the burdens whichhousehold are having to bear, not least be-cause of the high and in some cases still risingenergy prices, will limit their scope for pur-chasing other goods and services. Even so,surveys by the GfK show that there is a great-er willingness on the part of consumers tobuy. More than anything else, this is probablya reflection of some consumers’ intention tobring forward major purchases owing to theincrease in value added tax announced for2007.

46movement in overall output in the fourth
quarter of 2005 is not a sign of a lasting cyc-lical downturn. Instead, the continuing ro-bustness of the global economy and the Ger-man economy’s vigorous participation in therapidly progressing international division oflabour suggest a continuation of the risingcyclical trend. Owing to the substantial in-crease in the utilisation of industrial produc-tion capacity, this will probably also bring anincreasing boost to investment in machineryand equipment. Given the emerging bottom-ing-out in construction investment, it is hardlylikely to pose a further threat to overall eco-nomic growth. The confidence of householdscould be strengthened by the stabilising ofemployment subject to regular social securitycontributions and a reduction in unemploy-ment. Only gradual success can be expectedhere, however, especially as the substantialburdens posed by energy prices are likely topersist.

47Public financesGeneral government budget
The public finance situation in Germany im-
proved slightly in 2005. According to initial,provisional data, the general governmentdeficit amounted to 3.5% of GDP .
1This is
slightly down on the previous year’s deficit(3.7%) and markedly lower than had beenexpected by the Federal Government andother observers. As the relatively favourablebudgetary developments at the end of theyear have probably not yet been fully incorp-orated into the preliminary result, a furtherslight downward revision of the deficit is pos-sible. Nevertheless, the 3% ceiling for thedeficit ratio enshrined in the Maastricht Treatywas overshot for the fourth year in succes-sion. The debt ratio, which has exceeded thereference value to an increasing degree for anumber of years, grew again considerably.
The general economic situation placed a mar-
ginally greater strain on the governmentbudgets than it had done in 2004, while, onbalance, temporary effects had almost no im-pact on the deficits. Overall, the structural fis-cal balance, ie adjusted for cyclical and othertemporary effects, improved slightly.
At 43
1/C254%, the revenue ratio remained largely
unchanged in 2005.2As in previous years,
gross wages and salaries – the assessment
basis for wage tax and social security contribu-tions – developed less strongly than GDP and

48this, in particular, had a dampening effect.
Moreover, shortfalls in consequence of thefinal stage of the income tax reform had a fargreater impact than revenue-boosting meas-ures elsewhere (profit-related taxes, tobaccotax, motor vehicle tax). Finally, consumer re-straint in response to higher energy prices de-pressed receipts from mineral oil tax, which isa volume-based tax. By contrast, profit-relatedtax receipts and other revenue developed fa-vourably. Subsidy repayments from the Lan-desbanks and, in particular, the motorwaytolls for heavy goods vehicles that were intro-duced last year played a significant role in thepositive development of other revenue.
In 2005, expenditure in relation to GDP de-
creased slightly to 46
3/C254%. As in the past few
years, spending on compensation of employ-ees and government investment fell in abso-lute terms. Moreover, there was scarcely anyincrease in expenditure on pensions. Finally,despite rapidly growing government debt,interest expenditure remained almost un-changed as the low level of interest rates con-tinued to facilitate favourable refinancingterms for matured securities. On the otherhand, healthcare expenditure and transfers tothe EU budget went up considerably. Therewas also a significant rise in labour-market re-lated expenditure. Both the unfavourable em-ployment trend and – contrary to original ex-pectations – the labour market reforms placedstrains on government budgets. The year-on-year increase in additional expenditure by gen-eral government was, however, far surpassedby the scale to which central government ex-ceeded its budgetary plans, the latter havingrecently been the focus of public debate.The revenue ratio could fall slightly in 2006even though, in net terms, no further cuts intaxes and social security contributions areplanned for this year in contrast to previousyears. Non-tax revenue is likely to decline asthe positive exceptional effects experiencedin this area in 2005 will no longer be felt. Theweak trend in wages and salaries subject tosocial security contributions is also likely tocontinue. As things now stand, given thatcontribution rates look set to remain almostunchanged, social security contributions maybe expected to stagnate. The bringing for-ward of the transfer deadline for social secur-ity contributions will not influence the defin-ition in the national accounts, which meansthat the absence of real consolidation meas-ures will have a marked negative impact here.
The expenditure ratio could be reduced per-
ceptibly in 2006 if a more economical coursewere pursued at all levels of government.Compensation of employees could, in turn,play a role here, particularly as spending inthis area might decline further given con-tinued staff cuts. There will also be only alimited increase in pension expenditure as amid-year rise in the pension rate is not ex-pected. In contrast to last year, labour-marketrelated expenditure could go down. Interestexpenditure will continue to be restrained byfavourable refinancing conditions.
All in all, a decline in the general government
deficit can be expected this year providedstringent budget management is exercisedand no new measures are introduced whichwould place a strain on public finances. Themeasures which were outlined under the co-

49alition deal and have since been specified in
detail should place only a slight burden ongovernment budgets. Moreover, a restrainedexpenditure course is planned across theboard. The momentum of economic activityshould have a positive effect on the develop-ment of public finances. While, overall, only amoderate decline in the structural budgetdeficit can be expected in the absence of fur-ther relief measures, compliance with the 3%ceiling could be achieved this year.
Against the backdrop of the European rules,
the overshooting of the fiscal upper limitsevery year since 2002, the progress towardsmeeting the 3% criterion in 2005 and the fa-vourable cyclical outlook, every effort shouldbe made to comply with the deficit referencevalue in 2006. This is all the more urgent nowthat the amended Stability and Growth Pactprescribes that countries with an excessivedeficit must achieve annual structural consoli-dation of at least 0.5% of GDP – somethingwhich has been emphasised as an importantnew aspect of the Pact. The current economicoutlook poses no obstacles to a more evenspread of the deficit reduction measures,which, at the moment, are not planned until2007. If it does not make sufficient efforts,Germany may be faced with a tightening ofthe excessive deficit procedure.
Compliance with the 3% c eiling will, however,
by no means dispense with the need for fur-
ther consolidation. On the contrary, the Euro-pean and national budgetary rules require aswift reduction of the deficit beyond this mark.Both the Stability and Growth Pact and theGerman Budget Principles Act specify the obli-gation to achieve a close-to-balance budgetand the Pact prescribes a further annual struc-tural consolidation of 0.5% of GDP until thistarget is achieved. Moreover, even once themeasures outlined in the coalition agreementhave been implemented, central governmentand some state governments will still have totake additional measures beyond 2007 in orderto comply with the constitutional budgetaryprinciples. Ultimately, a reduction in the deficitand debt ratios is also essential if Germany is tobe in a better position to tackle future budget-ary burdens, particularly in the light of demo-graphic developments. As well as boostingpublic confidence in a fun ctioning fiscal policy,
this would also create the scope to enable theautomatic stabilisers to take effect during eco-nomic slowdowns. If, however, consolidationefforts were to be scaled back now in the ex-pectation of additional revenue as a result ofthe more favourable economic outlook, thiswould, among other things, run counter toone of the most fundamental intentions behindthe amended Stability and Growth pact, name-ly to step up the consolidation efforts duringmore favourable macroeconomic phases.

growth of 31% in revenue from assessedtaxes and a 3% increase in turnover tax re-ceipts. This was, however, accompanied by afall in revenue from wage tax (-4
1/C252%) and
mineral oil tax (-31/C252%), in particular.
In 2005 as a whole, tax receipts grew by1
1/C252%( + 36 billion), which was the first signifi-
cant increase since 2000. Revenue from as-sessed taxes increased by 41% (+ 37
1/C252billion)
not least as a result of the favourable businessearnings trend. Receipts from assessed in-come tax were up by 81% (+ 34
1/C252billion).
This was due, firstly, to an increase in grossrevenue despite the tax rate cut in 2005.Other factors included the decline – in par-ticular, as a result of the measures introducedwith the Act Accompanying the 2004 Budget– in grants paid out to home owners (- 3
1/C252bil-
lion) and the reduction in rebates to employ-ees (- 32
1/C252billion), which are both deducted
from cash receipts from assessed income tax.Corporation tax receipts grew by 24
1/C252%( + 33
billion), which is probably due in part to thelegislative measures taken to stabilise corpor-ation tax revenue levels. Income from wagetax went down by 4% (- 35 billion) in the
wake of a slight decrease in gross wages andsalaries. This was due largely to the tax cutsalthough they appear to have had less of animpact than initially expected. Among theconsumption-related taxes, revenue fromturnover tax rose by just over 1
1/C252%( + 321/C252
billion) in the context of a weakly growingVAT assessment base. Mineral oil tax receiptswent down by 4% (- 31
1/C252billion) owing to a
fall in petrol consumption. By contrast, to-bacco tax increases led to a rise of just over4
1/C252%( + 31/C252billion) in revenue from this
source despite the persistent decline in con-sumption. A significant rise of 12% (+ 31 bil-
lion) in motor vehicle tax revenue was record-ed as tax breaks for low-pollutant passengervehicles expired.
Overall, tax revenue (including estimated fig-
ures for local government taxes) was roughly31 billion higher than the official estimate in
November 2004. The highly volatile profit-related taxes were, on balance, far higherthan had been estimated. The significantmargin of error with regard to the assessmentbase, the assessment lag and the impact ofchanges in tax legislation played a role in this,while the marked decline in rebates to em-ployees, which are deducted from assessedincome tax revenue, also surpassed expect-Year-on-year change

51ations. By contrast, revenue from wage tax
and the most significant consumption-relatedtaxes was less than had been forecast, mainlyowing to the poor development of the assess-ment bases. The last official estimate fromNovember 2005 was exceeded by + 33 billion.
This was due largely to the strong growth inprofit-related tax receipts in December. Theoverall tax ratio rose slightly to 20.1%.
In 2006, the net impact of changes to tax le-
gislation is likely to be fairly small. On the onehand, changes in tax law which were agreedin the preceding legislative periods are grad-ually having a revenue-boosting effect. Onthe other hand, measures approved orplanned since the change of government will,on balance, place additional strains on gov-ernment budgets. It is true that some ofthese measures are aimed at broadening the
assessment base for direct taxes and reducingor abolishing tax concessions. However, therevenue trend in 2006 will be dominated bythe creation of new and the expansion ofexisting tax concessions. It is hoped that thiswill have a beneficial effect on economicgrowth. However, it is questionable whetherthis can really improve the underlying eco-nomic conditions and, indeed, whether it isappropriate for the government to be takingaction motivated by reasons of economic pol-icy, particularly in the light of the decidedlyfavourable economic outlook for this year. Itis all the more questionable given that the ul-timate aim is to achieve a more simple, trans-parent and efficient tax system.Total tax revenue and receipts from major individual taxes

52All in all, in 2006, it is to be expected that the
tax revenue-yielding assessment bases (grosswages and salaries and modified domestic ex-penditure) will develop more positively thanin 2005 and that the adjustments in the con-sumption of mineral oil products will not leadto another significant decline in revenue frommineral oil tax. Even if there is weaker growthin profit-related tax receipts, there will prob-ably be a further rise in overall revenue. Themost recent official estimate predicts an in-crease of 2.1% and a largely unchanged over-all tax ratio. However, the additional meas-ures announced so far are likely to curb rev-enue growth by almost
1/C252percentage point.
Central government budget
Central government recorded a surplus of
361/C252billion in the fourth quarter of 2005
compared with just over 371/C252billion in the
same period of 2004. Despite an increase ofjust under 1
1/C252% in tax revenue, overall rev-
enue was down by more than1/C252% on the
final quarter of 2004 when extensive assetdisposals had been recorded. Expenditurerose by 1%. Spending in connection with theHartz IV reform remained well above compar-able outlays in the previous year. However,following the securitisation of Post Officepension fund claims, the cessation of pay-ments to offset this fund’s deficit resulted inan extensive reduction in spending. In add-ition, relief was provided by the improved fi-nancial position of the Federal EmploymentAgency and the relatively small Federal grantto the statutory pension insurance schemeafter parts of the grant had been paid out inadvance in September as liquidity assistance.
According to the preliminary outturn, in 2005
the central government deficit, at 331
1/C252bil-
lion, was more than 38 billion less than in
2004. This was largely owing to the use ofcentral government assets and the sale ofPost Office pension fund claims to provideadditional relief of almost 312 billion on the
previous year’s position. Although the deficitof just under 322
1/C252billion envisaged in the
2005 budget plan was significantly overshot,the result was more positive than the FederalGovernment had latterly indicated. A deficitof roughly 335 billion had been predicted, in
particular, in the light of an 38
1/C252billion
budget overshoot in connection with theHartz IV reform, the 32 billion revenue short-
fall predicted in the last tax estimate and thefact that the Bundesbank profit fell short ofthe budgeted figure by almost 31
1/C252billion.
Ultimately, however, the smaller top-up grantrequired by the Federal Employment Agency,lower interest payments and much smallertax revenue shortfalls provided perceptible re-lief and resulted in a more favourable full-year outturn.
On 22 February, the Federal Cabinet is due to
approve the revised draft of the 2006 budget.So far, no precise figures have been pub-lished. The deficit of nearly 322 billion envis-
aged in the government draft from July 2005is likely to be increased considerably to some-where in the region of 338 billion and 339 bil-
lion. Evidently, the main reason for this is asignificant reduction in estimates for assetdisposals – as the latter are now to be distrib-Further revenue

53uted more evenly across the entire new legis-
lative period – in contrast to the original plansfrom summer 2005. This is compoundedby additional burdens from higher-than-projected expenditure on unemploymentbenefit II and ongoing contributions to localgovernment towards accommodation costsfor benefit recipients. Moreover, the growthpackage, which was finalised in January, willincrease the strain. More intensive promotionof renovation measures to reduce CO
2emis-
sions in buildings, greater investment in trans-port systems and increased backing for re-search, as well as tax shortfalls resulting fromplanned measures for stimulating economicgrowth, are likely to increase the deficit in the2006 Federal budget. On the other hand, acertain counterweight is provided by themore favourable basic situation concerningtax revenue and interest payments. The coali-tion agreements also envisage savings in ad-ministrative costs to be financed mainly bycutting Christmas bonuses but also by ex-tending weekly working hours for Federalcivil servants. While the Federal Government’splanned adjustments to the Hartz IV reformare intended to provide relief of 33 billion for
the Federal budget in 2006, it now seems un-likely that this can be achieved given thedelays in implementing these amendments.
All in all, a significant overshooting of the
constitutional upper limits for new borrowingpursuant to article 115 of the Basic Law nowappears unavoidable. Such a breach is prob-lematic in the light of the widely expectedbuoyant cyclical trend. The need for fiscalconsolidation by central government is fur-ther underscored by the fact that sizeableasset disposals are to some extent masking
the structural financing deficit. It should notbe overlooked that even if the 3% criterionprescribed by the Maastricht Treaty is met,considerable further efforts will be requiredto achieve structural compliance with theconstitutional borrowing limits.
The Federal special funds recorded a much
higher surplus of 34 billion in 2005 (2004: 32
billion). This was due largely to the fact thatloan repayments to the ERP Special Fund out-weighed new loans by far more than theyhad done in 2004. A surplus could be gener-ated this year, too.€b n

54State government and local government
budgets
In the fourth quarter of 2005, state govern-
ment recorded a deficit of 36 billion com-
pared with 341/C252billion in the fourth quarter
of 2004. In 2005 as a whole, the deficitamounted to just over 324 billion. This was
less than the previous year’s figure of 325 bil-
lion – in contradiction with the most recentplans, which had envisaged an increase. Withan increase of 2%, overall revenue grewmore sharply than the tax revenue of stategovernment (
1/C252%). This was due mainly to
higher income from subsidy repayments fromLandesbanks and extensive asset disposals.Expenditure rose by almost 1
1/C252%. While com-
pensation of employees declined, there was anotable rise in other spending, which wasprobably largely the result of the recapitalisa-tion of state-owned enterprises.
For the most part, the current plans for 2006
do not yet reflect the better result of 2005,which should provide a positive baseline ef-fect for this year. A total deficit of roughly323
1/C252billion is envisaged with a slight reduc-
tion in spending which, however, on balancemerely reflects the discontinuance of capitalinjections to state-owned enterprises. Whilesome state governments have already pre-sented adjustments to these plans, they ap-pear to be restricted to an extrapolation ofthe favourable developments in 2005. Manystate governments are still finding it difficultto observe the constitutional limits for newborrowing or, in the case of the east Germanstates, are often unable to demonstrate, asrequired, that special supplementary Federalgrants are being used to ease burdens result-ing from the former partition of Germany.Thus, a more significant reduction of the highstate deficits should be aimed at, particularlyin view of the more positive cyclical trendnow expected.
For local government, figures are currently
available only for the first three quarters of2005.
4The 31 billion year-on-year decline in
the deficit recorded during this period couldbe even higher in the last quarter given theexpected ongoing sharp growth in revenuefrom local business tax. Thus, the annual re-sult could be significantly more favourablethan that of 2004 (- 34 billion).Net borrowing in the market by

Statutory pension insurance schemeIn 2005, the surplus usually recorded in the
pension insurance scheme in the fourth quar-ter – as a result of contributions on bonusespaid at the end of the year – was, at justunder 31 billion, considerably less than in the
previous year ( 34 billion). The result in the
fourth quarter of 2004 had, however, beendistorted by the sale of the GAGFAH housingcompany which produced a one-off revenuewindfall of 32 billion. Furthermore, in the
third quarter of 2005 Federal grants amount-ing to almost 31 billion had to be paid out in
advance to cover current expenditure. Rev-enue from contributions increased by
1/C254%,
which was a notable improvement on thetrend throughout the earlier part of the year.Following the waiver of the pension adjust-ment in mid-2005, spending on pensionsrose by only
1/C252%. This increase was due en-
tirely to the rise in the number of persons re-ceiving pensions. By contrast, savings weremade on contributions paid by the statutorypension insurance scheme to the statutoryhealth insurance scheme for pensioners be-cause, since 1 July 2005, pensioners – as wellas employees – now pay a special contribu-tion of 0.9%.
In 2005 as a whole, there was a deficit of just
over 34 billion. Even allowing for the effect of
the sale of GAGFAH in 2004, this signifies adiscernible deterioration. At the end of theyear, the reserves amounted to just 0.11month’s expenditure and thus fell well shortof their minimum level of 0.2 month’s ex-penditure. This indicates that the contributionrate of 19.5% was not high enough. To avoidraising the contribution rate in 2006, employ-ers are now obliged to transfer social securitycontributions on earnings paid at the end ofthe month earlier than before. This meansthat, in most cases, 13 rather than 12 month-ly contributions will be paid. For example, thecontributions for December 2006 will be re-ceived and posted to the accounts at the endof that month (instead of mid-January 2007),thus inflating the reserve.
The resulting one-off improvement in the
budgetary balance does not negate the needfor comprehensive reform measures. In orderto curb the levy burden in the future, a swiftrise in the statutory retirement age appearsessential, although, given the rising life ex-Quarterly

56pectancy, more extensive measures would
also seem necessary in the long term, at least.A longer working life increases economic out-put and improves the financial situation of allpublic sector budgets and ultimately ofhouseholds, too. Furthermore, the FederalGovernment is planning an early decision onthe development of the statutory retirementage, which will create a reliable planningbasis for both employees and employers andprovide a clear signal about the urgent needto increase the participation of older personsin the labour force. The relief will, however,be limited by the fact that persons who havepaid contributions for 45 years will still be en-titled to claim a full pension at the age of 65.Thus, in the case of individuals who have con-tributed the same amount, some of themwould receive preferential treatment simplybecause their contributions had been paid inover a longer period. Exceptions would, as arule, reduce the financial effectiveness and re-quire higher contribution rates.
Federal Employment Agency
In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Federal Em-
ployment Agency recorded a deficit of 32
1/C252
billion, which was almost 311/C252billion higher
than in the same period of 2004. The im-provement was partly due to a slight increasein revenue from contributions. The decisivefactor behind this, however, was the sharperdecline in expenditure on unemploymentbenefit (-12%) at the end of the reportingperiod, largely owing to the significant de-cline in the number of recipients. In additionto this, substantial savings were made in thearea of active labour-market policy measures,although these were related to the fact thatresponsibility for financing payments in fa-vour of recipients of unemployment benefit IIwas shifted to central government. The com-pensatory amount paid in return by the Fed-eral Employment Agency was far less thanthe savings made on active labour marketpolicy in the final quarter.Quarterly

57In 2005 as a whole, the Federal Employment
Agency required a top-up grant from the cen-tral government budget of only 3
1/C252billion in
contrast to the 34 billion provided for in the
budget plan. This can be attributed both tothe more positive financial trends in un-employment benefit and active labour-market policy measures. Moreover, the com-pensatory amount payable to central govern-ment was more than 32 billion less than
planned.
The 2006 budget plan of the Federal Employ-
ment Agency envisages a surplus of almost32 billion. This is based mainly on a sharp rise
in revenue from contributions as well as fur-ther savings expected in connection with un-employment benefit. As in the case of thestatutory pension insurance scheme, a con-siderable one-off revenue increase of almostone month’s contribution receipts is expectedin consequence of the earlier transfer of so-cial security contributions. The plan is to usethese reserves in 2007 to help finance a cut inthe contribution rate from 6.5% to 4.5%.Further savings are to be achieved byshortening the maximum period of entitle-ment to unemployment benefit to 12 months(18 months for persons aged 55 and over) forindividuals who register as unemployed after31 January 2006. The deficit to be covered in2007 will be balanced by grants from centralgovernment. According to the Federal Gov-ernment, this will necessitate roughly 1 per-centage point of the planned increase in thestandard rate of VAT.Statutory health insurance scheme andlong-term care insurance scheme
5
In all likelihood, the statutory health insur-ance institutions will have recorded a far lessfavourable outturn in 2005 than in the previ-ous year. The positive balance of 34 billion
achieved in 2004 may have fallen to half thisamount. The “Act improving cost-efficiencyin pharmaceuticals supply”
6is now intended
to curb pharmaceutical expenditure, whichsaw a particularly sharp rise in 2005.
Despite a number of relief measures – the
additional contribution for childless personsand increased revenue from contributions asa result of the Hartz IV reform – the statutorylong-term care insurance scheme is likely tohave remained in deficit in 2005 albeit to alesser extent than in 2004. Thus, the reserves,which had stood at 33
1/C252billion at the end of
2004, will have diminished further. This in-creases the pressure for reforms in this area,too.
5The financial development of the statutory health and
long-term care insurance schemes is analysed in greater
detail in the short articles of the Bundesbank Monthly Re-
port of December 2005.
6In addition to a two-year price moratorium on all
pharmaceuticals and an additional 10% discount on theprice of generic drugs, manufacturers are to be prohibit-
ed from providing pharmacists with additional pharma-
ceuticals for sale purposes at no extra cost and the fixed-
price regulation is to be tightened up.Grant required
