Industry
Industrial activity continued at a rapid pace
after the turn of 2006-07. After adjustment
for seasonal and calendar effects, output in
February increased by3/C254% on the month. On
an average of the two-month period of Janu-
ary and February, output was 2% up on the
average of the fourth quarter of 2006. The
pace of growth in January and February was
therefore even somewhat faster than in the
final quarter of 2006, when the increase had
been 11/C252%. There was also a year-on-year in-
crease from 63/C254% in the fourth quarter to
8% in January and February. In particular, the
capital goods sector expanded its output.
In February, new orders were 4% up on Janu-
ary, when there had been a slight decline in
demand. The increase in the first two months
of the year was 21/C254% up on the fourth-
quarter average. On the whole, new orders
seem to be picking up again after settling at a
high level in the final quarter of 2006. The
most significant increase in orders placed
with German enterprises came from foreign
customers. The greatest rise was in the de-
mand for capital goods.
There was a slight increase in retail sales (ex-
cluding cars) in February. Nevertheless, this
was not enough to offset the decline record-
ed in January due to the effects of the in-
crease in VAT. There was a drop in house-
holds’ demand for cars in the first quarter of
2007.Output

6The seasonally adjusted value of exports of
goods in February was 2% up on the month.
On an average of the two-month period of
January and February, this represents a de-
cline of1/C252% on the final quarter of 2006,
when the export figures had been boosted by
late reports. By contrast, nominal imports, at
51/C252%, showed a substantial increase in Feb-
ruary. This, however, has to be seen against
the backdrop of the marked decline in Janu-
ary due to the effects of the VAT increase. In
the January-February period, the increase was
23/C254%. The trade surplus went down by
32 billion in February to a seasonally adjusted
3133/C254billion.
Construction
Construction output rose by just under 1% in
February. Given the marked increase in Janu-
ary, the average of the January-February
period was 53/C254% up on the fourth-quarter
figure. This positive outcome was also due to
the exceptionally mild weather conditions.
Sharp growth in output was achieved in both
general building and civil engineering work.
Economy as a whole
According to the available indicators, the cyc-
lical upturn in the German economy con-
tinued in the first quarter of 2007. As expect-
ed, however, the sharp rise in real GDP at the
end of 2006 is likely to have slowed down in
seasonally and working-day adjusted terms.
Major positive stimuli were generated by the
industrial sector, which significantly stepped
up its output again. On the demand side, the
underlying trend in exports continued on anEconomic conditions in Germany*

7upward course. Given that imports are likely
to have been growing more sharply at thesame time, exports made a negative contribu-tion to growth in purely mathematical terms.Investment activity remained buoyant. Thisapplies to machinery and equipment as wellas construction activity, which benefited fromthe mild weather conditions. As enterprisesalso built up their inventories, macroeconom-ic growth was also supported by the waystocks were managed. However, owing tothe drop in traditional retail sales and theslump in the number of car purchases – bothof which were connected with the VAT in-crease at the beginning of the year –household expenditure considerably dampen-ed GDP growth.
Labour marketThe labour market developed quite favour-
ably in February as well. According to initialestimates by the Federal Statistical Office, thenumber of persons in work stood at 39.44million. This was 30,000 more than in Januaryand 571,000 more than 12 months previous-ly. According to initial estimates by the Fed-eral Employment Agency, the number of em-ployees subject to social security contribu-tions, at 109,000, increased very sharply inJanuary. By contrast, the number of “minijobs” continued to fall. The scale ofgovernment-assisted forms of employmentbarely changed in March. As in February,there was a decline in the number of job va-cancies in March. This, however, is still a re-flection of the changes in the method of re-cording seasonal job vacancies, whereas va-cancies for “normal” jobs again showed an
increase.
There was a further perceptible decline in the
official unemployment figure in March. At aseasonally adjusted 3.83 million, there wereapproximately 869,000 fewer persons regis-tered as unemployed than 12 months previ-ously. The seasonally adjusted unemploymentrate stood at 9.2%, compared with 9.3% inFebruary. The reduction in unemploymentwas favoured not only by the strong pace ofeconomic activity in the first quarter, but alsoby the mild weather conditions and the de-clining labour supply.
PricesPrices in the international crude oil markets in
March were perceptibly higher than in Febru-ary. At US$62
1/C252, the spot quotation for a bar-
rel of Brent North Sea oil was 61/C252%u po nt h e
average of the previous month. This was duemainly to declining stocks in the USA andgreater geopolitical uncertainties. As this re-port went to press, the spot price stood at ap-proximately US$65
1/C252. However, futures con-
tracts did not rise as strongly as the spotprice. The premium on mid-term futures con-tracts (6 months) was being quoted atUS$2
1/C252, and US$4 in the case of long-term
contracts (18 months).
Seasonally adjusted industrial producer prices
in March were 0.2% up on the month. Thiswas due, first and foremost, to the furtherrise in energy prices. Owing to the fact thatthere had been even greater upward pressureEmploymentInternational oil

8on prices at the beginning of 2006, the year-
on-year figure went down to +2.5%.
Seasonally adjusted consumer prices rose by
0.3% in March. There was a sharp rise in fuel
prices, and heating oil became somewhat
more expensive. The prices of services also in-
creased somewhat, partly as a result of the
additional delayed adjustments to the higher
rate of VAT. By contrast, goods prices (exclud-
ing energy) were unchanged. The annual rate
of change in consumer price inflation (CPI)
was 1.9%, compared with 1.6% in February.
The year-on-year rate of increase in the Har-
monised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)
went up from 1.9% to 2.0%.
Public finances
Local government finances
According to the most recent figures from
the Federal Statistical Office, local govern-
ment posted a surplus of 321/C252billion in the
final quarter of 2006 compared with 311/C252bil-
lion one year before. The main factor in this
was an increase in revenue of almost 21/C252%,
which, however, was considerably less than in
the preceding quarters. As before, the
growth in tax receipts (+81/C252%), although re-
duced, played the decisive role. By contrast,
proceeds from asset realisations were nearly
one-fifth lower than in the fourth quarter of
2005.
Expenditure in the final quarter matched the
prior-year level. There were clear savings on
municipal benefits for the long-term un-employed (primarily accommodation costs).
Overall, payments fell by 7%, evidently partly
as a result of tighter rules for granting bene-
fits, whereby this easing on the cost side was
concentrated on local governments in west-
ern Germany. By contrast, a small increase of
just over1/C252% was recorded in personnel ex-
penditure. Investment in fixed assets grew far
more strongly by almost 8%, although in this
case, too, there were clear differences be-
tween the individual states. Whereas such
spending increased in Thuringia, Baden-
W/C252rttemberg and Bavaria by at least 15%,
Saxony-Anhalt, in particular, but also North-
Rhine/Westphalia and Hesse once again re-
corded decreases in fixed asset formation. On
the one hand, the overall observed expansion
of local authority investment can be attrib-
uted to the general improvement in the fi-
nancial situation. On the other hand, it may
also have resulted from bringing forward
planned investment projects so as to forestall
the increase in the standard rate of turnover
tax.
In 2006 as a whole, local government record-
ed a surplus of almost 33 billion, after run-
ning up a deficit of almost 321/C252billion in the
preceding year. Key to this turnaround was
an increase in revenue of 5%, which on bal-
ance was almost entirely due to an increase in
tax receipts of 121/C252% or just over 361/C252billion.
Local business tax made the most significant
contribution to this with net revenue in-
creases of just over 201/C252% or almost 35 bil-
lion, although the corresponding revenue
trend in eastern Germany was somewhat
muted on the whole. The growth in receipts

9whole year, reflected, above all, increased
transfers for municipal benefits for the long-term unemployed, was likewise perceptiblystronger in western Germany, where it wentup by 3%, than in eastern Germany (+
1/C252%).
On balance, there was also a noticeable over-all increase in revenue in eastern Germany,thanks chiefly to the substantial proceedsgenerated by the sale of an equity interest be-longing to the city of Dresden. By contrast,the capital proceeds of west German localgovernment fell markedly, meaning that intheir case this item contributed very little toimproving the national annual result.
Expenditure increased by 1
1/C252% over the year
as a whole. Although personnel expenditurefell by 1% (almost 3
1/C252billion), this constitutes
no direct saving if it was mainly due to thehiving-off of entities from the core budgets,thus necessitating in future the payment ofcompensatory local government grants or thepurchase of corresponding services from thirdparties. The underlying development cannotbe read off the figures directly as an increaseof 3% or almost 31 billion in other operating
expenses (which includes bought-in services)was accompanied by a decrease in grants toenterprises of just over 3
1/C252billion. Despite the
slight easing at the end of the year, municipalbenefits for the long-term unemployed stillshowed a strong overall jump of 11
1/C252%.
Fixed asset formation increased for the firsttime since 1999. At 2
1/C252%, however, this was
relatively modest and, besides, was concen-trated on individual states.
The sizeable budget surplus still did not lead
to a decline in the overall indebtedness oflocal government, possibly due to the expan-
sion of reserves. While local government didmanage to reduce its budgetary debt by 32
billion, the volume of outstanding cash ad-vances increased far more strongly by a fur-ther 33
1/C252billion to just over 3271/C252billion.
This meant that this form of liabilities, whichis actually intended exclusively to bridge tran-sitory liquidity shortages, constituted almostone-quarter of total local government debton average last year. The necessary contain-ment and reduction of these loans meansthat, despite the overall budget surplus andfavourable outlook for the fiscal balance, nu-merous local authorities will be required tomake substantial further efforts to consoli-date their finances – including and indeed es-pecially during economic upswings.€b n

10Securities markets
Bond market
In February 2007, debt securities with a mar-
ket value of 3100.8 billion were issued in the
German bond market. Net of high redemp-
tions, and after taking account of changes in
issuers’ holdings of their own bonds, net sales
of domestic bonds came to 39.6 billion, com-
pared with 331.7 billion in January. In add-
ition, foreign bonds worth 319.7 billion were
purchased in the German market. Overall,
the amount of resources raised on the Ger-
man market from the sales of domestic and
foreign debt securities reached 329.3 billion,
compared with 359.8 in January.
Among domestic debtors, credit institutions
once again accounted for the majority of bor-
rowing in the German capital market ( 38.5
billion). Most activity was focused on the sale
of other bank debt securities, which can be
structured flexibly ( 39.9 billion). Special credit
institutions raised 33.6 billion net from sales
of their own debt securities. By contrast, the
volume of public Pfandbriefe and mortgage
Pfandbriefe outstanding went down by 32.3
billion and 32.7 billion respectively.
In February, domestic enterprises issued own
debt securities to the amount of 32.4 billion
net. As in January, they only sold commercial
paper on balance, while reducing their debt
arising from longer-term corporate bonds by
30.5 billion.
In February, the public sector reduced the
outstanding volume of its own debt securitesby31.3 billion. Central government tapped
the capital market by 31.0 billion. In line with
its issuance calendar, central government also
redeemed five-year Federal notes (Bobls)
worth 316.0 billion net. At the same time, it
issued ten-year and 30-year Federal Bonds
(Bunds) worth 39.1 billion and 32.9 billion re-
spectively. It increased its short-term borrow-
ing mainly through two-year Federal Treasury
notes (Sch/C228tze) to the value of 32.7 billion. A
limited quantity of Federal Treasury financing
paper and Federal savings notes was also sold
(30.1 billion in both cases). State government
reduced its capital market borrowing in Feb-
ruary by 30.2 billion.
Domestic non-banks were the main pur-
chasers of debt securities in February, acquir-
ing paper from domestic and non-resident
borrowers to the amount of 37.3 billion and
36.7 respectively. By contrast, bond purchases
by domestic credit institutions primarily con-
sisted of foreign paper ( 312.9 billion). These
institutions simultaneously reduced their
holdings of domestic bonds by 32.9 billion. In
the month under review, non-resident invest-
ors increased their German bond portfolios
by35.2 billion. This was achieved by exclu-
sively acquiring interest-bearing paper worth
316.4 billion net issued by private borrowers.
Equity market
In the domestic equity market, German enter-
prises issued new shares with a market value
of31.0 billion, having already disposed of
31.9 billion worth of domestic shares in Janu-
ary. Furthermore, for the first time since No-
vember, shares issued by non-residents wereSales of debt

11again being bought in Germany ( 34.2 billion),
primarily by domestic banks ( 38.4 billion).
This contrasted with domestic non-banks,
which reduced their investment in foreign se-
curities by 34.1 billion net. The greatest inter-
est in domestic shares was demonstrated by
foreign investors. German non-banks likewise
invested in domestic shares ( 34.9 billion),
whereas domestic credit institutions sold
equities to the value of 312.1 billion.
Mutual fund shares
In February, there were inflows of 34.7 billion
to domestic mutual funds from sales of their
own shares, which was less than in January
(35,9 billion). The bulk of these funds ( 33.6
billion) flowed into specialised funds which
are open only to institutional investors. Mu-
tual funds open to the general public raised
31.0 billion from the sale of their own shares,
having recorded no additional net inflows in
January. Open-end real estate funds and
mixed funds each raised funds amounting to
30.8 billion. Likewise, mixed securities-based
funds and equity funds, which had previously
experienced outflows, were able to sell a
modest amount of shares in February ( 30.4
billion and 30.2 billion respectively). This con-
trasted with German bond-based funds,
which suffered renewed outflows (- 30.5 bil-
lion), and commercial funds, which were simi-
larly affected (- 30.3 billion). Foreign mutual
funds, on the other hand, sold own fund
shares in the German capital market for 37.8
billion, which was much the same amount as
in January.In February, domestic non-banks were again
the main purchasers of German mutual fund
shares ( 33.3 billion). They also added 34.9 bil-
lion worth of foreign mutual fund shares to
their portfolios. On balance, German credit
institutions invested 30.7 billion in shares of
domestic mutual funds, while acquiring 32.9
billion worth of foreign mutual funds. Non-
residents invested 30.7 billion in the German
mutual fund market.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account ran a surplus – in
unadjusted terms – of 38.4 billion in February,
down 32.8 billion on the previous month’s
level. This can be attributed to a smaller trade
surplus and a slightly larger deficit on invisibleSales and purchases

12current transactions, which comprise services,
income and current transfers.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the foreign trade sur-
plus fell by 32.0 billion to 314.2 billion in Feb-
ruary. After adjustment for seasonal and cal-
endar variations, it fell by 32 billion to 3133/C254
billion. Although the value of exports of
goods went up by 2%, nominal imports rose
even more sharply (51/C252%). In January and
February as a whole, exports were1/C252% down
in seasonally adjusted terms on the average
of the fourth quarter of 2006.1By contrast,
imports in those two months rose by 23/C254%
on the fourth quarter.
The deficit on invisible current transactions in-
creased in February by 31.2 billion on the
month to 34.9 billion. The main reason for
this was a 34.7 billion increase in the deficit
on current transfers to 36.5 billion. By con-
trast, the deficit on services went down by
32.8 billion to 30.8 billion. Net receipts from
cross-border income increased by 30.7 billion
to32.4 billion.
There were net capital exports of 316.5 billion
resulting from cross-border portfolio invest-
ment in February, compared with 37.9 billion
in the previous month. The increase can be
put down mainly to lower investment in Ger-
many by non-residents, who bought German

particular, demand for debt securities fellmarkedly ( 35.2 billion, compared with 322.0
billion in January). At the same time, how-ever, non-residents again purchased equities,on balance ( 37.1 billion, after sales amount-
ing to 32.7 billion in January). By contrast,
German investors added to their portfoliosoutside Germany ( 329.5 billion, compared

They invested mainly in bonds ( 320.4 billion)

in a modest amount of foreign shares ( 32.0

In the area of direct investment, there were
slight outflows of funds ( 31.4 billion, com-
pared with 35.0 billion in the previous
month). German proprietors provided theirforeign affiliates with additional funds worth36.7 billion, mainly in the form of equity cap-
ital. Foreign direct investors, too, increasedtheir cross-border investment in Germany inthe month under review ( 35.2 billion), afterwithdrawing funds from their German sub-
sidiaries in the previous month.
There were net capital exports resulting from
other statistically recorded investment in Feb-ruary ( 310.0 billion). Whereas the financial
operations of general government led to in-flows of 35.6 billion – mainly as a result of in-
curring short-term liabilities abroad – non-securitised funds amounting to 31.4 billion
were transferred from Germany through thetransactions of enterprises and households.There were likewise net capital exports in thebanking system ( 314.2 billion). Outflows of
funds at the credit institutions amounting to38.0 billion net were accompanied by an in-
crease in claims of 36.2 billion at the Bundes-
bank – primarily as a result of transactions inconnection with the large-value payment sys-tem TARGET.

15Leveraged buyouts:
the role of financial
intermediaries and
aspects of financial
stabilityThe number of acquisitions involving
financial investors and financed pre-
dominantly by debt (leveraged buy-
outs, or LBOs) has recently also gone
up sharply in Germany. The combin-
ation of special financing structures, a
favourable economic environment and
a large demand for alternative invest-
ments are enabling acquisitions to be
financed with an ever-growing per-
centage of debt. Although the German
banks involved in LBOs mostly retain
only a small percentage of the credit
risk in their own balance sheets and
have generally engaged in sound risk
management practices,1the risk to
which they are exposed before they
can ultimately pass it on to investors is
considerable. At the same time, it is
questionable whether this rapidly
growing market segment can provide
a sustainable source of income. In
terms of financial stability, moreover,
the diversification and spreading of
risk associated with LBOs are also off-
set by the disadvantage that the ultim-
ate distribution of passed-on credit
risks is not transparent and that there
is an increasing danger of inappropri-
ate risk pricing. The heavy indebted-
ness of the target companies is likewise
associated with increased risks.

16Definition and basic principles
Private equity denotes, in the narrower sense,
equity raised by an enterprise privately, ie not
on a stock exchange. This is done by a finan-
cial investor – also known as a private equity
firm – collecting capital from wealthy individ-
uals2and institutional investors and using it
to purchase equity shares in firms. A venture
capital fund is created when a financial in-
vestor provides funds for target companies
that are either newly established or are refin-
ing products which are not yet ready for the
market. An LBO fund, by contrast, uses these
funds for leveraged buyouts, ie usually for
purchasing an established company outright
using a large proportion of debt.3This report
addresses such leveraged buyouts because
they are the main drivers behind the rapid
growth of the private equity market and be-
cause the high leverage poses particular risks
to the parties involved.
A certain structure for financing and perform-
ing these transactions has developed over
time. In a first step, the resources collected by
the LBO fund are invested in a new “parent
company” as shares or partners’ loans. This
parent company then purchases a 100%
stake in a “sub-holding company”, which, in
turn, takes over the “new company” that has
been formed for the sole purpose of acquir-
ing the target company.
The transaction structure and financing struc-
ture are closely correlated since the positions
taken by creditors at certain points in the
transaction and the contractual relationships
determine the quality of protection. Seniorloans are granted to the “new company”,
which makes it easier to gain access to cash
flows and collateral. Within the category of
senior loans, the tranche denoted “Term loan
A” is usually an amortising loan, whereas the

17are usually redeemed through a “bullet pay-
ment” at maturity. “Second lien loans” areincreasingly being sought by “new com-panies”, too. Although of equal rank to termloan tranches in respect of cash flow, secondlien loans entitle their holders only to subor-dinated claims to collateral. As they are lesswell secured and therefore exposed to great-er risk, second lien loans pay much higheryields than senior tranches. Subordinatedloans or “mezzanine” instruments delivereven higher yields. However, they are also theleast protected, especially as they are typicallyraised by the “sub-holding company”. More-over, loans which are usually unsecured canbe provided by the seller at the “parent com-pany” level; these loans can be regarded as adeferred claim to the payment of the pur-chase price.
The aim of extensively using debt is to take
advantage of the “leverage effect”.
4For the
LBO fund’s investors, this provides returns inexcess of those obtained by subordinatedlenders. However, they are also exposed to acorrespondingly high risk as they can also ex-pect to lose their entire capital investment ifthe transaction fails.
The entry of a financial investor can offer
major advantages from the point of view ofthe target company. The transaction can pro-vide the necessary funding for projects suchas investment. The investor’s vested interestin raising the company’s value provides incen-tives for sustainably increasing the company’sprofitability by improving operations and opti-mising the financing structure. To achievethese goals, the funds usually exert an activeand, from a business standpoint, often posi-
tive influence on the corporate managementof the target company.
An LBO transaction ends when the financial
investment of the LBO fund is terminated,also known as “exiting”. Exit strategies mayinclude taking the company public or sellingit to another financial sponsor (secondary ortertiary) or to a strategic investor. A recapital-isation is another conceivable option. In thiscase, the financial investor collects part of thetarget company’s equity as a dividend andborrows additional funds. The aim of all exitstrategies is to obtain a high selling price orExample of the structure behind

Developments in the global and
European LBO market
The volume of new loans to finance LBO
transactions has grown dynamically in the
past few years. The European market reacheda sizeable US$116 billion in 2006; however,
the US market, at US$187 billion, is still con-
siderably larger.
The average size of LBO transactions in Eur-
ope has hardly increased over time. One rea-
son is the relative absence of “megadeals”
comparable with those in the United States.
Reasons for the growth in volume include the
favourable economic situation, low inflation
and strong competitive pressure on financial
intermediaries. These factors have led to fall-
ing yield spreads on financial markets and to
an increase in investors’ appetite for risk. Pri-
vate equity companies have seen large sums
of money flow into the funds they have cre-
ated, thus laying the foundation for the rapid
market growth. A few Anglo-Saxon private
equity firms at the top of the league have
been able, since 2005, to acquire equity
worth tens of billions of US dollars.
This has created new opportunities for the
structured acquisition of equity and debt;
these financing forms are typically based on
the increased use of “leverage”. Innovative fi-
nancial instruments are simultaneously enab-
ling liabilities to be structured in such a way
that the risk-return profile can be tailored
specifically to investors’ particular needs. This
has sharply expanded the ability of the finan-
cial markets to finance LBOs. These develop-
ments have also led, on the whole, to com-
panies being better able to align their bor-
rowing to their expected cash flow, thereby
enabling them to obtain more debt.US$ bn

Leverage multiples – usually de-fined as the ratio of debt to earnings beforeinterest, taxation, depreciation and amortisa-tion (EBITDA) – therefore represent an import-ant measure of risk. EBITDA is used to estimatethe available “cash flow” needed to servicethe debts. Leverage multiples have been con-tinuously rising since 2001. Target companieshave been coming under an ever-increasingdebt burden relative to their ability to repaytheir debt, measured as EBITDA. In 2006, le-verage multiples in Europe averaged 5.42times EBITDA; in the fourth quarter of 2006,however, they were down slightly to 5.36.
The increase in the volume of LBO financing
is therefore a reflection not only of a growingnumber of transactions but also – in the light
of rising leverage multiples – of financingwith an increasingly large percentage of debt.The amount of equity provided for LBO trans-actions has dropped correspondingly. Theequity share of LBO financing came in 2006to an average of only 34%
5following values
as high as just under 40% at the beginningof the decade.
The rising percentage of debt has been ac-
companied by two market developments: theincreasing number of recapitalisations andthe resale of target companies to other finan-cial investors (secondary or tertiary buyouts).

20In the case of recapitalisations, LBO funds
withdraw equity from the target company
and replace it with additional borrowed
funds.7This makes it possible for the LBO
fund and its investors to recoup the original
investment, or at least a part of it, prior to the
actual exit. In order to distribute a special divi-
dend, the target company might possibly
have to incur more debt; on the other hand,
the fact that a company can recapitalise in
the first place could also indicate that the tar-
get company is performing strongly in eco-
nomic terms.
In secondary and tertiary buyouts, the LBO
fund sells the company to other financial in-
vestors. Such transactions usually lead to a re-
newed rise in the leverage multiples. Exits of
this kind have recently been occurring atshorter and shorter intervals.8In this connec-
tion, it seems justified to ask whether second-
ary buyouts really lead to further improve-
ments in the operational ability or the effi-
ciency of the capital structure – which are at
the heart of the macroeconomic utility of
LBO-financed acquisitions – or whether there
is only a significant increase in risk through
the increased use of debt to finance the com-
pany.
However, secondary buyouts are important
for individual LBO funds because these funds
have been created to exist only over a given
lifespan and therefore have to sell their shares
after no more than a few years (usually five
to seven years). A drying-up of this exit chan-
nel9could therefore pose problems for the fi-
nancial investors. With leverage multiples at
their current high levels, however, it would
appear that this strategy cannot be continued
ad infinitum .
Pay-in-kind bonds are also being increasingly
used in the financing structure. These instru-
ments give the issuer the option of meeting
the resultant obligations (eg interest pay-
ments) either in cash or through the issuance
of new bonds. An advantage of this construct%European LBO firms’ average

21for the target company is that, during the
lifetime of the bond, there are no obligatorypayments and therefore no strain on liquidity.However, unless the bonds are replaced be-fore reaching maturity by new and more fa-vourable loans, the interest balance outstand-ing has to be paid at the end of the lifetime.It is of paramount importance that the partiesto the deal be made aware that the paymentobligations are only deferred.
The occurrence of financing through “bullet
loans” (ie the entire principal is paid on a sin-gle date at the end of the term) is on the in-crease. However, this involves significant risk,especially to the creditors of subordinatedloans, because they cannot claim repaymentuntil more senior creditors’ claims have beensatisfied. In the event of payment difficulties,this will at least reduce the subordinatedcreditors’ recovery rate.
Innovative agreements on the borrower’s
contractual obligations (financial covenants)
10
likewise affect the risk profile of LBO transac-tions. For one thing, cash sweep agree-ments
11can stipulate a reduced volume of
unallocated cash that has to be used for re-payment purposes. The liquidity that is freedup by these cash sweep restrictions is increas-ingly being used for dividend payments. Theintroduction of “covenant cures” whichallow LBO funds to provide companies withadditional liquidity in the event of a violationof the agreed provisions contained in the fi-nancial covenants represents a furtherworsening of the terms for lenders. Thisundermines lenders’ ability to take control ofa company that is temporarily in arrears.
12All in all, the changes in the structure oftransactions and of the financial covenantsindicate that financial investors have im-proved their bargaining position. This meansat the same time that the risk to lenders hasincreased.

ingly important as lenders in the past fewyears. Their position as buyers of leveraged%

designed to protect creditors. For instance, they may re-
quire the target company to comply with certain ratios.
In the event of a violation of these provisions, creditors
have the right to terminate the loan or other extended

11Under cash sweep agreements, an idle cash flow must
be used to a certain defined extent to repay or redeem
outstanding obligations. In this manner, even bullet loans
are, in some cases, repaid during their lifetime.

The German LBO market
The volume of published transactions in the
German LBO market15continued to grow inthe second half of 2006 to 330.1 billion. This
represents a 44.7% increase from the first
half of 2006 and a 69.1% increase from the
second half of 2005, and thus a continuation
of the growth trend. The number of enter-
prises acquired through LBOs has gone up
from 139 in 2005 to 186 in 2006.16
The German LBO market is still dominated by
non-resident financial investors. According to
figures from Ernst & Young, they accounted
for348.6 billion worth of the total volume of
published transactions ( 350.9 billion) in 2006,
ie just under 96%. Of the 23 known buyouts
of at least 3500 million per individual transac-
tion, 20 were by foreign investors.
German financial investors, by contrast, have
been relatively successful in the SME seg-
ment, which is apparently of comparatively
little interest to major foreign funds. Al-
though they accounted for only about 32.1
billion (or just under 4%) of the entire volume
of transactions in Germany in 2006, they
made up just over 40% of the total number
of transactions (76 out of 186).17Just under
one-third of the entire volume of transactions
in Germany, however, was attributable to one
single LBO.18Number

23The leverage used for LBO financing has also
continued to rise in Germany over the past
few years, following the international trend.
As a case in point, in 2006 the average lever-
age multiple19rose further to 5.03 times
EBITDA, compared with 3.86 times in 2003.20
The clearly growing importance of LBOs in
Germany is being reflected in their growing
share of the total German market for mergers
and acquisitions. In the second half of 2006,
the volume of LBOs surpassed the amount of
non-LBOs for the first time.
Financial intermediaries: their role and
the risks
Credit institutions can take on a variety of
roles in the LBO market: granting loans, buy-
ing their own shares of LBO funds and per-
forming various other services in the course
of a transaction. The Deutsche Bundesbank
and the Federal Financial Supervisory Author-
ity (BaFin), under an initiative by the Banking
Supervision Committee (BSC) of the Euro-
pean System of Central Banks, asked six
banks that are particularly active in this line of
business about the associated risks. The sur-
vey included all lending by these banks to fi-
nance LBOs, not just loans in connection with
German target companies.
The most significant source of potential risk
to banks in this business line is likely to be in
the provision of credit for LBO transactions.21
The surveyed institutions indicated an overall
credit volume (including commitments) of
322 billion for the month of June 2006. Inthe course of LBO transactions, individual
banks can enter into underwriting positions22
before passing them on to the actual invest-
ors; these represent a significant source of
“warehousing risk”.23Weeks or even months
can pass following the transaction before a
bank has reduced its initial stock of risk to its
desired level. The survey showed that eachTransaction volume in € billion

21A question arising in this connection is how an LBO
will affect those old creditors who were already involved
prior to the sale of the company to the financial investor.
Thus, the increased use of borrowed funds for buyouts
could mean that, upon closure of the transactions, such
creditors would bear a greater risk. However, a buyout
normally creates a completely new financing structure for
the target company. The old creditors are therefore usual-
ly “bought out”. It is only if this does not happen that
the old creditors could see their risk increase.
22Here, the banks commit themselves to lend a certain
amount at pre-defined terms and conditions.

24credit institution, for its five largest transac-
tions (for which detailed information was
available), had reduced the lending volume
by just under 80% within 120 days.
The existence of liquid syndication markets
and of secondary markets gives credit institu-
tions the opportunity to manage their credit
portfolios actively. Banks are making wide-
spread use of this option. With regard to their
five largest transactions, all surveyed institu-
tions indicated that, in more than 90% of
transactions, they were members of a loan
syndicate. They set limits for their entire LBO
financing portfolio and for individual credit
exposures, taking borrowers’ credit ratings
into account. Some institutions also indicated
that they attach importance to senior and se-
cured positions when lending.24The risks
from the individual transactions are allocated
among the banks and to other market partici-
pants. Credit institutions therefore usually
have relatively well-diversified portfolios
which, for the most part, are composed of
senior claims.
The banks’ responses show that, in the area
of LBO financing, they usually have more
comprehensive and meaningful information
at their disposal than in other types of corpor-
ate credit business. Through the due diligence
review (an intensive review of the target com-
pany’s economic and legal situation), the re-
sults of which are used not only by the LBO
fund but also by the other banks involved, a
deep insight into the enterprise can be ob-
tained. The target company’s business plan,
probable market development, competitive
situation, investment needs and, above all,ability to generate cash flows are analysed.
The maximum amount of debt that can be in-
curred to purchase the target company
hinges, in particular, on the lattermost fea-
ture, namely the ability to generate cash
flows. It is important to assess whether and,
if so, to what degree the debts can be ser-
viced even in a faltering economy. Another
important factor in the credit analysis is the
LBO fund’s track record. A number of quanti-
tative ratios (eg the ratio of cash flow to inter-
est costs) are also factored into the decision.
What the survey results also show is that all
surveyed institutions perform their own an-
alysis as a complement to the due diligence
check-up prior to making their lending deci-
sions. Some banks pointed out that they also
talked directly to the target company and the
due diligence experts.
Along with the comprehensive initial analysis
described above, the surveyed banks monitor
their exposures on an ongoing basis. At inter-
vals of less than a year (in some cases month-
ly), credit institutions receive information on
the target company such as cash flows, busi-
ness evaluations and (interim) balance sheets.
Reports (at least one a year) on the develop-
ment of the LBO portfolio are also prepared
for presentation to the bank’s management.
In the context of LBO financing, institutions
also run stress tests to improve their assess-
ment of the impact of adversity (eg changes
in interest rates or an economic downturn)
24The safety net for LBO transactions is always the com-
pany’s ability to generate cash flow that can be used to
repay the incurred debt. In addition, the LBO fund
pledges its shares of the target company, and the assets
of the target company are pledged to the lender.Liquid markets

Even though such stress tests are subject to
certain limitations, they are still a key comple-
mentary tool for risk analysis.
Own investments in private equity funds
played only a minor role among the German
banks surveyed. In June 2006, the capital in-
vested by these institutions in LBO funds was
less than 32 billion. This line of business is
therefore likely to harbour only a limited risk
of losses. Through their role as arrangers,
agents or advisers to LBOs, the banks in ques-
tion obtain commission income; through the
strong growth in this business line, such in-
come has reached a considerable volume.
This also entails income risks, which could be
significant owing to the potentially high vola-
tility and cyclical sensitivity of LBO business.
Insurance corporations are among the most
active institutional investors in Germany. In a
recent survey by Feri Rating and Research25in
November 2006, 93% of all insurers surveyed
said that they had invested in private equity
funds, 13% of them doing so with more than
2% of their entire assets. By contrast, only
31% of the surveyed banks said that they
had been active as private equity investors,
yet as many as 23% of these banks had in-
vested more than 2% of their total assets. In-
vestor interest in this form of investment is
continuing to grow. For instance, 80% of the
insurance corporations and 31% of the
banks surveyed had declared their intent to
invest in private equity funds in the following
six months. Although German insurers held
only 32.9 billion in private equity holdings at
the end of 2005, ie no more than 0.3% ofthe sum total of their capital investment,26
there is a tendency, particularly among the
major companies, to continue to enlarge their
share.
Impact on financial stability
The impact of LBO financing on financial sta-
bility needs to be examined from several an-
gles. On the one hand, the refinancing struc-
ture that is typical of LBOs can lead to a rela-
tively broad dispersal of credit risk within the
financial system, and this is a positive aspect.
On the other hand, it is becoming increasing-
ly difficult to determine who ultimately bears
the risk. It is therefore impossible to say pre-
cisely whether such transactions can ultim-
ately bring about a sustainable allocation of
risk within the financial system.
The credit institutions involved in initiating
LBOs usually keep only a small percentage of
the risk on their own books. Through syndica-
tion, a large percentage of credit risk is
passed on to other market players (other
banks, but increasingly also institutional in-
vestors). Thanks to an increasingly liquid sec-
ondary market, assumed or retained risks can
be passed on even after a transaction has
been concluded.
The survey of German banks also shows that
90% of the loans retained to finance LBOs
are senior claims and that the credit institu-

26tions usually have only small shares of individ-
ual transactions, creating granular portfolios.
The idea behind this conservative approach to
financing LBOs is that the failure of an enter-
prise acquired by financial investors should
have only a minimal impact on the individual
lending bank. All banks active in this seg-
ment, however, are temporarily exposed to a
considerable risk until the risk is ultimately
passed on (“warehousing risk”). In addition,
if there are no options for further placement,
those banks that, in this case, unintentionally
hold more shares of LBO financing in their
own hands will see the emergence of concen-
tration risk.
Because banks hardly invest directly in LBO
funds, there is no material risk. The potential
impact of the altered debt structure on old
creditors is also limited because, in the vast
majority of cases, their loans are repaid dur-
ing the transaction, which means that the li-
abilities side of the target company’s balance
sheet can be reconstructed from scratch.
The acquired enterprises themselves, how-
ever, may be potentially more vulnerable to a
difficult economic environment and rising
interest rates owing to their higher level of
debt. This distinct rise in financial leverage
over the past few years – a development that
is borne out by both market data and banks’
own statements – represents one of the LBO
market’s main risks. At the same time, the
typically short time horizon within which fi-
nancial investors seek to achieve their desired
yields may lead to the predominance of more
short-term-oriented corporate decisions. If a
target company plunges into crisis, the in-volvement of an increasing number of invest-
ors with different interests (a development
which is being encouraged by the way the
loans are structured) may also make it more
difficult to find a solution.
Another remaining question is whether some
investors are too eager to take on risks, given
that default rates have been low over the
past few years. This could be indicated by
trends such as the clear rise in leverage mul-
tiples. At the same time, the creeping erosion
of the financial covenants has probably ex-
acerbated lenders’ exposure to risk. There is
also the fundamental danger of mispriced
risks. Another danger that cannot be ruled
out is that investors that have purchased
structured products underestimate the risk
profile of their portfolio, leading to the exist-
ence of hidden risk concentration that, in the
event of the default of a target company,
could unleash a domino effect.
In a crisis situation, the emergence of second-
round effects would also be likely. Risks that
banks would have assumed to have been de-
finitively transferred could strike back as legal
risk or as poorer credit quality in other busi-
ness relationships. Moreover, the defaulting
of individual borrowers could also jeopardise
the liquidity of the secondary market and
thus hamper the banks’ prospects for trans-
ferring risk.
Primarily as a result of the quality of banks’
risk management techniques revealed by the
survey, the German market for LBO financing
is therefore highly unlikely to pose any in-
creased risk to the stability of the financialPotential risks

29Financial development
and outlook of the
public long-term care
insurance schemeThe introduction of the public long-
term care insurance scheme in 1995
added a new branch to the social se-
curity system. Cover against the risk of
needing long-term nursing care was
to be organised by the state and the
financial burden on the agencies re-
sponsible for providing social assist-
ance simultaneously eased. Given a
pay-as-you-go financing system, this
implies – particularly in view of the
ageing of society – shifting the finan-
cial burden into the future.
The new insurance scheme initially
generated financial surpluses, which
were then used to finance deficits run
up in subsequent years. The ageing of
society, which is one of the greatest
challenges to the sustainability of pub-
lic finances, is also impinging notice-
ably on the financial development of
the public long-term care insurance
scheme. The reserves are likely to be
exhausted in the near future and con-
tribution rates threaten to rise.
A reform of the long-term care insur-
ance scheme is currently under discus-
sion. Given the challenging status quo
and the fact that the existing problems
are likely to become more acute over
time, it is important to consider what
long-term effects on the future burden
of social security contributions would
ensue if the benefit range were to be
expanded and benefit rates dyna-
mised.

30The introduction of a statutory long-term
care insurance scheme
Before obligatory long-term care insurance
was introduced, the financial burdens associ-
ated with long-term nursing care were a pri-
vate risk which was initially managed using
an individual’s own or his or her family’s
funds. If this income or wealth was not suffi-
cient to cover the costs entailed in long-term
care, they were taken on by the public agen-
cies responsible for providing social assist-
ance. From 1991 to 1994, gross social assist-
ance expenditure on long-term care rose
from 361/C252billion to just over 39 billion. This
was financed by central, state and local gov-
ernment, ie largely through taxes.
In 1995, a public long-term care insurance
scheme was introduced as a separate branch
of the social security system in Germany. The
aims were to provide insurance against the
financial burdens associated with long-term
care and to ease the burden on the public
agencies responsible for providing social as-
sistance.1In order to achieve these aims as
quickly as possible, long-term care insurance
was introduced on a pay-as-you-go basis for
all those with public health insurance. At the
same time, those with private health insur-
ance were obliged to take out private long-
term care insurance, which, particularly in the
initial stages, was modelled to a large extent
on the statutory social security schemes (see
box on page 31 for details of the institutional
provisions).
Immediately after the scheme was intro-
duced, insurance protection was provided forall insurees regardless of their individual nurs-
ing care risk. This gave older insurees an
“introduction gain”, as the standardised so-
cial security contribution rate did not cover
the costs which they were likely to incur. This
privilege was granted at the expense of
younger insurees. Owing to the ageing of so-
ciety, the pay-as-you-go method of funding
the long-term care insurance scheme will
place additional burdens on future gener-
ations, too, because alternative, funded in-
surance would be less affected by the result-
ing deterioration in the implicit rate of return
and would therefore lead to a lower overall
contribution rate. In addition, the lack ofOverview of long-term care insurance

31Overview of the provisions of the long-term care insurance scheme
Compulsory contributions to the long-term care insur-
ance scheme were introduced on 1 January 1995 and
initially the contribution rate was 1% of income subject
to insurance deductions.1Benefits were not paid out
until 1 April 1995. The surplus attained by delaying the
introduction of benefits was used to accumulate re-
serves. From 1 July 1996 the range of benefits was ex-
tended to include in-patient long-term care. At the
same time the contribution rate was increased to
1.7%.2Since 1 January 2005 childless persons have had
to pay an additional contribution of 0.25% of their in-
come. Insured persons born before 1 January 1940 and
persons below the age of 23 are exempt from this.
There is no direct link between the level of (income-
related) contributions and the (standardised) benefits
of the public long-term care insurance scheme.
The reserves, which at the end of 2006 totalled just
over 531/C252billion, must amount to at least half the aver-
age expenditure for one month, which at the moment
is approximately 53/C254billion. Due to the uniform contri-
bution rate set by law and the completely standardised
benefits, there is virtually no competition among the
long-term care insurance institutions. The shortfalls of
individual insurance institutions are largely made good
by compensatory transfers from other institutions.
Only administrative costs are reimbursed at a flat rate,
so that there is no incentive in this case to act ineffi-
ciently at the expense of the other long-term care in-
surance institutions. While persons with statutory
health insurance are automatically members of the
public long-term care insurance scheme, which is in-
corporated in the organisational structure of the statu-
tory health insurance scheme, private long-term care
insurance schemes were introduced for persons with
private health insurance. The statutory long-term care
insurance system thus comprises both the public and
private long-term care insurance schemes.
Private long-term care insurance schemes were at first
required, from 1995, to accept persons with private
health insurance under terms and conditions similar to
those of the public insurance scheme. Thus under pri-vate schemes children are also co-insured, without hav-
ing to pay contributions, up until the age of 18.
A spouse who is not in employment pays only half the
contribution and, furthermore, the contribution is
limited to the maximum contribution rate to the public
long-term care insurance scheme. Contributions were
not allowed to be differentiated depending on the in-
suree’s state of health and associated long-term care
risk. Even for those taking up private long-term care in-
surance later, some of the provisions that are unusual
for the private insurance industry, such as the free co-
insurance of children, the prohibition of gender-
specific tariffs and capping the insurance premium at
the maximum contribution rate for public long-term
care insurance, still apply. This regulation served to
guarantee that from the start older people could also
claim full long-term care benefits with limited contri-
butions. The incomplete risk equivalence requires a risk
structure equalisation scheme among private long-
term care insurers.
The benefits for both public and private long-term
care insurance are partly determined by the degree of
nursing care needed, with three defined care levels.
Furthermore, the benefit rates differ for out-patient
and in-patient care. For out-patient care a further dis-
tinction is made as to whether the care is carried out
by a professional service provider or by other carers
(usually relatives). The rates range from 5205 per
month for out-patient care in nursing care level I to
51,432 in level III, provided the care is carried out by an
out-patient service or in a hospital. In particular cases
of hardship these benefit rates can be increased to
51,918 for out-patient care and 51,688 for in-patient
care. Above and beyond that, once a year the long-
term care insurance institutions assume the costs of a
substitute nurse for a maximum of four weeks and up
to51,432. Moreover, the public long-term care insur-
ance scheme bears the costs of procuring nursing care
products. Finally, for “self-acquired nursing aids” con-
tributions to the statutory pension insurance scheme
are paid.3In addition, carers have statutory accident
insurance.
1The income ceiling for contributions to the public long-
term care insurance scheme is the same as that for thestatutory health insurance scheme. In 1995 it was (in euroterms) 52,991 per month in western Germany and 52,454
in eastern Germany. Today the income ceiling for contribu-tions – following harmonisation in 2001 – is 53,562.50
throughout Germany. — 2The contributions are, as a gen-
eral rule, apportioned equally between employers and em-ployees. To compensate employers for the first stage (1%)the Day of Prayer and Repentance was abolished as a statu-tory public holiday. The only exception is Saxony, whereemployees consequently have to pay all of the 1% contri-bution themselves. The increase of 0.7 percentage pointwas then generally split equally between employers andemployees. Hence employees in Saxony pay 1.35% and
employers pay merely 0.35% into the public long-term careinsurance scheme (see section 58 of the Eleventh Book ofthe Social Security Code). — 3The level of pension
contributions depends on the care level and the amountof time spent each week on care. In level III, with at least 28hours a week spent on nursing care, contributions of 80%of the average nursing fee are paid (based on 2006: around5390 per month in western Germany and around 5325 in
eastern Germany). This creates a pension entitlement of80% of an average wage earner’s pension. At the presenttime this gives a monthly pension of around 521 in western
Germany and 518.50 in eastern Germany – in each case for
a year of nursing care.

32means-testing moderates the consumption of
wealth in old age.2The introduction of the
public long-term care insurance scheme cre-
ated a further branch of social security which
pushes up labour costs without providing for
equivalence between contributions and bene-
fits. The impact of the public long-term care
insurance scheme on income distribution
thus goes beyond that of a purely insurance
risk-related redistribution effect. Although
the previous social assistance model also had
a levelling effect, the social equalisation com-
ponent was located within the tax and trans-
fer system, which can be far more precisely
targeted.Financial development since 1995
In 1995, in particular, and in the first few
years that followed, the public long-term care
insurance scheme recorded large surpluses,
with the result that reserves rose to 351/C252bil-
lion by 1998. From 1999 onwards, however,
deficits were recorded, reaching an initial
peak of almost 31 billion in 2004. The rev-
enue side was boosted in 2005 through
the introduction of a special contribution for
childless persons and contributions for recipi-
ents of unemployment benefit II. In the past
year, there was a surplus in terms of cash in-
flow of almost 31/C252billion, which was, how-
ever, entirely attributable to a one-off wind-
fall gain generated from receiving social
security contributions for almost 13 months
(see box on page 33). The liquid reserves
therefore grew again to 331/C252billion. The
statutory minimum reserve level is set at half
a month’s expenditure and is currently around
33/C254billion.
Between 1997 (when there was a contribu-
tion rate of 1.7% for the whole year for the
first time) and 2006, revenue fell from 0.83%
to 0.76% of gross domestic product (GDP).
While nominal GDP increased by an annual
average of just over 2% from 1997, gross
wages and salaries rose by just under 11/C252%
and the revenue of the long-term care insur-
ance scheme from compulsory contributions
(contribution base) grew by only3/C254% per
year (see chart on page 42). Alongside the€ billion

33Recording the one-off increase in contribution receipts in 2006
In 2006, the public long-term care insurance
scheme – like the other social security schemes
– received, in terms of cash inflow, a one-off
increase equivalent to the amount of almost
one month’s receipts owing to the advance-
ment of the deadline for transferring social
security contributions. In the case of the long-
term care insurance scheme, this effect
equated to almost 51 billion. According to
the provisional financial outturn (PV 45 statis-
tic), which is based on cash flows, the public
long-term care insurance scheme posted a
surplus of just under 51/C252billion in 2006.
Accounted for on an accruals basis, however,
this one-off effect does not result in an im-
proved result because, in this case, the (retro-
spectively paid) contributions are attributed
to the month in which the labour income ac-
tually accrued. So advancing the transfer
deadline has merely brought the payable
amount and the actual payment into line
with each other. The contributions for Decem-
ber 2006 were already received and reflected
in the cash flow figures in December 2006,
whereas under the old system the funds
would mostly have flowed in January 2007. In
the final annual outturn for 2006 (PJ 1 statis-
tic), which is expected to be released in mid-
2007, the results are calculated on an accruals
basis. Therefore the one-off increase in re-
ceipts from contributions in terms of cash in-
flow will not be reflected in an improved re-
sult. Consequently, instead of a surplus it will
probably show a deficit in roughly the same
amount. In fact, the deficit is likely to have in-
creased in 2006 – if the one-off effect is disre-
garded – against 2005.
In the national accounts – which, in particular,
are relevant for reporting compliance with
the Maastricht criteria – the figures are like-
wise recorded on an accruals basis. Hence inthis case, too, the higher cash receipts do not
result in an improved outturn.
The solvency of the long-term care insurance
scheme is dependent on its state of liquidity.
Therefore, the time span for achieving com-
pliance with the minimum level of reserves
has been slightly extended by the advanced
deadline for transferring social security con-
tributions as the liquidity situation as at 31 De-
cember is now improved.
Generally, the task of a nalysing the financial
development of the social security system is
made more difficult by the fact that the differ-
ent schemes follow different accounting ap-
proaches. For example, the statutory pension
insurance scheme and the Federal Employment
Agency only release cash balances. The high
surpluses achieved in these cases, 571/C252billion
and511 billion respectively, thus also appear in
the final annual outturn. If the revenue from
contributions were recorded using the accruals
method, the statutory pension insurance
scheme would not record a surplus but a def-
icit. In the case of the statutory health insur-
ance scheme, by contrast, even the quarterly
figures (KV 45 statistic) are accounted for using
the accruals method, with the result that no
one-off increases in revenue were registered.
The release of the final annual outturn of the
public long-term care insurance scheme in
mid-2007 in accordance with the accruals ac-
counting principle will provide an opportun-
ity to more accurately assess the extent of the
effect of advancing the transfer deadline as
then, for the first time, data computed ac-
cording to both accounting practices will be
available for one social security scheme.
Translation of these results to the other social
security schemes is, however, difficult due to
their different contributor bases.

34generally moderate growth of wages and sal-
aries over the past few years, the decoupling
of the contribution base from gross wages
and salaries also observed in other branches
of the social security system has contributed
additionally to the declining revenue ratio.
This drift was driven by higher-earners, in
particular, switching from public to private
long-term care insurance and by the option
introduced in 2002 for employees to make
payments to supplementary pension schemes
via their company which are not subject to
social security contributions.3This is offset to
a lesser extent by the fact that, since the be-
ginning of 2004, the full contribution rate
has been levied on company pensions (rather
than half, as was previously the case) and
that all capital payments have become sub-
ject to compulsory contributions.By contrast, at 0.8%, the ratio of expenditure
to GDP has remained almost constant since
1997. However, relative to contributors’ re-
muneration subject to insurance contribu-
tions, it has risen from 1.6% to 1.8%. The ex-
penditure trend has been dampened as a re-
sult of the fixed nominal benefit rates, which
have not been adjusted since the long-term
care insurance scheme was introduced. The
real value of benefits has therefore decreased
over time. The nominal increase in expend-
iture to date is thus entirely attributable to
a quantitative increase in long-term nursing
care provision and a structural shift towards
higher nursing charges. The growth in ex-
penditure between 1997 and 2005 of just
over 18% is therefore due to the 171/C252% in-
crease in the number of persons being given
long-term care (from 1.66 million to 1.95 mil-
lion). In addition, there has been a gradual
shift away from financial benefits (which
were relatively cost-effective from the per-
spective of the long-term care insurance
scheme) towards non-financial benefits for
professional nursing services or in-patient
nursing care.4The ratio of non-financial
benefits to total expenditure on benefits has
increased since 1997 from 611/C252%t o7 11/C252%.

4The differing benefit rates for out-patient care, which
vary according to whether a commercial care provider
(non-financial benefits) or other persons do the nursing

carried out by family members, for example, is fiscally ad-
vantageous. However, if it is taken into account that fam-
ily members cut down the amount of paid work subject
to compulsory tax contributions in order to provide nurs-

Expenditure on long-term care insurance is
even more clearly concentrated on the olderage group than is the case for health insur-ance. More than half of all long-term carecases involve persons aged 80 or over. Ataround 55%, the percentage of expenditureon benefits which this group accounts for issomewhat higher still because the probabilityof a person requiring in-patient nursing care,which is a relatively expensive form of care,increases with age. In contrast, the risk ofpersons under 60 requiring long-term care isfairly small. This makes it clear that, similarlyto the statutory pension insurance schemeand – to a lesser extent – the statutory healthinsurance scheme, the public long-term careinsurance scheme is financially dependent onpersons of working age, whereas benefitsare primarily claimed by those in older agegroups.
The long-term care insurance scheme also
had the objective of easing the burden onsocial assistance. In addition to generatingsavings for the statutory health insurancescheme, the draft legislation introducing thescheme also notably envisaged easing thefinancial burden on state and local govern-ment. The insurance benefits, which now
largely superseded the previous nursing as-sistance, were projected to yield savings inout-patient care of just over 3
1/C252billion in the
year of introduction (from April 1995 on-wards) while the annual savings on in-patientcare, which would only make themselves feltas of mid-1996, were estimated at 33
1/C252-4 bil-
lion per year. Around half of all savings bystate and local government were to be chan-nelled into financing investment in the long-term care infrastructure.

36remained around this level, while other ex-
penditure on assistance granted in particular
circumstances continued to increase. By con-
trast, the volume of expenditure of the pub-
lic long-term care insurance scheme reached
just over 315 billion in 1997. Therefore, the
bulk of the expenditure was spent on persons
not considered to be in need according to the
social assistance definition.
Outlook for future financial development
Following the merely transient improvement
in the cash balance in 2006, the reserves are
likely to be depleted again as early as this
year owing to deficits. Given a favourable
macroeconomic trend, the minimum reserve
requirement could be complied with until2010 without any further adjustment meas-
ures. Subsequently, however, prompt action is
likely to be required.
In the long term, the public long-term care in-
surance scheme will face problems on both
the expenditure and revenue side owing to
the ageing of society. For one thing, the share
of older persons in the total population will
rise significantly. According to the Federal
Statistical Office’s forecasts, the proportion of
persons over 80 will increase from 41/C252%
today to 8% in 2030, reaching as much as
131/C252% by 2050.6The ratio of persons requir-
ing long-term care to contribution payers is
therefore also bound to increase. Conversely,
after a last slight increase, the share of per-
sons of working age (ie the vast majority of
contribution payers) in the total population
will decrease from 611/C252% in 2012 to 551/C252%
in 2035 and will then remain at this low
level.7
Cost pressures on long-term care benefits
should be less intense than those on health
insurance, for example, as there will not be
such significant technical progress in the form
of new products (methods of treatment,
pharmaceuticals and technical aids) to push
up costs. It still seems entirely plausible that
the primary effect of increased life expect-2005, percentage shares

38ancy will be that people will stay relatively
healthy for longer (so-called “compression
hypothesis”). If the probability of needing
long-term care does indeed depend less on a
person’s absolute age than on the nearness
of death, an extrapolation based on constant
age-specific long-term nursing care probabil-
ities would overstate the future development
of long-term care needed.8However, the fixed nominal benefit rates
under the legal status quo tend to counteract
the demographically induced financial prob-
lems so that there is no additional expend-
iture pressure on the level of benefits per
long-term care case. On the revenue side, the
expected annual growth in wages and salar-
ies is likely to offset the declining number
of contribution payers. Given constant age-
specific probabilities of requiring long-term
care, the quantitative deterioration in the
ratio of contribution payers to long-term care
patients could be completely neutralised by
the increase in per capita wages and salaries
in the long term.9In this scenario, a contribu-
tion rate of 1.7% (plus the special contribu-
tion for childless persons) would be sufficient
to finance expenditure on a lasting basis.
However, the system would have to with-
stand deficits for a period of around 25 years.
Constant surpluses can only be generated in
this scenario if the growth in the number of
long-term care patients slows down, in par-
ticular, because the less populous generations
born in the mid-1960s or afterwards will be
moving into higher age categories.Million

8Corresponding projections are generally based on data
for age-specific long-term care needs from the Federal
Ministry of Health. However, these are available only for
groups spanning five age cohorts in each case and for
those aged 90 or over only as a single undifferentiated
group. If, with the increase in life expectancy, the number
of persons well over the age of 90 and the probability of
them requiring long-term care as they age rises, the cal-
culations based on these data understate the future vol-
ume of expenditure. The lack of specific age groups for
those over 90 thus already partially presupposes the valid-
ity of the compression hypothesis.
9The wage development used for the Federal Govern-
ment’s projections for financing the statutory pension in-
surance scheme was used. In this scenario, the growth
rate of average remuneration increases from 2% to 3%
between 2010 and 2020 and then remains at this level.Expenditure

benefit rates

39One reason for this very positive perspective
is the assumed wage development. Further-
more, as nominal benefit rates are fixed, their
real volume decreases significantly over time.
With an assumed future increase in the price
level of 2% per year, the real value of the
benefits in comparison to 1995 will decrease
to 53% by 2030 and to 351/C252% by 2050.
Long-term care insurance cover would there-
fore be reduced and the necessary patient
co-payments would continuously increase.
Hence the possibility of dynamising benefit
adjustments is currently under discussion. For
example, one suggestion is an automatic an-
nual adjustment equivalent to the average of
nominal wage growth and the general infla-
tion rate.10To justify this dynamisation factor,
which is essentially below the rate of wage
rises, it is argued that, although the potential
for raising productivity in the labour-intensive
long-term care sector is limited, incentives to
cut costs should remain. If this variant for
dynamising benefit adjustments were adopt-
ed, the contribution rate would have to be in-
creased to just over 21/C252% by 2030 and to
over 31/C252% by 2050.11However, this does not
take demands for further extending the
range of benefits into account. For example,
there are complaints that the current defin-
ition of the need for long-term nursing care is
too closely tied to physical health and disre-
gards the need for physically healthy persons
suffering from dementia to be provided with
long-term care. Any extension to the existing
range of long-term nursing care benefits,
however, would lead to a corresponding in-
crease in the contribution rate.Individual aspects of the reform debate
In view of the emerging problems regarding
the public long-term care insurance scheme,
various changes to the existing system are
being discussed. In the coalition agreement
of autumn 2005, the need to build up a
demographic reserve fund in the form of
funded components in the public long-term
care insurance scheme was emphasised. As
the benefit levels of the public and private
long-term care insurance are almost identical,
a risk structure equalisation scheme was
planned between the two systems which
would leave capital reserves already formed
in the private insurance sector untouched.
Furthermore, the coalition agreement envis-
ages that benefit rates will be dynamised and
the long-term care needs of persons suffering
from dementia will be better taken into ac-
count.
Dynamisation of benefits requires
additional funds
Owing to the ageing of society, dynamising
long-term care benefit rates in order to avoid
a real devaluation of benefits would lead to
rising contribution rates. The extent of this
depends – as outlined above – on a number
10See: The Commission for Achieving Sustainability in
the Financing of the Social Security Systems (“R/C252rup
Commission”) Berlin 2003, p 202 (in German only).
Owing to the assumed long-term wage growth 3.0%
and an inflation rate of 1.5%, an adjustment rate of
2.25% per year for long-term care benefits was calcu-
lated.
11Comparable conclusions are reached, for example, by
J H/C228cker and B Raffelh/C252schen “Wider besseren Wissens:

Pflegeversicherung”, discussion papers from the Institute
for Public Finances of the Albert-Ludwigs Freiburg Univer-

40of factors including, in particular, the demo-
graphic scenario, the development of the
contribution base (employed persons’ wages
and pensions) and the concrete dynamisation
rule. However, the more the dynamised ad-
justment of benefit rates is below the average
growth of wages, the lower the increase in
contribution rates required. Ultimately, the
dynamisation of benefit rates would deter-
mine the extent of future insurance coveragainst the risk of requiring long-term care in
a pay-as-you-go social security system.
Reform approach within the existing
system
When the public long-term care insurance
scheme was introduced, there was initially a
large recourse to financial benefits, from
those providing care for a relative, for ex-
ample. However, there has since been a grad-
ual evolution towards professional care ser-
vices which are paid as non-financial benefits.
This is probably related to initial efforts in the
introductory phase to arrange (continued)
care within the family, which then gradually
declined in favour of the care services increas-
ingly appearing on the market. The changing
trend in family structures (higher labour mar-
ket participation rate, childlessness, small
families) will mean that care within the family
will play a continuously and possibly expo-
nentially diminishing role in future. Additional
expenditure on long-term care insurance is
therefore inevitable. On the other hand, the
financial burden could be eased considerably
if there were a shift away from in-patient care
towards out-patient care provided by profes-
sional services.
Involvement of private long-term care

tion scheme between the private and public
long-term care insurance systems envisaged

41tically identical. However, the calculation of
the contribution rates is based on quite differ-ent principles in the private insurance sectorwhere, to a large extent, risk-related pre-miums are calculated independently of theinsuree’s income. Provisions with protectedownership rights are set up in order to takeage-related increases in expenditure into ac-count and to smooth the level of premiumsover the insured person’s life.
At first glance, the risk structure in private
long-term care insurance schemes seems sig-nificantly more favourable than in the publicscheme. In 2005, for example, of 100 private-ly insured persons, only 1.3 were receivingbenefits; in the public system the figure was2.8. Owing to the different designs of thetwo systems, however, these figures are notdirectly comparable. While in the pay-as-you-go system it is the risk distribution amonginsurees at a certain point in time that is rele-vant (cross-sectional view), systems with age-related provisions are oriented to the devel-opment of the long-term nursing care riskover time (longitudinal view). For example, adisproportionately high share of older insur-ees in pay-as-you-go public insurance systemscreates an entitlement to social equalisation.In contrast, differences in age structure areirrelevant for funded insurance schemes.
A below-average instance of long-term carepatients owing to a relatively favourable agepattern of the insurees does not therefore jus-tify obligatory equalisation. If a private long-term care insurance scheme with a relatively
large number of younger members and a cor-respondingly low proportion of persons re-ceiving benefits were obliged to make equal-isation payments, it would not be able to ac-
cumulate sufficient provisions or would haveto increase premiums even if its age-adjustedrisk structure was no more favourable thanthat of the public long-term care insurancescheme. An equalisation mechanism betweenprivate and public long-term care insuranceschemes would therefore at least have to ad-just the probabilities of requiring long-termcare for the differences in age structure and,owing to the differences in the basic designof the two systems, would soon come upagainst further limitations.
12The general tax-
ation system would therefore seem to be a
more suitable means for achieving income
redistribution.
Financing by means of flat-rate premiums
or a “citizens’ insurance model”
The financing systems that have been dis-
cussed with reference to the statutory health
insurance scheme could also be applied tothe public long-term care insurance scheme.For example, the contribution base could bebroadened by expanding the amount of in-come subject to insurance deductions (eg toinclude rental and capital income and incomeover the current ceiling for the assessment ofcontributions) and the group of contributors(eg to include civil servants, self-employedpersons and privately insured persons with an
income above the threshold for opting out of
the statutory insurance scheme). Alternative-

42ly, a transition to a system of non-income-
related flat-rate insurance premiums could beconsidered.
13
The “citizens’ insurance model” would coun-teract the effects of what could be a sus-tained structural shift in working life towards
increased self-employment (not subject to so-
cial security contributions) on the finances ofthe public long-term care insurance scheme.
However, the statutory social security systemwould then be expanded, resulting in an in-creased overall burden of taxes and socialsecurity contributions. The implicit taxationof those already insured under the public
scheme would decrease, at least in the shortterm – albeit to the detriment of newly com-pulsorily insured persons.By contrast, the introduction of a flat-ratepremium would strengthen the insuranceprinciple of the long-term care insurance sys-tem and, not least, enhance transparency.The average cost of insurance cover againstthe risk of requiring long-term nursing care,at just over 320 per month for each insured
person, would be transparent for all partiesconcerned. Furthermore, decisions regardinga politically desired social equalisation be-tween higher and lower-income earnerscould be placed on a clearer footing and thenimplemented in the context of the generaltaxation and transfer system. The redistribu-tion of income would no longer be carried
out via a separate proportional “wage tax”with a ceiling for the assessment of contribu-tions, but via the overall tax system. By col-lecting non-income-related contributions, thefinancial base of the public long-term care in-
surance scheme would be less adversely af-fected by the demographic structural changefrom employed persons to pensioners and
the corresponding curbing of income current-ly subject to compulsory insurance.
Capital funding for future benefits
In the pay-as-you-go public long-term care in-
surance scheme, increasing costs must bemet by future contribution payers. In order torestrict the financial burden on them, it issuggested that there should be a move awayfrom pay-as-you-go financing towards great-er capital funding. The various models differ
both in terms of the speed and scope of the1995 = 100, log scale

43accumulation of reserves and the reduction
of the pay-as-you-go component. They rangefrom a complete transition to capital fundingfor all who have not yet reached a certain ageto suggestions involving only a temporary ac-cumulation of reserves. A transition wouldcertainly be accompanied by some initial in-creases in expenditure. For a transitionalperiod, citizens would need to make theirown financial provisions and older personswould have to be given support, as they donot have enough time to make sufficient self-provision by means of affordable contribu-tions.
14In this regard, the “R/C252rup Commis-
sion” has suggested imposing a special con-
tribution on pensioners and using this add-
itional income to form a capital stock.15If
dealing with this transitional problem were to
be viewed as a task for general government,
tax financing could also be considered.
Capital reserves can be formed within the
public long-term care insurance scheme.16
However, experience shows that collective re-
serves tend to lead to the temptation to ex-pand benefits. Although individual savings
are better protected from this phenomenon,
they do not directly help to ease the burdenon future generations. The most effective op-
tion would be a complete changeover to pri-vate long-term care insurance with a risk-appropriate calculation of premiums and age-related provisions with protected ownershiprights. However, as with the debate on flat-
rate premiums, a political decision wouldhave to be taken as to what extent thechange of system would be accompanied bysocial equalisation for persons with a lowincome and how the transitional burdenswould be distributed among the generations.
Cutting back the pay-as-you-go systems of
social security and correspondingly strength-ening funded components could lead to anintergenerational redistribution shift in favourof younger age groups. They would be lessaffected by the rising contribution rates ordeterioration in benefits that would other-wise occur. It would be the generation under-going the transition – which differs accordingto the transitional scenario – that would bearthe brunt of the burden. Given the fact that
the long-term care insurance scheme wasintroduced fairly recently, this group wouldinclude at least some of those who signifi-cantly benefited from its introduction. At thesame time, it must be remembered that the
transitional generation may be able to passthe burdens on to following generations. Thiscould take place at an individual level in the
form of smaller inheritances or at a generalgovernment level by financing the transitionthrough borrowing. The impact of the inter-generational income redistribution effects ul-

However, in this case the capital stock is to be accumu-
lated not according to actuarial principles, but mainly
through a special contribution paid by pensioners which
increases over time. After the projection period has
ended (2040) increases in contribution rates could quite
well become necessary.

ition, accumulating financial reserves within the govern-ment sector is equivalent to repaying government debt.Capital funding

44timately depends on the exact form that the
transition takes in terms of increased capital
cover.
A move away from pay-as-you-go to funded
financing would not per se entail an improve-
ment in efficiency. A generally expected high-
er return on the capital market would make it
easier to finance the long-term care insurance
scheme. However, financing the transition
would also entail certain costs, which would
have to be discounted at the capital market
rate. Without any further assumptions re-
garding the relative distortional effects of the
contribution rate in the existing long-term
care insurance scheme in comparison to fi-
nancing the transition through, say, taxes or
borrowing, no reliable allocation improve-
ments can be derived from a change in the
financing process.17
Concluding remarks
The introduction of the long-term care insur-
ance scheme in 1995 further expanded the
pay-as-you-go social security system in Ger-
many. Just like debt-financing, this will entail
a redistribution of income – owing in part to
the ageing of society – to the detriment of
future generations and in favour of current
generations, a fact which may well have
made the scheme politically easier to intro-
duce.
The financial reserves of the long-term care
insurance scheme will be exhausted in the
near future. Although awareness of the need
for fiscal policy action has been significantlysharpened in view of the ageing of society,
the fixed nominal benefit level is increasingly
viewed as being insufficient and so a dyna-
mised adjustment of long-term care benefit
rates is being called for. A reform of the long-
term care insurance scheme is therefore on
the agenda. An ageing population will inevit-
ably lead to rising long-term nursing care
costs in the future. This fact remains, regard-
less of what institutional framework is chosen
to cover long-term care risks.
In the current debate, the political objectives
of reform efforts are often defined as follows:
to strengthen contribution equivalence in
the social security systems coupled with the
transparent and focused financing of general
income redistribution through the tax system,
to restrict the burden on future generations,
to emphasise self-provision and to focus the
bulk of government social transfers on those
with a real need. Against this backdrop, it
would seem appropriate to take a cautious
approach to dynamising benefit rates and ex-
panding the benefit range financed through
the pay-as-you-go system and to try to curb
the contribution burden. Remaining gaps in
benefits could then be closed by introducing
targeted mandatory self-provision.
Another possibility would be to generally
collect flat-rate premiums instead of income-
dependent contributions in future and to
shift the task of redistributing income entirely
to the tax and transfer system. Such a restruc-
17See Deutsche Bundesbank, Prospects for, and obs-
tacles to, a stronger reliance on funding in the public sys-
tem of old-age provision in Germany, Monthly Report,

45turing of the contribution system would place
a burden on lower income earners; however,this could be countered by a tax-funded so-cial equalisation component which wouldthen be more selectively based.
The currently positive macroeconomic trend
must not blind anyone into overestimatingthe long-term financing possibilities. Whencalling for the dynamisation of benefit ratesand an expansion of the benefit range, themedium and long-term consequences shouldbe carefully examined and verifiably andtransparently documented in long-run calcu-
lations. Not least the lessons learned fromthe extension of benefits in the statutorypension insurance scheme in the 1970s andthe extensive debt-financing of governmentbudgets in the past should be borne in mind;promises of increased government benefitsthat are not associated with a direct burdenin the short term, and may therefore be moreeasily politically enforceable, may necessitatecorrespondingly larger and painful counter-measures in the long term.
