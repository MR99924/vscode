5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a whole
The German economy got off to an extremely
good start in 2008 after growing at a some-
what subdued pace in the final quarter of
2007. Real GDP in the first quarter of 2008
was 1.5% up on the quarter after adjustment
for seasonal and calendar effects. This repre-
sents a year-on-year calendar-adjusted rise of
2.6%. There was therefore a sharp rise in
overall capacity utilisation. The significantly
faster pace of growth was due mainly to in-
dustry, which rapidly set about processing the
large number of orders on hand, and the fact
that the weather had hardly any adverse
effect on construction. The wholesale trade,
the transport sector and commercial service
providers also benefited from this.
On the expenditure side, stimuli at the be-
ginning of 2008 were generated primarily by
investment. Construction investment, which
benefited from the comparatively mild
weather, was up 4.5% on the fourth quarter
of 2007. Owing to the high level of capacity
utilisation, expenditure on machinery and
equipment showed a further sharp rise of
4.0% in price-adjusted terms after already
having increased by 3.4% in the fourth
quarter of 2007. This was accompanied by a
clearly positive contribution to growth by
aggregate inventories, probably in the area of
primary and intermediate products. By con-
trast, primary consumption picked up only
slightly following the marked deterioration in
the fourth quarter of 2007. This was due to
the fact that households’ real scope for ex-GDP in 2008

6penditure was again restricted by a sharp in-
crease in consumer prices. Not only invest-
ment, but also the 2.4% growth in exports of
goods and services generated positive stimuli
at the beginning of 2008. In this context,
there is likely to have been a disproportion-
ately large increase in exports to non-euro-
area countries again. Despite the favourable
development in exports, foreign trade made
a negative contribution to growth overall (0.2
percentage point) in accounting terms since
real imports grew even more sharply (3.5%).
There was very strong growth in imports of
capital goods. Furthermore, imports of inter-
mediate goods were stepped up significantly;
these were probably used mainly for stocking
up inventories.
Industry
Growth in industrial output was rather sub-
dued at the start of the second quarter.
Industrial output in April was down 0.7% on
the month after adjustment for seasonal vari-
ations. Nevertheless, there was still a 5.6%
increase on the year. There was a perceptible
rise in the output of capital goods, although
the production of aircraft, ships and trains
was 8.1% down on the month, despite the
large number of orders on hand. By contrast,
producers of intermediate and consumer
goods recorded a marked decline. In the case
of manufacturers of intermediate goods, it
was mainly the suppliers to the construction
sector and the chemicals industry that were
affected.

70.5% in March. Even so, the volume of orders
in April was still 4.0% up on the year. Growthin domestic capital goods marginally ex-ceeded the decline in intermediate goodswith the result that domestic orders rose by0.3%. An appreciable increase in foreign de-mand was achieved only in the case of mech-anical engineering, electrical machinery andapparatus and consumer goods. Overall,there was a 3.8% decline in foreign demand.
There was a marked rise in the value of ex-
ports of goods in April (+1.2%) comparedwith March, when a slight decline was re-corded. Despite rising import prices, importsof goods were 2.1% down on the month innominal terms. The trade surplus rose by 32.4
billion to 317.7 billion, although there was a
further deterioration in the terms of trade.
ConstructionConstruction output fell by a seasonally ad-
justed 2.9% in April and was therefore backat the depressed level of the fourth quarter oflast year. However, orders received in March –more recent data are not available – showedan appreciable increase on February, especial-ly in the case of civil engineering. By contrast,housing construction orders declined again atthe end of the period under review afterrecovering briefly in January.
Labour marketTaking account of seasonal effects, the situ-
ation in the labour market was tending toshow further improvement. The seasonallyadjusted number of persons in employmentwent up by 25,000 in April. The year-on-year
rise was 1.6%. Taken in isolation, the increasein jobs subject to social security contributionswas even greater. According to estimates bythe Federal Employment Agency, the year-on-year increase in March was 2.4%. The num-ber of persons solely in marginal employmentshowed a slight increase in the first quarter.By contrast, the scale of government-assistedforms of employment showed hardly anychange at the end of the period under re-view.
At a seasonally adjusted 3.31 million, the
number of persons out of work remainedvirtually unchanged in May. The fact thatthere had already been a substantial declinein unemployment in the fourth quarter owingto the mild weather may also have beena factor in this. Furthermore, the specialarrangement for older persons, which gavethem the option of early retirement on reach-ing 58 years of age, was phased out at theend of last year. As a result, there has been amonthly increase in the unemployment rateof some 10,000 persons since the beginningof the year. The seasonally adjusted un-employment rate stood at 7.9% in May, as inthe previous month. This represents a declineof 1.3 percentage points on the year. Accord-ing to Federal Employment Agency figures,the number of known non-government-assisted jobs (BA-X index) went up againslightly at the end of the period under reviewfollowing a lull in April.

8Prices
Prices in the international crude oil markets
rose sharply again following a marked decline
in the last week of May and the first few days
of June. In mid-June, the price of a barrel of
Brent crude oil reached a new record high of
US$137. As this report went to press, the
spot price was slightly below this. In the oil
futures markets, a premium of US$21/C254was
being charged for six-month deliveries; the
figure for 18-month deliveries was US$2.
Seasonally adjusted import prices in April
showed a further marked rise on the month,
namely by 0.4%. The year-on-year rate re-
mained at the same high level (+5.7%). If
energy is excluded, however, seasonally ad-
justed import prices were down 0.1%; the
annual rate stood at 0.1%. Domestically pro-
duced industrial goods went up by a season-
ally adjusted 1.1% on the month and 6.0%
on the year. There were substantial price rises
(+2.9%), even if energy is excluded.
At a seasonally adjusted 0.5%, consumer
prices rose sharply again in May after the
general price level had remained unchanged
in April. In addition to the sharp price in-
creases for fuels and heating oil, services also
became more expensive. Food prices went
down only slightly on the whole, despite
price reductions in the case of dairy products.
The prices of industrial goods remained virtu-
ally unchanged. The year-on-year increase in
the national consumer price index (CPI) went
up from 2.4% to 3.0%. The corresponding
figure for the Harmonised Index of Consumer
Prices (HICP) was 3.1%, compared with2.6% in the same period last year. The HICP
was revised upwards by 0.1 percentage point
compared with the flash estimate; the figure
for the CPI was confirmed.
Public finances1
Statutory health insurance scheme
The statutory health insurance scheme re-
corded a deficit of just over 31 billion in the
first quarter of 2008. This was due primarily
to the weak inflow of contributions typical
for the first quarter of the year. In addition,
the two instalments of the Federal grant,
which will remain at the previous year’s level
of a total of 32.5 billion in 2008, will not be
transferred until the second and fourth quar-
ters. The deficit in the first three months of
2007 was 33/C254billion. Revenue rose by 4%
overall, while expenditure increased by 5%.
Contribution receipts were up 4% on the
year. As the average contribution rate, at
14.85%, was only marginally above that re-
corded in the first quarter of 2007 (14.82%),
this increase is mainly attributable to growth
in the contribution base. In particular, receipts
per insured person rose perceptibly. The num-
ber of employees subject to social security
contributions also increased, albeit in the con-
text of a marked decline in the number of re-

9cipients of unemployment benefits. However,
part of this additional revenue still resultsfrom the time-lagged effect of the distinct in-creases in contribution rates at the beginningof 2007, which did not come into effect forpensioners until April.
The renewed marked rise in expenditure in
the first quarter owed mainly to the increasedoutlays for hospital treatment (+3
1/C252%),
which had grown only moderately in 2007.However, the rate of growth still remainedbelow the average of all spending onbenefits. Expenditure on pharmaceuticalsincreased by almost 6%. Although the rate ofgrowth was thus lower than in 2007 as awhole, the slowdown is probably due almostentirely to the fact that expenditure in thefirst quarter of 2008 was no longer beingpushed up by the higher standard rate ofVAT. At just over 4
1/C252%, growth in spending
on out-patient treatment was also robust.The clear rise in benefits that are not subjectto budget caps (eg out-patient operations)seems to be continuing. With an increase ofalmost 8%, sickness benefit payments alsosignificantly contributed to the rise in overallexpenditure. Expenditure on vaccinations,which became one of the health insurance in-stitutions’ standard benefits on 1 April 2007,increased again by 60%.
Owing to the favourable labour market devel-
opment and relatively substantial wage in-creases, a sustained strong inflow of contri-butions is to be expected for the remainder ofthe year even if contribution rates are notraised. However, it appears that expenditureis increasing even more sharply in the currentfavourable climate; the surplus will conse-
quently be markedly lower on the year.Nevertheless, it should be noted that it is diffi-cult to make a reliable estimate owing to thewide variety of outgoings in the health insur-ance scheme. Moreover, surpluses no longerneed be as large as those in previous years asthe health insurance institutions’ debts havelargely been eliminated and, in many cases,reserves have already been built up again.
Although the Federal grant will be raised by
31.5 billion in the coming year, this may be
entirely offset by additional expenditure re-sulting from the restructuring of the remu-Quarterly

10Deutsche BundesbankCan Bremen, Saarland and Schleswig-Holstein also balance their budgets?
The second stage of the reform of Germany’s federal struc-
ture aims, in particular, to devise a new rule for effectively
limiting general government indebtedness. The ceiling for
debt incurrence introduced at the end of the 1960s pursuant
to Article 115 of the Basic Law has ultimately proved inad-
equate.1At the end of February this year, central govern-
ment put forward a reform proposal which is also intended
to apply to state government. In line with the requirements
of the European Stability and Growth Pact, the proposal en-
visages the achievement of at least close-to-balance budget-
ary positions after cyclical adjustment. This is understood to
be a structural general government deficit of no more than
0.5% of GDP, of which two-thirds may be incurred by central
government and one-third by state government. In order to
avoid conflicts with the regulations of the European budget-
ary surveillance procedure, financial transactions are to be
excluded from the deficit calculations. The cyclical influence
is to be calculated using the standardised procedure applied
at European level. As in the case of the Swiss “debt brake”,
the rule is to be made binding both for drafting the budget
and for the budget outturn. Missed targets are only to be
permitted within the restricted framework of an offsetting
account before corrective action must be taken.2
In this context, the commission responsible for the second
stage of the federal structure reform also discussed whether
and when the individual states would be in a position to
achieve balanced budgets. It should be remembered that,
following the first stage of the federal structure reform, the
states now have considerable leeway for adjusting their ex-
penditure, not least through their legislative authority over
civil servants’ pay and pensions, which are of great financial
importance. On the revenue side, however, the individual
states have barely any room for manoeuvre as the legislation
governing taxes (with the exception of real property transfer
tax, which yields relatively little revenue) applies throughout
Germany and any amendments must be approved by both
houses of the German parliament. Consequently, it is current-
ly not possible to differentiate according to the different
needs of the individual states. In this case, therefore, other
considerations take precedence over the principle of subsidi-
arity, according to which differing regional preferences re-
garding the scale of government activity should be reflectedin a corresponding diversity of tax rates for financing the
respective amount of government activity.
On the basis of the current framework and budget figures,
the state governments of Bremen, Saarland and Schleswig-
Holstein have declared that they will be unable to achieve a
balanced budget even by 2019. They base this statement on
forecast calculations which take only partial account of last
year’s more favourable outturn and which assume compara-
tively weak economic growth and relatively high interest
rates. Moreover, despite the need for consolidation, longer-
term expenditure growth equalling or exceeding inflation is
assumed. Without assistance from the other members of the
German federation, Bremen, Saarland and Schleswig-Hol-
stein feel unable to commit to stricter limits for new borrow-
ing.
A working group of the Federalism Reform Commission was
established to evaluate the plausibility of these statements,
and submitted a report in mid-April.3Whereas the three
states in question reaffirmed their assessment, an audit
group with representatives from Bavaria, Berlin and the Fed-
eral Ministry of Finance came to the conclusion that there
was sufficient scope for adjustment and that the states in
question could be reasonably expected to exploit that scope
to the full.4However, hardly any specific examples of poten-
tial savings in individual areas or types of expenditure could
be given. This is because individual states’ financial statistics
data are comparable only to a limited extent as the degree
to which core budget tasks are outsourced varies from state
to state, as do booking practices. In addition, imposing
specific savings obligations would also be questionable polit-
ically because as long as there is a consensus that the states
should determine their own political focus, such concrete
guidelines would hardly seem appropriate. Ultimately, each
state should set its own priorities, while keeping within the
confines of the framework set by the fiscal constitution and
the actual revenue development.
The German fiscal constitution does not formally stipulate a
uniform level of per capita revenue for each state. However,
the Revenue-sharing Act (Finanzausgleichsgesetz) approved
by consensus by the states in 2005 effectively guarantees
each state government (including local government) a level

ments for special factors such as the delayed settlement of payments

able states (city-states or non-city states). Any differences inthe states’ capacity to raise taxes remaining within this rangeare considered to be compatible with Article 107 (2) of theBasic Law, which stipulates an appropriate levelling-out be-tween the states.

As a general principle, persistent above-average borrowingis not a suitable means of compensating for lower revenueper capita . Over time, this would lead to a progressive restric-
tion of the remaining budgetary leeway after deduction ofdebt servicing costs in comparison with other states. In otherwords, expenditure must be sustainably covered by revenuein the longer term, and borrowing simply shifts the burdento a later point in time. It follows that states with weak rev-enue must generally have a lower-than-average level of ex-penditure. However, it should be noted that, given regionalprice level differences, this does not necessarily lead to alower real provision of services. If a state borrows in order toincrease its budgetary leeway in the short term, it must ac-cept that its future outgoings after deduction of debt ser-vicing costs (primary expenditure) will be all the more re-stricted as a result. Hence if a state believes that it cannotconsolidate its budget like the other states, and therefore re-fuses to accept any strict and uniform debt limit, it would ul-timately be seeking a bailout from the other members of theGerman federation.
A point of departure for analysing whether a state is pursu-
ing an appropriate expenditure policy (disregarding debtservicing costs) would be to check whether it restricts its pri-mary expenditure in comparison with other states to a levelappropriate to its relative revenue position after settlementof payments under the state government revenue-sharingscheme. Only if expenditure is kept at least within theseboundaries might a partial debt assumption by the othermembers of the federation – an option which is occasionallydiscussed in this context – conceivably provide a sustainablesolution to budgetary problems. However, the Federal Con-stitutional Court’s ruling in the case of Berlin made it clearthat, as well as demonstrating extreme budgetary hardship,a state must show that it has made very great efforts to re-solve the situation itself in order to be entitled to claim suchassistance. In this respect, the revenue framework more orless guaranteed under the state government revenue-sharing
scheme could be taken as a ceiling for the permitted primaryexpenditure ratio vis-/C224-vis comparable states.
An analysis of the primary expenditure of Bremen, Saarland
and Schleswig-Holstein reveals that even the relative expend-iture position for 2007 – which was derived from the revenueafter settlement of payments under the state governmentrevenue-sharing scheme – was still exceeded significantly insome cases. After adjustment for financial transactions (espe-cially granting loans and acquiring participating interests),Bremen’s per capita primary expenditure was
1/C252% above the
reference value for the other city-states Berlin and Hamburg,while its tax-generating capacity for 2007, measured in ac-cordance with the Revenue-sharing Act (including specialsupplementary Federal grants) was 8
1/C252% below the refer-
ence value. Saarland’s corresponding per capita expenditure
was 11/C252% lower than that of the other west German non-city
states; however, its tax-generating potential was 31/C252% below
the reference value. For Schleswig-Holstein, this per capita
expenditure measure was 21/C252% below the reference value
but, at 3%, the gap in its tax-generating capacity was onlyslightly larger. Nevertheless, all three states in question stillhad considerable leeway vis-/C224-vis the guaranteed expend-iture level of around 90% of the average in the comparablestates derived from the state government revenue-sharingscheme, so that further cutbacks would appear reasonable.
Overall, Schleswig-Holstein seems less in need of budgetary
consolidation than the other two states. The efforts neededto achieve a balanced budget are not significantly greaterthan in the comparable states of Lower Saxony and Rhine-land-Palatinate. For Saarland and, even more so, for Bremen,the task of consolidation is more challenging, despite thefact that they already received extensive special assistance inthe past.
6Should the option of further extraordinary finan-
cial assistance from the other members of the German feder-ation be considered within the framework of an obligation –also applying to these states – to achieve a balanced budget,it would have to be ensured that the states’ awareness oftheir own responsibilities is appropriately reinforced andthat situations of extreme budgetary hardship in which otherstates as well as central government are obliged to provideassistance will not recur in future.
working group, was not entirely satisfied with the procedure used
and has since provided its own analysis, which draws a more cautiousconclusion for Bremen and Saarland. See Kommissionsdrucksache111. — 5The Revenue-sharing Act provides for special supplementary
Federal grants for generally accepted special requirements such ashigher per capita costs for political management in smaller states. —6For a similar assessment, see also the results of the calculations for
Rhineland-Palatinate in Kommissionsdrucksache 111, p 5. In 2007, theper capita deficits excluding financial transactions and after adjust-
ment for the delayed settlement of payments under the state govern-ment revenue-sharing scheme came to 590 in Schleswig-Holstein (ie
2
1/C252% of primary expenditure excluding financial transactions),
around 5450 (12%) in Saarland and around 51,000 (191/C252%) in Bremen
(disregarding the general debt servicing fund, which appears to be insurplus), compared with 540 (1%) in Lower Saxony/Rhineland Palatin-
ate and 5250 (8%) for central government.

Should growth in other expenditure continue
at the same pace and the contribution rate
remain unchanged, the health insurance insti-
tutions would record deficits even if contribu-
tion receipts were to grow as strongly as in
2008. If growth in expenditure is not cur-
tailed, there is a danger that, despite in-
creases in the Federal grant, contribution
rates will need to be raised even in good
times. In the event of an economic downturn,
the financial situation of the statutory health
insurance institutions would deteriorate sig-
nificantly.
In itself, the establishment of a health insur-
ance fund on 1 January 2009 will hardly lead
to any additional expenditure relevant to the
contribution rate. On the basis of estimatesof the statutory health insurance scheme’s
revenue and expenditure (as with the statu-

Government must set a uniform contribution
rate for the health insurance fund by 1 No-
vember 2008 so that the revenue generated
(along with the funds provided by the Federal
grant) covers all expenditure in 2009. Not-
ably, it is still unclear to what extent liquid
reserves should already be built up for the
health insurance fund in 2009.
Public long-term care insurance scheme
At31/C254billion, the deficit recorded by the pub-
lic long-term care insurance scheme in the
first quarter of 2008 was down slightly on the
year. While revenue grew by almost 3% over-
all, expenditure rose by 2%. As a result of the
favourable employment trend and higher per
capita earnings, there was also a particularly
sharp increase in employed persons’ contribu-
tions (+4%). Conversely, there were signifi-
cantly fewer contribution payments made for
unemployed persons (-81/C252%). Furthermore,
pensioners paid just under 1% more in contri-
butions. On the expenditure side, growth in
non-financial benefits (particularly nursing
home care), at just over 2% overall, was
markedly stronger than that in financial bene-
fits, which were up by just over1/C252% on the
year. At the end of March, the liquid reservesQuarterly

13of the public long-term care insurance
scheme amounted to just under 33 billion.
As part of the nursing care reform, which will
enter into force on 1 July 2008, the contribu-
tion rate will be raised from 1.7% to 1.95%
(plus, where applicable, the special contribu-
tion of 0.25% to be paid by the childless). It
is envisaged that the additional revenue that
this will generate will be used to finance the
planned extension of benefits (notably, the
dynamising of long-term care benefit rates3
and additional benefits, eg for those suffering
from dementia). Although the additional
revenue should exceed these extra expenses
in the coming years, it is foreseeable that the
fundamental negatives (declining number of
contribution payers, growing number of
long-term care patients, rising benefit rates)
will far outweigh the positives (rising per
capita earnings) in the long term. This means
that contribution rates are bound to rise in
future.
Securities markets
Bond market
Issuing activity in the German bond market
declined slightly in April in comparison with
March. Bonds with a total value of 3117.4 bil-
lion were issued in the German market, com-
pared with 3130.9 billion in March. After de-
ducting redemptions – which were slightly
higher than in March – and taking account of
changes in issuers’ holdings of their own
bonds, issuers ultimately reduced their bond
market debt by 319.6 billion in April. The out-standing amount of foreign debt securities in
the German market also decreased in the re-
porting month ( 314.8 billion), meaning that,
in the upshot, 334.4 billion flowed back to in-
vestors.
Buoyed by a good cash balance situation, the
public sector redeemed bond market liabil-
ities to the net value of 313.0 billion in April,
312.4 billion of which was attributable to
central government which, only in March,
had sold debt securities totalling 39.0 billion
net in line with the issuance calendar. On bal-
ance in the reporting month, central govern-
ment primarily redeemed five-year Federal
notes (Bobls) for 314.1 billion as well as
thirty-year and ten-year Federal bonds
(Bunds) ( 32.0 billion and 30.8 billion respect-
ively). In addition, central government in-
creased its holdings of own securities by 35.7
billion. In net terms, it sold only two-year Fed-
eral Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze) to the value of
34.7 billion. State governments scaled down
the outstanding volume of their debt instru-
ments by 30.6 billion.
Like the public sector, German credit institu-
tions reduced the outstanding volume of
their debt securities in April ( 32.0 billion). This
in effect was the result of net redemptions of
public Pfandbriefe ( 34.0 billion). By contrast,

establish whether they should be adjusted in line with
cumulative price developments. If real wage and salary

most in line with nominal increases in gross wages.Planned nursing

14flexibly experienced net sales ( 30.8 billion in
each case). Specialised credit institutions
tapped the bond market to a lesser extent
(30.4 billion).
In the reporting month, German enterprises
redeemed debt securities for 34.7 billion net.
This ultimately involved only commercial
paper ( 35.7 billion). By contrast, German
non-banks sold longer-dated bonds for 31.0
billion.
In April, German credit institutions were, on
balance, the sole purchasers of debt secur-
ities, investing 35.8 billion in the bond mar-
ket. By contrast, German non-banks sold
large amounts of bonds ( 337.0 billion), the
vast majority of which were domestic instru-
ments. Non-resident investors reduced theirinvestment in the German bond market by
33.1 billion.
Equity market
Issuing activity in the German equity market
did not revive in April, despite prices develop-
ing more favourably than in March. New
shares totalling 30.2 billion were placed in
the market, the majority of which were issued
by non-listed enterprises. The outstanding
amount of foreign equities in the German
market decreased by 35.3 billion. Shares
were purchased by domestic credit institu-
tions and non-banks ( 324.8 billion and 313.8
billion respectively). Conversely, foreign in-
vestors sold a significant amount of German
equities ( 343.6 billion). This is likely to have
been due mainly to short-term sales in the
run-up to the respective dividend payment
dates.
Mutual fund shares
In April, domestic mutual funds recorded in-
flows of 36.1 billion, of which 34.0 billion
was attributable to mutual funds open to the
general public. Equity-based funds were par-
ticularly popular: they offloaded shares for
35.0 billion net. A comparable inflow of
funds was last seen in January 2000. Mixed
funds and open-end real estate funds also re-
corded net inflows, albeit to a lesser extent
(30.6 billion and 30.5 billion respectively). By
contrast, investors pulled out of, in particular,
money market funds and mixed securities-
based funds ( 31.9 billion and 30.3 billion re-
spectively). Specialised funds reserved for in-
stitutional investors generated 32.1 billion.Sales and purchases

15Shares in foreign mutual funds were sold on
the German market for 31.7 billion net in
April. Mutual fund shares were purchased
predominantly by German non-banks and
foreign investors ( 33.6 billion in each case) as
well as by German credit institutions ( 30.5 bil-
lion).
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus – in unadjusted terms – of 314.5 billion
in April. The result was thus 33.0 billion down
on the level of the previous month. The main
reason for this was the reversal to a negative
balance in invisible current transactions,
which comprise services, income and current
transfers. However, the impact of this on the
current account was mitigated by a higher
trade surplus.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the foreign trade sur-
plus in April went up by 32.1 billion on the
month to 318.7 billion. After adjustment for
seasonal and calendar variations, it increased
by32.4 billion to 317.7 billion. The value of
exports rose by 1.2% while the value of im-
ports declined by 2.1%. Compared with the
first-quarter average, seasonally adjusted
nominal exports increased by 0.6%, whereas
import values decreased by 1.9%.
A deficit of 33.3 billion was recorded for in-
visible current transactions in April, compared
with a surplus of 31.8 billion in March. This
turnaround is attributable to the deterioration
in the income balance which ran a deficit ofMajor items of the balance

1631.2 billion in April compared with a surplus
of35.4 billion in the previous month. The
sharp increase in dividend payments to non-
residents was a major contributory factor in
this connection. By contrast, the deficit on
services went down by 30.4 billion to 30.2
billion. In addition, the deficit on current
transfers fell by 31.1 billion to 31.9 billion.
Cross-border portfolio investment delivered
net capital exports again in April ( 323.8 bil-
lion, compared with 314.7 billion in March).
On balance, non-resident investors sold Ger-
man paper at the same time as German in-
vestors disposed of foreign instruments. Most
activity was focused on transactions by for-
eign investors ( 343.2 billion), who, as in pre-
ceding years, disposed of large amounts of
German shares ( 343.7 billion) prior to the
scheduled dates for dividend payments in
spring. In the process, they sold bonds ( 33.8
billion) and acquired mutual fund shares
(33.6 billion). Resident investors sold foreign
paper in the amount of 319.4 billion, dispos-
ing of a combination of money market instru-
ments ( 312.8 billion), shares ( 36.4 billion) and
bonds and notes ( 32.0 billion)
With respect to direct investment, April also
saw net capital exports. These amounted to
39.6 billion (compared with 311.2 billion inthe previous month) and, on balance, were
exclusively generated by German enterprises
(39.8 billion), which provided their foreign af-
filiates primarily with equity capital ( 36.7 bil-
lion). Foreign direct investors made hardly any
changes to their investment in Germany
(30.2 billion).
Other statistically recorded investment com-
prising financial and trade credits (in as much
as these do not constitute a part of direct in-
vestment) as well as bank deposits and other
assets saw inflows of funds in April ( 331.2 bil-
lion compared with outflows of 37.6 billion in
March). This was due partly to capital imports
by general government ( 315.4 billion), which
essentially liquidated foreign bank deposits.
Enterprises and households experienced in-
flows of 30.5 billion. The external position of
the banking system – any changes to which
can be seen as a reflection of all other bal-
ance of payments transactions – decreased in
April by 315.3 billion. This was due to a de-
cline in the net external assets of the credit in-
stitutions in the amount of 317.4 billion. By
contrast, the external position of the Bundes-
bank rose by 32.1 billion.

17Outlook for the
German economy –
macroeconomic
projections for 2008
and 2009The German economy got off to a very
strong start to 2008. Growth is likely to
be more subdued in the second and
third quarters, however. As explained
in this article, expansionary forces will
pick up at the end of this year or early
2009 against the backdrop of a then
more favourable global economic set-
ting and a slowing rate of inflation. As
far as it is possible to tell at present,
this faster pace of growth will continue
as an underlying trend in 2009. How-
ever, this quarterly pattern will not be
reflected in the annual growth rates.
According to these projections, overall
economic growth will be 21/C254% (2%
calendar-adjusted) this year and 11/C252%
(calendar-adjusted and unadjusted) in
2009. That would leave the economy
well within the range of normal cap-
acity utilisation with a balanced risk
profile.
The price climate has become decided-
ly gloomier of late. Even with gradual-
ly receding price pressure in terms of
the energy component and expected
corrections to food prices, rates of con-
sumer price inflation below 3% are un-
likely before the end of 2008. The rate
of price increase could ease to 2% in
the course of 2009. The annual average
rate of inflation (HICP) is therefore
likely to be 3.0% in 2008 and 2.2% in
2009, with the upside risks prevailing.

18Current situation
The German economy experienced very
strong, broad-based growth in the first quar-
ter of 2008. Overall output rose by 1.5% on
the quarter after adjustment for seasonal and
calendar effects. Adjusted for the different
number of working days, real gross domestic
product (GDP) was 2.6% up on the year,
compared with 1.8% in the preceding quar-
ter. Overall economic output at the beginning
of 2008 thus clearly exceeded the expect-
ations expressed in the December 2007 fore-
cast.1Industry, in particular, rapidly processed
a large part of the surge in orders received in
the fourth quarter of 2007 despite the early
date of Easter, and, with scarcely any
weather-related setbacks, the building indus-
try was able to benefit from the improved
business situation. Overall capacity utilisation
has thus shown a sharp increase recently and
is now probably well within the range of nor-
mal utilisation.2
In line with this robust economic activity, the
labour market has remained buoyant since
the beginning of the year. Employment ex-
panded rapidly – partly owing to the weather –
and was 1.7% up on the year in the first
quarter of 2008. At the same time, registered
unemployment showed a further marked fall
to a seasonally adjusted 3.36 million. The
year-on-year decline amounted to 624,000.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate,
as defined by the Federal Employment
Agency, was 8.0% in the first quarter, which
was 0.5 percentage point lower than in the
previous quarter and 1.5 percentage points
down on the year. Over the past few months,developments in the labour market have
proved to be noticeably more positive than
forecast in December 2007, not least as a
result of the ongoing progress made in redu-
cing hard-core unemployment.
In the first quarter of 2008, consumer price
inflation (as measured by the Harmonised
Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)) was just as
high as in the final quarter of 2007, at an an-
nual rate of 3.1%. Whereas the rate of infla-
tion at the end of 2007 was largely in line
with expectations, the rate in the first quarter
was 0.2 percentage point higher than fore-
cast in December 2007. This was largely the
result of sharply rising energy prices as well as
a less favourable trend in food prices.3
Overall, the current situation for the forecast
covering the period from the second quarter
of 2008 to the end of 2009 is more favour-
able in terms of economic growth and the la-
bour market and less favourable for con-
sumer prices than anticipated in the Decem-
ber 2007 forecast.4

ation, see Deutsche Bundesbank, The economic scene in

the December 2007 forecast not only as a result of unex-
pected price trends, but also owing to a different weight-
ing scheme and various methodological changes. On this
point, see Deutsche Bundesbank, Impact of the 2008

19Important assumptions5
Global economic activity lost some momen-
tum recently, albeit slowing from an extreme-
ly fast pace. This is particularly true of the US
economy, which has recorded little growth
since the fourth quarter of 2007. By contrast,
there is still a rapid pace of growth in the
emerging market economies of South and
East Asia as well as in the oil-exporting coun-
tries of the Middle East. Global economic
growth is likely to remain moderate as 2008
progresses and pick up again somewhat in
2009 with the assumed slight upturn in the
USA. On an annual average, this seasonal
pattern, based on the new purchasing power
parities, results in global growth slowing from
43/C254% in 2007 to just over 31/C252% in both 2008
and 2009, which means that it will drop
somewhat below the fairly high multi-year
average of 4%. This implies a downward cor-
rection of1/C252percentage point annually com-
pared with the assumptions on which the De-
cember 2007 forecast was based.6At the
same time, it is assumed that the volume of
global trade, which is also affected by the
shifts in growth between the major economic
areas, will expand by 51/C254% and 53/C254%r e -
spectively in 2008 and 2009, compared with
61/C252% in 2007. Growth in German exporters’
sales markets is likely to be1/C252percentage
point lower than this in 2008 and almost
1 percentage point lower in 2009. Compared
with the December 2007 forecast, export
market growth has been revised downwards
by 1 percentage point for 2008 and 11/C252per-
centage points for 2009.As usual, the technical assumption has been
made that exchange rates in the forecasting
period will remain constant at the average re-
corded for the first half of May. This implies a
euro exchange rate of US$1.54, compared
with a rate of US$1.37 on an annual average
in 2007. The effective exchange rate of the
euro against the euro area’s 22 most import-
ant trading partners is expected to be almost
7% above the 2007 level over the forecast
horizon. Compared with the December 2007
forecast, the assumption concerning the ex-Major assumptions of the projection

has been raised by US$0.08 and by 41/C254%o n
a weighted average.
Following the market expectations observed
in the first half of May, short-term interest
rates, as measured by the three-month
EURIBOR, will average 4.9% in 2008 and
4.3% in 2009. The market assessment of
long-term government bond yields, at aver-
age figures of 4.2% this year and 4.4% in
2009, points to a slight acceleration, which
can also be attributed to higher inflation ex-
pectations.
The international financial markets experi-
enced severe turmoil again in the first few
months of this year. Spreads on some risky
debt securities soared to new record highs.
Towards the end of the first quarter, however,
tensions eased somewhat. Spreads on BBB-
rated corporate bonds were 250 basis points
at the end of the period under review, com-
pared with the March high of more than 300
basis points. Like the December projection,
this forecast is based on the assumption that
spreads on bank loans will remain elevated,
which is reflected in higher costs of capital for
enterprises.
Based on forward prices in the first half of
May, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil
on an annual average was assumed to be
US$113.3 in 2008 and US$117.7 in 2009.
Compared with the December 2007 forecast,
this implies an upward correction to the
average price of crude oil of almost US$25
per barrel for 2008 and US$34 for 2009. In
US-dollar terms, other commodity prices (ex-cluding energy) are expected to rise, in line
with the assumption, by just under 23% in
2008, compared with the annual average for
2007, and increase by a further 61/C252%i n
2009.
In public finances, all measures were taken
into consideration which have either been
adopted or which have already been specified
in sufficient detail and are likely to be ap-
proved. In particular, this includes the higher
pension adjustments in mid-2008 and mid-
2009 as well as the1/C254percentage point in-
crease in the rate of contributions to the
statutory long-term care insurance scheme to
1.95% on 1 July 2008. By contrast, no ac-
count was taken of the higher tax allowances
expected as a result of the imminent recalcu-
lation of the socio-cultural minimum subsist-
ence level.
Cyclical outlook
Taken on its own, the new exogenous dataset
with noticeably lower growth in export mar-
kets, a considerably higher euro exchange
rate as well as a significantly higher crude oil
price, even in euro terms, signals that the De-
cember 2007 growth forecast needs to be re-
vised downwards considerably. On the other
hand, economic growth was extremely strong
at the beginning of 2008 and far exceeded
expectations. Despite the special factors fa-
vouring overall economic activity in the first
quarter of 2008 and the usual lagged effects
of important variables, there is some evidence
that the German economy’s intrinsic momen-
tum or resilience has, to date, been underesti-Interest rates

21mated. In addition, the financial markets
could prove to be placing less of a burden onthe real economy than some observersbelieve.
However, the level of overall output achieved
in the first quarter of 2008 sets the bar highfor the second quarter, particularly as themild weather helped construction activity getoff to a good start to the year. Moreover, alarge amount of machinery was delivered andcompanies heavily stocked up their inventor-ies of inputs and intermediary products. As aresult, technical counter-reactions may be ex-pected in the second quarter of the year, notonly in construction investment, but also inmachinery and equipment, and inventories.The baseline projection therefore assumesthat real GDP in the second quarter of 2008will show a slight decline on the quarterin seasonally and calendar-adjusted terms.However, even with this fairly cautious ap-proach, GDP in the second quarter would stillbe significantly higher than anticipated in theDecember forecast.
With production expected to undergo a mod-
erate upswing in the remainder of 2008, ex-pansionary forces should gain momentumnext year, possibly leading to real GDP thenonce more recording quarterly rates in theorder of
1/C252% as an underlying trend. This is
suggested by the fact that, with the Germaneconomy remaining in robust shape, the im-pact of adverse external factors is on thewane. This applies both to the euro’s recentappreciation with its moderate dampeningeffects on growth and to the price of oil andthe resulting severe loss of purchasing power(particularly among consumers). In addition,
export market growth will probably pick upmomentum again slightly. In this set of cir-cumstances, there is much to indicate thatprivate consumption, too, will gradually gainin importance and that overall economicgrowth will be broadly based and be quitebalanced in structure, particularly in 2009.

222008 and 1.4% in 2009. Overall economic
activity in the forecasting period should there-
fore be slightly above the potential growth
path.7The fact that 2008 has more working
days than 2007 means real GDP could in-
crease 2.3% this year in calendar-year terms.
Next year, by contrast, the calendar effect is
negligible.
However, the sharp variation in the average
annual growth rates masks the underlying
quarterly profiles. To gain an insight here, it is
worth examining economic growth over the
course of a year, which can be calculated
based on a calendar-adjusted year-on-year
comparison in the fourth quarter. This ap-
proach yields a growth rate of more than
11/C252% for 2008 and almost 2% for 2009. The
moderate pace of economic growth in the re-mainder of 2008 is reflected via a smaller
“statistical overhang” at the turn of 2008/09
in the average annual rate for 2009, which is
1/C252percentage point below its four-quarter
rate.
Growth is now expected to be 0.4 percent-
age point higher in 2008 than forecast in De-
cember 2007. This upward revision is the re-
sult of the significantly better GDP outcome
for the first quarter and the associated eco-
nomic assessment. Though the level of eco-
nomic activity for the remainder of 2008 has
also been revised upwards, the pace of
growth is regarded as weaker given the un-
favourable environment. The smaller “statis-
tical overhang” means that average annual
growth in 2009 is estimated to be 0.6 per-
centage point lower than in the last forecast,
although the rate of expansion during 2009
was revised downwards only slightly.
Despite the appreciation of the euro, growth
in exports of goods and services was out-
pacing the expansion of Germany’s sales mar-
kets up to the end of the period under re-
view. However, lagged volume effects of the
euro’s appreciation are likely to result in ex-
ports to non-euro-area countries trailing be-
hind market growth over the forecasting
period.8This is largely offset by German ex-
porters expanding their market share in the
euro area, with their overall market position
also likely, in fact, to improve further in 2008Technical components of the GDP

year terms, we expect an increase in real ex-ports of goods and services of 6
3/C254% in 2008
and of 43/C254% in 2009. With real overall de-
mand forecast to increase by 31/C252% and more
than 21/C252% respectively and given moderate
import substitution effects, real imports arelikely to expand by more than 6
1/C252% in 2008
and 53/C254% in 2009. Foreign trade will there-
fore make a positive contribution to growthin 2008. At
1/C252percentage point in the base-
line projection, this will be significantly lowerthan in the two preceding years, however.By contrast, net exports are expected tomake a largely neutral contribution to growthin 2009.
Gross fixed capital formation will remain a
major mainstay of growth over the forecastinghorizon even though its pace of expansion willslow perceptibly in 2009, albeit after threeyears of decidedly sharp growth. The moder-ate and partial correction in credit standardsrecently as well as the higher cost of debt fi-nancing do not present any major barrier toinvestment for most enterprises. This assess-ment is confirmed by the latest relevant sur-veys by the German Chamber of Industry andCommerce (DIHK) and the Ifo Institute. This isparticularly true of small and medium-sizedenterprises and reflects the commercial sec-tor’ s improved credit quality. In addition,strong profitability over a period of severalyears means that German enterprises haveample internal funds.

24ment will probably be stepped up noticeably
in 2008 and 2009. By contrast, only subdued
housing construction activity is to be expect-
ed. Overall, real gross fixed capital formation
could increase by 43/C254% in 2008 and 21/C254%i n
2009. The total capital stock – excluding hous-
ing – is therefore likely to expand at a rate of
just under 2% overall in 2009 and therefore
as sharply as, most recently, in 2000.
High price inflation is currently placing a con-
siderable damper on real private consumption.
Moreover, soaring prices for some food items
and further sharp energy price hikes severely
affected consumers’ price expectations in the
fourth quarter of 2007 and also had a nega-
tive impact on their propensity to make major
purchases. This resulted in the household sav-
ing ratio rising from 103/C254% in the first three
quarters of 2007 to 111/C254% around year-end
2007/08. Household sentiment temporarily
brightened somewhat, but, according to a GfK
survey, recently became noticeably gloomier.
This indicates that the propensity to save and
consume will initially remain impaired. The
fact that government subsidies for private
pension provision were again increased in
2008 is likely to have a stabilising effect on
savings. At just under 11 %, the saving ratio
during the forecasting period is therefore likely
to be only slightly down on its previous level.
The increase in private consumption will there-
fore be largely in line with the rise in dispos-
able income of nominally around 31/C252%i n
2008 and more than 3% in 2009. Ongoing
employment growth, higher average compen-
sation of employees and the increase in profit
and investment income will contribute to this
in equal measure. The anticipated decline inthe rate of inflation will probably result in real
private consumption expanding somewhat
more sharply in 2009 (11/C252%) than in 2008
(just under 1 %).
Economic growth will remain employment in-
tensive in the forecasting period; there is
therefore likely to be less and less leeway in
working hours and ever fewer productivity re-
serves. As a result, the increase in hourly
productivity –3/C254% this year and 1% next year
– will remain well below the average rate in
the past ten years (+11/C252%). Assuming the
economic growth projected here, the total
number of hours worked will rise by 11/C252%
and just under1/C252% respectively. The average
number of hours worked per employed per-
son will increase somewhat this year owing
to the larger number of working days and
will probably not change much next year
given fairly minor shifts in the employment
structure. The number of persons in work is
therefore likely to increase by just under
11/C252% to 40.3 million in 2008 and rise by
almost1/C252% again in 2009. For the forecast-
ing horizon, it is assumed that the demo-
graphic decline in the working-age popula-
tion will be offset by higher labour market
participation and that migration effects will
be negligible. Under these conditions, the
number of registered unemployed could aver-
age some 3.3 million persons in 2008 and
3.2 million in the following year. The un-
employment rate as defined by the Federal
Employment Agency would therefore fall
from 9.0% in 2007 to 7.8% in 2008 and
7.6% in 2009.Slight pick-up

25Labour costs and price outlook
The 2008 pay round has now largely been
concluded. Of the major sectors, only retail
and private banking have yet to reach an
agreement. In the metal-working and elec-
trical engineering industries, new negoti-
ations are not scheduled until November. As
expected, wage inflation accelerated mainly
in the services sector, especially in the public
sector, at the beginning of 2008. Pay settle-
ments, which frequently run to 2009 and
sometimes longer, were, in fact, somewhat
higher than assumed in the December 2007
forecast. This was probably due in part to the
unexpectedly positive developments in the la-
bour market and in earnings. Negotiated
rates of pay may therefore be expected to
rise by, on average, 23/C254% rather than 21/C252%
in 2008 and 2009. The wage drift is likely to
be largely neutral in both years given acceler-
ated increases in negotiated rates of pay and
fairly moderate economic growth. While
lower social security contributions by employ-
ers will help ease wage costs in 2008, contri-
butions are expected to go up slightly, on
average, in 2009. The increase in labour
costs, as measured by compensation per em-
ployee, will therefore accelerate from 21/C254%
in 2008 to 23/C254% in 2009. Assuming product-
ivity growth (per employee) of roughly 1%,
unit labour costs could show a marked rise in
the current year for the first time in some
while, at 11/C252%. In the following year, they
are expected to increase further, at 13/C254%. As
conditions in terms of pricing competitiveness
have changed and input prices are rising fast,
it will scarcely be possible to pass these costs
through fully to sales prices. At just under11/C254%, the domestic value-added deflator will
therefore increase more slowly than unit
labour costs, at least in 2008. This means that
enterprises, for the first time in years, will
probably not be able to raise their profit mar-
gins further in 2008 and 2009.
The unfavourable consumer price trend – as
measured by the HICP – with annual rates of
3% and more is likely to continue well into
2008. This can primarily be attributed to the
sharp increase in crude oil prices. Given the
assumed path of oil prices, inflation rates
below 3% are not to be expected before the
end of this year, with dampening baseline ef-
fects also playing a part in this. Consumer
price inflation can now be expected to aver-
age 3.0% in 2008. This represents an upward
revision of 0.7 percentage point compared2005 = 100, seasonally adjusted,

26with the December 2007 forecast,9largely
due to higher crude oil prices. The unexpect-
edly large increase in food prices will also
have a stronger adverse impact on the price
climate on an annual average than forecast
six months ago, despite some partial correc-
tions that have already taken place or are still
outstanding. By contrast, the price trend for
goods (excluding energy and food) and ser-
vices could be somewhat more favourable.
Excluding energy, the latest inflation forecast,
at 1.7% for 2008, is therefore largely in line
with that of December 2007.
Consumer price inflation could moderate to
just under 2% in the course of 2009 provided
no further adverse factors emerge. This cor-
responds to an average annual inflation rate
of 2.2% in 2009, which is also 0.7 percent-
age point more than was forecast in Decem-
ber 2007. As for 2008, the revision for 2009
is due almost exclusively to higher crude oil
prices, ie the energy component of the HICP .
Excluding energy, the annual inflation rate
projection, at 1.6% in 2009, is largely un-
changed from the last forecast. The slight
flattening compared with 2008 is due solely
to the weaker price trend for food. However,
higher rates of inflation are expected for in-
dustrial goods (excluding energy) and services
in 2009, mainly reflecting greater wage cost
pressure.
Public finances10
The state of public finances is likely to deteri-
orate again somewhat in the current year.
Following a small budget surplus in 2007, amarginal deficit is expected again for 2008.
Although budgetary developments continue
to be influenced by positive cyclical factors,
structural factors are key. In particular, the
business tax reform and the further reduction
in the contribution rate to the statutory un-
employment insurance scheme are leading
to losses of revenue. Furthermore, not least
owing to the turbulence in the financial mar-
kets, revenue from profit-related taxes is likely
to see weak growth; this revenue has shown
an extremely sharp increase in recent years
and has probably been well above its trend
value lately. However, there is a high degree
of uncertainty in this area, especially given
the difficulty of estimating the financial im-
pact of the business tax reform. Overall,
growth in government revenue is likely to be
markedly weaker than GDP growth. There
will probably be a decline in the expenditure
ratio as well, albeit to a lesser extent than in
the revenue ratio. Although there is likely to
be a clear acceleration in the growth of gov-
ernment expenditure, this will, in all probabil-
ity, again lag behind the increase in nominal
GDP , especially on account of spending on
provision for old age and in connection with
unemployment.
There will probably be no major improvement
in the public finance situation in the coming
9As mentioned above, owing to various statistical
changes to the HICP , the two inflation rate forecasts are
not directly comparable from January 2008 onwards.
10The account below is of the finances of general gov-
ernment as defined in the national accounts; this defin-
ition is also used largely as the basis for assessment of the
Maastricht criteria. For a more detailed assessment of
budgetary developments at central, state and local gov-
ernment level and of the social security funds, see

27year. On the revenue side, a certain amount
of additional revenue owing to the effects of
tax progression might help to counter con-
tinued subdued growth in revenue from
profit-related taxes. On the whole, it may be
assumed that the revenue ratio will stay
roughly at the prior-year level since, on bal-
ance, no major tax or social security cuts have
been implemented so far. Nevertheless, the
impending recalculation of the socio-cultural
minimum subsistence level can be expected
to lead to an increase in the relevant tax al-
lowances (and, in all likelihood, child allow-
ance, too). Moreover, additional deficit-
increasing measures are under discussion at
present, and these also have to be taken into
consideration in this context. Expenditure
growth is likely to accelerate further. In par-
ticular, there could be a fairly sharp increase
in healthcare spending owing to new ar-
rangements for the remuneration of outpa-
tient treatment. The government debt ratio,
which stood at 65.0% at the end of 2007, is
likely to fall to approximately 61% by 2009.
The situation of general government never-
theless conceals the fact that some subsec-
tors and, in particular, central government
will still show considerable structural deficits
in the coming year.
Risk assessment
Even though the baseline scenario presented
here is the most likely development given the
assumptions made, it is, naturally enough,
fraught with risks and uncertainties which
might lead to actual developments deviating
from expected developments.11The risk fac-tors involved are largely the same as those de-
tailed in the December 2007 projection.
Some of the risk potential identified earlier
has been incorporated into the baseline,
however. This applies to both global econom-
ic growth, which is now rated as weaker, and
the technical assumptions on the exchange
rates and crude oil prices.
With adjustment of the baseline assumption
on global growth, which has been revised
downwards by1/C252percentage point for both
2008 and 2009 from the December 2007
projection, the residual risk to the global
macroeconomic outlook is likely to be rather
limited. However, downside risks still exist in
some economies which are currently under-
going a correction in their housing markets or
in which such risks could materialise given
earlier quite sharp rises in house prices. The
underlying hypothesis that economic growth,
especially in Asia, is being impaired only to a
comparatively small extent by the slowdown
in the US economy is also still in need of con-
firmation.
The exchange rate of the euro has been on
an upward trend for some years. This appreci-
ation could continue, especially with other
interest rate patterns or given a prolonged
weakening of economic activity in the United
States. On the one hand, this would harm the
competitiveness of German enterprises in the
international sales markets and encourage
import substitution. On the other, it would
tend to ease the domestic price climate and,

home.
The international oil markets remain a consid-
erable factor of uncertainty. When this report
went to press (5 June), the spot price for a
barrel of Brent crude oil was US$21/C252higher
than in the projection assumption; in the case
of longer-term forward quotations, the figure
was as much as US$6 higher. If the price ofcrude oil were to stay at this level or, in fact,
continue rising, there would be a further de-
terioration in the terms of trade leading to a
matching dampening of domestic demand in
Germany and rising inflationary pressure. Be-
sides being a reflection of geopolitical ten-
sions and speculative elements, the latter
being difficult to assess, the high price of
crude oil could be an indication that the
global economy is still growing at a fast pace,
with the resulting higher export demand – in-
cluding from the oil-exporting countries –
forming a partial counterweight to the loss of
domestic purchasing power.
Despite a number of positive signs, the tur-
moil in the financial markets has not yet been
resolved. Risk premiums in the money market
are still well above their levels before the
onset of the financial market turbulence in
the summer of 2007. Even so, credit condi-
tions for enterprises in Germany have been
tightened only slightly since the start of the
turmoil and have not changed at all for
households. Given the limited interest rate
sensitivity of investments, there is some evi-
dence that, given stable expectations, the
income and goods cycle will not be severely
impaired.
Account also has to be taken of the fact that
growth in Germany exceeded expectations in
the first quarter of 2008. Even though growth
was positively influenced by special factors, it
still shows in what better shape the German
economy is at present. Given the large vol-

29ness survey – as well as the ongoing wide-
spread positive outlook in the corporate sec-tor, growth in the German economy in thenear future could also be perceptibly strongerthan expected in the baseline projection.
The recently displayed intrinsic momentum or
resilience of the German economy representsa clear counterweight to the risks, mainly inthe international setting, which, taken bythemselves, point to a preponderance ofdownside risks to economic growth. For thisreason, the prospects of more favourablegrowth and the risks of a poorer performancecurrently appear roughly balanced.
As in December 2007, the price projection is
very much shaped by the technical assump-tion on oil prices. Perceptibly higher rates ofinflation may be expected if the price of oilremains at its current high level or, in fact,rises even further. By contrast, a further ap-
preciation of the euro could help alleviate theeffect. With regard to food prices, the base-line projection assumes, in view of globallyrising demand, only a temporary and incom-plete downward correction. Seen in thatlight, it is fraught with certain downside risks.In particular, a sharp expansion in global agri-cultural production could involve strongerprice adjustments. In terms of domestic con-ditions, however, upside price risks predomin-ate. It is true that this projection is based onthe assumption that higher wage costs willbe passed on, to a certain extent, to prices,especially those of services. Given further in-creases in input prices, growing wage costpressure might trigger new rounds of price in-creases. Overall, the upside risks to futureprice developments predominate in both theshort and medium term.

31The market for
federal state bonds*Since reunification, the German fed-
eral states have become considerably
more indebted. Since the end of the
1990s, however, an increasing number
of federal state bonds have been is-
sued to finance budgetary deficits, and
since 2001, loans from domestic banks
have been repaid. Yet few analyses
of the market for federal state
bonds have been conducted. This
article therefore starts by outlining
market developments within the con-
text of changes in federal state
budgets and debt. Issue strategies vary,
both over time and from one federal
state to another. These variations
include the volume of bonds issued,
degree of structuring and tradability
on the secondary market.
Based on an internal dataset, the art-
icle then moves on to examine how
the yields on bonds of all 16 federal
states have developed. Here, a gradual
decline in the yield spread between
federal state bonds and central gov-
ernment bonds (Bunds) has been ob-
served since 2000. Furthermore, the co-
movement in yields is increasing. This
phenomenon can be explained to a
large extent by the increasing amount
of liquidity on the market for federal
state bonds.
*To avoid confusion, bonds or other securities issued by
any of the 16 federal states which form the Federal
Republic of Germany are referred to as federal state
instruments throughout this article. Bonds or other secur-
ities issued by the Federal Government are referred to as
central government paper. Bonds or other securities
issued by governments in other countries are referred to
as bonds.

32Development of federal state debt
Between the end of 1992 – when compar-
able results were first available for the whole
of Germany – and the end of 2007, the credit
market debt of the federal states rose from
the Deutsche Mark equivalent of 3196 bil-
lion1to3482 billion.2Developments varied
from federal state to federal state. Debt in-
creased substantially, above all, in the new
federal states, which financed their – initially
relatively debt-free – budgets to a large ex-
tent by raising loans, especially in the years
immediately after reunification. At an aver-
age of 35,600 per inhabitant, the credit mar-
ket debt in these federal states exceeded the
level of the federal states in western Ger-
many. At almost 313,500, however, the abso-
lute increase was strongest in Berlin in this
period, while an increase of only 3500 or so
per inhabitant was recorded in Bavaria. The
highest per capita debt level – almost
322,000 – was reported in Bremen at the end
of last year. Debt was therefore more than
seven times as high in Bremen as it was in
Bavaria (including local government). Yet
there were also marked differences between
the non-city federal states. At the last count,
the per capita credit market debt of the fed-
eral states of Saarland and Saxony-Anhalt
was more than four and a half times as high
as that of Bavaria.
There were a number of reasons for the large
federal state deficits in the years subsequent
to reunification. In the old federal states, they
resulted mainly from tax shortfalls owing to
tax relief following the third stage of the in-
come tax reform in 1990, payments for thebenefit of the new federal states and a sharp
rise in other expenditure in 1991 and 1992.
In the new federal states with their extremely
narrow tax base, the additional transfer pay-
ments in these years were not nearly suffi-
cient to cover expenditure. The federal states’
efforts to curb expenditure growth from
1993 did not lead to the intended deficit re-
duction owing to a – partly cyclical – decline
in revenue. Net new borrowing did not fall
significantly until 1997 and lasted until 2000.
This was attributable to expenditure restraint
as well as the substantial rise in revenue,
particularly from profit-related taxes. While
growth in federal state expenditure had aver-
aged more than 5% per year at the begin-
ning of the 1990s, it rose by no more than an
average of 0.5% per year from 1997 to
2000.
From 2001, however, federal state net new
borrowing again increased sharply, reaching a
high of slightly more than 330 billion in 2003.
The significant increase in debt was accom-
panied by weak revenue growth, which fell
by 8% overall or 314 billion from 2001 to
2003 and increased only slightly in 2004 and
2005. This was chiefly attributable to profit-
related taxes, the decrease in which can only
be partially explained by statutory tax relief
and restrained macroeconomic development.
Overall, these factors led to a 34 billion de-
crease in federal state income in 2005 com-

33pared with 2000. Increased expenditure also
clearly led to increased deficits and thus new
borrowing in this period. Averaging 1% an-
nually between 2000 and 2005, the increase
was limited, however.
In the last two years, the overall fiscal deficit
of the federal states was completely elimin-
ated, and the first surplus since 1969 ( 39 bil-
lion) was actually recorded in 2007. This was
due mainly to proceeds from asset sales and
strong growth, particularly in volatile profit-
related tax revenue as well as the additional
revenue arising from the increase in the
standard rate of VAT in 2007. Another con-
tributory factor was that expenditure con-
tinued to increase at a relatively restrained
average annual rate of 11/C254%. Yet, despite the
large surplus overall, some federal states still
had to borrow – in some cases, quite exten-
sively – to finance their budgets last year.
Capital market debt and bank loans
Traditionally, the German federal states have
financed their budget deficits extensively
through bank loans. The high federal state
deficits after reunification therefore also led
to a sharp increase in liabilities to domestic
credit institutions (see the chart on page 34).
At the end of 1997, these amounted to
3235 billion compared with 3147 billion at
the beginning of 1992.3The subsequent con-
solidation and reduction in the federal state
deficits temporarily led to a significantly
slower increase in 1998 and 1999, however.
A basic change can be observed in the
weighting of the federal states’ financial in-struments for financing the renewed increase
in fiscal deficits as of 2000. Given the general
broadening and deepening of financial mar-
kets, replacing bank loans with the issue of
own bonds on the capital market became ad-
vantageous for the federal states.4The gross
issue volume of federal state bonds therefore
surged accordingly. As a result, fewer bank
loans were raised, and existing loans were ac-
tually repaid on a net basis from the end of
2001. Owing to increased issuance activity,
the federal states started to play a greater
role in the German capital market. In the
period from 1992 to 1999, the federal states
accounted for slightly more than 3% of net
sales5of debt securities on the German bond
market; between 2000 and 2007, by con-
trast, the federal states accounted for 16%
of net sales.6At the end of 2007, the total
volume of federal state bonds outstanding
was3228 billion compared with an outstand-
ing volume of 3938 billion in the case of cen-
tral government securities. Debt securities
therefore account for 47% of overall federal
state debt compared with 96% in the case of
the Federal Government.

4The yield spread on public Pfandbriefe and federal state
bonds widened from 1999. Since yields on public Pfand-
briefe determine the banks’ refinancing costs for public
sector loans, they can be used to estimate the lending
rate.

34Volume and structure of
federal state bonds
Between 1992 and 2007, the German federal
states issued a total of more than 2,800 dif-
ferent bonds, some of which have been
topped up over time.7At just under 90%, by
far the largest share of gross sales was attrib-
utable to securities with an original maturity
of more than one year.
The most populated federal state, North
Rhine-Westphalia, is also by far the leading is-
suer of federal state debt securities on the
market; it issued bonds with a value of
3102 billion from 1992 to 2007. Berlin’s par-
ticular debt problem is reflected in its gross
sales of just under 358 billion in this period.
Together with Lower Saxony, the considerablysmaller state of Saxony-Anhalt is one of the
biggest issuers in the bond market (around
332 billion each). A similar picture can be
seen after the deduction of repayments.
North Rhine-Westphalia raised just under
360 billion net on the capital market between
1992 and 2007, followed by Berlin (just over
331 billion), Lower Saxony (just under 321 bil-
lion) and Hesse (just over 319 billion). See the
chart on page 35).
The federal states sell their bonds to two dif-
ferent investor groups. First, bonds are placed
privately, ie sold to long-term investors who
usually retain the security until maturity.DM bn €b n

36Second, securities are issued with secondary
trading in mind. The latter usually have a
higher issuing volume, carry a fixed coupon
and are repaid on a specific date. From the
issuer’s perspective, bonds sold to private in-
vestors have the advantage that they can be
tailored to the needs of a particular target
group. The disadvantage is that investors de-
mand a higher liquidity premium for non-
marketable securities.8Unlike the federal
states, the Federal Government meets its cap-
ital market borrowing needs almost exclusive-
ly with marketable bonds.9Between 1992
and 1998, 70% of the federal states’ bond
sales were attributable to bonds with a re-
spective issue amount of less than 3400 mil-
lion upon initial issuance. This percentage
halved in the period between 1999 and 2007
(see above chart) to the benefit of large-volume securities. Nonetheless, the bulk of
issues continued to have relatively low vol-
umes after 1999. Moreover, issuance policy
clearly varies from federal state to federal
state. While 84% of all bonds issued in Lower
Saxony had an issue volume of more than
3400 million in the period from 1992 to
2007, Saxony preferred smaller securities and
raised 91% of its capital in this way.
For smaller federal states, in particular, issuing
large-volume bonds is not always optimal,
despite the generally lower liquidity premium.
In view of their predominantly low borrowing
needs in absolute terms, these federal states
very rarely had to become active in the capital
market, but did have to invest or raise funds
in the money market between issue dates. In
order to issue large-volume bonds without
incurring these additional liquidity holding
costs, a number of federal states have joined
forces to offer joint Jumbo bonds since 1996
(“federal state Jumbos”). From an investor’s
perspective, Jumbo bonds not only provide a
higher degree of liquidity but also mean that
the federal states involved are jointly and sev-
erally liable. Jumbo bonds have an average
issue volume of just over 31.2 billion and are
therefore some of the largest bonds in the
market for federal state bonds. By way of
comparison, however, central government
issues are still much larger. The average vol-%

8The liquidity premium is a markdown which mitigates
the risk of not being able to sell a particular amount of a
bond on a particular date without influencing the prevail-
ing market price. With non-marketable securities, illiquid-
ity is, by definition, high.

“Federal state Jumbos” are used mainly byBremen, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-West Pom-erania, Saarland, Schleswig-Holstein andThuringia, which raised between just under40% and just over 75% of their capital onthe bond market by means of Jumbos.
10
Rhineland-Palatinate also participates inJumbo bonds on a regular basis, but theseaccount only for a smaller percentage of itscapital market borrowing (just over 20%).Some other federal states have, at least tosome extent, taken part in the issuance ofJumbos for a limited period.
11
An important feature of debt securities istheir structure. While the Federal Govern-ment finances it debts primarily by means ofstraight bonds, ie securities with a fixed termand fixed coupon,
12the federal states make
use of more complex financial products –usually lower-volume bonds. Variable interestrates coupled with market rates such as theEuribor are very common. In contrast to cen-tral government securities, federal statebonds also offer debtors or creditors termin-ation options. Furthermore, some federalstates also issue “exotic” bonds.
13
Since 1999, the federal states have also bor-rowed money in foreign currency. Since then,the average issue volume in foreign currencyhas been 5
1/C252%. From a legal perspective,
however, there is usually little leeway in termsof exchange rate risks. They normally have tobe completely hedged.

12The Federal Government currently has two structured

13These include a bond issued by Saxony-Anhalt pursu-

14For example, the 2005-2006 Budget Act of Saxony-
Anhalt stipulates that currency risks must generally be
hedged. In exceptional circumstances, the finance minis-
try can deviate from this rule; it maintains that it does not
make use of this option, however. If covered interest rate
parity holds, by which an arbitrage relationship between
interest rates in different currency areas and changes in
exchange rates is assumed, raising capital in a foreign
currency while hedging the foreign currency exposure
will not result in financial advantage. Constellations may,
however, arise on the foreign exchange and swap mar-
kets which create more favourable (or unfavourable) con-
ditions for raising funds in foreign currency. See Baba,
Packer and Nagano, The spillover of money market tur-
bulence to FX swap and cross-currency swap markets,
Bank for International Settlements, Quarterly Review,
March 2008. This clearly places greater demands on pub-
lic debt administration, and central government activities
are plainly less transparent as a result.Structured debt

38The largest issuer was again North Rhine-
Westphalia (just under 38 billion gross) fol-
lowed by Saxony-Anhalt (just under 36 billion
gross). In relation to funding on the capital
market, however, Saxony-Anhalt makes the
most intensive use of this type of bond. Be-
tween 1999 and 2007, Saxony-Anhalt raised
more than one-quarter of its issue volume in
foreign currency, followed by North Rhine-
Westphalia (just under 10%). Brandenburg,
Baden-W/C252rttemberg, Hesse and, to a lesser
extent, Berlin also raised capital in this way
(see the chart on page 37). In total, the fed-
eral states issued bonds in 15 foreign curren-
cies. In terms of value, the largest share is at-
tributable to traditionally low-interest-bearing
currencies such as the yen and the Swiss
franc, which account for just over one-third
and over one-quarter, respectively, of capitalraised in foreign currency. The US dollar
(approximately one-fifth) is also a popular
currency for debt securities, as is, to a lesser
extent, the British pound (just under 7%).
See the adjacent chart.
Yields and liquidity
Not only volume and structure but also price
factors play a crucial role in the market analy-
sis of federal state bonds. Since there are no
relevant indices, time series are calculated for
the average bond yields of each federal state.
These are then compared with the yields on
central government bonds. Finally, the factors
which influence the interest rate differential
between central government and federal
state bonds are examined.
Only bonds denominated in Deutsche Mark
or euro which have a fixed coupon and are
repaid on a specific date – in other words,
not subject to termination rights – are fac-
tored into yield calculations. These limitations
make it possible to depict a comparatively
homogeneous market segment, which dem-
onstrates characteristics similar to those of
central government bonds. Of the 2,864 fed-
eral state debt securities issued since 1992,
1,800 fulfil the above-mentioned criteria. The
relatively low issue volume, particularly in the
1990s, complicates the calculation of yields
for all maturities, however. Bonds are there-
fore sub-divided into four categories at any
given time by residual maturity: up to four

The federal states prefer to issue bonds with
a maturity of four to seven years (around40% of the issue volume), followed by theseven to 11 year category (just over 35%).The following presentation of yields relates tobonds with a residual maturity of four toseven years, ie the most liquid category.
The yield on federal state bonds is calculated
as an average of the bonds outstanding onthe calculation date, the residual maturity ofwhich falls into the relevant category. Theyields on the bonds included in the averageare weighted according to their respectiveoutstanding volume. The yields on individualissues are taken from Thomson FinancialDatastream. The chart on page 40 illustrateshow yields have developed for three federalstates as well as for Jumbo bonds issued joint-ly by several states.
Changes in the yield spread vis-/C224-vis central
government bonds of comparable maturityare of particular interest as fluctuationscaused by general interest rate developmentsare eliminated from the equation in this way(see the chart on page 40).
16In the mid-
1990s, when the issuance activity of federalstates was generally very restrained, the an-nual average of this spread across all federalstates amounted to more than 30 basispoints. It narrowed significantly after 2001and fell below 10 basis points at one point.The spread narrowed during a phase in whichthe federal states issued more bonds and riskpremiums fell generally. The spread for par-ticularly large-volume Jumbo bonds frequent-ly fell below the average interest rate pre-mium on all federal state bonds. Owing to
the turbulence on the financial markets, thepremium rose considerably in 2007 and, at anannual average of 21 basis points, was almosttwice as high on the year, however. The risein the interest rate premium for federal statebonds remained below that of Pfandbriefe,which tripled on the year in 2007 to an aver-age of just over 30 basis points.
17
The outstanding bond volume of Berlin andNorth Rhine-Westphalia is comparable withthat of some countries in the euro area.
18The
interest rate premiums on bonds issued bythese countries followed a development pat-tern similar to that of the federal states inquestion after the euro had been introduced.They initially fell from over 20 to just a fewbasis points and picked up again to just under10 basis points, predominantly in 2007; theyield spread of both federal states’ bondscompared with that of central governmentbonds rose to almost 30 basis points.
The development of spreads suggests that, in
general, three factors determine the interest
15The maturity buckets are similar to those of wide-
spread bond indices. The distribution of residual matur-
ities in the category of four to seven years, which is in the
focus of the analysis, does not change systematically over
time.
16When interpreting the interest rate differential of indi-
vidual federal states, the – at times – low liquidity of the
underlying bonds should be taken into account.
17Average yield on central government bonds or Pfand-
briefe with a maturity of four to seven years.
18According to the Bank for International Settlements,
Austria ( 3148 billion), Portugal ( 3120 billion), Finland
(388 billion) and Ireland ( 339 billion) had bonds with out-
standing volumes (each excluding money market paper)
which were more or less comparable with the capital
market debt of North Rhine-Westphalia ( 362 billion) and
Berlin ( 333 billion). Contrary to those in the other analy-
ses, these yield differentials relate to the most recent
bonds issued with a maturity of around ten years.Yield spread

41rate premium for federal state bonds com-
pared with that of central government debtsecurities: liquidity premiums, the generalwillingness of investors to take risks and thespecific risk which investors associate withbonds issued by individual federal states.While the risk propensity or aversion of themarket is, for example, reflected roughly inthe yield spread of corporate bonds to centralgovernment bonds, and federal-state-specificrisks could result from higher debt, the empir-ical recording of federal state bond liquidity ismore difficult.
A market is perfectly liquid if, at a given time,
any volume of a security can be traded on itwithout the price varying. There is, however,no exact measure of liquidity. Various tech-niques for measuring the liquidity of bondmarkets are presented in the literature. Thesecan be broken down into two categories. Vol-ume-based approaches record, for example,the outstanding volume of a bond or thetrading volume. The outstanding volume of adebt security is usually known, but providesonly very basic information on tradability.Trading volumes, on the other hand, relatedirectly to market activity. Since the majorityof bonds are sold outside the stock exchange,however, this information is available only inexceptional cases.
19The second category
comprises price-based measurements whichcan only be used for bonds which are actuallytraded; they therefore reflect only the moreliquid part of the market per se .
20An example
of such a price-based indicator is the bid-askspread, which, in the case of German centralgovernment bonds, tends to show littlevariation.
21Another option is to determine the hetero-geneity of yields at a given time. In arbitrage-free markets, the same bonds have the sameprice or generate the same yield. Differencesin the yields on securities of an issuer in agiven maturity category are an indication ofthe bond having low liquidity as arbitrageurswould otherwise exploit the difference andprices would assimilate as a result.

One measure of the heterogeneity of federalstate bonds is their standard deviation.
23By
observing this factor over time for individualfederal states and Jumbo bonds, it becomesclear that large-volume Jumbo bonds aremore liquid than the corresponding individualbonds of the federal states. This also appliesduring the third quarter of 2007, whenilliquidity spikes were recorded for federalstate bonds owing to the financial marketturbulence (see the chart on page 40).
An empirical study on the determinants of
federal state spreads shows that they are, infact, determined mainly by liquidity premiums(see the explanatory notes on page 42). Thehigher the degree of liquidity of bonds issued
19Only around 2% of trade in central government
bonds was conducted on stock exchanges in 2006. See

traded.

tural changes in the public bond market, Monthly Report,
October 2006, pp 29-44.
22Alternatively, transaction costs can render the exploit-
ation of obvious price differences unprofitable.
23Less standard deviation of yields on various bonds of a
given federal state is a sign of a higher degree of liquidity.
To take account of the various terms of the bonds used,
the yields on federal state bonds were adjusted using the
yield curve for central government bonds. See Schulz and

42Factors determining interest rate premiums of federal state bonds and central
government bonds
Federal state bonds regularly have higher yields
than the corresponding debt securities of central
government. A possible reason for this could be the
lower degree of liquidity of federal state bonds on
the secondary market, for which investors demand
a liquidity premium. In addition, investors could
demand higher compensation for the possible de-
fault of federal state bonds (credit risk premium).
Moreover, the spread should depend on the degree
of general risk aversion, which is not directly ob-
servable. This risk aversion indicates the general
propensity of investors to hold risky assets. In order
to determine the influencing factors, the following
panel regression is estimated with data on all
16 federal states.
spread it¼/C11 RAV tþ/C12 illiquidity itþ/C13 debt itþ/C22iþ"it
The dependent variable is the difference in the
yield between bonds with a maturity of four to
seven years of federal state iand corresponding
central government bonds at time t. The difference
in the yield between US dollar-denominated cor-
porate bonds of the lowest investment grade
category (BBB) and US government bonds is used
for measuring global risk aversion. The liquidity of
federal state bonds is shown by means of the meas-
ure presented on page 41. A federal state’s credit-
worthiness is measured by the per capita debt rela-
tive to that of the Federal Government. The hetero-
geneity between the federal states, which is not
indicated by the other explanatory variables, is cap-
tured with a state-specific fixed-effects term /C22. The
estimate is made using daily data for the period be-
tween 1996 and 2006. The results are summarised in
the adjacent table.
The results of regression A show that the spread be-
tween federal state bonds and central government
bonds actually depends to a considerable degree
on the risk aversion of investors. The more investors
are afraid of risk, the higher compensations they
demand for holding a debt security issued by a fed-
eral state rather than by the Federal Government.
In turbulent times, it is therefore mainly central
government paper that serves as a “safe haven”.
This could be a result of the higher degree of liquid-
ity of central government bonds, ie an investor can
sell a central government bond, without making aloss on the prevailing market price, more easily
than a corresponding federal state bond. This is
taken into account in regression B, which, in add-
ition to the risk aversion, also shows the concealed
liquidity premium per se in the form of a positive
coefficient: the lower the liquidity of federal state
bonds, the greater the interest rate premium for
central government bonds.
Regression C introduces per capita debt as a further
explanatory variable. A higher debt should cause
the credit risk of a federal state to rise. The esti-
mated coefficient is statistically significant and ex-
hibits the expected positive sign, testifying to the
fact that the market actually demands a premium
for the credit risk of a federal state. In economic
terms, however, the effect is small: an increase of
51,000 in per capita debt relative to that of the Fed-
eral Government would increase the interest rate
premium by no more than 1 basis point. This small
reaction is due, first, to the high creditworthiness of
German federal states, which is secured by future
tax revenue and realisable assets. Second, the fed-
eral principle, which is seen not least in the state
government revenue-sharing scheme, encourages
an implicit joint responsibility with the other fed-
eral states and the Federal Government, at least in
the eyes of market players.1
1For example, Bremen and Saarland received additional
transfers between 1994 and 2004 to overcome extreme
budgetary hardship. Following the Berlin ruling of autumn2006, the requirements for this have been sharply tighten-
ed, but further help remains possible in the future in
extreme circumstances.

43by a federal state – measured by the standard
deviation of yields – the lower the interest
rate premiums themselves. The market play-
ers’ general attitude to risk also plays a role.
In times of lower risk propensity, investors
demand a higher premium for holding federal
state bonds. State-specific factors are also im-
portant. On the one hand, they manifest
themselves as fixed effects for each federal
state; on the other, investors with increasing
per capita debt demand greater compensa-
tion from issuers. From an economic perspec-
tive, the latter effect is relatively slight, how-
ever. This is primarily a result of the federal
principle and the assumed ultimate mutual
assistance of central, state and local govern-
ment.
The yield differential between federal state
and central government bonds over time can
also be explained from yet another perspec-
tive. The greater co-movement in yields on
comparable securities can be an indication of
increasing integration in the corresponding
market. When the level of integration is high,
events affecting the entire German bond
market should be reflected in the yields of
both central government and federal state
bonds. An econometric estimate can deter-
mine the extent to which this is actually true.
The resulting estimation parameters can be
used to measure the level of integration (see
also the explanatory notes on page 44 f).
As expected, the level of integration in the
German market for domestic government
bonds has been shown to increase signifi-
cantly over time. Changes in yields on Bunds
towards the end of the period under reviewwere reflected in the co-movement in federal
state bond yields to double the extent they
had been at the beginning of the 1990s.
Market integration is not complete, however
– the corresponding coefficient is 0.7 to 0.8
and not 1. This is probably due to persisting
liquidity differences. This hypothesis is sup-
ported by the fact that the joint Jumbo bonds
issued by several federal states, which are sig-
nificantly more liquid owing to their higher
issue volume, have a much larger integration
level.
Owing to the turbulence on the financial
markets, however, the integration levels of
federal state bonds and Jumbos again fell
somewhat. Investors evidently preferred the
more liquid central government securities
during these “troubled times”. A similar de-
velopment could also be seen in the relation-
ship between Bunds and the equivalent
government securities of other euro-area
countries.
Summary and conclusions
Faced with mounting debt, the German fed-
eral states have increasingly been raising cap-
ital through the issue of bonds since the end
of the 1990s; by contrast, fewer and fewer
bank loans have been raised. Furthermore,
the federal states have tended to opt for rela-
tively large-volume bonds. In addition, joint
bonds (Jumbos) with large issue volumes
have been issued by several federal states
since 1996, but have not reached the scale of
central government bonds and five-year
notes. Yet regardless of this trend, the over-Integration of

The relationship between bon ds issue d by Germany ’s 
Federal Government an d those issue d by the country ’s 
state governments can be chara cterise d inter alia  by 
their degree of co-movement. The German market 
for domesti c government bon ds can be described as 
inte grate d if su bstituta ble debt se curities return the 
same yiel d.1 Central government bon ds (Bun ds) are 
the ben chmark for the German – as well as the Euro-
pean – bon d market. One can assume that any news 
affe ctin g the market as a whole will be reﬂ  ected 
in the movements of Bun d yiel ds. In a perfe ctly 
inte grate d market, yiel ds on Bun ds an d other bon ds 
shoul d therefore move in line with one another. This 
relationship can be estimate d usin g the followin g 
approa ch: 2
Δyjt = αjt + βjt ΔyBt + εjt
where Δyjt is the differen ce in the yiel d on a bon d 
issue d by fe deral state j at time t over ten tra ding 
days an d ΔyBt is the correspon ding chan ge in Bun d 
yiel d over the same perio d; ε is the resi dual of the 
regression. In a fully inte grate d bon d market, the two 
yiel ds shoul d move in line with one another, ie the 
coefﬁ cient β woul d be 1 an d the constant α zero. The

of 500 tra ding days, whi ch is rolle d in steps of ten days.3 Yiel ds are measure d for bon ds with a maturity 
of rou ghly ten years. 
The results of the estimate show that the constant α 
is in deed zero. By contrast, the inte gration parameter 
β is re gularly lower than 1. The chart below depi cts

45aroun d 0.8. This reﬂ  ects in creasin g co-movement in 
the yiel ds on central government an d fe deral state 
bon ds. This can pro bably be attri bute d primarily to 
a deepenin g market for fe deral state bon ds. As a 
dire ct conse quen ce of this market ’s la ck of li quidity, 
at least in the early to mi d-1990s, the possi bilities for 
arbitra ge tra ding to offset differen ces in pri ce were 
limite d. 
If one looks at the development of Jum bo bon ds 
issue d jointly by several fe deral state governments 
rather than at in dividual fe deral state bon ds, the 
degree of inte gration is systemati cally hi gher. Yiel ds 
on Jum bos, whi ch on avera ge have a consi dera bly 
lar ger issuan ce volume than simple fe deral state 
bon ds, therefore display greater co-movement with 
Bun ds than normal fe deral state bon ds. An d if one 
examines only parti cularly lar ge fe deral state bon ds 
(Jum bos an d in dividual bon ds) that are eli gible for 
tra ding on ele ctroni c platforms, the degree of inte-
gration is even hi gher. This is another in dication of 
how important li quidity is for the inte gration of the 
bon d market.
Re cently, inte gration measures for both Jum bos an d 
individual bon ds have droppe d, reﬂ ectin g wi denin g 
sprea ds between fe deral state an d central govern-
ment bon ds. This su ggests that, in the re cent ﬁ  nan cial market turmoil, investors have shown a preferen ce 
for the more li quid paper issue d by the Fe deral Gov-
ernment (see also Fa ctors determinin g interest rate 
premiums).
An in creasin g inte gration of the government bon d 
markets can be o bserve d at the European level as 
well.4 Bun ds can also be re garded as a ben chmark 
for bon ds issue d by the central governments of other 
European countries. However, in the 1990s the disper-
sion of the inte gration parameter  β described above 
was consi dera bly greater at the European level than 
it was amon g German fe deral state paper. This was 
due lar gely to ex chan ge rate volatility prior to the 
intro duction of the euro – even within the European 
Monetary System. Nevertheless, conver gen ce of the 
co-movement in yiel ds can be o bserve d up until 1999, 
whi ch can be explaine d by the anti cipate d intro duc-
tion of the euro as well as generally elevate d capital 
ﬂ ows an d greater compara bility of bon d spe ciﬁ cations 
within Europe.5 From 1999 onwar ds, the parameter β 
for euro-area government bon ds is in deed close to 1 
an d therefore hi gher than for German fe deral state 
bon ds, a development whi ch is pro bably the result 
primarily of the generally hi gher degree of li quidity 
of bon d se curities issue d by central government.

46whelming majority of federal state bonds
continue to have low issue volumes and are
not traded on the secondary markets. Since
1999, the individual federal states have not
only raised funds exclusively in euro in the
capital market but also in other currencies.
Between the 1990s and 2006, the average
interest premium on federal state bonds de-
creased considerably compared with Bunds,
but picked up again during the financial mar-
ket turbulence of 2007. One major reason for
the interest rate spread vis-/C224-vis central gov-
ernment bonds is the low degree of liquidity
of federal state bonds. In the 1990s, in par-
ticular, they were comparatively illiquid, a fact
which was reflected in higher premiums. Theparticularly liquid Jumbo bonds are therefore
usually traded at a lower interest rate pre-
mium than straight federal state bonds. The
debt level of individual federal states, in turn,
has only a slight effect on respective yields
because investors clearly expect the default
risk to be very low. Overall, the co-movement
in federal state bonds and central govern-
ment securities has increased over time. The
most recent rise in the interest rate differen-
tial was due to the general increase in market
players’ risk aversion during the financial mar-
ket turbulence. Similar trends were observed
for the bonds of other euro-area countries
and in risk pricing in financial markets in
general.
