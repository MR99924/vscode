Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The German economy recovered only slowly at 
the beginning of 2023 following the broad-  
based and strong setback in December of last 
year. Industry and construction saw another 
sharp increase in output in January, even ex -
ceeding the previous quarter’s average, but ex -
ports of goods rallied only partially in price-  
adjusted terms. Moreover, consumer- related 
sectors continue to suffer from the persistently 
high inflation and the associated reluctance on 
the part of consumers. In the retail sector, sales 
remained at the depressed level of the previous 
month in price- adjusted terms and were thus 
significantly below the previous quarter’s aver -
age. Although the GfK consumer climate re -
covered slightly of late, it stayed at a very low 
level. According to the ifo surveys, the same 
applies to enterprises’ business expectations, 
which are still mostly pessimistic despite bright -
ening further in February. The assessment of 
the business situation even deteriorated some -
what. All in all, German economic activity is 
likely to fall again in the current quarter. How -
ever, the decline is likely to be smaller than in 
the final quarter of 2022 in which economic 
output fell by 0.4%, according to revised data 
published by the Federal Statistical Office.
Industry
After seasonal adjustment, industrial output in -
creased markedly In January 2023 both on the 
previous month and on the fourth quarter 
(+2% and +1% respectively).1 In particular, 
there are signs of some bottoming- out in energy-  
intensive sectors, with seasonally adjusted out -
put in these areas even rising significantly com -
pared with the previous quarter.2 Production of 
intermediate goods, which encompasses most 
of the energy- intensive industrial sectors, there -fore increased clearly and the production of 
capital goods was also marginally expanded. A 
stronger improvement was offset by a fairly 
marked decline in the production of motor ve -
hicles and motor vehicle parts. By contrast, ac -
cording to data from the German Association 
of the Automotive Industry (VDA), the number 
of passenger cars produced rose markedly in 
January and even edged up further in February. 
Consumer goods output fell distinctly, how -
ever, driven by a considerable slump in the 
manufacture of pharmaceutical products.
At the beginning of the year, seasonally ad -
justed industrial orders expanded markedly in 
real terms compared with both the previous 
month (+1%) and the previous quarter (+1¾%). 
Excluding large orders, the increase was even 
more significant (+3%) compared with Decem -
ber. Orders from Germany climbed marginally 
on the quarter, while those from non- euro area 
countries even showed a marked rise. By con -
trast, orders from the euro area were down. In 
sectoral terms, the increase is driven mainly by 
transport equipment manufacturing. However, 
in most other sectors orders declined signifi -
cantly in some cases. Broken down by main 
category, capital goods producers were those 
recording higher orders, while there was a sig -
nificant fall among producers of intermediate 
and consumer goods.
After seasonal adjustment, nominal industrial 
sales experienced a significant month- on- 
month increase in January 2023 (+1¼%) and 
were also up on the previous quarter (+1%).

compared with the previous quarter while ex -German eco -

port sales roughly stagnated. Broken down by 
main category, capital goods producers saw 
quite a significant rise in turnover. Mechanical 
engineering revenue, in particular, was mark -
edly higher than the previous quarter’s aver -
age. By contrast, sales of consumer goods stag -
nated and producers of intermediate goods re -
corded a decline in sales. After seasonal adjust -
ment, nominal exports of goods rose markedly 
in January compared with the sharply de -
pressed level of the previous month, but were 
still down significantly on the average of the 
previous quarter. Owing to falling export prices, 
however, the decline compared with the previ -
ous quarter was only slight in real terms (-½%). 
The growth of exports to euro area countries 
counteracted the marked decrease in exports 
to non- euro area countries. Nominal imports of 
goods were down steeply again in January 
(-2%) and even showed a very considerable de -
cline (-7%) compared with the previous quar -
ter. In real terms, however, this figure is signifi -
cantly smaller (-3%), as import prices for en -
ergy plummeted. Real imports of goods from 
both the euro area and non- euro area coun -
tries decreased to roughly the same extent.
Construction
In January 2023, seasonally adjusted construc -
tion output was considerably higher following 
a weak December (+12½%). Both the main 
construction sector and the finishing trades 
saw strong growth. Construction output was 
likewise up significantly compared with the 
fourth quarter of last year (+6%), with the im -
provement likely first and foremost a counter -
reaction to the slump in December, which had 
also been intensified by the unfavourable wea -
ther conditions. The favourable weather in 
January boosted this effect further. In the light 
of the existing order backlog, the continued 
easing of labour and material shortages is also 
likely to have provided support. This is indi -
cated by the ifo Institute’s survey results. Con -
struction activity remains generally subdued, 
however. Higher construction prices and inter -Construction

est rates weighed on demand for construction 
work. New orders in the main construction sec -
tor rose slightly in December – the most recent 
month for which data are available – but were 
still considerably lower than the highs of the 
fourth quarter of 2021. The number of building 
permits also went up again after some de -
creases in December, but is still at a compara -
tively low level. On an average of January and 
February, the reach of the order books re -
mained roughly at the level of the fourth quar -
ter of 2022 according to ifo Institute surveys.
Labour market
Despite the current weak economy, labour 
market developments remained slightly posi -
tive. In seasonally adjusted terms, employment 
rose significantly in January 2023. The total 
number of persons in employment grew by 
64,000 compared with December of last year. 
At the end of 2022 (disaggregated data are not 
yet available for January), the favourable em -
ployment developments were mainly attribut -
able to employment subject to social security 
contributions, but also to exclusively low- paid 
part- time employment. Employment rose, 
above all, in a number of services sectors more 
geared towards meeting domestic demand. 
Professional, scientific, technical and other 
business- related services, the IT sector and the 
hotel and restaurant sector stand out in par -
ticular. By contrast, there was no employment 
growth in the manufacturing sector, which is 
subject to strong international competitive 
pressure. Instead, the moderate increase in 
short- time work for economic reasons at the 
end of the year was concentrated on the 
manufacturing sector. However, at the begin -
ning of 2023, notifications of short- time work 
also declined again. The other leading indica -
tors of employment growth remained largely 
stable in expansionary territory in February. This 
development in employment – which is quite 
positive in view of the economic situation  – 
could therefore continue in the coming months.In February, seasonally adjusted registered un -
employment remained virtually unchanged at 
its previous month’s level of 2.51 million 
people. The unemployment rate thus con -
tinued to hold steady at 5.5%. There were like -
wise only minimal shifts between the statutory 
insurance and basic welfare allowance 
schemes. Total underemployment, which also 
includes persons in labour market policy meas -
ures as well as language and integration 
courses, rose slightly in February. This can prob -
ably mainly be attributed to courses offered to 
Ukrainian refugees. Managers of the regional 
employment agencies are largely positive about 
the development of registered unemployment 
over the next few months. The IAB’s unemploy -
ment barometer even improved slightly of late. 
Unemployment is therefore likely to fall slightly 
in the coming months.
Prices
As in the previous months, global energy prices 
fell in February and early March, albeit less 
sharply. As this report went to press, the Euro -
pean gas price (TTF) stood at €44 per MWh, 
which was around 25% lower than at the end 
of January. The price of crude oil (Brent) also 
fell, standing at US$74 per barrel at the end of 
the period under review. The high level of sea -
borne Russian crude oil exports dampened the 
price. Concerns about demand also resurfaced 
recently. Forward quotations indicate slightly 
lower prices over the medium term. By con -
trast, estimates by the International Energy 
Agency for the second half of 2023 suggest 
that the global oil market is significantly under -
supplied and that prices may thus rise again.
Price developments at the upstream stages of 
the economy were mixed in January 2023 (lat -
est available data). The above- mentioned eas -
ing in global energy markets caused both do -
mestic and foreign prices to fall at the producer Employment up

Impact of the new HICP/ CPI weights on infl  ation 
developments  in Germany
In January 2023, the national consumer 
price index (CPI) was rebased on the year 
2020. A new base year is usually introduced 
every fi  ve years, entailing both an update to 
the CPI weighting scheme and methodo-
logical changes to the measurement of 
prices. Until now, updates to the CPI weight-
ing scheme have been based mainly on 
consumption pattern data taken from the 
sample survey of income and expenditure 
and the continuous household budget sur-
veys.1 Starting from the most recent base 
year changeover, however, consumption 
pattern data from the national accounts will 
play a greater role in the derivation of the 
new weighting shares.2 According to fi  g-
ures from the Federal Statistical Offi   ce, this 
new approach to deriving the weights ex-
plains the majority of the shifts in the CPI 
weights.3 The fact that the coronavirus pan-
demic occurred during the calculation 
period for the CPI weights was probably 
also a factor.4 Overall, the shift in the CPI 
weights was greater than usual.
Unlike the CPI weights, the weights of the 
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) 
are adjusted annually in an effort to refl  ect 
the consumption patterns of the previous 
year as closely as possible.5 The weights of 
the CPI base year provide the starting point 
for the Federal Statistical Offi   ce’s calcula-
tions. These weights are updated using the 
available detailed national accounts data on 
consumption expenditure and a price ex-
trapolation.6 Because the CPI weights under-
went an unusually signifi  cant change fol-
lowing the most recent adjustment to the 
base year, the HICP weights also shifted 
more sharply than usual. Expenditure shares 
for services increased somewhat compared 
with 2022, while the weight of goods de-
creased overall. In particular, the share of 
energy and food declined, while the share of non- energy industrial goods rose slightly. 
Looking in detail at the goods and services 
recorded in the HICP , a number of especially 
large weight adjustments become apparent. 
Most noticeably, rents and gas showed a 
sharp decline, with the former’s weight fall-
ing by just over four percentage points to 
7.3% and that of the latter roughly halving 
to 1.4%. By contrast, the weight of package 
holidays (up by 2.3  percentage points to 
3.5%) and restaurants (up by 2.1 percentage 
points to 4.9%) rose particularly strongly.
When the CPI is adapted to a new base 
year, it is usually revised backwards as far as 
the new base year. The overall extent of the 
revision to the CPI depends fi  rst on the 
scale of the changes to the weights that are 
used to weigh together the individual CPI 
sub- indices. Second, methodological changes 
to the measurement of prices for certain 
goods and services can lead to different de-
1 See Federal Statistical Offi   ce (2023a).
2 These methodological changes mainly affect the 
weights of the upper classifi  cation levels. The weights 
at the lower levels are still calculated using the results 
of the sample survey of income and expenditure and 
the continuous household budget surveys.
3 See Federal Statistical Offi   ce (2023a), pp. 10 ff. Over-
all, the adjustment of the weights was determined by 
changes in consumption volume and prices and the 
modifi  cation of the international approach to deriving 
the weights.
4 This time, in order to mitigate the impact of the 
coronavirus pandemic on the CPI weighting, an aver-
age value for the consumption pattern between 2019 
and 2021 was used rather than the consumption pat-
tern for the base year as is normally the case.
5 Unlike the CPI, the HICP is therefore a chain- linked 
index.
6 Until 2020, it was standard practice to use national 
accounts data from two years earlier to update the 
weightings. Owing to the coronavirus pandemic, since 
2021, the weights have been derived on the basis of 
the most recent data possible for the previous year. 
These include preliminary fi  gures from the national ac-
counts as well as information from the continuous 
household budget surveys and other data sources such 
as retail trade sales/ turnover, service revenues, and fi  g-
ures from transport (passengers), tourism or energy 
statistics. See Federal Statistical Offi   ce (2023b).Deutsche Bundesbank

velopments in the sub- indices and thus also 
in the overall index.7 This time, the sharp 
decrease in the weight of energy, in particu-
lar, led to a signifi  cantly lower contribution 
from energy and thus to a steep downward 
revision of the CPI rate overall, especially in 
2022. In line with this, the annual average 
rate of change for 2022 now stands at 
6.9% instead of 7.9%. Nonetheless, this is 
still an exceptionally high fi  gure that has 
not been seen since 1974. Following the re-
vision, the infl  ation rate in December 2022 
came to just 8.1% (instead of 8.6% as cal-
culated using the base year 2015). It thus 
remained lower than in November, mainly because the reporting of the immediate as-
sistance for gas and district heating bills 
had a price- lowering effect. In January, the 
annual CPI rate then rose again by 0.6 per-
centage point to 8.7% because the immedi-
ate assistance was a one- off factor that ap-
plied to December only and the new gas 
7 This time, major methodological changes with a 
marked impact on the affected CPI sub- indices for 
package holidays and air transport were made. Pack-
age holiday prices are now recorded using transaction 
data rather than offer prices, and greater market cov-
erage has been achieved. The latter applies to air 
transport prices as well. Changes in the CPI sub- indices 
are usually also refl  ected in the HICP sub- indices, as 
the prices recorded for the CPI also form the basis for 
the HICP .Consumer prices in Germany:

and electricity price brake8 probably had 
less of a dampening effect on consumer 
prices. In February, the rate stayed at 8.7%.
The HICP , on the other hand, is only revised 
in exceptional, very narrowly defi  ned cases.9 
Unlike the CPI rate, HICP infl  ation unexpect-
edly fell by a further 0.4 percentage point 
to 9.2% in January. By contrast, in Decem-
ber 2022, infl  ation had been projected to 
rise in January in line with market expect-
ations and the movement of the CPI. The 
fact that the HICP rate nevertheless fell in 
January, resulting in a signifi  cant downward 
surprise, is largely explained by the annual 
adjustment to the HICP weighting scheme.
In the December projection, the forecast for 
2023 was still based on the HICP weighting 
scheme for 2022.10 Besides this, consumer 
prices for gas were projected to continue 
rising at perceptibly higher than average 
rates despite the gas price brake. If the 
new, signifi  cantly lower weight for gas is used for 2023 instead, headline infl  ation is 
dampened by around 1 percentage point in 
all months as well as on an annual average. 
The contribution of package holiday prices 
to the HICP rate is also affected by the 
change in the weighting. However, owing 
to the pronounced seasonal pattern of this 
sub- index, the weight effect here varies 
considerably over the course of the year, 
unlike in the case of gas prices. For ex-
ample, the contribution of package holi-
days to the forecast error is markedly nega-
tive in the fi  rst few months of the year, 
standing at -0.7 percentage point in Janu-
ary.11 It then turns positive by the summer 
months, reaching a maximum of +0.7 per-
8 Although the brakes will not take effect until March, 
they will already be captured in the price statistics as of 
January on account of the reimbursements for January 
and February. For more information on this topic and 
on the assumed impact of gas and electricity prices, 
see the December 2022 projection: Deutsche Bundes-
bank (2022).
9 See Eurostat (2018), p. 31: “HICPs are in principle re-
visable, but only in limited circumstances.” These in-
clude errors and – very rarely – recalculations as a re-
sult of improved data sources and methods, provided 
they are approved by Eurostat. One such exception 
was the revision of HICP package holidays when the 
CPI was rebased to 2015 in 2019. As a special case, the 
HICP was revised up to January 2015, the start of the 
base year, owing to the signifi  cant methodological 
change in the recording of package holidays. However, 
the chain- linking of the index series led to a marked 
upward bias in the monthly year- on- year rates of the 
revised HICP in 2015. See Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2019b).
10 For the December 2022 projection, see Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2022). The weighting scheme for 2023 
was not yet known when the projection was pub-
lished.
11 It is worth noting that the contribution is negative 
even though package holiday prices were higher than 
the year before. Counterintuitive contribution effects 
such as these are the result of the HICP’s construction 
as a chain- linked index. Generally speaking, the contri-
bution of a HICP component to the infl  ation rate in the 
current year stems not only from price movements and 
the weight of the current year, but also from price 
movements in the previous year. In December 2022, 
package holiday prices reached their usual seasonal 
high before returning to normal at the beginning of 
the new year. Owing to the increased share of pack-
age holidays, the price decline between December 
2022 and January 2023 is now weighted more strongly 
than the price increase between January 2022 and De-
cember 2022. Counterintuitive contributions of this 
kind have been seen before in previous years. See, for 
example, Deutsche Bundesbank (2019, 2021) and 
European Central Bank (2019).Revision of the December 2022 HICP

level.3 Year- on- year rates also declined, to 6.6% 
for imports and 17.6% for domestic products, 
although these price decreases were solely due 
to the energy component. Excluding energy, 
however, prices for imports rose by a season -
ally adjusted 0.4% on December and for do -
mestic products by as much as 1.2%, with price 
pressures up again in the case of intermediate, 
capital and consumer goods after they had 
eased previously.
As measured by the harmonised Index of Con -
sumer Prices (HICP), consumer prices in Febru -
ary showed a somewhat weaker rise on the 
month than previously (0.6% in seasonally ad -
justed terms). The persistently high level of 
consumer price inflation was primarily driven 
by unprocessed food and, in particular, vege -
tables, where prices soared recently. In add -
ition, prices for services increased at a faster 
pace again. Together with a persistently high 
inflation rate for industrial goods, this con -
tinued to fuel core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices. By contrast, the 
rise in energy prices virtually came to a stand -
still recently. Headline inflation stood at 9.3%4 
in February 2023 and thus 0.1 percentage point 
higher than in January. Core inflation rose by 
0.3  percentage point to 5.4%, once again 
reaching the all-  time high of December 2022. 
This is all the more remarkable given that the 
update to the HICP weight applied to package 
holidays is still dampening the core rate.5
Inflation rate 
temporarily up 
again somewhat 
in February, …centage point in July. On an annual aver-
age, the one- off effects at the start of the 
year and in mid- year will more or less bal-
ance out, meaning that the forecast for the 
average infl  ation rate in 2023 ultimately re-
mains unaffected by the adjustment to the 
weight of package holidays.
Overall, almost 2 percentage points of the 
signifi  cant downward revision of the HICP 
rate in January compared with the Decem-
ber projection can be explained by the 
change in the weight of package holidays 
and gas. In February, the signifi  cance of the 
new weights for the forecast error declined 
slightly owing to the changed dynamics for 
package holidays, but still remained high. 
The core rate was somewhat lower in Janu-
ary than in the December projection, but 
was broadly in line with it in February, al-
though the weight effect for package holi-
days also had a marked dampening infl  u-
ence here. Had the weights remained un-changed, the core rate would even have 
surprised to the upside in both January and 
February. Overall, it remains at a record high 
of 5.4%.
3 Results provided by the Federal Statistical Office are pro -
visional. This is due to the electricity and gas price brake, 
which will apply from January 2023 but will not take effect 
until March 2023. For the reporting months of January and 
February, the brakes are not included in the calculations, as 
the reporting units do not yet have access to electricity and 
gas prices that take the brakes into account. With the pub -
lication of the results on March 2023, the figures for Janu -
ary and February will be revised.
4 The consumer price index (CPI), calculated for national 
purposes, rose somewhat less sharply (8.7%).

Inflation in Germany is likely to decline signifi -
cantly in March owing to a base effect. Energy 
prices had soared in March 2022 as a result of 
the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This has so far 
been reflected in a significantly higher year- on- 
year inflation rate. By contrast, from March on -
wards, the higher price level will form the basis 
for calculating the inflation rate, resulting in a 
lower overall rate. Nonetheless, core inflation is 
proving to be extremely persistent. It could 
even increase somewhat in mid- 2023, partly 
owing to the adjustments to HICP weights.

Statutory health insurance 
scheme
The statutory health insurance (SHI) scheme 
(comprising the health insurance institutions and 
the health fund) finished 2022 with a significant 
surplus, exceeding expectations and improving 
considerably on the previous year. According to 
preliminary figures, the surplus amounted to just 
over €4½ billion, following a deficit of €5½ bil -
lion in 2021.7 The results were chiefly driven by 
additional central government funds and unex -
pectedly strong contribution receipts.
At almost €4½ billion, the lion’s share of the 
surplus was generated by the health fund 
(2021: €1½ billion). At the end of the year, the 
fund’s reserves stood at €12 billion, €8 billion 
above the statutory lower limit. The health in -
surance institutions posted a small surplus of 
€½ billion. Last year, they had still been run -
ning a deficit of €7 billion. The institutions’ re -
serves were consequently up somewhat, to 
€10 billion at the end of 2022. For the health 
insurance institutions as a whole, the reserves 
were thus €5½ billion above the statutory 
lower limit.
The SHI scheme’s revenue was up by 9% on 
the year, not least because of much higher cen -
tral government payments. Central govern -
ment issued a supplementary grant of €14 bil -lion (2021: €5 billion). In addition, its refunds 
for pandemic- related special expenditure in -
creased by just over €4 billion. Contribution re -
ceipts grew steeply, by 5%. Somewhat higher 
supplementary contribution rates – up by 
0.1 percentage point on average – contributed 
around ½ percentage point to this. Excluding 
the special payments from central government 
and the higher supplementary contribution 
rates, revenue rose by just over 4% overall.
The SHI scheme’s expenditure grew by 5½%. 
The health fund incurred €21 billion for 
pandemic- related benefits, up €4 billion on the 
year. In particular, expenditure on coronavirus 
tests for the general public rose to a total of €10 
billion. In addition, the fund paid out financial 
assistance to hospitals (€7 billion) and took on a 
share of vaccination costs (€3½ billion). It also 
made special payments of €½ billion to nursing 
staff providing long- term care. Health insurance 
institutions’ spending on benefits climbed by 
4%. Spending on hospital treatment, a particu -
larly large expenditure item, rose by 2%.8 
Growth in medical treatments and pharmaceut -
icals was noticeably stronger (just over 4½% in 
each case). A substantial rise in pension provi -
sions pushed up administrative expenditure by 
7% (+2½% after adjustment for this factor).
The health fund is set to record a large deficit 
for the current year. The fund passes on the ex -
pected contribution receipts and the lower 
central government grants9 to the health insur -
ance institutions. In addition, it transfers funds … but likely to

phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the

By contrast, the chart on p. 14 shows preliminary outturns 
for 2021 as well.
8 When combined with financial assistance from the health 
fund, payments to hospitals thus increased by 4%.
9 Instead of the special grant of €14 billion that was paid 
in 2022, central government is providing an additional 
grant of €2 billion this year. Furthermore, it will issue a loan 
of €1 billion, which is to be repaid by the end of 2026.Deutsche Bundesbank

from its liquidity reserve (putting it in deficit) – 
providing the health insurance institutions with:
– for the last time, compensation for losses 
caused by the reduction of SHI contributions 
on occupational pensions since 2020 (€½ 
billion);
– owing to a special rule, a grant of €4½ bil -
lion – the amount by which the group of SHI 
estimators expected the liquidity reserve to 
be above its limit at the end of 2022 in their 
assessment from autumn of that year;10
– a transfer of just over €½ billion to the in -
novation and structural funds;
– additional funds for improvements in the 
areas of obstetrics and paediatrics (€½ bil -
lion).
Based on the assumptions used by the group 
of SHI estimators in autumn 2022, this results in a deficit of just over €6 billion in the health 
fund overall.
A deficit is likewise on the cards for the health 
insurance institutions. Based on the results of 
the group of SHI estimators and the Federal 
Ministry of Health’s estimate that the average 
supplementary contribution rate will rise to 
1.6% (+0.3  percentage point), the deficit is 
forecast to amount to around €2 billion. Health 
insurance institutions’ spending is projected to 
rise by 4½% compared with expectations for 
2022. Lower central government funds will 
weigh on revenue. Special injections from the 
health fund’s liquidity reserve only partially off -
set these cuts.
Overall, this would result in a deficit of €8 bil -
lion for the SHI scheme as a whole. From to -
day’s perspective, however, the outturn is likely Marked deficit

to be much more favourable. Last year’s results 
were far better than projected. These provide 
the starting point and are expected to continue 
to have an effect in the current year. Further -
more, contribution receipts will probably be 
higher than assumed, even though the actual 
average supplementary contribution rate is just 
under 0.1  percentage point lower than esti -
mated. All in all, the deficit could thus remain 
below €5 billion. This would ease the strain on 
the reserves.
As things stand, the provision of additional 
central government funds will have come to an 
end in 2024. The reserves will also have been more or less used up. Pressures on the supple -
mentary contribution rates will then increase 
going forward. However, the Federal Ministry 
of Health is planning fundamental reforms. 
These are to cover both the financing and ex -
penditure sides (with a particular focus on hos -
pitals). A draft law has been announced for the 
middle of the year.
Public long- term care 
insurance  scheme
The public long- term care insurance scheme re -
corded a deficit of just over €2 billion in 2022,11 
a deterioration of €1 billion compared with the 
previous year.12 This is mainly due to burdens 
arising from last year’s reform of long- term 
care. These were much higher than the declin -
ing burdens from pandemic- related special 
payments (-€1½ billion). Liquid funds shrank to 
€4½ billion at the end of 2022, falling short of 
their minimum target. As liquidity was tight, 
central government granted a loan of €1 billion 
to run beyond the end of the year.
Revenue saw a steep rise of 10%, primarily due 
to payments from central government. Since 
2022, central government has provided a regu -
lar grant of €1 billion each year to cover part of 
the burdens resulting from the latest reform of 
long- term care. The long- term care insurance 
scheme also received higher pandemic- related 
special grants13 in order to compensate in part 
for burdens arising from the pandemic. Contri -
bution receipts increased by 5½%. Under the 
reform of long- term care, the contribution rate 
for childless persons increased by 0.1 percent -Increasing

transfers from the core area corresponding to receipts of 
0.1 percentage point of the contribution rate. Assets accu -
mulated in this way are to be depleted in the 2030s to 
dampen the expected contribution rate rise. At the end of

age point to 3.4% at the start of the year. How -
ever, this increase accounted for only a minor 
share of the growth in contribution receipts.
At 11%, expenditure growth was even some -
what stronger than growth in revenue. 
Pandemic- related special payments amounted 
to €5 billion, similar to the previous year.14 The 
long- term care insurance scheme’s expenditure 
on benefits rose by 12%. This high growth is 
mainly attributable to spending on residential 
care (+24%), and this is due to the reform of 
long- term care. Since the beginning of 2022, 
the long- term care insurance scheme has been 
taking on a greater share of the costs as the 
length of residence in long- term care homes in -
creases.15 In the draft law, the Federal Govern -
ment projected additional expenditure of €2½ 
billion for this purpose. However, the actual 
costs are likely to have been much higher. Cash 
benefits continued to grow by a substantial 
7%, even though benefit rates remained un -
changed.
The financial situation of the long- term care in -
surance scheme is likely to be far better this 
year. For one, there will no longer be any net 
burdens from special coronavirus- related pay -
ments. In addition, a further reform of long-  
term care has been announced that will ameli -
orate the financial situation at first. According 
to press reports, the planned measures (in par -
ticular raising contribution rates and postpon -
ing transfers to the long- term care provident 
fund) will significantly improve the financial 
situation of the long- term care insurance 
scheme. This will temporarily mask the under -
lying trend of a deteriorating financial situation.
In concrete terms, the first stage of the an -
nounced reform of long- term care appears to 
involve sharply raising the contribution rate of 
3.05% in mid- 2023 by 0.35 percentage point 
(additional revenue of around €3 billion in 
2023). In addition, the Federal Ministry of 
Health is to implement a decision by the Fed -
eral Constitutional Court ruling that, as of Au -
gust 2023 at the latest, the relevant factor for determining the contribution rate should no 
longer simply be whether contribution payers 
have children. Instead, the contributions to be Expenditure

14 The long- term care insurance scheme reimbursed non- 
residential and (semi-)residential long- term care facilities for 
coronavirus testing costs (€2 billion). Furthermore, these fa -
cilities received financial compensation for additional ex -
penditure relating to the pandemic. They were also com -
pensated for revenue shortfalls caused by the non- utilisa -
tion of long-  term care services on account of the pan -
demic. Overall, the compensation for additional expenditure 
and revenue shortfalls amounted to almost €2½ billion. In 
addition, bonuses of €½ billion were paid to nursing staff 
providing long- term care.
15 The co- contribution rate of long- term care recipients 
drops to 30% after a three- year period of residence. How -
ever, the limitation on residents’ co- contribution does not 
apply to fees for accommodation, food and investment.Deutsche Bundesbank

paid must be differentiated according to the 
number of children they have. For the contribu -
tion rate of 3.4%, which is to be applied for 
persons with one child, contributions are ap -
parently to be divided evenly between enter -
prises and contribution payers. Any supple -
ments or reductions according to the number 
of children a contribution payer has affect the 
long- term care insurance scheme members 
alone and not employers. The supplement to 
the general contribution rate paid by childless 
persons is set to rise to 0.60 percentage point. 
Persons with more than one child are to be 
granted a reduction of 0.15 percentage point 
per child. However, as of the fifth child, the 
contribution rate would remain at 2.80% (1.1% 
for contribution payers, 1.7% for employers). 
Furthermore, the plans envisage suspending 
the long- term care insurance scheme’s repay -
ment of central government’s 2022 loan of €1 
billion until the end of 2028. Transfers to the 
long- term care provident fund for 2023 are not 
scheduled for payment until next year (just over 
€1½ billion). Overall, the reform would im -
prove the long-  term care insurance scheme’s 
finances by a little more than €5½ billion this 
year.
Benefits are set to expand substantially in the 
coming year. The long- term care insurance 
scheme is to reimburse care recipients in long- 
term care homes a larger share of costs. Co-  
contribution is to be cut further, by up to 
10 percentage points. In addition, it should be -
come easier to use replacement care and short- 
term care services. The long-  term care allow -
ance and non- residential non- cash care bene -
fits are earmarked to rise by 5%. These were 
last adjusted with the 2017 reform of long-  
term care. All in all, additional expenditure is 
estimated to amount to just over €2 billion in 
2024. It is unclear to what extent this already 
reflects the impact of rising prices for services 
in care homes. In addition, postponing trans -
fers to the long- term care provident fund for 
this year will result in a one- off additional bur -
den of just over €1½ billion. A further increase 
of 5% in the aforementioned benefit rates is scheduled for 2025 (€1 billion in additional ex -
penditure). In the case of residential long- term 
care, by contrast, the effects of limiting co-  
contribution will be felt. The continued rise in 
prices for services in care homes is likely to lead 
to considerable additional expenditure next 
year, as is already currently the case.
All in all, however, the additional revenue gen -
erated by the higher contribution rate is ex -
pected to exceed the additional expenditure 
next year, too. Nevertheless, the further dy -
namic adjustment of benefits as well as demo -
graphic developments will continue to put in -
creasing pressure on the long- term care insur -
ance scheme. Without a fundamental reform 
of financing and benefits, contribution rates 
will have to be raised time and time again.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €129.6 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in January 2023 was significantly 
up on the previous month’s figure of €80.4 bil -
lion. After taking account of increased redemp -
tions and changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, the outstanding volume of 
domestic bonds rose by €25.0 billion, following 
a drop of €31.4 billion in December 2022. The 
outstanding volume of foreign debt securities 
in the German market grew by €30.6 billion, 
which meant that the outstanding volume of 
domestic and foreign debt securities in Ger -
many increased by €55.5 billion on balance in 
January.
Domestic credit institutions issued bonds total -
ling €17.3 billion net in January, following net 
redemptions of €15.5 billion in the previous 
month. Mortgage Pfandbriefe (€7.9 billion) ac -
counted for the largest share of issues, fol -
lowed by other bank debt securities that can 
be structured flexibly (€5.3 billion) and debt 
securities issued by specialised credit institu -

Domestic enterprises expanded their capital 
market debt by €4.3 billion in January, follow -
ing net redemptions of €6.1 billion in Decem -
ber. The bulk of this net issuance was attribut -
able to non- financial corporations.
The public sector issued bonds worth €3.3 bil -
lion net in the reporting month. Central gov -
ernment increased its capital market debt by 
€7.0 billion. It chiefly issued ten- year Federal 
bonds (Bunds) (€7.6 billion), five- year Federal 
notes (Bobls) (€6.2 billion) and two- year Fed -
eral Treasury notes (Schätze) (€5.4 billion). By 
contrast, it redeemed Treasury discount paper 
(Bubills) worth €12.5 billion. State and local 
governments redeemed bonds with a net value 
of €3.7 billion.
Domestic non- banks were the strongest group 
of buyers in January. They added bonds total -
ling €22.2 billion net to their portfolios, most 
of which took the form of foreign securities. 
Non- resident investors purchased domestic 
debt securities for a net €15.0 billion. Domestic 
credit institutions acquired bonds worth €10.5 
billion net. These were all foreign securities, on 
balance. The Bundesbank acquired debt secur -
ities amounting to €7.8 billion net, predomin -
antly under the Eurosystem’s asset purchase 
programmes. The vast majority of those pur -
chases involved domestic paper issued by the 
public sector.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
raised fresh capital resources of €0.1 billion on 
balance by placing new shares in the German 
equity market. Net issuance of foreign equities 
in Germany totalled €5.3 billion. Domestic 
credit institutions and domestic non- banks 
were the main buyers, purchasing shares 
amounting to €2.9 billion and €2.2 billion net, 
respectively.Mutual funds
Domestic mutual funds recorded inflows of 
€8.0 billion in January, compared with €11.9 
billion in December. The main beneficiaries 
were specialised funds reserved for institutional 
investors (€5.5 billion). Of the various asset 
classes, equity funds (€2.5 billion), mixed secur -
ities funds (€2.1 billion), open-  end real estate 
funds (€1.9 billion) and bond funds (€1.6 bil -
lion) attracted the most investment. Foreign 
mutual funds placed shares worth €4.9 billion 
in the German market in January. On balance, 
domestic non- banks were virtually the only 
purchasers of mutual fund shares in the report -
ing month (€16.8 billion). Foreign investors 
purchased German mutual fund shares worth a 
net €0.2 billion, while domestic credit institu -

Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €16.2 billion in January 2023, down €9.4 bil -
lion on the previous month’s level. This was at -
tributable to a decline in the goods account 
surplus and in the invisible current transactions 
balance, in particular, which comprises services 
as well as primary and secondary income.
In January, the surplus in the goods account fell 
by €1.0 billion to €9.9 billion because receipts 
recorded a sharper decline than expenditure.
The surplus in invisible current transactions de -
creased by €8.5 billion to €6.3 billion. This was 
mainly because net receipts in primary income 
contracted by €8.4 billion to €12.8 billion. 
Lower revenue following the payment of the 
EU’s agricultural subsidies to Germany in De -
cember 2022 made a particular contribution to 
this decrease. In addition, receipts from invest -
ment income fell. The surplus of €1.4 billion in 
the services account in December 2022 turned 
into a deficit of the same amount in the report -
ing month. Receipts fell more sharply than ex -
penditure, mainly in the area of charges for the 
use of intellectual property, computer services 
and other business services. By contrast, the 
deficit in the secondary income account nar -
rowed by €2.7 billion to €5.1 billion. Although 
receipts declined, expenditure fell more sharply, 
with lower general government expenditure on 
current transfers relating to international co -
operation playing a particular role.
In January 2023, financial markets showed an 
increasing appetite for risk owing to the 
brighter economic outlook. Germany’s cross-  
border portfolio investment generated net cap -
ital exports of €24.3 billion (December: €52.5 
billion). German investors increased their hold -
ings of foreign securities by €39.8 billion, pur -
chasing bonds (€24.5 billion), money market 
paper (€6.1 billion), mutual fund shares (€4.9 
billion) and shares (€4.3 billion). Conversely,

In January, transactions in financial derivatives

Direct investment recorded net capital exports 
of €14.5 billion in January (December: €26.4 
billion). Foreign enterprises decreased their dir -
ect investment in Germany by €21.9 billion. 
This was attributable to net redemptions in 
intra- group lending (€25.4 billion), predomin -
antly in financial loans. By contrast, foreign 
companies injected their affiliates in Germany 
with additional equity capital (€3.5 billion), 
with reinvested earnings playing an important 
role. In the opposite direction, German enter -
prises likewise scaled back their foreign direct 
investment by €7.4 billion, reducing the volume 
of both trade credits (€9.7 billion) and financial 
loans (€3.6 billion) to business units abroad. By comparison, they stepped up their equity cap -
ital in affiliates abroad by €5.9 billion, almost 
exclusively by reinvesting earnings.
Other statistically recorded investment – which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these

German balance of payments in 2022
In 2022, the German economy’s current account surplus decreased by 3½ percentage points to 
4¼% of nominal gross domestic product (GDP). This represents the largest decline since German 
reunification and the lowest figure for the balance since 2003. The main driver of this was the 
considerable decline in the surplus on the goods account, which was a result of the massive 
deterioration in the terms of trade. This was caused by the sharp rises in the prices of energy and 
other imported commodities. The German services account likewise deteriorated. Here, a contri -
bution was made by cross- border travel expenditure, which rose back to its level from before the 
COVID-  19 pandemic. The balance of primary and secondary income remained more or less 
unchanged. Aggregate net lending/ net borrowing fell relative to GDP, as there was a sharp reduc -
tion in aggregate savings. The reason for this was the decline in the saving ratios of households 
and non- financial corporations, which had risen during the pandemic. The general government 
deficit decreased somewhat. On the one hand, many of the fiscal measures related to the COVID- 
19 pandemic came to an end. On the other hand, however, extensive new support measures 
were introduced in response to the energy crisis and high inflation.
Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine as well as the high rates of inflation and the monet -
ary policy response to inflation were also reflected in Germany’s capital flows with other coun -
tries. In the financial markets, the more difficult environment led to lower turnover and a greater 
desire for safety amongst investors. All in all, Germany’s net external assets rose by €220 billion 
last year resulting from transactions.
Significant changes were observed, above all, in German portfolio investment. Cross- border 
demand for shares and mutual fund shares declined markedly in both directions. In net terms, 
German investors sold off foreign shares and non- residents also parted with German shares. By 
contrast, bonds again attracted greater mutual interest. In addition to lower risk, higher yields are 
likely to have played a role here. Tighter monetary policy on both sides of the Atlantic had a 
major impact on these developments. For example, the Eurosystem discontinued net purchases 
under its asset purchase programmes, which had a direct impact on German portfolio transac -
tions.
Last year, it was confirmed once again that direct investment does not respond to burdens as 
quickly as portfolio investment. Cross- border exposures involving German investors were remark -
ably robust in this segment. By contrast, the other investment account partly reflected the major 
changes in securities: the considerable decline in new investment in securities was offset to a not 
insignificant degree by higher net claims on non- residents.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current account
Underlying trends in the 
current  account
The German current account surplus declined 
considerably in 2022. It fell by €116½ billion to 
€162 billion. At 3½ percentage points, this also 
represented the largest decrease in relation to 
nominal GDP since German reunification. As a 
result, the balance stood at 4¼% of GDP , which 
is the lowest value since 2003. Over the course 
of the year, changes in energy prices related to 
the war against Ukraine led to exceptionally 
strong fluctuations in Germany’s current ac -count. In the third quarter, as a result of the en -
ergy price shock, the current account surplus 
plummeted to 2¼% of GDP in seasonally ad -
justed terms, after having stood at 6½% at the 
end of the previous year. In the fourth quarter, 
however, the balance rose rapidly again to 
more than 4¾% of GDP .
In 2022, the main driver of developments in 
the German current account was the consider -
able decline in the goods trade balance. This 
was a result of the massive deterioration in the 
terms of trade caused by the sharp rises in the 
prices of energy and other imported commod -
ities. The services balance likewise deteriorated. 
This was attributable to the normalisation of 
German residents’ cross- border travel following 
two years of low activity due to the COVID-  19 
pandemic. Combined, the balance of primary 
and secondary income remained more or less 
unchanged.
In 2022, German enterprises were faced with a 
turbulent global environment. The high rates of 
inflation and tighter monetary policy in many 
regions, the Russian war of aggression against 
Ukraine, and some persistent effects of the 
COVID-  19 pandemic all weighed on global eco -
nomic developments. Developments in global 
trade were rather muted, owing especially to 
the weak contributions from emerging market 
economies. Furthermore, in Germany, the rise 
in energy prices was comparatively sharp. The 
prices of imports to Germany increased due, in 
particular, to the relatively strong depreciation 
of the euro.1 From a macroeconomic perspec -
tive, this depreciation improved German price 
competitiveness to some extent. However, 
energy-  intensive enterprises are likely to have 
suffered significantly in terms of price competi -
tiveness, as they are affected by the energy 
price shock to a greater degree.Current account

Germany’s foreign trade surplus declined sig -
nificantly. This was mainly due to strong, nega -
tive price effects, which were only marginally 
offset by positive volume effects. The lower 
foreign trade balance was therefore a result of 
sharply higher import prices. In terms of vol -
ume, imports decreased to a somewhat greater 
extent than exports. The German terms of 
trade fell by around 9¼% on the year, as im -
port prices rose significantly more sharply than 
export prices (+26% compared with +14½%).
In regional terms, the current account surplus 
declined particularly vis- à- vis non- euro area 
countries, falling by 3  percentage points to 
1¾% of GDP . This was chiefly attributable to 
the smaller surplus on the goods account. The 
high import prices for energy were a major fac -
tor in this context. In addition, the decline in 
the services balance also contributed to this re -
sult. This reflects the strong increase in travel 
vis- à- vis both the rest of the euro area and the 
rest of the world.
From the perspective of savings and invest -
ment, aggregate net lending/ net borrowing fell 
considerably, in line with the current account 
balance. In this context, net investment relative 
to GDP increased only marginally. Enterprises’ 
investment in machinery and equipment con -
tinued to see robust growth in 2022 as a result 
of catch- up effects. Housing investment like -
wise grew substantially in nominal terms due 
to the sharp rises in construction costs. A more 
significant factor behind the decline in net 
lending/ net borrowing was the strong decrease 
in domestic saving. With households needing 
to compensate for their loss of purchasing 
power and with the normalisation of previously 
subdued consumption, the household saving 
ratio returned roughly to its pre- pandemic 
level. Corporate saving declined as well. This 
was attributable partly to higher distributions 
and partly to lower transfers received. In 2022, 
the government started to wind down its assis -
tance measures related to the COVID-  19 pan -
demic. Over the course of the year, compre -
hensive new support measures were gradually introduced in response to the energy crisis and 
the high rates of inflation, but, on the whole, 
these measures were smaller in scale than 
those of previous years. Overall, net lending/  
net borrowing among households and non-  
financial corporations fell quite sharply, while 
general government’s deficit position de -
creased. Compared with pre- pandemic levels, 
aggregate net lending/ net borrowing relative 
to GDP was lower in 2022. This is attributable 
primarily to general government posting a def -
icit while households and enterprises made a 
broadly similar contribution to what they had 
in 2019.

the prices of energy products. As a result, the 
foreign trade surplus narrowed by €95½ billion 
to €79½ billion. In price- adjusted terms, how -
ever, exports were down ½% on the previous 
year and imports saw a somewhat stronger dip 
of 1¾% on the year.2
In regional terms, nominal exports to the euro 
area countries grew almost as strongly as those 
to non- euro area countries. Sales to the United 
States saw very significant expansion. This was 
supported by the depreciation of the euro 
against the US dollar. In addition, German ex -
porters recorded very sharp rises in revenues 
from major sales regions in South and East Asia as well as Europe. However, business with 
China, which had been particularly booming in 
many of the preceding years, saw below aver -
age growth. This was due to the relatively 
moderate growth of the Chinese economy, 
which had also felt the impact of the stringent 
measures taken to contain the COVID-  19 pan -
demic. Deliveries to Russia collapsed as a result 
of EU sanctions and behavioural adjustments in 
response to Russia’s war against Ukraine, 
amongst other reasons. Exports to Ukraine also 
declined significantly. This was partly offset by 
the goods delivered in connection with the 
war.3 However, accounting for only 0.3%, ex -
ports to Ukraine were of minimal significance 
to German exporters in 2022.
Export developments were highly heteroge -
neous across various product categories. In 
price- adjusted terms, there was significant 
growth in deliveries of consumer goods. Here, 
exports of pharmaceutical products saw espe -
cially strong expansion. Exports of motor ve -
hicles and motor vehicle parts also rose very 
sharply. Motor vehicle production in Germany 
stalled at times in March following the out -
break of Russia’s war against Ukraine, given the 
absence of deliveries of motor vehicle parts 
from Ukraine. However, as these and other pre- 
existing global supply bottlenecks abated, do -
mestic motor vehicle production, and subse -
quently exports, picked up considerable mo -
mentum. There were marked declines in ex -
ports of chemical products as well as metals 
and fabricated metal products. The energy-  
intensive production of these goods was bur -
dened by the large rises in energy prices. In On annual

2 Contrary to the foreign trade statistics, real goods ex -
ports rose by 1½% and goods imports by 2¾% when cal -
culated using the national accounts approach. One reason 
for these divergent developments is that the foreign trade 
price indices weight goods according to their shares in the 
base year of 2015. In the national accounts, however, price 
changes for imported and exported goods are weighted 
using the goods’ current shares. During periods that exhibit 
highly heterogeneous price increases for individual goods, 
such as 2022, there can be marked differences in the 
shares used for each of the two calculation methods.

and relief aid totalling €2 billion; see Federal Government 
(2023).Deutsche Bundesbank

addition, exports of energy products decreased 
significantly. This was attributable to declining 
exports of gas, which was also due to a drop in 
foreign demand for gas.4 By contrast, there 
was growth in deliveries of refined petroleum 
products and electricity.5
The revenue of foreign manufacturers from 
goods deliveries to Germany rose very sharply 
for a broad range of products. Imports of 
motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts in -
creased considerably in price- adjusted terms. In 
this context, a role was played by the fact that 
purchases were brought forward seeing as 
government subsidies for purchases of electric 
vehicles were scaled back at the end of 2022. 
Deliveries of machinery likewise recorded 
strong expansion. The sharp increase in imports 
of intermediate goods benefited from easing 
supply bottlenecks. This also affected electronic 
and electrical equipment. Imports of chemical 
products, which were still stagnating in the 
previous year, saw massive growth. One reason 
for these imports was probably to substitute 
for domestic production, which was throttled 
due to energy prices. Deliveries of consumer 
goods were also up considerably.
By contrast, energy imports fell very sharply in 
price- adjusted terms owing to a very substan -
tial decrease in gas imports. This was attribut -
able to the decline in energy consumption in 
Germany as a result of hugely increased energy 
prices. The drop in consumption was con -
nected with both energy savings as well as pro -
duction cutbacks in individual sectors.6 By con -
trast, coal imports were expanded, also for use 
in power stations. In addition, more crude oil 
was delivered to Germany. However, the add -

offset the decline in gas volumes to some ex -
tent.
Broken down by region, almost all major trad -
ing partners recorded very sharp growth in rev -
enues from their deliveries to Germany. In this 
context, nominal imports from non- euro area 
countries increased by almost twice as much as 
those from euro area countries. First, non- euro 
area countries benefited from greater demand 
for their specific product mix. They offer a rela -
tively wide selection of electronic and electrical 
equipment as well as clothing. Second, the 
prices of energy products, which make up a 
larger share of these countries’ product ranges, 
went up particularly sharply. The rise in the 
prices of energy products was also a key factor 
in the growth in Russian revenue from Ger -
many. By contrast, the volume of energy im -
ports from Russia plummeted.
The other components of trade in goods 
– which include the supplementary trade items, 
net goods exports in merchanting trade, and 
trade in non- monetary gold – mitigated the de -
cline in the foreign trade balance overall.7 As a 
result, the surplus on the goods account fell by 
€82½ billion in 2022, which was much smaller 
than the decline in the foreign trade surplus.Invisible current transactions
The balance of the cross- border services ac -
count was deep into negative territory in 2022. 
Having been positive in each of the two pre -
ceding years of the pandemic, the balance 
reached a deficit of €31 billion in the reporting 
year. On the one hand, receipts went up by 
18% on the year to almost €408 billion in 
2022, with revenue growth in the transporta -
tion sector playing an important role. On the 
other hand, however, expenditure rose signifi -
cantly more strongly, climbing by just under 
29%. This was due mainly to the increase in 
travel expenditure, which returned to pre-  
pandemic levels, as well as to considerably 
higher transport expenditure.
At €55 billion, the sub- account for cross- border 
travel posted the highest nominal deficit in its Much greater

7 This was primarily attributable to the sharp rise in net re -
ceipts from merchanting trade, which grew by €8 billion, 
as sales rose more sharply than purchases overall. A signifi -
cant contribution to this was made by transactions in the 
automotive industry, which generally comprise a large pro -
portion of such business. In addition, the supplementary 
trade items increased by €5 billion on balance. In this con -
text, a role was also played by the strong rise in imports for 
contract processing in Germany. Furthermore, there was a 
sharp rise in the c.i.f. charges for imports, amongst others; 
these comprise the costs of freight and insurance from the 
border of the supplier’s country to the German border. By 
contrast, net expenditure for trade in non- monetary gold 
remained virtually unchanged.Deutsche Bundesbank

existence. Travel receipts –  which Germany 
generates largely through travel for trade fairs, 
events and business trips  – continued to fall 
significantly short of pre- pandemic levels. By 
contrast, increasing numbers of individuals resi -
dent in Germany were travelling abroad again 
as many pandemic- related restrictions were 
lifted. Travel expenditure doubled compared 
with the year before. The main beneficiaries 
were the Mediterranean and Alpine countries. 
However, spending on long- distance travel re -
mained significantly below pre-  pandemic 
levels. It was not until partway through 2022 
that travel to Asia, in particular, was again pos -
sible on a larger scale.
The sub- account for cross- border transport ser -
vices had already expanded by around 40% 
back in 2021, mainly owing to the increased 
freight prices in international goods transport 
caused by higher energy prices. Starting from 
this elevated level, the reporting year saw fur -
ther sales increases of more than one- third on 
both sides of the balance sheet for fees from 
sea, air and ground transport as well as pipe -
line and electricity transmission. On balance, 
the deficit in this sub- account rose moderately, 
climbing by €2 billion to €8½ billion for Ger -
many. Other components of the services ac -
count related to the goods trade, such as 
manufacturing, maintenance and repair ser -
vices, experienced only marginal changes in 
their balances compared with 2021.
In the reporting year, too, there was a one- off 
effect on the revenue side under the item 
“Charges for the use of intellectual property”. 
As in the previous year, this was related to li -
censing following the development of vac -
cines. This effect was once again evident and 
at just a slightly reduced level, meaning that 
the surplus of €31½ billion in the sub- account 
was only marginally lower than in the previous 
year.

iture for other knowledge- based and business 
services rose fairly sharply. The resulting deficit … due to

of €21½ billion was attributable in around 
equal part to cross- border telecommunications 
and information services as well as other busi -
ness services, with the former accounting for a 
larger share of year-on-year deficit growth. The 
latter services comprise research and develop -
ment, professional, technical and commercial 
services, and management consultancy ser -
vices. The other components of the services ac -
count remained virtually unchanged in terms of 
both sales and balances.
Following its massive increase in 2021, the pri -
mary income surplus also grew significantly in 
the reporting year. Given the sharp decline in 
the goods surplus, net primary income, at just 
under 4% of GDP in 2022 (€150 billion), un -
usually made up the largest share of the cur -
rent account surplus. Combined, cross- border 
compensation of employees and other primary 
income recorded a small deficit.
The surplus in primary income was mainly at -
tributable to net investment income. According 
to the Bundesbank’s preliminary calculations, 
income for domestic investors and capital 
donors from cross- border investment grew by 
one- sixth. This increase is heavily attributable to 
the upturn in receipts from direct investment, 
which also includes reinvested earnings. In -
come from non- euro area investments in -
creased not only because of high corporate 
profits abroad but also because of the weaker 
euro exchange rate. In addition, the turn -
around in interest rates had an impact on 
banks’ revenue. Interest income doubled, albeit 
from a low level. Payments by domestic actors 
to foreign financiers rose by one- quarter in 
2022 compared with the previous year. This 
was driven mainly by dividend payments on 
portfolio investments and other investment ex -
penditure from the financial sector due to 
higher interest rates. Owing to the consider -
able net external assets of residents in Ger -
many, it was despite the unusually sharp in -
crease in expenditure that, for Germany, net in -
come rose by €15 billion on the year to €153 
billion in absolute terms.The traditional deficit in the cross- border sec -
ondary income account widened significantly 
last year. The increase of €10 billion to €69 bil -
lion was due primarily to higher expenditure. 
Half of the deterioration in the account balance 
was attributable to unilateral non- government 
cross- border payments. Growing remittances 
from immigrants to their countries of origin 
played a certain role in this context. Cash and 
non- cash donations made by households to 
Ukraine were another factor, though. Govern -
ment payments to non- residents rose markedly, 
while receipts remained broadly unchanged. 
On the revenue side, EU coronavirus assistance 
decreased considerably in 2022. This gap was 
partly plugged by increasing receipts from in -
come and wealth taxes on non- residents. 
Meanwhile, government expenditure went up, 
for example as a result of Germany’s contribu -
tions to the EU budget based on gross national 
income as well as government assistance to 
Ukraine.
Capital movements
Underlying trends in capital 
movements
Reflecting the decline in the current account 
surplus, the balance of the financial account, at 
€220 billion, was also significantly lower than 
in the previous year (€248½ billion).8 In 2022, 
Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, 
high inflation and the global tightening of 
monetary policy impacted the international 
financial markets by leading to falling prices in 
the equity and bond markets. At the same 
time, the high level of uncertainty dampened 
investors’ risk appetite, meaning that domestic 
fixed income securities were more in demand 
than equities, despite the price losses in the 
bond markets.Other

As early as the beginning of the year, the inter -
national financial markets were already being 
affected by rising inflationary risks, which 
stemmed largely from the fact that global 
growth was increasing whilst at the same time 
supply- side constraints continued to exist. Rus -
sia’s attack on Ukraine at the end of February 
then led to massive increases in commodity 
and food prices and sharply intensified price 
pressures, which also impacted inflation ex -
pectations in the medium term. As a result, 
major central banks moved more quickly to -
wards monetary policy normalisation. The 
Eurosystem therefore decided in March 2022 
to scale back net purchases under the asset 
purchase programme (APP) more rapidly over 
the course of the second quarter than it had 
envisaged in December 2021. In addition, the 
Governing Council of the ECB began raising its 
key interest rates in its July 2022 meeting and 
had increased them by a total of 250 basis 
points by the end of the year; at its final meet -
ing of 2022, it made clear that it would con -
tinue to raise interest rates.
The aforementioned factors were also reflected 
in the behaviour of portfolio investors with an 
international focus. Their risk appetite, i.e. their 
willingness to invest in comparatively risky 
assets such as mutual fund shares or shares, 
declined markedly. Instead, domestic and US 
bonds were in fairly strong demand, with their 
risk/ return profiles improving over the course of 
the year relative to an investment in shares. Dir -
ect investment tends to be based more on 
long-  term considerations, which means that it 
takes longer for the effect of current negative 
factors to feed through. In this respect, the 
outward direct investment of German enter -
prises was only slightly below the previous 
year’s level. Foreign enterprises, too, expanded 
their direct investment in Germany, but less so 
than in the year before. Other investment partly 
mirrored developments in portfolio investment: 
as, on balance, German investors sought sig -
nificantly fewer foreign portfolio securities, 
German excess savings were increasingly re -
flected in net exports in other investment.The Bundesbank’s TARGET2 claims on the ECB 
exceeded the previous year’s figure by €8½ bil -
lion, thus reaching a new peak. Transactions in 
the TARGET2 payment instrument are based on 
individual decisions made by a wide range of 
participants. These individual decisions, for 
their part, are determined by the general 
macroeconomic environment but potentially 
also by specific characteristics of individual 
banks participating in TARGET2. A Bundesbank 
study presented on pp. 35ff. examines the ex -
tent to which the balances of the national cen -
tral banks resulting from individual decisions 
are determined by the bank- specific character -
istics. It concludes that these individual factors German capital

have played only a minor role in the rise in Ger -
man TARGET2 claims over the past few years.
Portfolio investment
Portfolio investment generated relatively low 
net capital exports of €24½ billion in 2022 
(previous year: €203½ billion) amidst a signifi -
cant drop in trading volumes. One major rea -
son for this decline is likely to have been the 
high level of uncertainty in the markets as a re -
sult of high inflation and Russia’s war of ag -
gression against Ukraine. This uncertainty was 
reflected in reduced risk appetite, meaning that 
investors, on the whole, were reluctant to 
make investment decisions regarding securities. 
Similarly sharp declines occurred in 2020 
(coronavirus pandemic) and 2011 (European 
sovereign debt crisis).
Against this backdrop, portfolio investment 
abroad by German investors rose by only €16½ billion on balance. This is the lowest this figure 
has been since 2008. In 2021, German invest -
ors had added foreign securities worth €175 
billion to their portfolios. Interest in foreign 
mutual fund shares, in particular, declined in 
the reporting year. Net purchases of this instru -
ment amounted to €33½ billion in 2022, which 
was well below the previous year’s figure 
(€116½ billion). In view of the significant price 
losses, investors appear to have been holding 
back on investing in this instrument.
Purchases of foreign debt securities were bal -
anced out by sales and redemptions. Although 
German investors sold bonds worth €12½ bil -
lion on balance, they purchased money market 
paper worth the same amount. Over the course 
of 2022 as a whole, German investors added 
US bonds to their portfolios, amongst other 
things. In addition to the interest rate advan -
tage of these debt securities, investors opting 
for a safe haven in connection with the war of 
aggression against Ukraine is likely to have 
played a role here. There was also high de -
mand for interest- bearing instruments from 
Canada and Ireland.
Decreased risk appetite and investor caution is 
even more evident in the equities segment. On 
balance, resident investors sold shares of for -
eign enterprises for a net amount of €16½ bil -
lion. In the previous year, they had expanded 
their portfolios by €47 billion. In the first quar -
ter, German investors offloaded European 
shares, in particular. This behaviour is consist -
ent with the especially sharp drop in European 
equity indices following Russia’s attack on 
Ukraine.9 However, this trend reversed as the 
year progressed. Over the course of 2022 as a 
whole, German investors sold shares from 
France, Switzerland and the United Kingdom in 
particular. By contrast, they acquired a large 
volume of equities from the United States, Can -
ada and Australia.Lower flows

Foreign portfolio investment in Germany gen -
erated net capital exports of €7½ billion in 
2022 (previous year: €28½ billion). Over the 
year, foreign investors sold shares of German 
enterprises (€4½ billion) and mutual fund 
shares (€3 billion). This was in line with the 
price losses in the German equity market, espe -
cially in the first half of the year. Towards the 
middle of the year, pressure to sell eased and 
investors returned to the German market. Equi -
ties benefited from improving sentiment in the 
euro area and from reports of the first deliver -
ies of liquefied gas being made and high gas 
storage levels, which pushed concerns about 
an energy crisis into the background. Sellers 
were located in the Netherlands, Luxembourg 
and the United States, in particular. By contrast, 
investors from the United Kingdom, Spain and 
Switzerland were some of the main buyers of 
German shares on balance.
Non- resident investors acquired debt securities 
to the tune of €½ billion. At the same time, 
they offloaded money market paper (€37 bil -
lion). This is likely to have been due in part to 
the declining outstanding volume of German 
short- term debt securities. In view of rising 
interest rates, it became more attractive for do -
mestic market participants to raise funding via 
secured loans (repo transactions). At the same 
time, foreign investors sought bonds issued by 
enterprises, the public sector and banks – 
worth a combined €37½ billion. Net purchases 
of the first two instruments were made by the 
Eurosystem under the pandemic emergency 
purchase programme (PEPP) until March 2022 
and under the APP until June 2022. In the past, 
net asset purchases for monetary policy pur -
poses were a major reason why, on balance, 
foreign investors sold domestic debt securities. 
With the expiry of the purchase programmes, a 
dominant domestic buyer has now exited the 
market.
Financial derivatives (which are aggregated to 
form a single item in the balance of payments) 
recorded net capital exports of €42½ billion in 
2022, a clear decline from the year before (€60 billion). Forward and futures contracts relating 
to electricity and gas bucked this general trend, 
however. Amid the turbulence in the energy 
markets, net capital exports were recorded. In 
the previous year, trading in this segment had 
still yielded German net capital imports.
Direct investment
The large number of events and developments 
that fuelled global uncertainty in 2022 also af -
fected global direct investment. The United Na -
tions Conference on Trade and Development 
(UNCTAD) observed a marked decline in new 
investment projects after the first quarter of 
2022 and the start of the Russian war of ag -
gression against Ukraine. This included green -
field project announcements as well as inter -
national project finance deals and cross- border 
mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Nevertheless, 
according to UNCTAD’s estimate, the number 
of greenfield project announcements was Foreign investors

around 6% higher for 2022 as a whole than in 
the previous year. By contrast, cross- border 
M&A transactions were reported to be around 
6% lower than the previous year’s figure. When 
examined in detail, the figures aggregated 
across all countries and regions were driven by 
fairly different developments.10
German enterprises operating internationally 
also faced particular challenges in 2022. The 
coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine, 
as well as their far- reaching economic conse -
quences, significantly hampered cross- border 
business for many enterprises and also influ -
enced their investment decisions.11 An environ -
ment with more risks and greater uncertainty 
– including for business conditions – makes it 
harder to calculate cross- border exposures. 
However, direct investment is generally longer- 
term in nature. It is affected less immediately 
by acute events than other forms of investment 
that instead pursue short- term returns.12 Ger-
man inward and outward direct investment 
therefore proved to be quite robust in 2022 
despite the particularly difficult economic envir -
onment. It recorded net capital exports of 
€125½ billion – a new peak from a long- term 
perspective, even exceeding the particularly 
high figure of €100½ billion the previous year. 
This was partly due to the fact that German 
outward investment once again grew very 
strongly, while foreign investment in Germany

12 Direct investment is usually more long-  term in nature, 
and adjustments are also more likely to take place over the 
longer term. Nevertheless, shorter- term arrangements be -
tween affiliated enterprises also affect cross- border direct 
investment flows. For example, this may be the case when 
an entity in one country provides certain cross- border 
financial services to entities in other countries. In recent 
years, this sort of cross- border relocation of business activ -
ity has been observed in the context of the United King -
dom’s withdrawal from the European Union, which is also 
reflected time and again in direct investment flows to and 
from Germany.Deutsche Bundesbank

year. It was probably to the advantage of Ger -
man direct investment that Germany’s direct 
capital links with Russia – despite its strong de -
pendency in some sensitive areas  – were al -
ready limited before the latter’s invasion of 
Ukraine. At the end of 2021, for example, these 
direct investment stocks accounted for only 
around 1% of Germany’s total direct invest -
ment stocks abroad. In addition, the large- scale 
withdrawal of some German enterprises from 
business with Russia was balanced out by the 
increased focus placed on future projects with 
other partner countries.
Enterprises domiciled in Germany invested 
€169 billion abroad in 2022, only slightly less 
than in the previous year (€181 billion). They 
once again strongly expanded their equity in -
vestments in foreign affiliates in particular 
(€114 billion). Reinvested profits accounted for 
more than half of these funds. This meant that 
these played a greater role last year than equity 
capital in the narrower sense, determined as 
the balance of new investment and liquidation 
in direct investment. Comparatively high cross- 
border transaction values were recorded for 
enterprises specialised in providing financial 
and insurance services.13 In terms of volume, 
cross- border corporate takeovers by firms 
based in Germany also played a certain role last 
year – but to a much lesser extent than in pre -
vious years, in line with the subdued global 
trend.14
In 2022, enterprises domiciled in Germany also 
issued a considerable amount – €55 billion – to 
affiliated enterprises abroad via intra- group 
credit transactions, which was only slightly less 
than in the previous year (€59½ billion). Ger -
man firms mainly granted short- term loans and 
trade credits to subsidiaries and affiliated enter -
prises abroad. Comparatively more favourable 
financing conditions are likely to have played a 
role here. By contrast, for subsidiaries domi -
ciled in Germany, repayments of loans previ -
ously granted to their parent enterprises abroad 
dominated.German enterprises engage in direct invest -
ment in many countries all over the globe. A

was made in other euro area countries on bal -
ance. Particularly large amounts flowed into 
Luxembourg (€29½ billion) and the Nether -
lands (€19 billion), both of which have been 
significant holding company locations for years. 
German enterprises also made major net in -
vestments in France (€15 billion) and Spain (€13 
billion). In the rest of Europe, the United King -
dom in particular attracted funds from affiliated 
enterprises (€10½ billion). Outside Europe, the 
United States (€19 billion) and China (€11½ bil -
lion) were targets of large- scale German direct 
investment. Sweden, by contrast, was the 
source of larger net return flows of funds to 
Germany in 2022 (€16 billion).Foreign enterprises provided domestic enter -
prises with direct investment funds totalling 
€43½ billion in 2022. This was significantly less 
than in the previous year (€80½ billion). For -
eign enterprises provided these funds mainly 
through intra- group lending (€29 billion), with 
loans making up more than two- thirds thereof. 
Loans granted by foreign subsidiaries to their 
German parent companies were the dominant 
factor here. As regards these reverse flows, last 
year parent enterprises in Germany redeemed 
long-  term loans that had previously been 
granted to them by subsidiaries domiciled 
abroad. In return, they received significantly 
more short- term credit. On balance, foreign in -
vestors increased their equity investment in af -
filiated enterprises in Germany by €15 billion.
Direct investment in Germany by firms from the 
United States (€17½ billion), Ireland (€13½ bil -
lion) and France (€11 billion) was particularly 
high in 2022. This was dominated by intra-  
group lending. By contrast, there were larger 
return flows of funds to Luxembourg (€25 bil -
lion).
Other investment
Other investment, comprising loans and trade 
credits (where these do not constitute direct in -
vestment) as well as bank deposits and other 
assets, saw net capital exports of €23 billion in 
2022. In 2021, other investment had given rise 
to net capital imports of €147½ billion. The 
balance of other investment often sees volatil -
ity – including changes in sign – but the rever -
sal of trend in 2022 was particularly large. This 
was mainly due to net capital exports of €11½ 
billion in the banking system, which had re -
corded net capital imports of €152 billion in 
2021. On balance, both claims and liabilities 
falling under “other investment” increased sig -
nificantly less in 2022 than in the previous year.

Do bank- specifi  c factors affect net cross- border 
transactions  in TARGET2?*
At the onset of the global fi  nancial crisis, 
TARGET2 claims on the ECB began to accu-
mulate on the Bundesbank’s balance sheet. 
In the years that followed, periods charac-
terised by growing balances alternated with 
phases of temporary declines. The Bundes-
bank regularly comments on the develop-
ment of TARGET2 balances in the Euro-
system in its Monthly Reports as well as in 
its Annual Report.1 These analyses are 
based on macroeconomic interrelationships 
and, as of 2015, on the evaluation of asset 
purchases made by the Eurosystem under 
the asset purchase programme (APP).
By contrast, the present analysis focuses on 
microeconomic factors, looking at the bilat-
eral payments of individual banks in 
TARGET2. The analysis differentiates be-
tween customer payments, interbank pay-
ments, intragroup payments of banks con-
nected to the system, transactions related 
to the settlement of ancillary systems, and 
transactions involving at least one (domes-
tic or foreign) central bank. The study is 
based on transaction data from the German component of the Eurosystem’s TARGET2 
settlement system (TARGET2- Bundesbank) 
covering the period from January 2009 to 
December 2021. The micro data enable re-
lationships to be identifi  ed not only at the 
country level but also for individual credit 
institutions. These micro data are linked to 
the yearly data on the balance sheets and 
profi  t and loss accounts of domestic and 
foreign banks provided by BankFocus (Bur-
eau van Dijk). In the empirical analysis, 
these serve as explanatory variables for the 
TARGET2 transactions.
The chart below shows end- of- month val-
ues of the German TARGET2 balance from 
January 2003 to February 2023. TARGET2 
claims increased sharply during three time 
periods: between the onset of the global 
fi  nancial market crisis in 2008 and the peak 
of the European sovereign debt crisis in 
mid- 2012, upon the launch of the public 
sector purchase programme (PSPP) in early

2015, and upon the outbreak of the corona-
virus pandemic and subsequent implemen-
tation of the pandemic emergency pur-
chase programme (PEPP) in 2020.
In the analysis presented here, we investi-
gate the extent to which individual charac-
teristics of the commercial banks participat-
ing in TARGET2 also infl  uence the develop-
ment of TARGET2 balances alongside the 
macroeconomic relationships that have al-
ready been examined. To study this aspect, 
we use transaction data from TARGET2- 
Bundesbank relating to individual bank ac-
counts. The raw data comprise bilateral 
pairs: a sender and a recipient of euro pay-
ments. Either the sender or the recipient 
has to be a bank holding an account in 
TARGET2- Bundesbank. By contrast, the 
partner bank must be connected to 
TARGET2 abroad, as domestic transactions 
have no impact on Germany’s TARGET2 
balance. The analysis assigns a bank to a specifi  c country according to the TARGET2 
component in which the account is held.
The TARGET2 transaction data contain in-
formation about the type of payment. This 
is derived from the corresponding text fi  eld 
of the SWIFT message that is used.2 The 
chart below shows the 12- month moving 
average of total net cross- border fl  ows to 
German banks for the period from January 
2009 to December 2021 and compares the 
overall development of net fl  ows to Ger-
man banks with the development of the 
following categories of transaction: cus-
tomer payments, interbank payments, in-
tragroup payments of connected banks, 
central bank payments, payments related to 
2 SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial 
Telecommunication) is a cooperative institution estab-
lished by banks that operates a network for the ex-
change of electronic messages, especially payment 
messages. A SWIFT payment message is merely a pay-
ment instruction; the payment is settled via a payment 
system or correspondent banking connection.

ancillary systems, and other transactions 
(rest). In general, the developments in each 
category vary strongly depending on the 
specifi  c type of transaction. Customer pay-
ments, interbank payments and central 
bank payments in particular tend to in-
crease Germany’s overall TARGET2 claims.3
The positive balance (infl  ows minus out-
fl  ows) of customer payments corresponds 
to Germany’s current account surpluses 
during the observation period. However, in-
dividual customer payments are not neces-
sarily linked to current account transactions, 
since they may also refl  ect transactions 
made on behalf of customers, such as 
securities purchases or other forms of in-
vestment. The positive net fl  ows in inter-
bank payments may refl  ect different fi  nan-
cing conditions among commercial banks in 
the euro area. For example, German banks 
may generally fi  nd it relatively easy to ob-
tain liquidity from private markets, whereas 
banks in other countries in some cases rely 
more heavily on open market operations 
with the central bank. This might favour 
payment fl  ows towards Germany. Finally, 
central bank payments also continually in-
creased Germany’s TARGET2 balance.
Other types of transaction have a negative 
impact on German TARGET2 claims, namely 
intragroup payments and transactions re-
lated to the settlement of ancillary systems.4 
One possible interpretation of the negative 
intragroup balance is that German banks, 
which hold a large part of the Eurosystem’s 
excess liquidity, provide loans to their for-
eign branches and subsidiaries. The nega-
tive balance of ancillary system transactions 
is large but diffi   cult to interpret from an 
economic perspective, as information on 
the underlying transactions is not available.5 
This also applies to the residual “other trans-
actions” category, as it predominantly con-
tains transactions conducted more for tech-nical reasons as a result of the way that 
TARGET2 is designed. Liquidity transfers to 
and from TARGET2- Securities (T2S) are one 
of the key factors here.6
The present analysis examines potential de-
terminants among German and foreign 
banks that are able to explain the develop-
ment of the German TARGET2 balance. The

clude, for example, securities settlement, large- value 
and retail payment systems.

equity, and liquidity, in each case for Ger-
man and foreign banks, respectively. Analo-
gously to the treatment of net fl  ows, all 
German or foreign factors are normalised 
by dividing them by the total assets of the 
German or foreign bank in the previous 
year t–1. πgf denotes German and foreign 
bank bilateral fi  xed effects, which absorb 
specifi  c, time- invariant relationships be-
tween the institutions. Since German banks 
interact with multiple banks in a given 
country, the estimation also controls for any 
country– time- varying fi  xed effects σct. These 
completely absorb macroeconomic country- 
specifi  c effects on the German TARGET2 
balance. εgft is the statistical error term.8 The 
parameter vectors β and γ indicate whether 
and to what extent individual factors of 
German banks or foreign banks matter for 
the (relative) net fl  ows to Germany in 
TARGET2. The estimates are carried out in 
the aggregate for all transaction categories 
as well as separately for the individual trans-
action categories.
The table on p. 39 presents the estimation 
results.9 Column 1 shows the estimates for 
German net infl  ows in aggregate terms 
across all transaction categories. An in-
crease in the liquidity ratio of German banks 
in the previous period of 1 percentage point 
leads to a statistically signifi  cant rise in in-
fl  ows via TARGET2 of 0.14  percentage 
point. All other German and foreign deter-
minants are insignifi  cant. At fi  rst glance, 
this result appears to contradict the eco-
nomic intuition that German banks with 
abundant liquidity have an incentive to in-
vest these liquid assets abroad. However, 
this does not seem to be the key factor. Ra-
ther, such banks appear to be especially at-
tractive for foreign counterparties such that 
the latter provide them with additional 
liquidity. Column 2 shows the estimates for 
German net infl  ows via customer payments. It appears that only German bank factors 
make a signifi  cant contribution: claims on 
central banks weakly reduce net fl  ows to 
Germany. Customer deposits, bank deposits 
and the general liquidity ratio increase the 
central bank liquidity of German commer-
cial banks. Customer payments on behalf of 
non- fi  nancial corporations mainly accrue to 
credit institutions that engage heavily in re-
tail banking and the interbank market. As a 
result, these banks receive more liquidity in 
the customer payments category via 
TARGET2. In quantitative terms, however, 
the effects are rather minor. Column 3 
presents the estimates for German net in-
fl  ows via the interbank market. According 
to these results, only German banks’ profi  ts 
have a (weak) positive effect. All other co-
effi   cients are insignifi  cant. Column 4 shows 
the estimates for German net infl  ows via 
intra group payments. German bank factors 
do not play any role here. Higher equity of 
foreign banks increases net fl  ows to Ger-
many. Column 5 presents the estimates for 
German net infl  ows via central bank pay-
ments. They provide mixed results. German 
banks with higher claims on central banks 
receive lower additional net fl  ows from 
abroad. These banks clearly do not need 
additional liquidity. Net fl  ows from abroad 
are higher if both the German and the for-
eign bank have higher liquidity. Similar to 
other transaction categories, overall liquid-
ity and claims on central banks work in the 
opposite direction. According to the esti-
7 The majority of each bank’s claims are likely to be on 
the respective national central bank. However, this bal-
ance sheet item may also include claims on central 
banks from other countries.

The group of German banks and the group of foreign 
banks take into account that the data within each

standard errors across these two groups.

by dividing them by the total assets of the 
German or foreign bank in the previous 
year t–1. πgf denotes German and foreign 
bank bilateral fi  xed effects, which absorb 
specifi  c, time- invariant relationships be-
tween the institutions. Since German banks 
interact with multiple banks in a given 
country, the estimation also controls for any 
country– time- varying fi  xed effects σct. These 
completely absorb macroeconomic country- 
specifi  c effects on the German TARGET2 
balance. εgft is the statistical error term.8 The 
parameter vectors β and γ indicate whether 
and to what extent individual factors of 
German banks or foreign banks matter for 
the (relative) net fl  ows to Germany in 
TARGET2. The estimates are carried out in 
the aggregate for all transaction categories 
as well as separately for the individual trans-
action categories.
The table on p. 39 presents the estimation 
results.9 Column 1 shows the estimates for 
German net infl  ows in aggregate terms 
across all transaction categories. An in-
crease in the liquidity ratio of German banks 
in the previous period of 1 percentage point 
leads to a statistically signifi  cant rise in in-
fl  ows via TARGET2 of 0.14  percentage 
point. All other German and foreign deter-
minants are insignifi  cant. At fi  rst glance, 
this result appears to contradict the eco-
nomic intuition that German banks with 
abundant liquidity have an incentive to in-
vest these liquid assets abroad. However, 
this does not seem to be the key factor. Ra-
ther, such banks appear to be especially at-
tractive for foreign counterparties such that 
the latter provide them with additional 
liquidity. Column 2 shows the estimates for 
German net infl  ows via customer payments. It appears that only German bank factors 
make a signifi  cant contribution: claims on 
central banks weakly reduce net fl  ows to 
Germany. Customer deposits, bank deposits 
and the general liquidity ratio increase the 
central bank liquidity of German commer-
cial banks. Customer payments on behalf of 
non- fi  nancial corporations mainly accrue to 
credit institutions that engage heavily in re-
tail banking and the interbank market. As a 
result, these banks receive more liquidity in 
the customer payments category via 
TARGET2. In quantitative terms, however, 
the effects are rather minor. Column 3 
presents the estimates for German net in-
fl  ows via the interbank market. According 
to these results, only German banks’ profi  ts 
have a (weak) positive effect. All other co-
effi   cients are insignifi  cant. Column 4 shows 
the estimates for German net infl  ows via 
intra group payments. German bank factors 
do not play any role here. Higher equity of 
foreign banks increases net fl  ows to Ger-
many. Column 5 presents the estimates for 
German net infl  ows via central bank pay-
ments. They provide mixed results. German 
banks with higher claims on central banks 
receive lower additional net fl  ows from 
abroad. These banks clearly do not need 
additional liquidity. Net fl  ows from abroad 
are higher if both the German and the for-
eign bank have higher liquidity. Similar to 
other transaction categories, overall liquid-
ity and claims on central banks work in the 
opposite direction. According to the esti-
7 The majority of each bank’s claims are likely to be on 
the respective national central bank. However, this bal-
ance sheet item may also include claims on central 
banks from other countries.
8 The standard errors are clustered over two groups. 
The group of German banks and the group of foreign 
banks take into account that the data within each 
group are not independent. The analysis clusters all 
standard errors across these two groups.
9 The data set excludes all observations if one of the 
German or foreign factors exhibits a missing value. 
Some factors are not included in the estimates be-
cause the clustering across German and foreign banks 
does not produce standard errors in some cases.mates, only existing central bank liquidity 
impedes additional fi  nancial infl  ows. In add-
ition, higher profi  ts at foreign banks are as-
sociated with lower net fl  ows to Germany.10 
Column 6 presents the estimates for Ger-
man net infl  ows via ancillary system trans-
actions. Some of the coeffi   cients are statis-
tically signifi  cant. However, owing to the 
different types of ancillary systems and the 
lack of information on the underlying trans-
actions, the results cannot be interpreted 
from an economic perspective.The aim of this study is to examine whether 
individual characteristics of German and 
foreign banks can explain the German 
TARGET2 balance. Individual bank charac-
teristics provide only limited additional ex-
planatory power. On balance, it appears 
that macroeconomic effects and time- 
invariant relationships between German The impact of bank factors on German TARGET2 net fl  ows

else being equal, the Bundesbank’s claims aris -
ing from currency and deposits rose by €14 bil -
lion. Of this amount, €8½ billion was attribut -
able to the increase in the Bundesbank’s 
TARGET2 balance compared with the previous 
year; in 2021, the increase was significantly 
higher, at €125 billion. By contrast, the Bundes -
bank’s liabilities to non- residents arising from 
currency and deposits fell by €90½ billion in 
2022. The bulk of the decline was driven by 
lower deposits from non- euro area residents 
compared with the end of December 2021. At 
that time, the Bundesbank’s counterparties 
from non-  euro area countries had temporarily 
increased their deposits particularly sharply at 
the end of the year.15 The Bundesbank’s liabil -
ities arising from the allocation of euro bank -
notes within the Eurosystem went up by €9 bil -
lion last year.
Transactions via the accounts of monetary 
financial institutions (MFIs) excluding the 
Bundesbank resulted in net capital imports in 2022. They amounted to €93½ billion, which 
meant that they were nearly twice as high as in 
2021. This was primarily down to higher de -
posits by foreign institutions, almost half of 
which were group-  affiliated banks. However, 
deposits by foreign enterprises and households 
also rose significantly. On the assets side, MFIs 
domiciled in Germany (excluding the Bundes -
bank) increased their deposits with foreign in -
stitutions. They also issued more loans to for -
eign non- banks. On balance, their claims on 
foreign enterprises and households increased 
more strongly than their claims on foreign 
banks.
The cross- border activities of non- banks led to 
net capital exports of €11½ billion in other in -
vestment, overtaking 2021 (€4½ billion). This 
was helped along by enterprises’ and house -
holds’ transactions producing net capital ex -
ports of €32 billion. They primarily issued short- Other MFIs

of the development of cross- border fl  ows 
of central bank liquidity in TARGET2. At the 
microeconomic level, German bank charac-
teristics play a more important role than 
characteristics of foreign banks. According 
to the estimates, a German bank with rela-
tively large claims on central banks receives 
less additional central bank liquidity from 
abroad than a German bank with compara-
tively small central bank claims. However, 
higher overall liquidity of a German credit 
institution leads to stronger net infl  ows. 
Foreign bank characteristics are only rele-
vant for central bank payments and intra-
group payments.
In addition, descriptive analyses reveal dif-
ferences between different transaction cat-
egories in TARGET2. While customer pay-
ments, interbank payments and central 
bank payments increased net capital fl  ows to Germany overall, intragroup payments 
and transactions related to the settlement 
of ancillary systems led to net outfl  ows.

term loans to foreign counterparties and, in 
turn, repaid foreign loans, which were also pre -
dominantly short- term. Conversely, their cross- 
border claims arising from currency and de -
posits declined. In comparison, transactions by 
general government gave rise to net capital im -
ports of €20 billion in 2022.
Reserve assets
The Bundesbank’s reserve assets increased by 
€4½ billion in 2022 on account of transactions. 
This was due to an increase in other reserve 
assets, special drawing rights and the reserve 
position in the International Monetary Fund.The international reserve holdings are also in -
fluenced by balance sheet adjustments which, 
in compliance with internationally agreed ac -
counting standards, are not recognised in the 
balance of payments. The end- of- year revalu -
ation of the reserve assets resulted in an in -
crease of just over €10½ billion in 2022. This 
was due chiefly to an increase in gold prices 
compared to the previous year. On the report -
ing date of 31 December 2022, the value of 
Germany’s reserve assets stood at €276½ bil -
lion. Reserve assets

The impact of digitalisation on labour 
productivity  growth
The evolution of labour productivity is a key determinant of economic growth and prosperity. 
Over the past few decades, productivity growth in many industrial countries has been low in spite 
of the rapid diffusion of digital technologies, which is generally credited with having the poten -
tial to sustainably increase labour productivity. The question therefore arises as to what extent 
digitalisation actually leads to productivity gains.
Digital transformation can influence labour productivity through various channels. A frequently 
studied transmission channel focuses on investment in digital goods. Another transmission chan -
nel, which has received less attention to date, is that of digital intermediate inputs, which feed 
into numerous goods via production linkages. A multi- sector model shows that this channel plays 
an important role, and that the contribution of digital transformation to labour productivity 
growth is greatly underestimated if digital intermediate inputs are excluded. In addition, the 
analysis finds that efficiency gains in the digital sectors – measured in terms of the evolution of 
total factor productivity – are of key importance. Without these gains, labour productivity growth 
would have been significantly lower in several of the larger euro area countries, with productiv -
ity even stagnating, in some cases.
Nevertheless, it should be noted that the efficiency gains resulting from digital transformation 
have tended to decline over time. It remains to be seen whether the notable increase in the use 
and diffusion of digital technologies during the coronavirus pandemic marks a turning point in 
this regard. Surveys of firms, at least, arrive at a rather optimistic assessment of the situation.Deutsche Bundesbank

Motivation
Similarly to the advent of electrification at the 
beginning of the 20th century, digitalisation 
can be regarded as the driving force behind a 
fundamental economic structural change. 
Digital transformation processes, such as the 
increasing automation of production processes 
and the growing use of robots and digital plat -
forms, can trigger significant changes at the 
firm and industry levels. However, the actual 
macroeconomic impact of digitalisation is still 
being studied intensively (for more on this, see 
the box on pp. 48 f.). A key issue is the import -
ance of digital transformation for labour prod -
uctivity growth.1
Given the increasing diffusion of digital tech -
nologies, it may seem surprising that labour 
productivity growth has been declining for 
some time now in many advanced economies, 
including the large euro area economies. On 
the one hand, there are a number of structural 
factors, such as demographic change and insti -
tutional and regulatory barriers, that may be 
hindering the potential efficiency gains of 
digital transformation.2 Furthermore, there is 
evidence of measurement problems that could 
potentially lead to an underestimation of the 
productivity gains resulting from digitalisation.3 
On the other hand, however, there is also a group of “techno- pessimists”, who regard 
digital technologies as being less transforma -
tive than generally assumed. In their opinion, 
digital technologies do not have the same po -
tential to cause major leaps in productivity as 
previous waves of innovation, triggered, for ex -
ample, by the development of the steam en -
gine or electrification.4 They also see signs that 
the development of digital innovations is be -
coming increasingly costly and therefore ever 
more difficult to achieve.5 Additionally, in their 
view, it should be borne in mind that innov -
ations do not enhance productivity until they 
are implemented. If new technologies – such 
as artificial intelligence or quantum comput -
ing – are not widely used, their productivity-  
enhancing potential will only be able to unfold 
to a limited extent.6 Indeed, there are indica -
tions of a widening productivity gap between 
highly productive and less productive firms. 
This is also interpreted as a sign of weakening 
technology diffusion.7
This article studies the importance of the pro -
duction and use of digital goods for the evolu -
tion of aggregate labour productivity in the 
four largest euro area countries compared with 
the situation in the United States. To this end, 
structural macroeconomic models depicting 
key transmission channels are used. In particu -
lar, production networks are modelled, as the 
impact of digitalisation on productivity can also 
arise from input- output linkages. First of all, 
however, the challenge of adequately captur -
ing digitalisation must be addressed.Question of the

Measurement and develop -
ment of digitalisation
To quantify the macroeconomic effects of 
digital transformation, a delineation of digitali -
sation is needed. However, there is no clear- cut 
definition of digital transformation. Interpreted 
narrowly, digitalisation is the collection, storage 
and processing of information.8 Broader defin -
itions describe digitalisation as a range of new 
applications of information and communica -
tion technology (ICT) in business models and 
products.9 Various indicators are therefore used 
to measure an economy’s degree of digitalisa -
tion. In addition to findings on the diffusion 
and application of digital technologies among 
households, firms and the public sector, these 
indicators comprise investment expenditure on 
digital goods as well as output and efficiency 
gains in those sectors that predominantly pro -
vide digital goods and services. Although they 
do not necessarily produce a consistent picture, 
they do provide initial indications of the macro -
economic importance of digitalisation. Further -
more, a closer inspection of these indicators re -
veals key aspects that need to be taken into ac -
count when interpreting model- based ana -
lyses. This concerns, for example, measurement 
problems, which can limit the informative value 
of cross- sectional comparisons between coun -
tries.
Indicators on the diffusion 
and application of digital 
technologies 
The European Commission uses the Digital 
Economy and Society Index (DESI) to capture 
the diffusion and use of digital technologies in 
the EU Member States.10 This indicator, which 
is largely based on survey data, consists of four 
equally weighted components that assess the 
spread of digitalisation in terms of infrastruc -
ture (“connectivity”), the corporate sector (“in -
tegration of digital technology”), public admin -
istration (“digital public services”) and the pub -
lic’s digital skills (“human capital”).11 As a result of conceptual revisions, the current version of 
the DESI is only available for the years 2017 to 
2022.12
According to the DESI, the use of digital tech -
nologies in the EU has been increasing in re -
cent years. This is particularly evident in the 
case of digital public services and connectivity. 
A comparison across countries produces a 
mixed picture, however. A clear discrepancy 
can be seen between the frontrunners, such as 
Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands, and 
countries with the lowest indicator values, such 
as Greece, Bulgaria and Romania.13 While there 
has also been marked progress in the past few 
years among the countries that are lagging be -
hind, the divide between them and the EU 
countries with the highest indicator values has 
widened.14
The four largest euro area countries are hover -
ing around the EU average, with Spain most re -
cently performing the best and Italy the worst. 
In all four countries, at times considerable pro -
gress has been made over time.15 Particularly in 
the COVID-  19 years, marked improvements 
were seen. The increase in the use of mobile No clear- cut

9 See, inter alia, International Monetary Fund (2018).
10 The indicator was developed in the context of the 
Digital Single Market Strategy. See European Commission 
(2015).
11 The “connectivity” component refers to the coverage of 
fixed and mobile broadband connections in an EU Member 
State and the corresponding prices. The use of digital solu -
tions in the corporate sector – such as social media, elec -
tronic communication and accounting systems, artificial in -
telligence, cloud services and big data analytics – form part 
of the “integration of digital technology” component. The 
“digital public services” component captures the extent to 
which the services of public administrations are provided in 
a digital format. The “human capital” component incorpor -
ates the number of university graduates in ICT as well as 
ICT training measures. For a detailed description of the 
DESI, see European Commission (2022a).
12 The indicator largely uses data from the previous year. 
The main reference period for the DESI 2022 is therefore 
2021.
13 See also European Commission (2022b).
14 Compared with the DESI 2017, the difference between 
the average of the three EU countries with the lowest indi -
cator values and that of the three with the highest indica -
tor values rose by 30% according to the DESI 2022.
15 During this period, the indicator rose by approximately 
50% in Spain, by almost 60% in Germany and France and 
by as much as around 75% in Italy.Deutsche Bundesbank

internet and the integration of digital technolo -
gies by small and medium-  sized enterprises 
was especially striking.
The International Digital Economy and Society 
Index (I-DESI), also published by the European 
Commission, makes it possible to assess the 
progress of digitalisation in the EU in a global 
context.16 The latest published results show 
that the United States is well ahead of the EU 
in this respect. There are also indications that 
digitalisation in the United States is progressing 
more dynamically compared with the EU.
Investment expenditure on 
digital goods
Another approach to capturing digitalisation 
looks at investment expenditure in the area of 
ICT as recorded in the national accounts.17 ICT 
investment is considered to be a key transmis -
sion channel through which digitalisation can 
have a productivity- enhancing effect. This is 
achieved, on the one hand, by equipping more 
workplaces with ICT capital.18 Moreover, the 
quality of the capital stock may improve. In this 
context, a number of studies stress the import -
ance of capital- embodied technological pro -
gress that is only unleashed by investment.19In the EU, ICT investment expenditure increased 
markedly in relation to total gross fixed capital 
formation between 1999 and 2020. However, 
this masks diverging developments. The share 
of investment in software and databases in -
creased significantly, whilst investment in tele -
communications equipment and computer 
hardware decreased markedly relative to total 
investment. In terms of individual countries, the 
picture is indeed mixed. While the share of ICT 
investment in gross fixed capital formation in 
France, Italy and Spain increased significantly in 
some cases between 1999 and 2020, it fell 
markedly in Germany. The relative importance 
of the individual categories of fixed ICT assets 
also differs between the four largest euro area 
countries. Investment in software and data -Diffusion of

I-DESI3
16 The I-  DESI, which is only partially comparable to the 
DESI due to methodological differences, covers the EU27 
Member States, the EU as a whole and the United States, 
inter alia. See also Foley et al. (2020). The I-DESI addition -
ally contains the component “internet use by the general 
public”, which also comprises the use of social media, on -
line banking and video calling. Furthermore, the weighting 
of the main components differs between the two indica -
tors. The I- DESI was last published in 2020 and is based on 
data up to 2018. For information on the methodology used 
for the DESI and the I- DESI, see European Commission

bases accounts for a much larger share of gross 
fixed capital formation in France, Italy and 
Spain than in Germany.20
In the United States, too, software and data -
bases account for the bulk of ICT investment. 
Similarly to the development in the EU, their 
share in gross fixed capital formation increased 
significantly between 1999 and 2020, while 
the share of telecommunications equipment, 
computers and hardware decreased. The share 
of ICT investment as a whole increased slightly 
over the period under review.
When looking at the share of ICT investment, it 
should be noted that there are specific price 
trends behind expenditure developments. 
These can differ considerably across categories 
of fixed assets. According to the official figures, 
the quality- adjusted price of ICT products in the 
United States halved between 1999 and 2020, 
while the deflator of total gross fixed capital 
formation increased by almost one- third. This 
implies that ICT investment grew by around 7% 
per year in real terms. By contrast, price-  
adjusted gross fixed capital formation as a 
whole rose by an average of around 2% per 
year. Qualitatively comparable developments 
are also evident for the EU, where real ICT in -
vestment rose by an average of 4% per year 
compared with an average growth rate of 1% for price- adjusted gross fixed capital formation 
as a whole.
In these comparisons, it should also be noted 
that the national accounts metrics are fraught 
with a number of measurement problems, 
which hinder comparisons between countries. 
Digital goods are classified differently in some 
cases. Moreover, a meaningful cross-  country 
comparison is made more difficult by the fact 
that statistical methods for measuring ICT in -
vestment are not fully harmonised. This is all 
the more important as the quantification of ICT 
investment poses particular challenges. For ex -
ample, technical progress is often expressed in 
the form of quality improvements. In the case 
of ICT goods, however, these are, in some 
cases, insufficiently recorded in official statistics 
– as shown by a number of studies.21 Finally, 
for several years now the recorded statistics for 
investment, particularly in intellectual property 
(which includes software and databases) have, 
in some countries, been greatly distorted by High importance

A comparison of online and oﬄ   ine prices in Germany
In the course of increasing digitalisation, 
trade via online stores and digital market-
places has been growing more important, 
which can potentially affect price- setting 
behaviour. Everyday experience and aca-
demic studies show that the prices of many 
goods undergo only infrequent adjust-
ments.1 However, the rate of change of 
those prices that are adjusted is typically 
high when compared with the average in-
fl  ation rate.
Against this background, the question 
arises as to whether increasing digitalisation 
has affected price setting, and if so, how. It 
is conceivable that online prices might ad-
just more frequently but less sharply owing 
to a lower cost of changing prices and 
greater transparency.2This analysis is based on microdata which 
enter the German Consumer Price Index 
(CPI) and have been recently made available 
for research purposes.3 The dataset com-
prises around 14.5 million price spells for 
the years 2015 to 2019. A distinction is 
made between eight outlet types, including 
internet trade.4 There are online and offl   ine 
markets for some 290 product groups, such 
as women’s sports shoes. These product

al. (2022).
2 For an overview of studies on differences in price set-
ting between offl   ine and online markets, see, for ex-
ample, European Central Bank (2021). Cavallo (2017) 
fi  nds no major differences in pricing behaviours by 
marketplace among multi- channel traders, while 
Gorodnichenko et al. (2018) report that online retailers 
change prices more frequently.
3 These fi  ndings are based on Bundesbank work 
within the ESCB research network “Price- setting Micro-
data Analysis Network” (PRISMA). See, inter alia, 
Strasser et al. (2023).

Production of digital goods
Evidence for the macroeconomic importance 
of digitalisation can also be found on the sup -
ply side of the national accounts. One standard 
indicator is the gross value added share of the 
digital sectors.23 These economic sectors are 
characterised by a high concentration of digital 
goods producers.24 However, their definition is 
generally not particularly clear- cut.25 In add -
ition, the industry composition may differ be -
tween countries. This, too, limits the informa -
tive value of comparative analyses.26 When 
studying shares of value added, it should also 
be noted that these do not fully capture the 
economic significance of the digital sectors. For 
example, the output of digital goods producers 
feeds into a wide range of goods and services 
via intermediate products.In the EU, digital sectors accounted for around 
7% of total gross value added in 2020. Their 
share was thus roughly as high as 20 years earl -
ier. In Germany, the share of value added in the 
digital sectors was, in some cases, significantly 
higher than in the other three largest euro area 
countries. It also increased slightly in Germany Shares in gross

the EU, …groups make up approximately 16% of the 
consumer basket covered by the German 
CPI, mainly industrial goods, but also some 
processed food products such as frozen 
food and alcoholic beverages.5 The price 
changes are calculated at the individual 
product level in a given store and subse-
quently aggregated.6
In fact, the data show that, overall, online 
prices are changed more frequently than 
offl   ine prices (17% per month on average, 
compared with 11%), especially for indus-
trial goods. By contrast, prices of processed 
food products are changed somewhat 
more frequently offl   ine. Price changes due 
to sales are one reason for this. If sales are 
excluded, the prices of industrial goods are 
still adjusted more frequently online, and 
the frequency of processed food price ad-
justments becomes more similar between 
online and offl   ine markets.Concerning the direction of price changes 
(share of price increases or decreases), there 
are no clear differences between online and 
offl   ine products. Only in the “processed 
food” category is the share of price in-
creases higher for online trade. With regard 
to the size of price changes, as expected, 
they turn out to be, on average, smaller in 
online stores than in offl   ine stores – for 
both directions.
Overall, more frequent but smaller price 
changes are consistent with lower menu 
costs for online markets. As online trade 
gains a greater share of the market in the 
wake of increasing digitalisation, this could 
result in a higher degree of price fl  exibility.
5 The “processed food” category includes online shops 
as well as home delivery services for frozen food.

22 Level shifts and jumps in macroeconomic time series 
due to relocation of intellectual property rights – for ex -
ample, licences – are likely to affect small economies in 
particular. Difficulties in conducting economic analyses can 
also arise for larger economic regions, however. See also 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2018).

European Central Bank (2020a) and OECD (2020b).

“Information and communication” (NACE section J). See 
also Anderton et al. (2020) and European Central Bank 
(2021).
25 Fintech activities, for example, are not explicitly men -
tioned in the classification of economic sectors still used 
today (NACE Rev. 2), and statistical registers assign the ma -
jority of fintech firms to the IT sector. See also von Kalck -
reuth and Wilson (2020).

between 1999 and 2020, whilst declining, at 
times distinctly, in France, Italy and Spain.
In contrast to the EU as a whole, the value 
added share of digital sectors in the United 
States increased markedly between 1999 and 
2020. This is all the more remarkable given that 
producer prices for digital goods fell by around 
40% in this period. Real gross value added 
growth in the digital sectors was correspond -
ingly strong. While total gross value added rose 
by an average of 2% per year in price- adjusted 
terms, this figure was 7% for the digital sec -
tors.
Measures of efficiency
The indicators presented above provide initial 
insights into the evolution and extent of digital -
isation. However, the metrics do not deliver 
any direct conclusions on the implications of 
digital transformation for developments in ag -
gregate labour productivity. These ultimately 
result from efficiency gains that are made pos -
sible by digitalisation.27 Such efficiency gains 
cannot be observed directly. However, there 
are ways to measure them indirectly. Indicators 
for this include, for example, the relative price 
of investment in ICT and total factor productiv -
ity (TFP) in the digital sectors.The relative price of ICT investment is often 
measured by the ratio between the price index 
for ICT capital goods and that for consumer 
goods. A declining relative price is interpreted 
as an indicator of investment- specific techno -
logical progress, based on the idea that tech -
nological progress on the supply side leads to a 
decline in output prices. The development of 
prices for computer hardware is a fairly illustra -
tive example of this. Relative to the consump -
tion deflator, the price index for computer 
hardware, which also takes into account im -
provements in quality, fell around 190- fold in 
the United States between 1980 and 2021. A 
falling relative price stimulates demand for cap -
ital goods and thus enables technological pro -
gress to exert its productivity- enhancing effect 
via investment.
In the four largest euro area countries, the rela -
tive price of ICT investment has fallen, in some 
cases sharply, in recent decades.28 This is par -
ticularly evident in Germany. By contrast, the 
decline in relative prices of ICT investment in 
France, Italy and Spain was considerably 
weaker. Nevertheless, in most of these coun -… but marked

tries, this decline was, for the most part, still 
significantly more pronounced than for the rest 
of gross fixed capital formation (excluding con -
struction investment).29 Accordingly, investment-  
specific technological progress in the field of 
ICT would have been quite pronounced in the 
countries under review, especially in Germany.
However, the differences between countries 
should also be interpreted with caution here, 
as the measurement of prices for ICT goods 
poses particular challenges and is not fully har -
monised.30 This should also be taken into ac -
count when comparing the relative price trend 
of ICT investment with that of the United 
States, where relative prices fell particularly 
sharply.
These restrictions aside, however, a noticeable 
flattening in the relative price decline of ICT 
capital goods can be identified in all countries 
under review in recent years. This suggests a 
slowdown in investment- specific technological 
progress in ICT goods across these countries.
The evolution of TFP captures the part of out -
put growth that cannot be explained by a 
change in labour or capital input. TFP thus rep -
resents a key indicator for the efficiency of pro -
duction processes.31 However, it cannot be ob -
served directly; rather, it must be estimated (see 
also the box on pp. 52 ff.).32 This can be done 
at the firm or industry level as well as for the 
entire economy.
Such estimates show that TFP growth in the 
digital sectors of the four largest euro area 
Member States has tended to flatten out over 
time.33 Compared with the first five years after 
the establishment of the euro area, average 
TFP growth in the digital sectors was 3  per -
centage points lower in Germany and France 
and 4 percentage points lower in Italy between 
2014 and 2018.34 Only in Spain did TFP growth 
pick up slightly during this period, by 1  per -
centage point. In the United States, TFP growth 
has recently gained momentum, but has not 
come close to the strong rates seen at the start of the 2000s. Nevertheless, on average, TFP 
growth was still considerably larger in the Distortions

Total factor productivity growth in digital sectors
Total factor productivity (TFP) is a key meas-
ure of the effi   ciency of production pro-
cesses and a main driver of labour product-
ivity. This box focuses on the evolution of 
TFP in the “digital sectors”, i.e. industries 
that produce digital goods and services. 
Specifi  cally, it looks at four sectors: the in-
dustry for computer, electronic and optical 
products as well as electronic equipment; 
the sector for the production and distribu-
tion of media products (publishing activ-
ities; motion picture, video and television 
programme production, sound recording 
and music publishing activities; program-
ming and broadcasting activities); the tele-
communications sector; and, fi  nally, the 
sector covering computer programming, 
consultancy and related activities as well as 
information service activities.1
A standard approach is to measure TFP 
growth by decomposing the growth rate of 
gross value added into the contributions of 
the primary production factors, labour and 
capital, as well as a residual component.2 
The latter, also known as the Solow residual, 
is interpreted as a measure of TFP growth. 
To obtain the most precise estimate of TFP 
possible, a two- step approach is used which 
extends the standard procedure by add-
itionally controlling for the degree of utilisa-
tion of the factors of production.3
In a fi  rst step, the Solow residual ( ∆sit) is 
calculated in sector i in year t as the differ-
ence between the growth rate of price- 
adjusted gross value added ( ∆yit) and the 
annual growth rates of capital input (∆kit) 
and labour input (∆lit) weighted by the re-
spective production elasticities:4
s it=y it(1↵it)k it↵itl it.
In a second step, the Solow residuals of sev-
eral economic sectors are regressed on the change in the average degree of capacity 
utilisation (∆uit) and a sector- specifi  c indi-
cator variable (ci):5
s it=ci+βu it+"it,
where εit is an error term. The estimations 
include data for 23 economic sectors in the 
four major euro area Member States and 
the United States for the years 1997 to 
2018.6 The sectoral data are taken from the 
1 A proper alignment of effi   ciency changes with digi-
talisation trends requires a suitable classifi  cation of 
digital activities. Where such activities are innovative, 
the respective classifi  cation systems are naturally out-
dated. There is next to no explicit mention of fi  ntech 
activities, for example, in the classifi  cation of economic 
sectors still used today (NACE Rev. 2 – 2008), and stat-
istical registers classify the majority of fi  ntech fi  rms as 
IT fi  rms. For Germany, see von Kalckreuth and Wilson 
(2020).
2 See Solow (1957).
3 If capacity utilisation is neglected, factor inputs and 
thus the TFP series may be recorded inaccurately. See 
Basu et al. (2006), Comin et al. (2020) and Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2021a).
4 The decomposition is based on a Cobb- Douglas pro-
duction function with constant returns to scale. As-
suming perfect competition on the factor and product 
markets, cost minimisation by fi  rms implies that the 
factors of production are remunerated according to 
their marginal products. Labour elasticity ( αit) can 
therefore be determined by the ratio of the wage bill 
to gross value added, while the elasticity of capital is 
equal to 1– αit . See Hulten (2010) and Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2012, 2021a).
5 See Basu et al. (2006), Comin et al. (2020) and 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2021a).
6 The model is estimated separately as a panel for 
each country and three sub- sectors. The latter com-
prise non- durable manufacturing (NACE divisions C10- 
C12, C13- C15, C16- C18, C20- C21 and C22- C23 and 
sections D and E), durable manufacturing (NACE div-
isions C24- C25, C26- C27, C28, C29- C30, C31- C33) 
and other economic sectors (NACE sections F, G, H, I, 
J, K, M, N and R- S); see Deutsche Bundesbank (2021a). 
In order to consider the digital sectors separately, 
NACE divisions J58- J60, J61 and J62- J63 are entered 
individually. Due to a lack of data, utilisation data for 
J62- J63 are used for divisions J58- J60 and J61 in Ger-
many. The series for Italy end in 2017. Based on EU 
KLEMS data, TFP growth rates for the United States 
can only be obtained from 1998 onwards. In addition, 
for the United States, no data are available for NACE 
divisions J61 and C21, and sectors D and E are entered 
as one sector (D- E).Deutsche Bundesbank

As capacity utilisation itself can also react to 
TFP , an instrumental variables method is 
used to estimate the panel models. Eco-
nomic variables which correlate with cap-
acity utilisation but not with TFP serve as in-
strumental variables. These are an oil price

Italy prior to 2010), the capacity measures for the ser-
vices sectors are extended backwards by using the 
growth rate of average capacity utilisation in the

The estimates show important similarities 
for the four largest euro area Member 
States, but also signifi  cant differences. The 
greatest effi   ciency gains occurred in tele-
communications. On an average over the 
period from 1997 to 2018, TFP rose by 
around 2% per year in Italy and by 4% in 
Spain, 5% in France and as much as 6% in 
Germany.11 The low average growth rate in 
Italy can be explained in part by the signifi  -
cant decline in TFP in the wake of the Euro-
pean sovereign debt crisis. TFP growth in 
the manufacture of electronic and optical 
products is similar to that recorded for tele-
communications in the case of Germany 
and France. In Spain and Italy, however, 
growth was considerably weaker. Italy, in 
particular, saw hardly any effi   ciency gains in 
this sector. There are also marked differ-
ences between the euro area Member 
States under review in the area of informa-
tion service activities, which includes soft-
ware development, programming and data 
processing, amongst other things. Only in 
Germany have there been noticeable effi   -
ciency gains since 2007. In Spain, TFP in this 
sector decreased at the end of the observa-
tion period following initial increases. In the 
economic sector focused on the production 
and distribution of media products, effi   -
ciency is estimated to have remained 
broadly unchanged in Germany and France, 
while in Spain and Italy it even declined 
markedly.
In the United States, TFP developments 
were broadly similar in the sectors under re-
view, although the country recorded greater 
progress overall.12 This applies in particular 
to the manufacture of electronic and op-
tical products, which saw exceptionally 
strong TFP growth of almost 10% per year. 
Remarkably, there were also signifi  cant productivity gains in the United States in 
the print, fi  lm and audio media sector.
Combining the various digital areas yields a 
clear grading. Whereas effi   ciency gains in 
the United States are very large, Germany 
posts somewhat smaller growth. Growth in 
France comes in slightly further behind, 
while TFP advances in digital sectors are sig-
nifi  cantly weaker in Italy and Spain. How-
ever, this cross- country analysis is subject to 
the caveat that measurement problems 
may restrict the comparability of TFP series 
(see also pp. 49 ff.).
10 Capacity utilisation is only taken into account if β/uni23DC is 
signifi  cant at the 90% level.
11 The data for Italy cover the years 1997 to 2017. The 
relatively fi  erce competition between service providers 
is a potential driver of TFP growth in the telecommuni-
cations sector. However, the government’s infl  uence in 
this area can still be pronounced. See Federal Statistical 
Offi   ce (2018).
12 Due to the lack of data, no conclusions can be 
drawn for the telecommunications sector (J61). This is 
the result of differences in the classifi  cation of eco-
nomic sectors. There is no exact equivalent for NACE 
division J60 in the NAICS classifi  cation used in the 
United States. There are also slight differences for 
NACE division J60.Deutsche Bundesbank

review than in the other sectors of the econ -
omy. This is consistent with the picture ob -
tained when looking at relative prices.
Digitalisation and labour 
productivity
The various indicators considered here suggest, 
in part, a rapid pace of digitalisation. This is 
particularly true of the two presented measures 
of efficiency, although their development has, 
in some cases, weakened over time. The impli -
cations of this for the course of macroeco -
nomic labour productivity can be examined 
using structural macroeconomic models. Trad -
itional approaches focus mainly on the role of 
investments;35 meanwhile, the importance of 
digital intermediate inputs is neglected. Recent 
studies suggest, however, that production link -
ages play a key role in the diffusion of tech -
nologies.36
Traditional analytical 
approaches 
Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) 
models are one tool that can be used to grasp 
the macroeconomic role of investment- specific technological progress.37 Amongst other 
things, they make it possible to assess the con -
tribution of this progress to trend growth in la -
bour productivity.38 A neoclassical baseline 
model39 which takes into account various types 
of capital, including ICT capital, serves as the 
basis for this. Besides the evolution of TFP , 
investment- specific technological progress as -
sociated with the respective capital types is a 
key driver of the model.40
The total contribution of investment-  specific 
technological progress to labour productivity 
growth is equal to the weighted sum of the 
technological progress associated with each of Importance of

39 A detailed description of this model framework can be

40 One particular feature of the model specification 
chosen here is the assumption of time- varying production 
elasticities. The calculation follows the approach in Eden 
and Gaggl (2018). In the above DSGE approach, exogen -
ous stochastic shocks are implemented to capture the 
time- varying production elasticities. For more information,

the respective types of capital.41 Investment-  
specific technological progress can be approxi -
mated on the basis of the relative price path of 
the relevant categories of capital goods.42 
However, its importance for productivity growth 
is also determined by the relative weight of the 
corresponding type of capital in the production 
process.43
According to this approach, the contributions 
of investment- specific technological progress in 
ICT to aggregate productivity growth in the 
four largest euro area countries has been lower 
in recent years than before the global financial 
and economic crisis. A similar picture emerges 
for the United States. This development is 
largely being driven by the flattening of the 
relative price paths of ICT investment. With re -
gard to the size of growth contributions, note 
that the relative weight of ICT capital was com -
paratively small.44 By this yardstick, the growth 
contributions of ICT- specific technological pro -
gress to aggregate labour productivity are quite high.45 For example, in France and the United 
States, they were around 12 times higher in the 
period from 2013 to 2018 than the average 
contributions of technological progress associ -
ated with non- ICT investment (excluding con -
struction). In Germany and Spain, the contribu -
tions of ICT- specific technological change were 
at least as high as the contributions made by 
technological progress in non-  ICT investment. 
According to the model decomposition, the 
positive impulse from ICT in Italy was even 
counteracted by a negative contribution to la -
bour productivity growth from non- ICT invest -
ment between 2013 and 2018.
Consideration of input- output 
linkages
However, digital products are entered into pro -
duction processes not only as capital goods but 
also as intermediate inputs. This transmission 
channel is rarely taken into account in conven -
tional macroeconomic models. Yet digital 
goods, in particular, are used to a large extent 
as an intermediate input. The multi-  sector dy -
namic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE)

41 It is assumed here that the exogenous investment-  
specific technological progress can be described by a sto -
chastic trend. See Schmitt- Grohé and Uribe (2011).
42 The model analysis assumes that there is an inverse re -
lationship between relative price paths and investment-  
specific technological progress. See also Schmitt- Grohé and 
Uribe (2011).
43 Assuming a Cobb- Douglas production function with 
constant returns to scale, the weight is given by the ratio of 
the respective capital income to total labour income.
44 Average ICT capital income shares range between 2% 
(Germany, Italy, Spain) and 5% (United States) over the 
total reference period. By contrast, capital income shares 
for non- ICT assets vary from 9% (Spain) to 13% (Germany).
45 Several simplifying assumptions need to be made in 
model- based growth accounting. These include, in add -
ition to the basic principles of the standard neoclassical 
model, the assumption of a closed economy and of labour 
being a homogeneous factor of production. The model fur -
thermore presumes the existence of a direct inverse rela -
tionship between investment- specific technological pro -
gress and the relative price of the respective investment 
goods.Deutsche Bundesbank

implications.46 In the model, sectoral output is 
used not only for consumption or investment 
purposes but also as an intermediate input in 
various sectors of the economy.47 It is assumed 
that different intermediate inputs can only be 
substituted to a limited extent. Furthermore, 
the intermediate input bundle can vary among 
the economic sectors. The model specification 
used here covers 19 economic sectors and was 
specified for each of the four largest euro area 
economies as well as the United States.48,49
In this model framework, digital transformation 
is triggered by TFP growth in digital sectors. An 
increase in TFP lowers marginal costs, as pro -
duction can now take place with smaller factor 
inputs.50 The prices of digital goods fall as a re -
sult. This, in turn, stimulates demand for these 
goods, both for consumption and investment 
purposes and as an intermediate input. As far 
as is possible, products from non- digital sectors 
are replaced by the comparatively cheaper 
digital goods. However, demand for other 
goods also increases due to complementarities. 
The growth in production in non- digital sectors 
calls for increased use of factors of production, 
which, when viewed in isolation, drives up fac -
tor payments, marginal costs and prices.TFP growth in

DSGE model EMuSe that does not include an environmen -

lang et al. (2021, 2022, 2023).
47 The MuSe model is therefore an extension of prototyp -
ical models. In the latter, production is usually used only for 
consumption or investment purposes, as capital and labour 
are the only factors of production. See, inter alia, Chris -
tiano et al. (2018).
48 The model bundles NACE divisions C26- C27 (manufac -
ture of computer, electronic and optical products and elec -

50 The transmission channel of TFP growth in digital sec -
tors described here is transferable to the other sectors de -
picted in the model.Deutsche Bundesbank

In order to quantify the contribution of digital -
isation to labour productivity, sectoral TFP 
paths, which were estimated separately (see 
also the box on pp. 52 ff.), are fed into the MuSe 
model. Specifically, two scenarios are com -
pared here. In the reference scenario, the TFP 
paths for all sectors are considered.51 In the 
counterfactual scenario, by contrast, it is as -
sumed that TFP in digital sectors is constant 
and remains at its initial level. The differences 
between the two scenarios can then be used 
to assess the contribution to labour productiv -
ity growth made by digital sectors.
The MuSe model quite accurately reproduces 
the actual path of labour productivity in the 
countries under review, with the exception of 
Spain.52 This is also noteworthy given that la -
bour productivity developments in this group 
of countries vary widely in some cases. Labour 
productivity in the United States rose consider -
ably more strongly than in the euro area coun -
tries under review. Within this group, there was 
a marked difference between Germany and 
France, on the one hand, and Italy and Spain, 
on the other.
If the changes in TFP in digital sectors are fac -
tored out of the simulation, the picture changes 
significantly. Labour productivity growth would 
be considerably weaker. For the United States, 
around seven- tenths of productivity growth 
would be lost, despite digital sectors account -
ing for a relatively small share of aggregate 
gross value added. The loss would be substan -
tial in Germany and France, too, at roughly 
one- half and four- tenths respectively. Accord -
ing to this calculation, aggregate labour prod -
uctivity in Italy would have stagnated. By con -
trast, differences compared with the reference 
scenario do not appear until the end of the 
simulation period for Spain. In accordance with 
this, there would have been only comparatively 
weak macroeconomic impetus coming from 
digital sectors in Spain in the years prior to 
2012. Overall, the simulation results show the 
key importance of TFP growth in digital sectors 
for the developments of labour productivity. In line with this, less dynamic TFP growth in digital 
sectors –  amid continuously weak impetus 
stemming from the other economic sectors – 
would have significant consequences.
In order to show the specific importance of 
input- output linkages for the transmission of 
digitalisation, a further scenario assumes that 
digital goods are used exclusively for consump -
tion or investment purposes and not as inter -
mediate inputs.53 The simulation results sug -
gest that digital intermediate inputs play a key 
role in aggregate productivity growth, since 
productivity gains were mostly significantly 
lower when digital intermediate inputs were 
excluded.54 This is particularly evident for the 
United States, Germany and France. However, 
this transmission channel was also important in 
Italy. In Spain, on the other hand, relatively 
weak TFP growth in digital sectors also implies 
that the importance of digital intermediate in -
puts for labour productivity growth was lower.
For simplicity, this analysis looked at a closed 
economy. Digital goods are in fact also ex -
ported and imported.55 However, it should be 
emphasised that the model incorporates the 
actual country- specific TFP paths, which also 
reflect external developments. A number of 
studies show that TFP progress is markedly in -Assessing the

51 The simulation results are driven exclusively by the inter -
play between TFP paths in the individual sectors.
52 In Spain, labour productivity increased considerably as a 
result of the disproportionately large reduction in labour 
input in the wake of the global financial and economic cri -
sis and the subsequent sovereign debt crisis. However, this 
dramatic development is not triggered by TFP adjusted for 
capacity utilisation and cannot therefore be inferred from 
the model. See also Deutsche Bundesbank (2021a).
53 To this end, digital goods are excluded from the inter -
mediate input bundles of all sectors.
54 For a more detailed discussion of the prominent role of 
input- output linkages, see, inter alia, Foerster et al. (2022) 
and vom Lehn and Winberry (2022).
55 According to WIOD data for 2014, the share of im -
ported digital intermediate inputs in total intermediate in -
puts was recently around 3% in Germany, 2% in France 
and Italy and 1% in Spain and the United States. The share 
of imported digital consumer goods stood at around 1% in 
all countries under review. The share of imported digital 
capital goods in total gross fixed capital formation was 
close to 7% for Germany, while this share was 5% for 
Spain, 4% for the United States and 3% for France and 
Italy.Deutsche Bundesbank

fluenced by international research and develop -
ment, especially in open economies.56 Foreign 
direct investment and imports of intermediate 
goods can also have an impact on a country’s 
TFP growth.57
Summary and outlook
Digitalisation affects aggregate labour product -
ivity developments in a variety of ways. Stand -
ard analytical approaches typically focus on the 
importance of digital capital goods. By con -
trast, the role of digital intermediate inputs is 
often neglected. Analyses using a macroeco -
nomic multi- sector model show the key im -
portance of digital intermediate inputs. If sec -
toral interlinkages are neglected, production 
growth resulting from digitalisation is often sig -
nificantly underestimated. Furthermore, it can 
be seen that efficiency gains in digital sectors 
have a decisive impact on labour productivity 
developments. Without progress in digital sec -tors, productivity growth in the largest euro 
area countries would have been considerably 
lower or productivity would have even stag -
nated. The same applies to the United States. 
Here, too, labour productivity developments 
are driven largely by TFP growth in digital sec -
tors.
Nonetheless, it becomes apparent that the effi -
ciency gains resulting from digitalisation have 
tended to decline over time. Whether a turning 
point will be reached in view of recent develop -
ments is a matter of dispute.58 The European 
Commission’s indicators on the application and 
diffusion of digital technologies indicate a sig -
nificant increase during the coronavirus pan -
demic. This suggests that changes in the frame -

German enterprises’ profitability and 
financing in 2021
The profitability of non- financial enterprises in 2021 was marked by the economy recovering from 
the pandemic- induced slump in business activity experienced the previous year. Revenues 
expanded at an above- average pace, driven by catch- up effects. Price increases also played a 
very important role in this regard, with enterprises’ pre- tax profit margin rising to a historically 
high 5.1%. The long- term debt ratio came back down again. By contrast, enterprises’ preference 
for liquidity eased only slightly. On the cost side, spending on materials rose considerably, fuelled 
by a sharp rise in prices for intermediate goods and industrial raw materials. Increased costs were 
largely passed on to consumers but, for the most part, relief in other areas was not. As a result, 
enterprises expanded their margins substantially during the economic recovery in the reporting 
year. On balance, the profit situation in 2021 was extremely favourable in virtually all sectors.
While the annual financial statements we have on file are for the year before the Russian war of 
aggression against Ukraine and the resulting intensification of the energy crisis, they nevertheless 
reveal how the corporate sector and, in particular, the energy- intensive sectors were faring when 
the 2022 crisis hit. Liquidity and stability were both relatively high in the corporate sector. The cor -
responding ratios exceeded those recorded for years immediately preceding earlier recessions or 
crises, including the coronavirus pandemic. On average, the energy- intensive sectors were no 
worse off in terms of their profitability and financing than other sectors. Overall, they are there -
fore likely to be able to withstand the immediate effects of the energy price shock, partly on 
account of the gas and electricity price brakes and, more recently, lower energy prices.
Given the continuing, albeit somewhat weaker, economic growth, non- financial enterprises are 
likely to have seen their business activity expand again in 2022. However, the sharply increased 
energy costs will probably have had a significant impact, especially on annual financial state -
ments in energy- intensive sectors. Cost- side pressures increased across all sectors. On balance, 
enterprises’ profit margin is therefore likely to have been somewhat lower in 2022 than in the 
reporting year.Deutsche Bundesbank

Underlying trends
2021 saw the German economy claw back 
from the slump into which it was plunged by 
the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis, aided in 
no small part by the gradual easing of protect -
ive measures to combat the pandemic at home 
and abroad. Driven by catch- up effects, real 
gross domestic product expanded by 2.6% on 
the year. German exporters benefited from 
growing foreign demand as global economic 
activity picked up. Easing pandemic- related re -
strictions boosted private consumption consid -
erably. Business investment also shot up. How -
ever, construction investment stagnated on the 
back of the sharply increased construction 
prices. Fiscal policy, which was still strongly ex -
pansionary as a result of the extensive tempor -
ary coronavirus support measures, had a stabil -
ising effect. The recovery would have been 
even more pronounced if, in particular, industry 
had not been hampered by global supply 
bottlenecks for intermediate inputs and sharp 
rises in commodity prices. Although growth in 
output was well above potential growth, 
medium- term aggregate production capacity 
remained significantly underutilised.
The pre- tax profit margin improved sharply in 
2021. At 5.1% – based on the annual financial 
statements we currently have on file  – it reached its highest level since 2007.1 In 2020, it 
barely registered a decline, despite the corona -
virus pandemic being in full swing. The sharp 
price increases for intermediate goods and in -
dustrial raw materials significantly pushed up 
the cost of materials in 2021. However, these 
cost increases were largely passed on to con -
sumers. By contrast, this was not always the 
case for falling costs for other items. Savings 
here instead bolstered or boosted enterprises’ 
margins. Amongst other things, reported per -
sonnel expenses as a share of gross revenue 
declined. Thus, while consumers mostly had to 
bear the strain of cost increases, they were 
largely denied the relief afforded in other areas. 
As a result, enterprises expanded their margins 
substantially during the economic recovery in 
the reporting year. On the earnings side, other 
operating income also climbed steeply, likely in 
part as a result of government financial assis -
tance measures during the coronavirus crisis. In 
line with this, the number of corporate insolv -
encies continued to decline in almost all sectors 
in 2021. Even after the temporary suspension 
of the obligation to file for insolvency, which 
was tied to certain conditions, had been 
phased out in 2021, insolvency applications did 2021: German

Impact of higher energy costs on the profi  tability of 
German  industrial enterprises
Soaring energy prices are placing a burden 
on the German corporate sector. High en-
ergy costs weigh on fi  rms’ profi  tability if 
they are unable to pass the increased costs 
on or suffi   ciently improve their energy effi   -
ciency. The vulnerability of German enter-
prises’ profi  tability to the sharp rises in en-
ergy costs can be measured using simula-
tions which draw on extrapolated data 
from the Bundesbank’s corporate fi  nancial 
statement statistics. The calculations are 
based on the accounting relationships in 
the profi  t and loss (P&L) account, into which 
rises in energy costs are fed. These data can 
be used to compute hypothetical energy 
price- related changes in the gross profi  t 
margin.1
However, the simulations do not shed any 
light on actual developments in enterprises’ 
profi  tability, as the design of the calcula-
tions means that only the cost of materials 
changes, while all other P&L positions are 
left unchanged. Additional burdens, such as 
reduced sales revenue due to energy sav-
ings or losses in households’ purchasing 
power, or higher personnel expenses caused 
by rising wages, are not refl  ected in the cal-
culations. Nor do they take account of ad-
justments made by enterprises, such as 
passing on costs or taking measures to im-
prove energy effi   ciency, which mitigate the 
burdens caused by rising energy prices. 
Moreover, the results merely illustrate the 
direct impact on the profi  t situation and do 
not provide any insight into the medium- 
term repercussions for German enterprises.2
The analysis focuses on the manufacturing 
sector, which is particularly affected by en-
ergy price increases because of its high 
average energy intensity. Based on the 
sector- specifi  c ratio of energy inputs to 
total inputs, the fi  rms’ cost of materials is 
increased in the calculations in accordance 
with the price rises for electricity, gas and oil.3 The price increases for electricity 
(+28%) and gas (+109%) are based on the 
latest year- on- year fi  gures from the Federal 
Statistical Offi   ce for the fi  rst half of 2022. 
The rise in oil prices (+81%) is based on the 
world market price for Brent oil, converted 
into euro. The profi  tability results are com-
pared with their fi  gure for 2019 without a 
change in energy costs.4
The results show that the rise in energy 
prices places a particularly strong drag on 
gross profi  t margins in the chemicals indus-
try, in the glass and ceramics industry, in the 
manufacture of basic metals and in the 
paper industry. In the manufacture of fabri-
cated metal products, the textile and cloth-
ing industry, the rubber and plastic industry, 
the food industry and the printing industry, 
profi  tability appears to be less vulnerable to 
higher energy costs than is the case on 
average in the industrial sectors. The manu-
facture of machinery and equipment, the 
electrical engineering industry, the wood in-
dustry and the pharmaceutical industry 
– the latter not being energy- intensive any-
1 See German Council of Economic Experts (2022) for 
similar simulations for manufacturing fi  rms using indi-
vidual data.
2 The P&L data in the calculations primarily correspond 
to domestic business activity. First, the calculations re-
late to the individual fi  nancial statements of German 
enterprises, without data from consolidated fi  nancial 
statements. Second, the sales fi  gures in the extrapo-
lated data from the Bundesbank’s corporate fi  nancial 
statement statistics are consistent with the Federal 
Statistical Offi   ce’s fi  gures on gross output in Germany.
3 The ratio of energy expenditure to total expenditure 
on materials was calculated using the data on sector- 
specifi  c inputs from the Federal Statistical Offi   ce’s 
input- output tables for 2019. It was assumed that the 
sector- specifi  c shares of expenditure on electricity, gas 
or oil in total energy expenditure correspond to the 
shares of electricity, gas or oil consumption in total en-
ergy consumption according to data from the Federal 
Statistical Offi   ce. This is a simplifi  ed assumption, as the 
price per kilowatt hour typically also varies according 
to the energy source.
4 A comparison with 2020 would be confounded by 
the exceptionally weak corporate profi  ts in that year.

way – appear to be broadly resilient. Given 
that profi  t margins are estimated to be posi-
tive in most sectors despite the sharp rise in 
energy prices, the direct profi  t losses in the 
manufacturing sector appear manageable. 
However, the picture is somewhat more 
critical for the manufacture of basic metals 
and also for the manufacture of transport 
equipment, as profi  tability in these sectors 
had already been below- average previ-
ously.5
When interpreting the results, it is import-
ant to note that energy prices had already 
risen sharply before the end of 2021. This 
primarily refl  ected the recovery of global 
demand from the impact of the pandemic. 
Considering only the energy price increases 
since the second half of 2021, which was 
shortly before war broke out in Ukraine, 
gross profi  t margins fell by only around half 
as much in each case.
One important factor in the macroeco-
nomic impact of the higher energy costs 
– which, to some extent, are likely to per-
sist – is the high global competitive pressure 
that many manufacturing sectors face.6 This 
limits the scope for price adjustments if for-
eign competitors are less affected by higher 
energy prices. In that case, it could be more 
advantageous for fi  rms to wind down their 
business activities in Germany than to con-tinue producing. Among those sectors most 
exposed to surging energy prices, this is es-
pecially true of the manufacture of basic 
metals, the chemicals industry and the 
paper industry. These sectors are likely to 
have diffi   culty passing higher energy costs 
on to their customers to a suffi   cient extent. 
However, the high level of competition also 
means that the products made by these 
sectors –  some of which are important 
intermediate goods for other sectors – can 
be fairly easily replaced by imported goods. 
Some key intermediate goods at the begin-
ning of the domestic value chain could 
therefore, in principle, be substituted in part 
by imports. This would mitigate any spill-
overs from production cuts to downstream 
sectors. Nevertheless, there could be a 
negative impact on employment, as the 
manufacturing sectors most affected by this 
account for a substantial share of employ-
ment.Gross profit margin by energy cost share*

share of energy in total expenditure on materials and 
less so on price increases broken down by energy 
source.

at the sectoral level using a measure of sector- specifi  c 
import substitutability. It is defi  ned as the ratio of in-
puts in Germany to the sum of imports and exports of

the coronavirus pandemic.
Energy- intensive sectors 
on sound financial footing 
before outbreak of energy 
crisis
The energy price shock triggered by the Russian 
war of aggression against Ukraine left the 
energy- intensive sectors facing major chal -
lenges last year. Soaring prices for gas, electri -
city and crude oil have put pressure on manu -
facturers of metals, chemicals, glass, ceramics 
and paper, in particular – industries character -
ised by high gas, electricity and oil intensity 
levels. Construction, in and of itself, is not a 
particularly energy- intensive sector. However, it 
likewise has rather high exposure to the energy 
crisis, indirectly via energy- intensive construc -
tion materials. Besides the manufacturing sec -
tor, levels of energy consumption are also high 
in the transportation sector, which is almost ex -
clusively fuelled by refined petroleum products. 
The energy price shock intensified both the 
pressure on firms to adjust their production 
processes as well as production and sales 
losses, resulting in high needs for short and 
medium- term financing. The annual financial 
statements we have on file are for the year be -
fore the energy crisis. However, they can be 
used to assess the liquidity and stability of 
energy- intensive sectors, individual sectors and 
the corporate sector as a whole prior to the cri -
sis.
Compared with the years preceding the eco -
nomic downturns of 2002-03 and 2009 – and 
even the coronavirus pandemic – non- financial 
enterprises were more robust in terms of their 
financing conditions and capital structure in 
2021. These metrics were thus left virtually un -
touched by the coronavirus crisis. However, the 
impact of measures to preserve liquidity and 
stability, implemented in the wake of the 
coronavirus pandemic by government or by en -
terprises themselves, continued to be felt. On balance, liquidity levels in the corporate sector 
in 2021 were very good by historical standards. 
A similar picture emerges with regard to stabil -
ity ratios. The long- term debt ratio (long- term 
liabilities to equity) was lower and the equity 
base stronger than before previous economic 
downturns and at least roughly as high as be -
fore the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. 
The aggregate interest coverage ratio was also 
extremely high in 2021 in view of favourable 
profitability levels and the ongoing low interest 
rate environment.

ratios as well as their profit situation. On aver -
age, however, energy- intensive sectors were 
no worse off than non- energy- intensive ones in 
terms of their profitability and financing. Their 
liquidity levels and equity ratios even tended to 
be above average. On average, the gross profit 
margin was similarly high. While liquidity levels 
and equity ratios were lower in the construc -
tion sector than in other sectors, given the con -
struction boom in previous years, this sector 
was much more solidly positioned than in the 
past. The energy- intensive sectors are therefore 
likely to be able to withstand the immediate 
financial impact of the energy price shock for 
the time being. Profit losses in the manufactur -
ing sector as a result of higher energy costs 
also appear to be manageable from today’s 
perspective (see the box on pp. 69 f.). The re -
cent fall in energy prices as well as the gas and 
electricity price brakes for enterprises will also 
provide a helping hand in this regard this and 
next year. Nevertheless, as higher energy costs 
look likely to be here to stay, these and the as -sociated necessary adjustment of production 
processes will probably weigh on the German 
corporate sector and potential output in the 
medium term.2
Sales and income
The economic recovery in the reporting year 
drove sales up considerably. Revenue growth 
averaged 12%, following a decline of 3.7% in 
the previous year. The catch- up effect after the 
crisis year of 2020 consequently led to the larg -
est increase in sales since data collection started 
in 1997. Higher prices are likely to have been a 
greater factor in the increase in sales revenues 
than volume growth, as the prices of goods 
and services rose particularly sharply. As enter -
prises also expanded their inventories sharply, 
production outpaced sales in value terms.

previous year, but remained at a high level rela -
tive to sales, in part because of the ongoing 
use of crisis assistance measures.
Sales rose sharply in almost all sectors. The 
strongest sales growth was recorded by energy 
companies, partly because energy prices rose 
considerably, even in 2021. The high increases 
in the prices of intermediate goods are also 
likely to have contributed to the above- average 
rates of sales growth for intermediate goods 
producers in the metal and wood industries as 
well as in the chemicals and pharmaceutical 
sectors. Looking at service providers, sales grew 
most strongly in the transportation and storage 
sector, particularly in water and air transport, 
mainly owing to catch- up effects following the 
crisis year of 2020 and a sharp rise in the prices 
of these services. As restrictions designed to 
contain the pandemic were still in place in 
2021, sales in the hotel and restaurant sector, 
by contrast, did not yet recover following the 
sharp decline in the previous year. Sales also 
stagnated in the food industry. However, unlike 
in the hotel and restaurant sector, for example, 
sales there had not plummeted in the preced -
ing year. Only the construction sector recorded 
a drop in sales, though this sector did see an 
exceptionally sharp rise in the stock of finished 
and unfinished products.
Non-  financial enterprises boosted their profits 
significantly again in 2021 and more than off -
set the slight decline in profits in the preceding 
year. As overall expenditure did not climb as 
fast as income, the annual result before tax 
rose by around half. The sharp rise in commod -
ity prices in particular, but also heightened de -
mand for intermediate goods, contributed to 
the nonetheless large increase in expenses. 
Viewed in isolation, personnel expenses and 
other expenses also picked up as a result of the 
rise in employment, the partial recovery in 
working hours due to the reduced use of short- 
time work arrangements, and significant wage 
increases. The profitability of non-  financial en -
terprises increased in virtually all sectors. In

sectors trade, business services, construction 
and the chemicals and pharmaceutical indus -
tries even exceeded these peaks.
Sources and uses of funds
As the economy recovered, enterprises’ sources 
and uses of funds rose exceptionally sharply. 
On the revenue side, the additional funds were 
sourced internally and externally in roughly 
equal parts. Internal financing rose, with in -
creased transfers to provisions, mainly as a re -
sult of retained profits. The increase in external financing was driven by significantly higher 
short- term liabilities, while long- term liabilities 
were scaled back. On the expenditure side, 
non- financial asset formation doubled as the 
stock of finished and unfinished goods rose 
sharply. The increase in tangible fixed assets re -
covered somewhat, but remained below the 
pre- crisis level of 2019. Financial asset forma -
tion rose sharply on the back of significantly 
higher short- term receivables. The build- up of 
liquidity in the form of cash remained at an ele -
vated level.Sources and

Balance sheet developments
In line with the high sales growth, the total 
assets of non-  financial enterprises expanded 
considerably in 2021. As with sales, the 8.6% 
increase was the highest since records began, 
driven by rebound effects after the crisis year of 
2020. On the assets side, the share of financial 
assets in total assets remained broadly un -
changed. On balance, the shift from long- term 
to short- term receivables continued. The de -
cline in long- term receivables was more pro -
nounced than in the previous year and was 
again due to the reduction in receivables from 
affiliated enterprises. Short- term receivables also rose significantly more strongly than in the 
previous year. As in the preceding year, the de -
sire to preserve liquidity was still a factor in 
some cases. In the energy sector, cash re -
sources were stocked up considerably, by oper -
ators of power grids for example, possibly with 
a view to future investments in network expan -
sion. While the recession had resulted in a drop 
in trade receivables in 2020, they expanded 
considerably in the reporting year in line with 
the high growth in sales. In addition, there was 
also an exceptionally large increase in other re -
ceivables and assets. This was, in large part, 
due to the strong expansion of energy sup -Share of finan -

pliers’ business activities, especially in energy 
trading.
Non- financial assets rose in 2021, mainly be -
cause inventories expanded exceptionally 
sharply. In the previous year, they had been 
scaled back in a bid to conserve liquidity, in part 
in response to the crisis. Stockpiling was 
broadly spread across sectors. In addition to 
the impact of the economic recovery, this could 
be due, in part, to the desire, sparked by supply 
bottlenecks, to ensure that value- added chains 
are more resilient. Tangible fixed assets also 
grew markedly again. By contrast, intangible 
fixed assets, which had grown sharply in the pandemic year of 2020 in the information and 
communication sector, amongst others, dis -
played no particular momentum in 2021.
The equity ratio of non- financial enterprises re -
mained stable at a high level in 2021 despite 
the headwinds of the pandemic and a degree 
of energy price inflation. The increase in equity, 
which was high in absolute terms, was spread 
broadly across sectors. Growth in equity was 
above average in the services sectors (except 
the wholesale trade) and in the construction 
sector.Non- financial

Profi  tability and fi  nancial position of German listed groups 
in 2021 and an outlook for 2022
In 2021, German non- fi  nancial listed groups 
rapidly recovered from the setbacks of 2020 
– a year dominated by the pandemic.1 Their 
revenues and profi  ts reached new highs, 
while rising energy prices already had a 
clear impact on energy suppliers. Estimates 
for 2022 suggest that earnings increased 
substantially across all economic sectors as 
a result of price and exchange rate effects. 
Owing to the accelerated growth in ex-
penditure, profi  ts are likely to have risen less 
sharply, particularly for energy suppliers.
Revenues grew by 20% in 2021.2 This is 
mainly due to the base effect of the low fi  g-
ures in 2020 and price effects. The latter 
were a key factor in the doubling of energy 
suppliers’ revenues. Overall, earnings before 
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisa-
tion (EBITDA) rose by 38% on the year, 
while earnings before interest and taxes 
(EBIT) tripled. As a result, the weighted 
average profi  t margin rose sharply.3 It in-
creased by 5.0 percentage points to 8.1%, 
just shy of the peak seen in 2017. In con-
trast to 2017, the strong growth in 2021 
was carried by the vast majority of groups. 
Accordingly, the distribution of the profi  t 
margin shifted signifi  cantly toward higher 
values. The profi  t margin of groups that previously had low profi  ts recovered to a 
greater extent than that of groups with 
high profi  ts. Furthermore, the profi  ts of 
large groups with higher revenues rose 
more strongly than those of smaller groups. 
At the sector level, the profi  t margin in both 
the services sector and the production sec-
tor (excluding energy) reached new highs. 
Despite energy price- dependent revenue in-
creases, energy suppliers were unable to 
improve their profi  ts in 2021, as operating 
expenses increased by the same magnitude.
1 The reporting population comprises around 230 
non- fi  nancial groups (excluding real estate activities)

On the asset side, current assets grew by 
more than 25%, with more than two- thirds 
of this being attributable to energy sup-
pliers. This was largely the result of valu-
ation effects of derivatives held for hedging 
purposes. Inventories rose by 12% across all 
groups, partly refl  ecting developments in 
commodity prices. Cash holdings, which 
had already grown sharply in 2020, in-
creased by 9% in 2021 on account of high 
infl  ows from current operations. Among 
non- current assets, intangible assets in-
creased by 12%. The telecommunications 
sector made a signifi  cant contribution to 
this through the acquisition of licenses. 
Property, plant and equipment grew by 6% 
on a broad basis across groups. The 10% 
increase in fi  nancial assets was mainly at-
tributable to growth in car manufacturers’ 
fi  nancial services business and their acquisi-
tion of equity interests, and to derivatives 
positions of energy suppliers.On the fi  nancing side, equity went up by 
23%, partly on account of the high profi  ts 
for the year. A large contribution was also 
made by the differences arising from cur-
rency translation and the remeasurements 
of defi  ned benefi  t pension plans. The equity 
ratio climbed by 1.7  percentage point to 
30.2%. It grew signifi  cantly more strongly 
in the services sector than in the production 
sector, where the aggregate equity ratio 
was dampened by the strong balance sheet 
growth among energy suppliers.
A considerable 27% rise in current liabilities 
set the tone for the debt position overall. 
This increase was largely due to changes in 
the valuation of energy price- dependent 
derivatives positions of energy suppliers. By 
contrast, the remainder of the production 
sector and service providers reduced their 
fi  nancial liabilities. Across all sectors, trade 
payables increased by 21%, which is likely 
to be due to both rising output and price 
changes. Non- current liabilities remained 
more or less stable. Low growth in long- 
term borrowings was almost entirely offset 
by the decline in pension obligations.
In the fi  rst half of 2022, revenue increased 
by around one- quarter compared with the 
fi  rst half of 2021. This development is esti-
mated to have continued in the second half 
of 2022, partly as a result of price effects 
and the weaker euro, which increased 
group revenues generated in foreign cur-
rency and translated into euro. Owing to 
the further rise in energy prices, energy sup-
pliers are likely to record the largest revenue 
increase in 2022, as was the case in the pre-
vious year.
The slight normalisation of groups’ profi  t 
margin4 in 2022 was due to pre- tax profi  ts 
not increasing to the same extent as rev-

in the pandemic year of 2020 reversed in the 
reporting year. As business activity picked up 
again, trade payables and advance payments 
received rose sharply. Short- term liabilities to 
affiliated enterprises also expanded signifi -
cantly. By contrast, short- term liabilities to 
credit institutions were virtually unchanged. 
Long- term liabilities were scaled back mainly to 
affiliated enterprises, but also to credit institu -
tions. By contrast, more bonds were issued on 
balance. Provisions were also larger in 2021 
than a year earlier. This was mainly attributable 
to other provisions, which were set aside in line 
with positive business developments. However, 
provisions for pensions and tax also continued 
to rise.Trends for 2022
With economic growth higher year on year, 
non- financial enterprises are likely to have fur -
ther expanded their business activities again in 
2022. However, the business situation deterior -
ated over the course of the year, in particular 
owing to the sharp rise in energy prices as a re -
sult of Russia’s war of aggression against 
Ukraine and the gradual end of reopening ef -
fects after measures to contain the pandemic 
were lifted. The loss of purchasing power asso -
ciated with high inflation weighed on private 
consumption. The slowdown in the global 
economy and ongoing supply chain issues 
dampened German exporters’ sales. Real gov -
ernment consumption grew less strongly as 
pandemic- related spending came to an end. 
High energy costs will probably have had a sig -
nificant impact, especially on the annual finan -
cial statements in energy- intensive sectors. The 
decline in housing investment as a result of 
sharply higher construction costs and increased Strong growth in 
liabilities; scaling 
back of long- 
term liabilities Further rise in 
business activ -
ities likely in 
2022, with a 
slight decline 
in the profit 
marginenues. This development was strongly infl  u-
enced by energy suppliers, which – despite 
high revenue growth – recorded lower pre- 
tax profi  ts on account of rising expenditure. 
In addition, pre- tax profi  ts were weighed 
down by the direct consequences of the 
war in Ukraine. Several groups discontinued 
their production and distribution in Russia 
and Belarus, triggering impairments of 
group assets.
Compared with individual enterprises 
covered by the corporate fi  nancial state-
ment statistics, the profi  tability of groups 
increased more strongly in 2021, albeit after 
having fallen more sharply in 2020. This is 
because –  unlike single- entity fi  nancial 
statements, which mainly refl  ect business in 
Germany – the profi  tability of groups largely 
refl  ects global economic developments and 
the domestic conditions prevailing in the 
countries where the subsidiaries are lo-
cated.55 Furthermore, the metrics derived from the fi  nancial 
statements are shaped materially by differences be-
tween the accounting standards applied (German 
GAAP for the corporate fi  nancial statement statistics, 
IFRS for the consolidated fi  nancial statement statistics).Annual result before taxes on income

financing costs is likely to have hurt the con -
struction sector. The services sector, mean -
while, is likely to have fared better thanks to 
catch- up effects after measures taken to con -
tain the pandemic were lifted. On the cost side, 
enterprises experienced pressure from strong 
increases in the prices of intermediate goods 
and industrial raw materials as well as from 
higher wage growth. On balance, enterprises’ 
profit margin is likely to be somewhat lower in 
2022 than the exceptionally high profit margin 
in the reporting year.

Discrepancies may arise from rounding.  * The banking system's liquidity position is
defined as the current account holdings in euro of euro area credit institutions with the
Eurosystem. Amounts are derived from the consolidated financial statement of the
Eurosystem and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  1 Figures are daily averages
for the reserve maintenance period ending in the month indicated. Following the
changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the
Eurosystem's asset purchase programmes.  4 From August 2009 includes liquidity

2002 euro banknotes and other banknotes which have been issued by the national cen-
tral banks of the Eurosystem and which are still in circulation. In accordance with the
accounting procedure chosen by the Eurosystem for the issue of euro banknotes, a
share of 8% of the total value of the euro banknotes in circulation is

under “Other factors”. The remaining 92% of the value of the euro banknotes in
circulation is allocated, likewise on a monthly basis, to the NCBs, with each NCB
showing in its balance sheet the share of the euro banknotes issued corresponding to
its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-
system and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  7 Equal to the difference bet-

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

figures do not tally with the sum of the quarterly figures, as the latter are all pro-
visional. The quarterly figures for some insurance sectors are estimated.  3 The develop-
ment of the types of expenditure recorded here is influenced in part by statisticalchangeovers.  4 Including discrepancies in clearing transactions between central, state

posals of equity interests and as loan repayments. On the expenditure side, this con-
tains the acquisition of equity interests and loans granted.  6 Excluding central govern-

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the curren-
cy concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's price
competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective exchange
rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitiveness. The
weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more detailed in-
formation on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the Deutsche
Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 The calculations are
based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral exchange rates of the
euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following 18 countries: Australia, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Poland, Romania,
Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United
States. Where current price and wage indices were not available, estimates were used.
2 Includes countries belonging to the extended EER group of trading partners (fixed
composition) and additionally the following 23 countries: Algeria, Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Colombia, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, New Zea-
land, Peru, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan,Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates. The ECB has suspended the
publication and calculation of the euro foreign exchange reference rate against Russian
rouble with effect from March 2, 2022 until further notice. For the calculation of
effective exchange rates, an indicative rate is used for the Russian Federation from that
date. It is calculated from the daily RUB/USD rates determined by the Bank of Russia in
conjunction with the respective ECB's euro foreign exchange reference rate to the US
dollar.  3 Annual and quarterly averages.  4 Euro area countries (from 2001 including
Greece, from 2007 including Slovenia, from 2008 including Cyprus and Malta, from

2015 including Lithuania, from 2023 including Croatia) as well as Canada, Denmark,
Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.
