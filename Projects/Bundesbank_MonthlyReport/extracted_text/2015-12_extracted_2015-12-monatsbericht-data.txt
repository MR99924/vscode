Commentaries
Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The German economy is likely to have broadly 
maintained the pace of expansion observed in 
the third quarter at the end of 2015 and is thus 
expanding in line with potential growth at 
healthy capacity utilisation levels. Private con -
sumption is still sustained by significant in -
creases in employment and earnings. In add -
ition, the further fall in crude oil prices is easing 
household budgets and increased government 
expenditure in connection with the influx of 
refugees is providing additional stimulus. By 
contrast, industry made a subdued start to the 
final quarter. A possible improvement is sug -
gested by the further rise in incoming orders at 
last report, but more importantly the continued 
improvement in business expectations in the 
last few months.
Industry
Industrial output in October was up by a sea -
sonally adjusted ¾% on the month but largely 
moved sideways (-¼%) compared with the 
average of the third quarter. The production of 
capital goods rose steeply (+1¼%), with the 
automotive industry and mechanical engineer -
ing playing a key role. By contrast, there was a 
sharp decline in the production of intermediate 
goods and consumer goods (-1% and -2½% re -
spectively).
In October, there was a steep seasonally ad -
justed 1¾% increase in the intake of industrial 
orders on the month. The average of the third 
quarter, when a clear decline in orders had 
been recorded, was thus exceeded by ½%. Do -
mestic orders rose distinctly compared with the 
average of the third quarter and there were 
likewise more orders from non- euro- area coun -
tries (+¾% in each case). By contrast, orders from the euro area moved sideways. Leaving 
aside orders from the aircraft and aerospace 
industry  , part of which originated from non-  
euro- area countries, a substantial increase was 
recorded, however. Capital goods manufactur -
ers recorded a ½% rise in orders overall. This 
was attributable, on the one hand, to a clear 
improvement in orders for manufacturers of 
motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts, who 
had experienced a serious slump in demand in 
the third quarter, and, on the other hand, to a 
strong decline in mechanical engineering. 
There were no new stimuli for intermediate 
goods, but orders for consumer goods were up 
very steeply (+3¼%).
Industrial sales in October were a substantial 
2¼% higher than in September in seasonally 
adjusted terms, thus also exceeding the aver -
age of the previous quarter by ¾%. This was 
mainly due to the upturn in business with do -
mestic customers (+1½%), whilst export sales 
remained at the average level of the third quar -
ter. Business with buyers from the non- euro-  
area improved by 1¼%, whereas sales in the 
euro area did not continue their upward trend 
and clearly undershot the average of the previ -
ous quarter (-1¾%). After seasonal adjustment, 
nominal goods exports decreased markedly in 
October in both a monthly and quarterly com -
parison (-1¼% in each case). Nominal goods 
imports recorded a steep seasonally adjusted 
decline of 3¼% in October on the month. The 
average level of the third quarter was also 
clearly undershot (-2%), but after price adjust -
ment the decline was only around half the size.
Construction
In October, construction output was up slightly 
(+¾%) in seasonally adjusted terms on the Sep -
tember level, which had undergone marked 
downward revision, and thus almost matched 
the average third- quarter level (-¼%). This was Domestic

due, on the one hand, to a steep decline in 
output in the finishing trades (-3½%), where 
the statistical data are very prone to revision, 
and, on the other hand, to a distinct expansion 
in the main construction sector (+2¾%). The 
increase in civil engineering (+3½%) was 
stronger than that in building construction 
(+2¼%). In the third quarter – figures are avail -
able up to then – new orders in the main con -
struction sector remained at the previous quar -
ter’s level. Housing construction recorded a 
very steep increase while there were fewer 
orders in industrial and public sector construc -
tion.
Labour market
Employment continued to rise clearly in Octo -
ber, albeit not quite as strongly as the average 
of the third quarter. The seasonally adjusted 
number of persons in work in Germany grew 
by 27,000 on the month; the year- on- year 
increase  was 385,000 persons or 0.9% at last 
report. The growth in employment is mainly 
attributable  to the creation of new jobs subject 
to social security contributions. There was an 
extraordinarily sharp year- on- year increase of 
688,000 jobs or 2.2% in September. In con -
trast, according to the provisional figures of 
the  Federal Employment Agency, exclusively 
low- paid part- time employment continued to 
decline  slightly. Furthermore, the development 
in the number of self- employed persons is con -
siderably negative. The leading indicators for 
the labour  market provided by the Ifo Institute 
and the Federal Employment Agency moved up 
further at last report from an already high start -
ing level, which suggests employment growth 
in the next few months.
Registered unemployment declined somewhat 
in seasonally adjusted terms in November, fol -
lowing a sideways movement since the begin -
ning of the second quarter. At the last count, 
2.77 million persons were registered as un -
employed at the Federal Employment Agency; 
the unemployment rate dropped by 0.1 per -Employment

centage point on the month to 6.3%. There 
were 84,000 fewer unemployed persons than 
one year earlier, with the unemployment rate 
down by 0.3 percentage point. In November, 
the labour market barometer of the Institute 
for Employment Research (IAB) remained at the 
level of the previous month slightly above the 
neutral threshold. Unemployment is therefore 
likely to remain stable over the next few months 
or to fall slightly.
Prices
Crude oil prices decreased strongly again 
during   the reporting period. On average in 
November  , prices declined by 6¾% on the 
month, and were just over two- fifths down on 
the year. Crude oil prices plummeted further 
after the OPEC meeting at the beginning of 
December  ended without a decision on pro -
duction ceilings. As this report went to press, 
the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil stood at 
US$37. The premium on crude oil futures was 
US$4¼ for deliveries six months ahead and 
US$8¼ 12 months ahead.
Import prices, which had fallen significantly in 
the previous few months, remained unchanged 
in October after seasonal adjustment. This 
applied  both to the energy components and to 
other industrial goods. Domestic industrial pro -
ducer prices continued to decline markedly, 
however. Not only energy, but also other goods 
were significantly cheaper in some cases. This 
was particularly true of intermediate goods, 
while producer prices for capital and consumer 
goods remained broadly stable. At both stages 
of the production chain, the negative year- on- 
year figure increased slightly to -4.1% for im -
port prices and -2.3% for producer prices.
Seasonally adjusted consumer prices in Novem -
ber were unchanged on the month. Prices for 
both energy and food products hardly moved. 
Industrial goods also remained at the level of 
the previous month. Services became slightly 
more expensive, with package holidays having a clearly dampening effect. Overall, the annual 
rate of consumer inflation rose to 0.4% accord -
ing to the national Consumer Price Index (CPI), 
and to 0.3% as measured by the Harmonised 
Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). Excluding 
energy  , the corresponding rate for both defin -
itions was +1.3%. Headline inflation is likely to 
increase in the next few months, mainly due to 
the decreasing  base effect as a result of the 
strong decline in crude oil prices at the turn of 
2014-15.
Public finances1
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
As in the previous year, the statutory health in -
surance scheme recorded a deficit of €1 billion 
in the third quarter of 2015. While the health 
insurance institutions closed in a somewhat 
better position than one year previously, with a 
slight surplus, the finances of the health insur -
ance fund deteriorated slightly with a deficit of 
just over €1 billion.
Including the additional contributions set indi -
vidually by the institutions, the revenue of the 
health insurance institutions stemming from 
transfers from the fund rose by 4½%. Diminish -
ing other inflows meant that total revenue 
recorded  somewhat weaker growth of 4%. 
Total expenditure saw a slightly more subdued 
increase of 3½%, however. The slowdown in 
spending growth that has been observed over 
several quarters thus continued. In particular, 
growth in expenditure on pharmaceuticals, for 
which higher discounts had expired in the pre -
vious year, continued to slow down, but was 
still above  average at 4½% recently. Although 
the increase in sickness benefit remained sig -Crude oil prices

1 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter.

debt, see the statistical section of this report.Deutsche Bundesbank

nificantly down on the high rates of the previ -
ous year, it picked up again somewhat in the 
third quarter at 5%. Overall, spending on bene -
fits rose by 4%. The somewhat weaker growth 
in total expenditure primarily stemmed from a 
drop in other expenditure (including premium 
payouts to insured persons, which have been 
prohibited since the beginning of 2015).
The health insurance fund recorded a third-  
quarter deficit, a typical development during 
the course of the year. Favourable employment 
developments paired with higher wages and 
pension payments resulted in a 4% increase in 
total contribution receipts. After adjustment for 
the lower average additional contribution rate 
of 0.83% – compared with the uniform special 
contribution of 0.9% levied until the end of 
2014 – this increase amounted to 4½%. Cen -
tral government transfers to finance tasks relat -
ing to society as a whole were almost one-  
tenth higher, since the temporary cut of 
€3½  billion for the full year was reduced to €2½ billion. Overall, revenue was up by just 
over 4% on the year. However, at 4½%, the 
increase in spending by the health insurance 
fund was recently somewhat steeper still, 
meaning that its deficit was a little less than 
€¼ billion higher than one year ago.
In autumn 2014, the group of statutory health 
insurance estimators had forecast a €2½ billion 
deficit in the health insurance fund for 2015. 
This amount corresponds to the gap between 
the reduced central government grant and the 
standard annual transfer of €14 billion and 
would be covered by drawing on the fund’s 
reserves . On account of the somewhat 
stronger- than- expected increase in income 
subject to compulsory insurance contributions 
in the first three quarters, the fund’s deficit 
could be somewhat smaller for 2015 as a 
whole, but will probably exceed the previous 
year’s figure (-€1 billion). For the health insur -
ance institutions, there are signs of somewhat 
weaker growth in spending on the benefits 
included  in the estimate compared with the 
size of the increase that was expected at the 
time. The health insurance institutions’ deficit 
could thus remain below the amount of €1 bil -
lion, which results from the average additional 
contribution rate staying below the rate needed 
to cover expenditure as calculated by the group 
of statutory health insurance estimators. How -
ever, the improvement this implies against the 
health insurance institutions’ prior- year result 
(-€1 billion) is likely to be overcompensated for 
by the probable increase in the health insur -
ance fund’s deficit, with the overall result that 
a limited increase in the statutory health insur -
ance system’s deficit compared with the previ -
ous year (-€2½ billion) is on the cards.
On account of a distinctly stronger rise in ex -
penditure compared with the rise in income 
subject to compulsory insurance contributions, 
as expected for 2016 by the group of statutory 
health insurance estimators in autumn 2015, 
an increase of 0.2 percentage point was calcu -
lated for the average additional contribution 
rate needed to cover expenditure, taking the Growth in con-

figure to 1.1%. A number of health insurance 
institutions have already decided to take such 
an adjustment measure. However, it is not yet 
possible at present to estimate precisely how 
high the average additional contribution rate 
will ultimately be in 2016, given that decisions 
have yet to be made in some cases and be -
cause of the possibility of members switching 
to other institutions. The option of making 
greater use of their reserves in excess of the 
statutory minimum to gain members by offer -
ing below- average additional contributions evi -
dently does not appear particularly attractive to 
a large number of institutions at the moment. 
Overall, the financial result of the statutory 
health insurance scheme is likely to improve in 
2016, especially since the €2½ billion increase 
in the central government grant back to the 
previous standard amount of €14 billion could 
mean that the health insurance fund no longer 
posts a deficit. Additional contributions can 
certainly be expected to climb further in future 
because trend growth in expenditure is exceed -
ing the respective rate for the contribution 
base.
Public long- term care 
insurance  scheme
The public long- term care insurance scheme 
recorded  a surplus of €¼ billion in the third 
quarter of 2015, following a slight deficit in the 
same period of 2014. The driver behind this 
financial  improvement was the fact that the 
contribution rate was raised from 2.05% to 
2.35% (plus an extra 0.25% in each case for 
childless persons) at the start of 2015. Given an 
overall expenditure increase of 14½%, the in -
crease in revenue (+19%, roughly 14½ percent -
age points of which were accounted for by the 
raised contribution rate) continued to signifi -
cantly outstrip the additional costs incurred 
from higher benefit rates and expanded bene -
fits owing to the 2015 reform. The additional 
revenue corresponding to 0.1 percentage point 
of the contribution rate (just over €¼ billion 
per quarter) does not affect the balance, as the transfers to the precautionary fund financed 
from this revenue are recorded here as spend -
ing by the public long- term care insurance 
scheme.
The scheme thus appears likely to record a 
marked surplus for 2015 as a whole. However, 
the expenditure effects expected in the wake 
of the benefit increases sparked by the 2015 
reform still do not seem to have been fully real -
ised. The precautionary fund will have built up 
reserves of just over €1 billion at the end of its 
first year. Transfers should continue up until the 
end of 2033, and from 2035 the funds should 
then be used exclusively to cushion further in -
creases in the contribution rate.
On 13 November 2015, the Bundestag adopted 
the Second Act to Strengthen Long-  term Care 
(Zweites Pflegestärkungsgesetz),  including a 
fundamental reform of benefits legislation. 
Under this Act, the three care levels currently in 
place are to be replaced by five care grades Continued

from 2017 onwards. Cognitive or psychological 
impairments will be considered equivalent to 
purely physical impairments with respect to the 
degree of long- term care required. In cases 
where benefits are already being received 
under current legislation, the possibility of cuts 
has been ruled out. The contribution rate in -
crease of a further 0.2 percentage point on 
1 January 2017 is set to be insufficient to cover 
the additional benefit claims from the outset. 
Regardless of the relatively favourable financial 
situation at present, the general reserves will 
then be depleted more rapidly in future; it thus 
appears likely that a further contribution rate 
hike will become necessary in several years’ 
time to fund current expenditure. Heavier 
burdens  will then be imposed once again on 
future generations paying into the pay- as- you- 
go system owing to continued unfavourable 
demographic trends.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €144.5 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in October 2015 was down only 
slightly on the previous month’s figure (€145.9 
billion). After deducting redemptions, which 
were higher than in September, and taking 
account  of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, net redemptions of do -
mestic debt securities came to €1.3 billion. The 
outstanding volume of foreign debt securities 
in Germany rose by €8.4 billion during the 
reporting  month, which meant that the out -
standing volume of debt instruments in the 
German market increased by €7.1 billion over -
all.
Domestic credit institutions issued bonds worth 
€5.8 billion net in October (compared with 
€3.6 billion in September). Growth was seen 
primarily in the outstanding volume of debt 
securities  issued by specialised credit institu -
tions (€5.7 billion), but also, to a lesser extent, 
in the outstanding volume of other bank debt securities (€2.0 billion). This contrasted with 
net redemptions of mortgage Pfandbriefe and 
public Pfandbriefe to the tune of €1.2 billion 
and €0.8 billion respectively.
In October, the public sector redeemed debt 
securities worth €0.9 billion net (following net 
redemptions of €2.6 billion in September). Cen -
tral government, in particular, reduced its debt 
by €1.9 billion in net terms. Predominantly five- 
year Federal notes (Bobls) (€12.8 billion), but 
also Treasury discount paper (Bubills) (€2.0 bil -
lion), were redeemed on balance. This con -
trasted with net issuance of ten- year Federal 
bonds (Bunds) (€6.0 billion), two- year Federal 
Treasury notes (Schätze) (€4.0 billion) and 
30-year Bunds (€0.7 billion). State and local 
governments issued new bonds worth €1.0 bil -
lion in net terms.
Domestic enterprises reduced their capital mar -
ket debt by €6.1 billion in October, after issuing 
bonds worth €19.6 billion net in the previous 
month. Exclusively long- term paper was re -
deemed on balance. Redemptions were almost 
solely attributable to other financial institutions 
(€6.6 billion).
In the reporting month, the Deutsche Bundes -
bank was the primary buyer in the German 
bond market, acquiring debt securities for 
€12.7 billion net under the Eurosystem’s asset 
purchase programmes. Domestic non- banks 
expanded their bond portfolios by €9.1 billion. 
By comparison, domestic credit institutions and 
non- resident investors sold debt securities for 
€12.3 billion and €2.4 billion net respectively.
Equity market
In October, domestic enterprises placed €0.9 
billion worth of new shares in the German 
equity market. The volume of foreign equities 
in the German market rose by €0.4 billion. 
Shares were purchased by foreign investors 
(€2.2 billion) and domestic credit institutions 
(€0.2 billion) on balance. Domestic non- banks Net redemptions

sold equities for €1.1 billion in net terms, all of 
which were German shares.
Mutual funds
In October, domestic mutual funds recorded 
net inflows of €8.2 billion (September: €9.8 bil -
lion). On balance, specialised funds reserved for 
institutional investors were once again the 
chief beneficiaries (€5.4 billion). Among the 
fund providers, mixed securities- based funds 
(€3.9 billion) and share- based funds (€1.7 bil -
lion) were the main sellers of new shares. The 
outstanding volume of foreign mutual fund 
shares distributed in Germany increased by 
€3.9 billion during the reporting month. Do -
mestic non- banks were virtually the only buyers 
of mutual fund shares in October (€11.8 bil -
lion). Domestic credit institutions purchased 
mutual fund shares for €0.2 billion net, while 
holdings by foreign investors remained un -
changed on balance.

In October 2015, the German current account 
recorded a surplus of €23.0 billion, €2.0 billion 
below its level in the previous month. This 
result   arose from a lower trade surplus com -
bined with a decline in the invisible current 
transactions balance, which comprises services 
as well as primary and secondary income.
In October, the surplus on the goods account 
was down slightly by €0.7 billion on the month 
to €24.1 billion, with exports of goods decreas -
ing somewhat owing to reduced receipts from 
merchanting trade and supplementary trade 
items, while goods imports were on the rise.
In the month under review, Germany recorded 
a total deficit of €1.1 billion in invisible current 
transactions, compared with a surplus of €0.2 
billion in September. This turnaround was pri -
marily attributable to a €1.5 billion rise in the 
secondary income deficit to €3.2 billion, mainly as a result of higher net payments to the EU 
budget. Added to this, the deficit in the ser -
vices account widened marginally by €0.3 bil -
lion to stand at €4.7 billion, whereas the sur -
plus on primary income grew by €0.6 billion to 
€6.7 billion.
In October, the international financial markets 
were influenced by the expansionary monetary 
policy that continued to prevail in key currency 
areas. Against this backdrop, German cross-  
border portfolio investment generated net cap -
ital exports totalling €13.3 billion, largely on 
account of the demand for foreign securities by 
German investors (€13.1 billion). First and 
foremost , they purchased bonds from foreign 
issuers (€9.1 billion), whilst also adding foreign 
mutual fund shares (€3.9 billion) and a modest 
volume of shares (€0.9 billion) to their port -
folios. By contrast, they parted with foreign 
money market paper (€0.8 billion). Meanwhile, 
foreign investors disposed of German securities 
to the tune of €0.2 billion net on the back of German mutual 
funds record inflows

ernment bonds worth €9.8 billion net – with 
the Bundesbank counting among those mak -
ing purchases under the government bond-  
buying programme  – but acquired private 
bonds (€7.7 billion) and shares issued by Ger -

Direct investment likewise generated net cap -
ital exports in October (€2.5 billion). Domestic 
enterprises in Germany supplied their affiliates 
abroad with funds to the tune of €5.0 billion. 
This was achieved almost exclusively by boost -
ing equity capital (€6.1 billion), primarily by 
reinvesting  earnings (€3.9 billion). By contrast, 
enterprises in Germany cut the amount of 
funds they transferred abroad via intra- group 
lending by €1.1 billion. They received net in -
flows in the shape of direct investment amount -
ing to €2.5 billion. For the most part, foreign 
investors granted loans to affiliated enterprises 
in Germany (€4.5 billion). Parallel to this, how -
ever, they reduced their equity stakes (€2.0 bil -
lion).
Other statistically recorded investment – com -
prising financial and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other assets – also saw net capital 
exports in October. These amounted to €5.5 
billion. Monetary financial institutions recorded 
net inflows totalling €1.5 billion while the activ -
ities of other sectors led to outflows of funds. 
Specifically, activities on the part of enterprises 
and households resulted in net outflows of 
€6.5 billion, while those of general government 
generated outflows in the amount of 0.3 bil -
lion. With respect to cross- border other invest -
ment by the Bundesbank, the increase in claims 
on TARGET2 balances (€7.6 billion) and the 
increase  in liabilities resulting from a rise in the 
Bundesbank’s holdings of foreign deposits 
(€7.5 billion) broadly offset one another.

Outlook for the German economy –  
macroeconomic projections  
for 2016 and 2017
The German economy is currently growing primarily on the back of lively domestic demand. The 
main drivers are the favourable labour market situation and substantial increases in households’ 
real disposable income. Foreign trade, by contrast, is currently being hampered by frail demand 
from the emerging market economies, and this is making itself felt on industrial investment. With 
export markets outside the euro area expected to rebound and economic growth within the euro 
area gaining a little more traction, the healthy underlying state of the German economy should 
stand out even more clearly over the next two years.
In this setting, growth of 1.7% in Germany’s real gross domestic product (GDP) this year could be 
followed by a rise of 1.8% in 2016 and 1.7% in 2017. The anticipated upturn in growth is masked 
by calendar effects. Adjusted for working- day variations, growth rates would stand at 1.7% in 
2016 and 1.9% in 2017, following 1.5% this year. The expected rise in GDP thus significantly out -
strips the estimated potential growth rate, which has been lifted slightly to 1.3% per annum for 
the next two years on account of the influx of refugees. Aggregate capacity utilisation can there -
fore be expected to climb distinctly and build up a widening gap over normal utilisation levels. 
Despite the expansionary effect which migration is having on the labour supply, the labour mar -
ket will experience shortages to a growing extent, driving up wage increases. Germany’s general  
government budget is expected to post a higher surplus still in the current year and record a more 
or less balanced fiscal outcome in 2016 and 2017 as mounting expenditure, inter alia on account 
of the influx of refugees, will clearly offset favourable cyclical factors and the lighter interest pay -
ment burden.
Against this backdrop, consumer price inflation will accelerate as the dampening effect of crude 
oil prices on inflation gradually peters out. This should more visibly reflect the feed- through of 
rising domestic cost pressures in the price level. As measured by the Harmonised Index of Con -
sumer Prices (HICP), inflation could rise from 0.2% this year to 1.1% next year and 2.0% in 2017. 
Excluding energy, HICP inflation should climb from 1.1% in 2015 to 2.0% in 2017.
Compared with the June 2015 projection, expectations for economic growth have now been 
raised slightly for 2017, while the expectations for inflation have been pared back over the entire 
forecast horizon, notably in 2016. The adjustment to expected price developments largely reflects 
the renewed downturn in crude oil prices, which had not been expected in June. Downside risks 
to economic growth would arise if the current sluggish dynamics in a number of emerging market 
economies (EMEs) were to worsen. In addition, the scale of the expected refugee influx and the 
attendant macroeconomic and fiscal implications are subject to major uncertainty.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current situation
The pace of expansion of the German econ -
omy decelerated somewhat in the second and 
third quarters of 2015. After posting strong 
growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the 
first three months of 2015, real GDP rose by 
0.8% in seasonally and calendar- adjusted 
terms, just short of the rate projected in the 
June projection.1
The German economy is currently growing pri -
marily on the back of robust domestic demand. 
In the second and third quarters private con -
sumption continued the robust growth trend 
that has been in evidence since mid-2014, 
though with slightly weaker momentum. Posi -
tive impulses were provided mainly by higher 
income levels in the wake of stronger employ -
ment growth and a marked rise in earnings, 
combined with the increases in purchasing 
power brought about by the lower crude oil 
prices.Business investment, by contrast, which had 
increased  steeply in the latter part of 2014 and 
in early 2015, declined distinctly. One factor in 
this may have been that industrial output 
remained  on the flat trajectory that it has been 
locked into for some time now. Industrial firms 
are comfortably processing their stock of orders 
with their existing production capacities at nor -
mal utilisation levels. Added to this, the recent 
fall- off in new orders has given them little rea -
son to expand their production capacities. The 
industrial investment ratio was not far off its 
long- run average despite its recent setback.2
The underlying upward trend in Germany’s resi -
dential real estate market remains intact. While 
housing investment was only slightly up on the 
winter level, it should be noted that investment 
in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quar -
ter of 2015 had been bolstered by exceptionally 
mild weather conditions.
Export growth remained buoyant into the 
second quarter, with deliveries of goods and 
services to euro- area and non- euro- area coun -
tries alike growing at an extremely brisk pace, 
even though the export markets outside the 
euro area have been slackening since the be -
ginning of the year. German exporters could 
not fully maintain their substantial gains in 
market share outside the euro area, which 
were probably aided by the euro’s depreci -
ation. Exports lost much of their momentum in 
the third quarter. Foreign trade is missing the 
stimulus from non- euro- area markets, espe -
cially from EMEs in the Far East. As for imports, 
the downturn in business investment meant 
that import growth was not only a little flatter 
than hitherto but that it also fell short of the 
figure assumed in the June projection.German

Employment rose by 215,000 persons in the 
second and third quarters, which was fraction -
ally higher than the figure assumed in the June 
projection. The buoyant employment situation 
probably owed much to migrants from other 
EU countries, who mostly assimilate well 
into  the labour market. Seasonally adjusted 
unemployment , on the other hand, barely 
declined  any further.
Year- on- year growth in wage costs in the 
second and third quarters, measured in terms 
of compensation per employee, averaged 3.0% 
and was thus slightly higher than expected. 
This was due to wage drift, which was up 
somewhat in spring due to slightly higher 
bonuses  paid by industry. The effect of the 
introduction of the general minimum wage on 
actual earnings observed hitherto is broadly 
consistent with the assessments presented in 
earlier projections.3
Price pressures since the beginning of the 
second quarter have eased rather than climb -
ing markedly, as had been anticipated in June. 
The June projection had forecast an annual 
HICP rate for October of 0.9%, compared with 
the actual outturn of just 0.2%. This quite large 
forecasting error was mainly attributable to the 
renewed downturn in crude oil prices, although 
price inflation for services similarly fell short of 
expectations, with the increase in rents proving 
to be surprisingly small.4 On the other hand, 
the price increase for goods, notably for food, 
had been underestimated in June. The non-  
energy HICP inflation measure therefore 
matched the expected rate of 1.4%.
Major assumptions
This projection is based on assumptions made 
by the Eurosystem’s experts concerning the 
global economy, exchange rates, commodity 
prices and interest rates. The assumptions are 
based on information available as at 12  No -
vember 2015. The assumptions regarding eco -
nomic activity in the euro area are derived from projections made by the national central banks 
of the euro- area countries.
Global economic growth has not accelerated 
during the course of the year as fast as the 
June projection had assumed. Activity in the 
industrial  countries was robust, broadly match -
ing the expectations, but in a number of emer -
ging market economies it failed to meet the 
June projection. Structural problems as well as 
macroeconomic and financial imbalances are 
continuing to hamper the growth prospects of 
various EMEs. The low commodity prices are 
compounding these problems for a number of Employment

4 Rents for existing lettings predominate in the consumer 
price index. They normally adjust to rents for new lettings 
with a substantial time- lag and are less volatile. Since rent 
levels for new lettings have been rising strongly for a 
number of years now, the consumer price component 
“rents” had been expected to accelerate further.Deutsche Bundesbank

commodity- extracting EME countries.5 The rate 
of expansion in the world economy (excluding 
the euro area) is expected to accelerate moder -
ately in 2016 and 2017, and global growth 
(weighted by purchasing power parities) could 
advance from 3% this year to 3½% in 2016 
and 4% one year later. Growth rates would 
thus remain at a moderate level.
The volume of global trade actually contracted 
in the first six months of the year. It fell well 
short of the assumptions made in the June pro -
jection and is difficult to reconcile with the 
reported  global growth figures. Recessions and 
the depreciation of domestic currencies in a 
number of major EMEs triggered a sharp drop 
in imports, which also receded in several indus -
trial countries. While the latter should be a 
short- lived phenomenon, the recovery of im -
port demand in several EMEs might turn out to 
be more hesitant. This has prompted further 
sharp downward revisions to the assumptions 
for international trade (excluding the euro 
area). Following on from just +½% in the cur -
rent year, growth rates for the next two years 
are projected to be no more than 3% and 
3¾%, well short of the average of 4½% per 
annum  observed since 2010.
Expectations of an abundant supply of crude 
oil in tandem with subdued global industrial activity as well as weaker demand dynamics in 
some EMEs have contributed to a renewed 
marked decline in crude oil prices since the 
June projection. While the futures prices from 
which the assumptions for crude oil prices are 
derived still point upwards, crude oil prices in 
this projection are one- quarter (for 2016) and 
one- fifth (for 2017) lower than what had been 
assumed in the June projection. The prices of 
other commodities have likewise fallen again 
considerably. It might take commodity prices 
until 2017 to rebound given the expected mod -
erate pace of expansion of the global econ -
omy.
With policy rates remaining low, the Eurosys -
tem continued the expanded asset purchase 
programme (EAPP) that it launched in March 
2015. The ECB Governing Council also recalled 
that the programme provides sufficient flexibil -
ity should the anchoring of medium to long-  
term inflation expectations and the objective of 
returning the rate of HICP inflation back to a 
level below, but close to, 2% in the medium 
term be jeopardised. Despite the robust devel -
opment of domestic demand in the euro area, 
the ECB Governing Council announced in 
October  that it would re- examine the degree of 
monetary policy accommodation at its Decem -
ber meeting. The prospects of a sustained high 
supply of liquidity and a further drop in the 
deposit  rate again slightly dampened market 
expectations of future interest rate movements. 
The technical assumptions derived from these 
expectations regarding the trajectories of short- 
term interest rates and yields on nine to ten-  
year government bonds are thus still lower 
than the assumptions that underlay the June 
projection. In line with this, the interest rates 
for bank loans in Germany assumed in this pro -
jection also remain at a very low level. Accord -

(DIHK), access to credit in Germany is likewise 
still very favourable.
Against the backdrop of clear signals of an im -
minent policy rate rise by the US Federal 
Reserve  and the announcements made by the 
ECB Governing Council in October, which bol -
stered expectations of a further loosening of 
monetary policy in the euro area, the euro 
recently  depreciated further against the US dol -
lar. In the period used for deriving the exchange 
rate assumptions, the single currency traded at 
US$1.09, which was 3 cents lower than the 
assumptions  in the June projection.6 The slight 
downward drift continued after this projection 
was concluded.
The economic recovery in the euro area has 
continued over the year to date. Significant 
growth stimuli have emanated from domestic 
demand. In particular, private consumption 
spending has continued to benefit from em -
ployment growth and the additional scope for 
expenditure resulting from persistently low 
energy  prices. The demand backlog for con -
sumer durables has also provided a stimulus in 
a number of countries. This demand had been 
curbed in the past few years on account of a 
weak income trend and heightened labour 
market risk.7 More favourable financing condi -
tions and the easier access to credit are encour -
aging firms to step up their investment. Much 
like in Germany, euro- area exports rose dis -
tinctly in the first half of the year, despite 
declining  world trade. Exporters probably bene -
fited from increased competitiveness, due 
partly to the euro’s depreciation, and from 
strong demand from a number of industrial 
countries. Trade within the euro area also 
picked up considerably, boosted by the in -
creased stimulation of demand.8 Exports are 
likely to rise fairly steeply in the next two years, 
too, with exports to countries outside the euro 
area expected to benefit less from the euro’s 
low exchange rate and more from the recovery 
in world trade. Following calendar- adjusted 
GDP growth of 1.5% in the current year, the 
growth rates expected for the euro area (excluding  Germany) for 2016 and 2017 are 
slightly lower than those given in the June pro -
jection, at 1.7% and 1.9%; this is because of 
lower external stimuli owing to the downward 
revision to the assumptions for world trade. 
This means that average aggregate capacity 
utilisation of the other euro- area countries will 
not yet be back to normal levels by the end of 
the forecast period.
The fiscal policy measures in Germany con -
sidered in this projection will worsen the gen -
eral government fiscal balance up to 2017 by 
½% of GDP compared with 2015 (primarily in 
2016).9 Changes in taxes and levies will have 
practically no effect on balance. On the one 
hand, the statutory health insurance institu -
tions are expected to progressively raise their 
respective additional contribution rates on 
average. Moreover, the contribution rate for Monetary policy

increase in the basic income tax allowance at 
the start of 2016. On the expenditure side, a 
renewed expansion of benefits under the 
second reform of long- term care in 2017 as 
well as additional healthcare spending and the 
increase in the housing allowance will push up 
social benefits. Added to this is higher spend -
ing on infrastructure, education, research and 
social housing construction. The measures in -
cluded here need to be supplemented by dis -
tinctly higher spending in connection with the 
influx of refugees.10
Economic outlook11
In the fourth quarter of 2015 and first quarter 
of 2016, the expansion of aggregate output in Germany is unlikely to markedly exceed the 
pace of growth in the preceding two quarters, 
but probably will not remain below that rate 
either. Industrial output could continue to 
suffer  into the first quarter of 2016 from the 
recent weak order intake, even though senti -
ment in manufacturing has already rebounded 
from its slowdown in the second and third 
quarters of 2015, according to the Ifo Insti -
tute’s surveys. The services sectors are expected 
to carry on growing robustly.
The German economy could gain additional 
momentum over the course of 2016 if exports, 
as assumed, recover from their sluggishness in 
the second half of 2015 and business invest -
ment also subsequently revives as capacity util -
isation rises. A key prerequisite for this is that 
world trade expands at a faster pace. However, 
the quite steep growth in Germany will con -
tinue to be largely driven by domestic demand 
and, in particular, by private consumption, 
which is reaping the benefits of low unemploy -
ment, distinct increases in real wages and rising 
government transfers. The influx of refugees is 
playing an important role in both government 
monetary transfers and in the comparatively 
large increase in government consumption ex -
penditure.
Under these conditions, fourth- quarter growth 
in seasonally and calendar- adjusted real GDP 
could be lifted to 2.0% over the course of 2016 
and may almost  maintain this pace in 2017 
with growth of 1.8%.12 In terms of annual 
averages, this results  in GDP growth, adjusted 
for seasonal and calendar effects, of 1.7% in 
2016 and of 1.9% for 2017, after 1.5% in 2015.

from the different number of working days has 
the result that the unadjusted annual average 
growth rates paint a somewhat different pic -
ture (+1.8% for 2016 and +1.7% for 2017, after 
+1.7% in 2015). For 2016, the same level of 
GDP growth is thus expected as in the June 
projection, whereas a slightly higher increase is 
now anticipated for 2017.
Overall, the German economy would expand 
significantly faster than potential output in the 
next two years. At 1.3% per year over the pro -
jection period, the expansion of potential out -
put is now estimated to be marginally higher 
than it was in June, owing to the impact of the 
influx of refugees on the labour force potential 
(including a certain crowding- out effect on 
other net migration) and the indirect effects on 
productivity growth and fixed capital forma -
tion. The output gap, which is already slightly 
positive this year, would continue to widen, 
and the German economy’s production capaci -
ties would see considerably higher utilisation in 
2017 than the long- run average.
Besides robust domestic activity, a key precon -
dition for the expected strengthening of the 
growth process in 2016 is a marked acceler -
ation of exports. However, the weak perform -
ance of late is likely to be only gradually over -
come. This is suggested by the declining num -
ber of orders received from abroad in the third 
quarter and the worsened export expectations 
of industrial enterprises revealed by the DIHK’s 
autumn survey. Given the assumption of 
stronger growth in international sales markets, 
however, exports should pick up again over the 
course of 2016 and largely maintain this higher 
pace in 2017. Even though the boost provided 
by the euro’s depreciation has probably largely 
run its course, German exporters could, after a 
certain dip, potentially slightly expand the mar -
ket share they gained up to mid-2015 in trade 
with non- euro- area countries, while slight re -
ductions in market share are probable in trade 
with other euro- area countries owing to Ger -
man firms’ deteriorating price competitiveness.… will push

Business investment is also likely to remain 
slack in the fourth quarter of 2015 and first 
quarter of 2016. A crucial factor in this is the 
subdued outlook for industry, where utilisation 
of production capacities is merely normal, 
meaning there has so far been no need for 
investment  in capacity expansion. The healthy 
financial position of enterprises and the on -
going extremely favourable financing condi -
tions are likely to be used primarily for replace -
ment and modernisation projects in the first 
instance. In the course of 2016, however, in -
vestment is expected to revive if robust domes -
tic activity is augmented by additional stimuli 
from foreign demand and the degree of aggre -
gate capacity utilisation climbs into significantly 
positive territory.
Housing investment is likely to pick up again 
more strongly in the projection period. Building 
permits and new orders in housing construc -
tion have risen considerably of late, pointing to 
robust demand in this area. What is more, financing  terms remain favourable, and the 
high immigration level is still providing momen -
tum. However, the expected population profile 
of this inflow of immigrants contrasts sharply 
with the previous pattern given the increasing 
share of refugees, which makes it more difficult 
to assess the impact on the housing markets.13
Notwithstanding the investment packages 
agreed by the Federal Government and the 
comparatively good fiscal situation of many 
state and local governments, growth in gov -
ernment investment will probably be no more 
than muted this year. Government construction 
investment is, however, expected to rise per -
ceptibly in the next two years as there are plans 
to ramp up infrastructure investment. More -
over, higher growth in government investment 
in machinery and equipment is in the pipeline 
once the current delays in military procure -
ments are resolved.14
Overall, gross fixed capital formation should 
make an increasing contribution to economic 
growth over the next two years. While the in -
crease in fixed capital formation is likely to re -
main modest next year, fixed investment is 
likely to pick up again noticeably in 2017 on the 
back of stronger private investment.
Private consumption will remain the driving 
force behind the buoyant domestic demand 
over the projection horizon. This is due mainly 
to the continuing upbeat labour market situ -
ation, which is marked by sharply rising em -
ployment and low unemployment as well as 
perceptible wage growth. Moreover, the 
growth in real disposable incomes as a result of 
these favourable fundamentals is being ampli -
fied by exceptional factors. While the introduc -
tion of the minimum wage and the sharp drop 
in energy prices provided stimulus this year, the 
additional government monetary transfers in 
connection with the influx of refugees will pro -Business

vide a catalyst in 2016 especially, as will income 
tax cuts, for instance. In addition, the oil price 
has fallen even lower and will continue to sig -
nificantly dampen average consumer price in -
flation next year.
With consumer price inflation picking up again 
and smaller supportive fiscal effects, real dis -
posable household income is likely to grow at a 
slightly slower rate in 2017, at 1½%, than in 
2015 and 2016. The saving ratio could decline 
a little next year compared with 2015 when the 
additional purchasing power gains brought 
about by lower energy prices are gradually 
translated in toto  into higher consumer spend -
ing. In terms of real private consumption, this 
results in growth rates of 2¼% in 2016 and 
1½% in 2017, following +2% this year.
Government consumption has risen perceptibly 
this year, and growth looks likely to remain 
relatively strong over the next two years. This is 
due to additional healthcare spending as well 
as the second reform of long- term care in 2017. 
In addition, payroll spending for child day- care 
and education is to be stepped up both in gen -
eral and also as a result of refugee migration. 
Moreover, the growing number of asylum ap -
plications will necessitate higher social transfers 
in kind.
With final demand set to expand overall, im -
ports, too, should rise strongly over the fore -
cast period. Moreover, the import share in im -
portant expenditure components should in -
crease further with the continuing international 
division of labour, although recently revised 
national accounts data suggest that this trend 
is slightly flatter than previously assumed. After 
rising by 6% in 2015, imports could increase by 
almost 5% and 5½% respectively in the two 
coming years. European manufacturers, due to 
their improved competitive position vis-  à- vis 
non- euro- area providers, also as a result of the 
depreciation of the euro, should benefit more 
from the revival of demand in Germany.… but could

Germany’s trade surplus rose sharply this year. 
This was driven by strong price effects resulting 
from continued low crude oil prices as well as 
developments in exports, which benefited, 
amongst other things, from the depreciating 
euro and product range effects. The current ac -
count balance is thus also at an especially high 
level. In the two subsequent years, however, 
the surplus is likely to shrink somewhat amid 
rising domestic demand and strong import 
growth. In addition, import prices should pick 
up again perceptibly over the projection period. 
Nonetheless, the surplus is unlikely to fall below 
7% of GDP . This is partly because the primary 
income balance is expected to remain well in 
positive territory given Germany’s large inter -
national investment position.
Labour market
The positive labour market development of the 
past few years should continue during the fore -
cast period due to the overall favourable eco -
nomic outlook. For the next few months, lead -
ing indicators point towards ongoing high de -
mand for labour, especially in several services 
sectors. The Ifo employment barometer sug -
gests that trade and industry is planning to cre -
ate a considerable number of new jobs. This is 
borne out by the record level reached by the 
Federal Employment Agency’s BA-  X job index. 
The enterprises questioned by the Association 
of German Chambers of Commerce and Indus -
try as part of its autumn survey are only slightly 
less optimistic. Jobs subject to social security 
contributions are likely to remain the main 
driver of employment growth over the projec -
tion horizon.
That the continuing high demand for labour 
has, to date, not caused more severe labour 
market shortages is due to the steady influx of 
workers from other EU member states. This 
year again, a fairly large number of people 
have migrated to Germany on balance, espe -
cially from countries recently granted extended 
labour mobility within the EU (Romania, Bul -Slight fall in

garia and Croatia). Overall, however, the influx 
from the east European EU countries, too, now 
appears to have peaked. This projection assumes 
that net immigration of non- refugees will drop 
from around 400,000 in 2015 to approximately 
275,000 in 2016 and just under 200,000 in 
2017.
Moreover, the influx of refugees will also be felt 
in terms of labour supply. However, it will prob -
ably be quite some time before refugees are 
integrated into the labour market in any signifi -
cant number (for the underlying assumptions 
on the influx of refugees and its economic and 
fiscal implications up until 2017, see the box on 
pages 24 to 28). The effects on the labour mar -
ket will consequently probably remain limited 
over the forecast horizon. The introduction of a 
general statutory minimum wage at the begin -
ning of 2015 will make it even more difficult for 
refugees, whose qualifications are probably 
often not in line with labour demand and who 
lack language skills, to find work. A consider -
able number of refugees are likely to be insuffi -
ciently productive, particularly when they first 
enter Germany, to make it attractive for poten -
tial employers to take them on at wages at or 
above the minimum wage.15 As a consequence, 
many recognised refugees will probably initially 
be unemployed even though there currently 
appears to be a comparatively large demand 
for unskilled workers in some services indus -
tries. This could mask an underlying slight 
decline  in unemployment, with the jobless total 
potentially even rising somewhat over the next 
two years.
Demographic factors imply that the labour sup -
ply of the native population will increasingly 
contract over the projection horizon. In add -
ition, the low level of unemployment (exclud -
ing refugees) reached by then will be difficult 
to reduce further under the prevailing eco -
nomic and socio- political conditions. Conse -
quently, labour market shortages look increas -
ingly likely. Nor is refugee immigration likely to 
substantially ease these shortages over the 
forecast period. Employment growth could therefore slow somewhat especially towards 
the end of the projection horizon, despite the 
robust state of the economy. This might be 
partly offset by a slightly stronger increase in 
productivity as capacity utilisation grows, and 
by slightly longer working hours.
Labour costs and prices
When estimating increases in negotiated 
wages, all past pay agreements are taken into 
consideration and extrapolated beyond their 
contractual term, taking into account the over -
all economic situation and industry- specific 
features . The 2015 pay settlements were pre -
dominantly moderate, with average wage in -
creases of 2½% a year. The very moderate 
wage agreements in the services industries of 
late and potentially diminished trade union in -
fluence as fewer workers are covered by col -
lective bargaining suggest that negotiated 
wages in these industries are likely to display a 
flatter growth trajectory. With strong economic 
growth and increasing shortages on the labour 
market, the rise in negotiated wages is none -
theless likely to intensify towards the end of 
the projection horizon. Overall, negotiated pay, 
as defined in the Bundesbank’s negotiated pay 
rate statistics, will increase by not quite 2½% 
both this year and next and by around 2¾% in 
2017. This represents a slight downward revi -
sion for 2016 and 2017 as compared with the 
June projection.
The general statutory minimum wage of €8.50 
an hour, which came into force at the begin -
ning of the year, triggered a pronounced rever -
sal in the wage drift from negative to positive.16 Labour market

16 Only in exceptional cases, does the general minimum 
wage have a direct impact on the Bundesbank’s negotiated 
pay rate statistics. This is because the Bundesbank’s statis -
tics are usually based on an agreed basic pay rate, which 
presupposes completed vocational training and several 
years of professional experience, whereas the minimum 
wage predominantly applies to segments with lower quali -

The current inﬂ  ux of refugees – projected impact on the 
labour  market and public fi  nances
The fi  rst thing to note when considering the 
current infl  ux of refugees to Germany is 
that they are fl  eeing from great hardship in 
their home countries. But the current wave of immigration will naturally also impact on 
the German economy, not least the labour 
market and public fi  nances. This analysis 
outlines the assumptions made in the pro-
jection in respect of migration and the 
expected  economic repercussions. The aim 
is to make it easier to interpret the esti-
mates while taking account of the particu-
larly high degree of uncertainty surrounding 
the future levels and structure of refugee migration and its impact on employment 
and wages as well as on economic growth and government budgets.
The available information is mostly sparse, 
necessitating many assumptions which are 
subject to major uncertainty. Besides gauging the likely scale of refugee migra-
tion, the future speed of processing appli-
cations for asylum, the share of successful 
applications and the average duration of stay after rejection of unsuccessful appli-
cants in Germany, these assumptions relate 
to numerous other factors, including as-
pects that are key to ensuring the successful integration into the labour market of those allowed to stay. Several of these parameters can be infl  uenced by modifying the institu-
tional and legal framework. This analysis, however, is based on the legislative status 
quo and thus does not anticipate, say, pos-
sible additional measures aimed at improv-
ing the integration of refugees or the estab-lishment of a system geared to distributing 
asylum seekers more evenly among the in-
dividual EU member states.
By the end of October 2015, Germany’s Federal Offi   ce for Migration and Refugees (Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge  
or BAMF) had registered 331,000 initial applications  for asylum so far this year. 
However, there is currently a huge backlog of applications still waiting to be processed. 
Consequently, a more reliable indicator 
might be the number of refugees recorded by BAMF’s EASY database, although it was 
not actually designed to register refugees but rather to organise the distribution of asylum seekers among the various federal 
states. Up to the end of October, EASY had 
logged 758,000 applicants, although this 
fi  gure probably overstates the actual num-
ber of individuals applying for asylum in Germany owing to multiple recording or 
registrations of migrants in transit.
This projection assumes that gross immigra-
tion of asylum seekers will total 900,000 in 
2015 (see following table). For 2016 as a whole, a further 900,000 refugees are expected . This projection, which includes family members
1 who may later join per-
sons granted asylum, would indicate a major decline relative to the average monthly infl  ux seen in the second half of 
this year. In 2017, this fi  gure is expected to 
drop to 600,000. Net immigration of asy-lum seekers, ie infl  ows minus outfl  ows
2 
could total over 1½ million between 2015 
and 2017. To this total must be added other net immigration. In the past few years, this 
has mainly taken the form of economic 
migrants  from other EU countries. This kind of migration is expected to contract sharply 
over the projection period as net immigra-
tion from eastern and southern Europe 
appears  to have already peaked. The macro-
economic projection further assumes that 
1 In line with the “Geneva” Convention relating to the 
Status of Refugees, the Residence Act (Aufenthalts-
gesetz) generally only permits close family members 
(ie spouses and children) to subsequently join persons eligible for asylum status and refugees.
2 These outfl  ows comprise not just asylum seekers 
whose applications have been rejected but also recog-nised refugees exiting the country. Such an exit may be voluntary but it may also occur upon the expiry of their limited residence status as a recognised refugee where the situation in their home country has improved suffi   -ciently.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
December 2015

the new refugees will crowd out other 
kinds of immigrant to a small degree as 
they have similar work skills, meaning that 
economic migrants will have worse job pro-
spects in the German labour market. In order to isolate the direct impact of the 
infl  ux  of refugees, this crowding- out effect 
will not be considered here.
The scale of refugee migration, the share of 
migrants recognised as refugees and the 
length of time taken to process applications 
vary greatly depending on the applicant’s 
country of origin. For instance, the share of 
asylum seekers arriving from Syria, who 
have almost always been granted protec-
tion in the recent past, has increased signifi  -cantly in the course of 2015, while the share 
of migrants from west Balkan countries, 
who have virtually no chance of becoming 
residents, has declined. Accordingly, the 
proportion of those receiving protection in 
Germany will rise considerably in the short 
term. The current projection assumes that 
the average recognition rate in 2015 will be just over half of the total number of appli-cants, with this fi  gure rising to close to two- thirds in 2016 and 2017, compared with just 
under one- third in 2014. According to 
BAMF fi  gures, the average amount of time needed to process an asylum application in 2014 was just over eleven months.
3 Despite 
the current backlog in registering applica-tions, it is anticipated that the drive to accelerate  the procedure will reduce the average time span between entering the country and receiving a decision on their status to nine months, commencing in 
2016.4
Aside from an individual’s prospects of becoming  a resident, other key factors affecting  the impact of refugee migration 
on the labour market include age structure, 
language skills and qualifi  cations. Accord-
ing to the available reports, asylum seekers 
tend to be relatively young. The projection 
assumes that three- quarters of the refugees are of working age between 15 and 65 and that the bulk of the remainder are children.
5 The low average age of applicants and the 
unlikelihood of their having obtained a training certifi  cate in their home country mean that refugees’ (verifi  able) vocational qualifi  cations are likely to be signifi  cantly inferior  to those offered by Germans or other migrants.

Asylum, Migration und Inte gration. On page 54 of this 
publication it says that the average amount of time 
needed to complete the asylum procedure was 11.3 
months (arithmetic mean) and that the median fi  gure 
(when the procedure is half- way complete) equalled 
seven months.4 Moreover, account is taken of the fact that rejected asylum applicants often do not leave the country right away.5 According to BAMF, around 26% of fi  rst- time asylum 
applicants registered between January and October 
2015 were younger than 16, with a further 55% aged 
between 16 and 35. Less than 1 per cent were older 
than 65. See BAMF (2015), Aktuelle Zahlen zu Asyl, 
October 2015, p 7.6 No reliable data on refugees’ vocational training are 
available at present. Among employed and un-
employed persons subject to social security contribu-
tions and originating from war- torn countries – a cat-egory that does not per se refer to former refugees – 
71% had no evidence of vocational training, 8% had 
some training certifi  cate and a further 8% had aca-demic qualifi  cations in June 2015. See German Insti-

ably applies to their school- leaving qualifi  -
cations.7 However, qualifi  cations can be 
gained in Germany, which the broadly 
young intake of refugees should fi  nd fairly 
easy. This scenario presents the German 
education system with a major challenge.
Once recognised, refugees gain unrestricted 
access to the labour market for as long as 
their residence permit is valid.8 Neverthe-
less, for the time being, the share of non- 
employed persons will probably remain 
comparatively high as many newcomers will 
fi  rst need to acquire German language skills 
and other qualifi  cations. Accordingly, the 
projection assumes a labour force participa-tion of initially just under 50%. This is well 
below the average for the general popula-
tion, roughly three- quarters of which is in the workforce. In addition to the lengthy asylum procedure, this is a further reason why the infl  ow of refugees will probably 
impact only gradually on the labour market. Based on the aforementioned assumptions, 
the aggregate labour supply will grow by around 520,000 persons (1¼%) in cumula-
tive terms during the reporting period (see 
adjacent chart).
The results of empirical studies suggest that 
this additional pool of labour will initially 
push up unemployment owing to low or irrelevant  skills as well as cultural and lin-
guistic barriers, with refugees only gradually 
gaining a foothold in the labour market.9 
For instance, according to the IAB, the level 
of unemployment among foreigners from 
war- torn and crisis- stricken countries, many 
of whom are likely to have entered Ger-
many only recently, stands at around 40%.10 
Despite the currently favourable labour market situation, the projection assumes an unemployment rate of 70% in the fi  rst 
7 An unrepresentative BAMF survey of refugees arriv-
ing in 2015, together with statistics supplied by the 
Federal Employment Agency on employed and un-
employed persons subject to social security contribu-
tions and originating from war- torn countries, sug-gests that the share of asylum seekers possessing a 
certifi  cate of aptitude for higher education, a lower or 
intermediate secondary  school leaving certifi  cate or more basic or no qualifi  cations is one- third for each 
category. See IAB (2015) op cit, p 4f.
8 By contrast, asylum seekers, ie individuals whose 
application  has not yet been evaluated, may not com-
mence employment until at least three month after 
submitting their application. Moreover, for the follow-ing 12 months they may only do so subject to a priority 
test conducted by the Federal Employment Agency. 
However, their participation in the labour market will 
be modest, not least as their uncertain residence status is likely to limit their job prospects to mainly casual or low- paid part- time work. Therefore, the assumed em-
ployment rate among this group of persons is barely 
more than one- twentieth.9 The results of empirical studies are based on correl-
ations observed in the past and therefore cannot be directly applied to today’s situation because key fac-tors such as legal provisions, labour market situation 
and migration structure have since changed. This is all the more the case for studies focusing on other coun-tries. For information on the integration of immigrants 
into the labour market see, for instance, M Benton, 
S Fratzke and M Sumption (2014), Moving up or stand-
ing still? Access to middle- skilled work for newly arrived  migrants in the European Union, Migration Policy  Institute (MPI) and International Labour Offi   ce

12 months following recognition as a refu-
gee, falling to a still sizeable 40% in the 
third year. This produces an employment 
rate of around 15% in the fi  rst year follow-ing the granting of refugee status, rising to 
roughly one- third after three years.11 The 
total number of persons in work could rise by about ½% by 2017 on account of refu-gee migration, in which case the unemploy-ment rate will be ½ percentage point higher 
than it would have been if this infl  ux had not occurred. German citizens are unlikely 
to be crowded out of the labour  market as 
foreign newcomers possess different skills than native workers.
12 Nevertheless, some 
Germans with limited qualifi  cations or im-
migrants already residing in Germany could fi  nd themselves disadvantaged.
13
The fact that the average skillset is likely to be relatively limited, coupled with linguistic 
and cultural barriers, will doubtless also impact  on the earnings of working refu-
gees. IAB fi  gures indicate that, in the past, 
recognised refugees’ average gross monthly earnings were clearly below those recorded 
for other groups of migrants, both in the fi  rst year following immigration and even 15 years later.
14 Compared with native 
workers, this pay gap was even greater.15 In 
line with past observations, the projection 
assumes that most refugees taking up gain-
ful employment will initially be engaged in 
low- paid work.16 This will slightly depress 
the annual aggregate rise in earnings per 
employee over the projection period.
Furthermore, given the major uncertainty 
attached to many factors, it is hard to gauge 
the impact of developments on public fi  nances  at present. With respect to the effects  on government budgets in a given year, apart from the annual average num-ber of refugees that need to be provided for, the per capita expenditure entailed is 
also of signifi  cance. For the duration of the asylum procedure and in the interim period 
between receiving a rejection and exiting the country, asylum seekers receive cash and non- cash benefi  ts to cover their basic needs (including healthcare and accommo-
dation) pursuant to the Act on Benefi  ts 
Granted to Asylum Seekers (Asylbewerber-
leistungsgesetz). In addition, the govern-
ment incurs expenditure on administration, integration (inter alia for language courses) or repatriation measures, where applicable. 
Once an applicant has been granted asy-
lum, the standard provisions apply, eg social 
welfare legislation. This leads to compara-
tively high transfers, mostly unemployment 
welfare benefi  t (II) and accommodation 
costs that will persist for quite some time. 
On top of this, there are other costs, not-
ably for childcare, education and training as well as assistance in fi  nding work. Own in-
come that would reduce transfers and in-
crease tax and social contributions is likely 
to be very modest initially.
Overall, the scenarios presented here result 
in a year- on- year increase in government 
expenditure (compared with 2014) equiva-
11 The stated shares are based on IAB (2015), which 
assumes that the employment rate among refugees 
will gradually become aligned with that of the native 
population over a period of almost 15 years.

lent to ¼% of GDP in 2015, rising to ½% 
next year and just under ¾% in 2017. Ini-tially, government consumption will pre-
dominate When the wave of refugees sub-
sequently ebbs, as is presumed, and bene-
fi  ts for those granted the right of residence 
become the main cost factor, monetary 
transfers to households will gain in import-ance.
17
The additional government spending on refugees will push up aggregate demand as the projection assumes that the effects 
of this supplementary government expend-
iture on the budget will not be offset by 
savings or tax increases elsewhere. Includ-
ing second- round effects, this demand shock is likely to have a similar impact to 
that of a stimulus package and per se will 
raise German GDP by about ¼% in 2015. By 
2017, this effect could cumulate to just 
under ¾% compared with a baseline scen-
ario without rising refugee migration.18 In 
addition, the high number of refugees will 
increase the demand for housing, and even 
after taking account of the crowding- out 
effect of the refugee infl  ux on other immi-
gration, it will probably stimulate higher in-
vestment in housing construction. That said, this projection assumes that, in the short term, housing needs will be met by 
providing emergency accommodation, later supplemented by using vacant properties. A 
noticeable demand effect on the private 
housing market will only emerge later and 
could be limited on balance.
Refugee migration could raise the German 
economy’s potential output by just under 
½% towards the end of the projection hori-
zon compared with the baseline scenario 
without such refugee migration. Deducting 
the small crowding- out effect on other migrants , the effect still amounts to just 
over ¼%. The primary effect generated by a signifi  cant growth contribution of the factor  
labour  due to the enlarged labour force is 
dampened by lower productivity growth 
and a slight rise in structural unemployment 
owing to the refugees’ lower skill level. Added to this are secondary effects that 
stem from more dynamic fi  xed capital for-
mation.
All in all, the main initial macroeconomic implication of refugee migration is the demand  effect that it will generate. How-ever, the boost to GDP stemming from (initially  not counter- fi  nanced) additional 
government spending will only be tempor-
ary and will reverse once the negative effect 
on public fi  nance is offset. The supply 
effects  and the long- term impact on public 
fi  nances will largely hinge on how quickly 
and effectively refugees are integrated into 
the labour market. In the short run, the 
effects  are likely to be comparatively mod-
est due to the presumed low initial partici-pation rate and high unemployment among 
these refugees, and their integration will 
remain  a major challenge for some time to come.

Deutsche Bundes bank, Public Finances, Monthly 
Report , November 2015, pp 58-70.
18 The demand effect is reduced to the extent that 
increasing supply constraints prevent additional 
demand  from taking full effect. This demand effect would also be smaller if refugees repatriate part of 
their cash benefi  ts. Conversely, it would increase if, in addition to received state benefi  ts, they use their own savings to purchase  consumer goods in Germany.Deutsche Bundesbank

In addition, industry bonus payments were 
slightly higher this year than last. Although the 
surge in wage costs caused by the introduction 
of the general minimum wage will drop out 
next year, the tighter labour market for skilled 
and highly skilled workers and a further im -
provement in the overall economic situation is 
likely to help wage drift remain positive. Over -
all, gross wages and salaries are therefore ex -
pected to record similar rates of growth per 
employee, at 2¾% and 3% respectively, in 
2016 and 2017 as this year. In terms of labour 
costs (measured as compensation per em -
ployee), the increase in the contribution rate 
for the public long- term care insurance scheme 
in 2017 will weigh on employers, which means 
that the increase in payroll costs will be some -
what stronger still using this definition. Assum -
ing that economic output per employed person 
rises by 1% a year, unit labour costs will in -
crease by around 2% a year over the projection 
horizon.
Domestically generated inflation as measured 
by the GDP deflator is likely to increase from 
1.8% in 2016 to 2.0% in 2017. Enterprises have 
been able to keep their profit margins stable 
this year, despite the minimum wage- related 
cost surge. Lower commodity prices and the 
euro’s depreciation are likely to have played a 
role in this. Even if these factors providing relief 
tail off next year in line with the assumption, 
margins in the projection period are likely to 
remain largely unchanged.
Consumer price inflation is likely to increase 
markedly over the projection horizon. While 
the dampening effect of the renewed decline 
in crude oil prices will peter out, domestic price 
pressures will become increasingly important. 
Overall, consumer price inflation (as measured 
by the annual HICP rate) could rise from 0.2% 
in the current year to 1.1% in 2016 and 2.0% in 
2017. This is likely to result in a continuing con -
siderable inflation spread compared with the 
other euro- area countries.The projected path of consumer prices is largely 
determined by the expected development of 
energy prices, which, in turn, depends heavily 
on the price movements of mineral oil prod -
ucts. The latter usually react promptly to 
changes in crude oil prices (in euro terms), and 
will therefore increase again during 2016 ac -
cording to the upward crude oil price assump -
tion. However, given that the retail prices of 
mineral oil products have fallen steeply in the 
second half of 2015, their annual average rate 
for 2016, and thus also the corresponding rate 
for energy, will be negative overall (around 
-3%), although less notably than in 2015 (just 
above -7%). The prices of mineral oil products 
are not likely to exceed the prior- year figure 
again until 2017; the same applies to energy 
prices overall (+2½%). In this context, it is as -
sumed that electricity prices for households will 
increase moderately in 2016 und 2017, and 
that natural gas prices for households, which 
have become largely decoupled from the de -
velopment of crude oil prices in recent years, 
will fall slightly in 2016 and increase marginally 
in 2017.
Other goods and services are likely to record a 
larger price increase in the projection period. 
Food prices will probably follow the slightly ris -
ing curve of energy and food commodity prices 
in the medium term. Industrial goods (exclud -Rising domestic

ing energy) are also likely to become more ex -
pensive, although the euro’s depreciation will 
continue to have some impact initially. Towards 
the end of the projection period, these price 
pressures should then be shaped by above-  
average aggregate capacity utilisation and ro -
bust wage growth. The latter will probably also 
push up the price of services.17 The rise in rents 
is likely to increasingly reflect the impact of the 
growth in rents for new lettings. Overall, price 
inflation, excluding energy, could climb from 
1.1% in the current year to 1.6% in 2016 and 
2.0% in 2017.
Public finances
Under this projection, the general conditions 
for German public finances will remain favour -
able overall, although additional expenditure 
will occur, particularly owing to refugee migra -
tion (see the box on pages 24 to 28).18 While 
the budget surplus is likely to increase in 2015 compared with 2014, this is attributable to 
temporary factors. Thus the fiscal outturn for 
2014 (0.3% of GDP) was temporarily depressed 
by court rulings,19 and the cyclical impact on 
government budgets is improving slightly.20 
However, in structural terms, the fiscal balance 
in 2015 is unlikely to change very much, and 
– as in 2014 – a moderate surplus of around 
½% of GDP is likely.
Next year, however, the surplus will contract, 
and the government budget could post a more 
or less balanced result. Although economic ac -
tivity is likely to continue to improve and inter -
est expenditure should fall somewhat further, 
the structural primary balance (ie excluding 
interest expenditure) will deteriorate markedly, 
as things currently stand. The revenue ratio will 
be pushed down slightly by cuts in taxes and 
social contributions. Concurrently, primary ex -
penditure should somewhat outpace the ex -
pansion of nominal GDP as a result of envis -
aged additional spending on infrastructure, 
education and research as well as social wel -
fare. In the underlying scenario, however, ex -
penditure in connection with refugee migra -
tion, in particular, is set to increase markedly. In 
2017, the budget could remain more or less 
balanced. On the one hand, further slight relief

Projection
17 The envisaged infrastructure levy will probably no 
longer be introduced during the course of the projection 
period. For this reason, the expected rise in the HICP which 
had been forecast in the June projection has per se been 
revised downwards by approximately 0.1 percentage point 
for 2017.
18 Besides these uncertainties and those described below, 
there are risks regarding the impact of measures an -
nounced by HSH Nordbank not included in the baseline 
scenario due to inadequate specification, and the associ -
ated potential implications for the deficits and debt of the 
federal states affected.
19 As a result of court rulings, tax refunds in the amount of 
0.3% of GDP are expected, which are reported as capital 
transfers in the national accounts in 2014 (at the time of 
the court ruling). Although revenue from the recent auc -
tions of mobile phone frequencies (0.2% of GDP) was pro -
visionally recorded in full in the national accounts in the 
second quarter of 2015, it will probably be spread over sev -
eral years in future outturns.
20 Cyclical adjustment is based on the Eurosystem’s disag -
gregated framework, which is geared to the trends in key 
macroeconomic budget reference variables. The cyclical 
impact on the balance thus calculated is neutral for 2015 
and will become increasingly positive up to 2017.Deutsche Bundesbank

est payments is anticipated. On the other hand, 
expenditure on refugee migration could in -
crease. Moreover, the reform of the public 
long- term care insurance scheme, among other 
things, will push up budget costs. In structural 
terms, the surplus from this year will decline in 
2016 and could turn into a small deficit in 2017.
Under these conditions, the debt ratio would 
diminish rapidly, but, at 65% in 2017, would 
still exceed the 60% ceiling (end-2014: 74.9%). 
Given the prospect of a broadly balanced 
govern ment budget as of 2016, the decline will 
be chiefly due to nominal GDP growth in the 
ratio’s  denominator. Furthermore, the liabilities 
of government- owned bad banks should be 
reduced  further.
Risk assessment
Substantial price shifts have been observed in 
the crude oil market recently. Over the projec -
tion period, too, price developments might 
fluctuate strongly, both upwards and down -
wards, from the underlying assumptions. This 
would have a major impact, as in the past, on 
the inflation rate and possibly also on eco -
nomic growth.
The risks to economic growth appear to be 
broadly balanced. This projection is based on 
the assumption that world trade will regain 
momentum, and that the economic recovery in 
the euro area will strengthen further. On the 
one hand, the development of world trade 
could remain below these expectations if the 
slowdown in some emerging market econ -
omies, in particular China and the commodity- 
exporting economies, proves to be persistent 
or even becomes more severe. There is also a 
certain risk that German exporters might not 
be able to broadly maintain their strong market 
share gains from the first half of 2015, contrary 
to the assumption. On the other hand, the pro -
jected development of world trade following 
the downward revision compared with the 
June projection is now considered rather cau -tious, meaning that a more favourable devel -
opment also appears conceivable. Moreover, 
economic activity could be impaired by pro -
tracted terrorist dangers and the related coun -
termeasures. Weaker export growth would im -
pact negatively on Germany’s export- oriented 
industry and, in particular, on business invest -
ment, although the pick- up assumed here 
could also occur earlier and be more pro -
nounced in the event of stronger exports. Add -
itional risks could potentially ensue from the 
Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal.
As already mentioned several times, the influx 
of refugees and the attendant economic impli -
cations are subject to major uncertainty. Devi -
ations from the scenario assumed here would 
chiefly affect government budgets, private con -
sumption, housing construction investment 
and the labour market.
The risks to price developments are more or 
less balanced. Upside risks could result from Debt ratio

crude oil prices would dampen consumer price

German enterprises’ profitability and 
financing  in 2014
In 2014, non- financial corporations markedly increased their profitability in a predominantly 
smooth macroeconomic environment, with export markets and the domestic economy both 
stimulating demand. Following a slump in 2013, the pre- tax return on sales returned to the level 
of the period from 2010 to 2012 (4¼%). The higher profits were attributable, for one thing, to the 
fact that enterprises considerably increased the quantity of goods sold and services rendered 
during  the reporting period. For another, the cost of materials fell, in particular due to a drop in 
crude oil prices in the second half of 2014. However, as in the previous years, personnel expenses 
increased perceptibly in the light of growing payrolls and higher compensation. Moreover, 
additional  costs emerged as a result of higher write- downs.
For the most part, there were no unusual movements in asset and liability positions on non-  
financial corporations’ balance sheets, which are prepared in accordance with German GAAP. 
Their long- term inclination to strengthen their capital base persisted; in 2014 it was not only small 
and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) – as had mainly been the case in previous years – but also 
large enterprises which contributed to this trend. By contrast, the balance sheets of listed enter -
prises, which are prepared according to international accounting standards, showed substantial 
shifts between equity and debt. The difference is essentially that, to determine pension provision 
values in the context of consolidated financial statements, market rates as of specific reporting 
dates are used for discounting expected payment obligations, whereas under German reporting 
standards a seven- year average rate is applied. The interest- related increase in pension provisions 
was a major reason why the equity ratio of listed enterprises declined considerably in 2014 and 
fluctuated significantly in 2015.
The expansion strategy of firms in the reporting period was particularly reflected in the extensive 
increase in long- term equity investments, following a lull in 2013. Firms also expanded their own 
production capacities. In this context, employment growth once again appeared to play a greater 
role than the increase in fixed assets. Entrepreneurial activities in 2014 were largely financed using 
internal funds; the strong expansion in the cash flow was the main source of this funding. 
Borrowed  funds were increasingly used in sectors such as vehicle manufacturing where firms 
invested in fixed assets and acquired other long- term equity in large quantities.Deutsche Bundesbank

Underlying trends
In 2014, the German economy by and large de -
veloped without any disruptions, following two 
years of distinctly dampening influences that 
were predominantly attributable to recession -
ary tendencies in some parts of the euro area. 
At 1.6%, real gross domestic product (GDP) in -
creased by a greater margin than potential out -
put. The economy was bolstered by both for -
eign and domestic demand. Aggregate pro -
duction capacity utilisation fluctuated within 
the normal range throughout the entire year. 
Given that the price of crude oil fell drastically 
in the second half of 2014, that other com -
modities, too, witnessed deflation and that 
wages increased perceptibly but not exces -
sively, non- financial corporations inhabited a 
relatively favourable macroeconomic environ -
ment on the whole. The fact that firms used 
this to their advantage is reflected in their profit 
and loss accounts – however, not so much by a 
considerable increase in turnover, but in the 
form of profitability in 2014 returning to its 
level of the period from 2010 to 2012, follow -
ing a decline in 2013.1 The aggregated balance 
sheet of the non- financial corporations sector 
shows that broad- based yet moderate eco -
nomic growth during the reporting year is re -
flected in the absence of sharp movements in 
asset and liability positions for the most part. 
At the same time, long- term trends such as the 
strengthening of the equity capital base and 
the increase in balance sheet links between en -
terprises persisted.
The medium- term expansionary strategy of 
firms, which was focused on external and in -
ternal growth in equal measure, continued in 
2014. First, the increase in other long- term 
equity investments was again more substantial 
than the increase in total assets, after a lull in 
2013 following similarly dynamic developments 
during the period of economic recovery be -
tween 2010 and 2012. Second, non-  financial 
corporations accumulated fixed capital, albeit 
to a lesser extent than other long- term equity 
holdings. As in the three preceding years, the increase in tangible fixed assets in 2014 was 
nonetheless high enough to maintain the ratio 
of tangible fixed assets to total assets. The fact 
that businesses expanded their production cap -
acity at domestic locations, too, is reflected pri -
marily in the robust increase in employment, 
which has been observed for some years now.2
The protracted low- interest- rate environment 
had varied effects on non- financial corpor -
ations’ profit and loss accounts. These effects 
differ in terms of their thrust and the timing of 
their impact on results. Although low interest 
rates do ease borrowing costs, they also curb 
income from interest- bearing claims. Moreover, 
the expenses resulting from interest- induced 
adjustments to provisions for long- term pay -
ment obligations from pension commitments, 
in particular, become effective with a lag. This 
is because – due to the smoothing procedure 
prescribed by German GAAP – the low- interest- 
rate environment only gradually impacts on the 
discount rate, which is relevant for determining 
the present value of expected payment flows. 
Given that all these effects are recorded under 
interest expenditure or income in line with 
accounting  rules, net interest expenditure pro -
vides a relatively comprehensive insight into the 
impact on non-  financial corporations’ profit 
and loss accounts. In 2012, non-  financial cor -
porations’ net interest expenditure contracted 
by a total of €3½ billion, the decisive factor 
being that interest expenditure decreased by 
5½%. Interest income, on the other hand, 
remained  quite steady in 2012. In 2013, net 
interest expenditure exceeded the level of 2011. 
This was attributable to two factors. First, inter -
est income was down by one- fifth and, second, 
no additional reductions occurred in interest Relatively 
favourable macroeconomic setting in 2014

corporations continued to pursue broad- based expan-sionary strategyLow- interest- rate environment with varied effects on profit and loss accounts

financial corporations increased by ¾% in 2014. On aver -

expenditure. The cost arising from the appreci -
ation of provisions is likely to have made a dis -
cernible impact by now. In the reporting period, 
net interest expenditure recorded a €1 billion 
hike. This was due, in roughly equal parts, to 
expenditure and income factors.
With regard to single- entity financial state -
ments prepared pursuant to German GAAP , the 
majority of effects, which stem from the ad -
justment of pension provisions, are still pend -
ing.3 Similarly, over the past two years, provi -
sions for pensions and similar obligations had 
already increased by €14 billion in the non-  
financial corporations sector’s aggregated bal -
ance sheet. Since the Act to Modernise Ac -
counting Law (Bilanzrechtsmodernisierungsge -
setz) entered into force, pension provisions are 
reported as a net figure, ie adjusted for the 
value of the financial assets which are used 
specifically to meet these requirements and, 
therefore, off- limits to all other creditors. These 
“outsourced” pension assets (also known as 
plan assets) went up by an estimated €11 bil -
lion in the same period, which was partly 
attributable  to valuation gains on shares and 
fixed- income securities. The balance sheets of 
German listed non- financial corporations pre -
pared according to international accounting 
rules already reflect the lower interest rate level 
in its entirety because these businesses value 
their pension provisions at reporting-  date-  
specific market interest rates. (For details on 
German non- financial group’s profitability, 
assets and capital structure in 2014, see the 
box on pages 36 to 38.)
On average across the non- financial corpor -
ations sector, pre- tax returns on sales returned 
to the level seen between 2010 and 2012. 
Hence, the decrease in profitability in 2013 was 
due, in particular, to the combination of tem -
porarily lower sales growth and the lack of cor -
responding relief in terms of personnel expend -
iture because enterprises clung to their employ -
ment plans, most of which were geared to -
wards expansion. This proved to be the correct 
strategy given that the economy was regaining momentum in some parts of the euro area 
after having overcome the burdens associated 
with the sovereign debt crisis. However, the 
substantial profit growth in the reporting year 
was not exclusively attributable to an increase 
in goods sold and services rendered, but also to 
considerable price reductions in internationally 
traded commodities in the second half of the 
year as only a fraction of the material- induced 
cost savings was passed on to customers in the 
form of lower selling prices. However, the asso -
ciated increase in earnings will only be tempor -
ary if the pass- through of prices continues. Es -
pecially given that the purchase prices of key 
commodities are unlikely to remain at the cur -
rent levels in the long term, the entire non-  
financial corporations sector and, in particular, 
the manufacturing sector will have to generate 
more dynamic sales growth compared with 
2013 and 2014 in order to maintain profitability 
in light of the planned recruitment of new per -
sonnel and past investment in fixed capital and 
other long- term equity holdings.
For the fifth consecutive year, the number of 
business insolvencies declined in 2014, reach -
ing the lowest value of the last two decades. 
This is consistent with the sound profitability 
and equity base that can be found across the 
entire non- financial corporations sector. In add -
ition, a lower number of primary insolvencies 
will further reduce the likelihood of subsequent 
insolvencies occurring on the basis of liquidity 
shortfalls caused by insolvent customers. The 
insolvency ratio decreased in all major eco -
nomic sectors, while the decline in the number 
of insolvent businesses in the manufacturing 
sector was particularly pronounced as it was

Profi  tability, assets and capital structure of German 
non- fi  nancial groups in 2014
The fi  nancial performance of groups in-
cluded in the consolidated fi  nancial state-ment statistics
1 improved signifi  cantly in 
2014. For example, annual profi  t before tax 
on income was up by 11%, which more 
than compensated for the decline recorded in the previous year. It also rose at a similar 
rate to the results of domestic enterprises 
included in the single- entity fi  nancial state-ment statistics (+8½%).The groups’ operating profi  t (EBIT), which 
serves as a measure of their operating activ-
ity,2 climbed at a slightly slower pace of 
7½% following growth of 6% in 2013. The increase in EBIT was accompanied by only a 
marginal rise in sales (+1%). According to information contained in the consolidated 
management reports, this was refl  ected in 
weaker growth in emerging market econ-omies, whereas demand for services ren-
dered by the groups was largely constant to 
escalating in industrial countries. Further-
more, euro- denominated sales revenue fi  g-
ures understate the scale of sales growth on local markets owing to negative ex-change rate effects when translating sales revenue generated by non- euro- area sub-sidiaries. Besides the higher sales volume, effi   ciency- enhancing measures and cost 
relief  were also cited in the fi  nancial reports 
as appearing to have contributed to the 
favourable  result. Another factor to play a 
part in the positive picture painted here was 
the 5% increase in operating profi  t before 
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), which was not affected by extraordinary 
write- downs and is on a more stable course in this respect.
On balance, the groups’ operating return 
on sales (EBIT as a percentage of sales) rose 
by a weighted average of ½ percentage 
point to 7% and was therefore markedly up 
on the average level of profi  tability since 
2005 (around 6½%). An improvement was

recorded by enterprises in the median and 
upper percentiles of the distribution of 
returns , in particular, whereas the profi  t-ability of enterprises with weaker returns stagnated . A sector- by- sector comparison 
revealed that groups in the services sector 
continued to generate a higher operating return on sales (7½%) than groups in the 
production sector (6¾%).
Increasing at a rate of 9%, the groups’ total 
assets rose more than twice as sharply over the course of 2014 than was the case over 
the average of the preceding years. One item that notably increased on the asset side was non- current assets. This was pri-
marily attributable to the acquisition of sub-sidiaries. Correspondingly, a steady increase 
in investments was also observed in the single- entity fi  nancial statement statistics. 
This is likely to refl  ect external growth strat-
egies and enterprises’ efforts to achieve greater vertical and horizontal integration 
and to diversify for reasons of competition 
and profi  tability. In the consolidated fi  nan-
cial statements, these activities are accom-
panied by a rise in intangible fi  xed assets in the form of goodwill. What is more, when acquisitions take place, the hidden reserves of subsidiaries  are frequently disclosed dur-ing purchase  price allocation by recognising 
intangible fi  xed assets that were previously 
not included in the balance sheet (eg patents  and licences). In connection with 
this, the long- observed trend of a shift from 
tangible  fi  xed assets to intangible fi  xed 
assets showed no sign of abating. Standing 
at more than one- third, their balance sheet 
share is particularly pronounced – especially 
for groups in the services sector.
While the groups’ supply of liquidity fell slightly in 2014, it remained close to the 
average recorded in recent years and stands at a level similar to that of domestic enter-Intangible and tangible fixed assets of

namic growth of German exports. In construc -
tion, too, however, the number of business in -
solvencies diminished in the area of transport 
and storage and in the business services sector.
Sales and income
Sales among non- financial corporations grew 
by just over 1% in 2014, which was up on the 
year (2013: +¼%). Moreover, the nominal de -
velopment understates the increase in goods 
sold and services rendered given that price re -
ductions occurred, above all, in the reporting 
year but also in the preceding year. As a conse -
quence, producer prices for industrial products 
fell by 1.0% in domestic and 0.3% in foreign 
markets.4 The major segments of the non-  
financial corporations sector are similar in the 
sense that they recorded better sales develop -
ments in 2014 than in 2013, the only exception 
being electricity, gas and water supply, which 
recorded a strong decline in the reporting year. In arithmetical terms, the above- average sales 
growth in industry in the reporting period 
(+2½%) was largely attributable to the consid -
erable expansion in the business activities of 
the vehicle manufacturing sector, where sales 
increased by almost one- twelfth in nominal 
terms. Unlike the previous two years, in 2014, 
the construction industry concluded the year 
with a substantial increase in turnover. In the 
trade sector, the development in turnover in 
the motor vehicle and retail segments was rela -
tively favourable, whereas, in 2014, the whole -
sale segment again failed to exceed the level it 
achieved in 2012 after a strong upswing. Fol -
lowing relatively modest growth in 2013, turn -
over in both the transport and storage and in -
formation and communication segments of the 
services sector increased distinctly in 2014. 
Sales growth among business services pro -Sales growth in 
2014 somewhat stronger than in 2013prises included in the single- entity fi  nancial 
statement statistics.
On the liability side, balance sheet growth 
was driven primarily by growing provisions 
for pension commitments and an increase 
in long- term fi  nancial debt. The rise in pen-
sion provisions is largely the result of the signifi  cant decline in the discount rate in the current low- interest- rate environment, 
as international accounting standards stipu-
late that the interest rate in place on the 
respective reporting date be used as the 
basis for determining the present value of 
pension liabilities.3 The 74 largest groups 
therefore had to increase their pension pro-visions by around €46 billion in 2014. While the rise in pension liabilities does not affect 
operating profi  t, it is refl  ected in down-stream comprehensive income and there-
fore in reported capital as well. This was a 
key factor in the equity ratio’s fall by two percentage points to 27¾% on the report-
ing date.4 This effect had the greatest im-
pact on major groups in the production sec-tor. The share of fi  nancial debt attributable 
to all groups also rose by ¾ percentage 
point to 20½%. In aggregated terms, how-ever, debt is at a stable and sustainable level from a long- term perspective.
3 By contrast, according to the German GAAP gener-
ally applicable to single- entity fi  nancial statements, the discount rate should be derived from the average mar-ket interest rate over the past seven years.
4 In addition, currency translation differences and 
valuation losses arising from hedging (eg for commod-ity and currency risks) were marginally offset by profi  t for the fi  nancial year and capital increases.

-0.6% respectively.Deutsche Bundesbank

viders, which was relatively high to begin with, 
further intensified.
The interest income of non- financial corpor -
ations in the reporting period fell only slightly 
short of the heavily subdued level of 2013. In -
come from other long- term equity investments 
fell by just under one-  tenth, following robust 
growth in the two preceding years. The reason 
why overall income was nevertheless able to 
keep pace with sales was the marked increase 
in other operating income, which comprises 
proceeds from activities that businesses do not 
classify as their core operating areas. These 
often include income from rent and licensing as 
well as from staff secondments and the sale of 
tangible fixed assets.
The more favourable purchase prices for com -
modities, in particular, translated into consider -
able cost relief for non- financial corporations. 
On average, non- financial corporations were 
able in 2014 to introduce prices that were 
lower by one- tenth compared with 2013. 
Whereas the decline in import prices of com -
modities intensified, it flattened in the case of 
semi- finished products and finished intermedi -
ates. In addition, the provision of goods and 
services increased by a greater margin in 2014 
than it did in 2013. As a result, the cost of ma -
terials in the reporting period on the whole did 
not fall much more sharply than in 2013.
Given the clear improvement in the gross in -
come basis5, businesses were able to withstand 
the renewed marked increase in staff costs. At 
3½%, although this cost item grew somewhat 
more strongly than in 2013 (+3%), it neverthe -
less fell perceptibly short of the average annual 
rate in the period from 2010 to 2012 (+4½%). 
The relatively stable upward trend observed 
over the last few years is the outcome of a not -
able expansion in the number of core staff and 
considerable wage and salary increases. Nego -

corporations sector considered here, were 
raised by 3% in the reporting period, a steeper 
increase than in 2013 (+2½%). The cost burden 
from write-  downs was significantly greater in 
2014 than in 2013, which was mainly due to 
the fact that deductions for the decreasing 
value of tangible fixed assets rose substantially 
this time round. This could not be offset by the 
lower extent of downward value adjustments 
for current and financial assets. As in 2013, 
write- downs on financial assets in the reporting 
period were down by more than one- quarter 
compared with 2011 and 2012, which were 
characterised by a relatively high amount of 
value adjustments.Overall in 2014, income grew faster than ex -
penditure. On average across the non- financial 
corporations sector, the annual result before 
taxes on income was 8½% up on the figure of 
2013, thus more than offsetting the previous 
year’s 4½% decline. The pre- tax return on sales 
came to 4¼% in total. Hence, corporate profit -
ability in 2014 returned to a level last seen in 
the initial years following the Great Recession. 
According to the results, the drop in 2013 to 
4% was of a temporary nature.

entire shortfall in 2014. Barring 2013, this sec -
tor has generated a relatively steady flow of 
profits over the past five years, the 2014 pre-  
tax return on sales coming in at 4½%, which is 
somewhat higher than the figure for the cor -
porate sector overall. As for the components of 
the broader manufacturing sector, sales by 
vehicle  manufacturers once again generated a 
clearly below- average return during the report -
ing period, even if it did outpace the exception -
ally meagre showing in 2013. Profitability in the 
mechanical engineering sector stalled at the 
previous year’s level which, while good by in -
dustry standards, was nonetheless rather medi -
ocre in historical terms. The electrical engineer -
ing industry, meanwhile, saw its return on sales 
advance so strongly that the chemical and 
pharmaceutical industries were the only major 
industry sectors to generate higher rates of 
profitability.
The construction sector was extremely profit -
able in 2014. Over a period of more than ten 
years, the construction industry first embraced 
consolidation, then harnessed the upbeat de -
mand to push up its return on sales from a low 
of 3% to 7% in the reporting period. Notable 
success has been enjoyed in recent years by the 
multitude of mostly small construction firms, 
many of which operate as unincorporated en -
tities. Quite a large number of these firms are 
probably to be found in the especially expan -
sionary field of housing construction.
Business service providers defended their pos -
ition as the most profitable services sector with 
a return on sales of just over 9% in 2014, a 
figure surpassed only in the 2006-08 boom 
period. When considering this sector’s gener -
ally high profitability levels, it should be borne 
in mind that it contains more unincorporated 
entities, proportionately speaking, for which 
management wages are a component of profit, 
while at corporations, management compensa -
tion forms part of personnel expenses. Profit -
ability was likewise well above average in the 
information and communication sector, while 
wholesale and retail trade and the transport and storage sector fell short of the average rate 
for the non- financial corporations sector as a 
whole. The transport and logistics sector saw 
its pre- tax annual result contract by more than 
two- fifths in 2014. While sales growth was re -
spectable, profits slumped under the combined 
impact of higher costs for intermediate goods 
and personnel expenses, and a sharp upturn in 
depreciation and write- downs. Net of taxes, 
transport and logistics firms, taken as a mean, 
only just avoided turning in a loss.
Sources and uses of funds
Sources of funds of non- financial corporations 
eased slightly in 2014, just as they had done in 
the three years prior to that. Strong cash flows 
meant that internal funding sufficed to cover 
almost all the corporations’ financing needs. 
Secondary financing was generated by two 
components. One was the steady stream of 
cash produced by depreciation and write-  
downs, and by the creation of provisions; the 
other was the continued inclination of busi -
nesses to retain a higher share of profits. Irre -
spective of the exceptionally favourable finan -
cing conditions, injections of equity repre -
sented the sole form of external funding used 
during the reporting period. In net terms, non- 
financial corporations did not incur any fresh 
liabilities, largely on account of one- off effects. 
Although developments were flat overall, the 
maturity spectrum of financial obligations has 
been radically transformed, with long- term 
liabilities  –  primarily those to affiliated com -
panies – being redeemed (with the exception 
of bond issuance) and businesses mainly using 
bank loans to cover their short- term cash 
requirements . The need to raise funding through 
injections of equity was no more than modest 
by historical standards in 2014.
On average, corporations used two- thirds of 
their available resources for investments in tan -
gible fixed assets. The net increase in tangible 
fixed assets outstripped depreciation by 14% 
on balance in the reporting period, which is Return on sales

broadly consistent with the long- term mean. 
Upbeat activity in the construction sector 
meant that the increase in tangible fixed assets 
was slightly above average. In transport and 
storage, the (gross) increase in tangible fixed 
assets was a quarter up on depreciation, sug -
gesting that fierce competitive pressure, com -
bined with dwindling profitability, is the main 
force driving investment. As for the manufac -
turing sector, vehicle manufacturing once again 
came to the fore, with tangible fixed assets 
being increased by a third more than the cor -
responding volume of depreciation. Fixed in -
vestment in the chemical and pharmaceutical 
industry was nearly a quarter higher than de -preciation, suggesting that the investment re -
straint observed in this sector in recent years 
might be overcome. Corporations from the 
electrical engineering industry, on the other 
hand, barely accumulated any tangible fixed 
assets in 2014, once depreciation and write-  
downs had been accounted for.
In 2014, two sectors accounted for the bulk of 
the increase in other long- term equity invest -
ments, and thus for the expansion of capital 
and production ties as well. First, vehicle manu -

ments as in maintaining and extending their 
internal production capacities. These firms had 
to tap external sources for part of the neces -
sary funding, just as they had in the previous 
years, and they made use of both long- term 
liabilities  and shareholder equity injections. 
Second, businesses in the information and 
communication sector drove up their stock of 
other long-  term equity investments in the re -
porting period, though their internal funding 
resources adequately covered this outlay. The 
inclination to build up other long- term equity 
holdings was less pronounced in the chemical 
and pharmaceutical and electrical engineering 
sectors, on the other hand, and the same could 
be said for electricity, gas and water suppliers, 
which are likewise sectors with substantial 
holdings of other long- term equity invest -
ments.
Balance sheet developments
Total assets of the non-  financial corporations 
sector expanded by a moderate 2½% in 2014. 
Other long- term equity investments were once 
again the most dynamic fixed asset item during 
the year. The fixed assets to total assets ratio 
remained steady in the non- financial corpor -
ations sector as a whole. While the tangible 
fixed asset ratio at corporations surged on the 
back of the very good annual result, it was 
down again for unincorporated entities. One 
area in which the current spell of low interest 
rates came to the fore in the reporting period 
was the maturity spectrum of receivables at 
non- financial corporations, which appeared 
keen to scale back the share of non- interest-  
bearing assets and shift their investments more 
into higher yielding, longer-  term receivables 
and securities.
More or less all the sectors under consider -
ation, headed by vehicle manufacturing, set 
aside additional provisions to cover payment 
obligations expected at a future date. These in -
clude payments of post- employment benefits 
under direct commitments to current and for -mer employees as well as provisions to allow 
for the long- term effects and uncertainties of 
business decisions. In total, provisions account 
for roughly 16% of total assets. This ratio’s long 
and drawn- out decline6 has recently switched 
to a gradual ascent over the past three years. A 
major driver behind this development, now as 
then, is the need to adjust the present values of 
future payment obligations upwards to match 
the low- interest- rate environment. German 
GAAP prescribe a discount rate which stands 
for the average market interest rate observed 
over the last seven years for the measurement 
of long- term provisions. This would suggest 
that businesses have not finished adjusting to 
current interest rate levels, and it points to the 
prospect of further provisioning in the coming 
years which, in and of itself, will place a strain 
on annual results. Provisions for pensions make 
up 5½% of total assets, and pension obliga -
tions are much higher at corporations, structur -
ally speaking, than they are at unincorporated 
entities. Many enterprises looking to scale back 
the pension provisions carried in their balance 
sheets have tried to reallocate assets internally 
to occupational pension schemes.
Long- term equity and liabilities broadly 
matched last year’s figures, the increase in 
equity being cancelled out, for the most part, 
by a reduction in long- term liabilities. The re -
porting period mainly saw the redemption of 
long- term liabilities to banks and to affiliated 
companies, while the issuance of corporate 
bonds was as vibrant as ever, their value in 
corporations ’ balance sheets almost doubling 
over the past five years. The ratio of short- term 
liabilities   to total assets was largely static, 
though bank loans in particular saw a shift 
from long to short maturities.
Own funds as a share of non- financial corpor -
ations’ total assets stood at a mean 29½% at 
the end of the 2014 financial year, marking a 
continuation of corporations’ long- term inclin -Moderate

ation to strengthen their equity capital base. 
Around half of the rather sizeable increase of 
one percentage point observed during the re -
porting period was explained by one- off fac -
tors at individual corporations. Almost all the 
economic sectors under consideration har -
nessed the upbeat business environment to 
build up further financial reserves, meaning 
that the increase in the equity capital ratio ob -
served in 2014 was founded on a broad sec -
toral footing. Broken down by firm size, the 
figures reveal that SMEs nudged their capital 
ratio higher still to 25½%, which is more than 
double the very low figure reported for 2000.7 
Large enterprises, meanwhile, made another distinct addition to their equity capital ratio to 
31½% in 2014, following a number of years in 
which this ratio moved steadily along the 30% 
line.

ures from the consolidated financial statement 
statistics up to the third quarter of 2015 sug -
gest that sales by listed non- financial groups 
were 7½% up on the year, compared with the 
1% annual rate of change reported in 2014. 
While exchange rate effects – the translation of 
sales revenues generated by subsidiaries lo -
cated outside the euro area at the distinctly 
lower euro exchange rate – go some way to -
wards explaining this increase, it should be 
noted that many groups are also reporting 
stronger sales figures. The second factor under -
pinning the trend forecast for the non- financial 
corporations sector as a whole is that this sec -
tor is more reliant on the relatively expansion -
ary overall domestic demand observed in 2015 
than the major groups which often operate in 
international markets. Material costs look set to 
ease on the back of a further drop in commod -
ity prices. The increase in negotiated pay rates 
was flatter than in 2014, but the general statu -
tory minimum wage introduced at the begin -
ning of the year is likely to have left its mark on 
personnel costs, notably in the services sectors. 
One- off effects explain why the largely upbeat 
sales and cost trends did not send groups’ 
return  on sales sharply higher in the first three 
quarters of 2015. The Volkswagen Group, for 
instance, was forced to set aside substantial 
provisions and recognise impairments during 
the course of this year after irregularities in the 
emissions test data for its diesel vehicles came 
to light, while, in a separate development, a 
group in the energy sector posted huge write- 
downs. It can be assumed that these two 
rather  weighty effects will also have a knock-  
on effect on the profitability of the non-  
financial corporate sector as a whole.
In the current setting, the consolidated finan -
cial statement statistics are of limited use for 
predicting key balance sheet ratios at individual 
corporations, especially so for their equity and 
liabilities. The main reason why the equity cap -
ital ratio in 2014 fell sharply for groups but 
climbed in the aggregate balance sheet of non- 
financial corporations was the mismatch be -
tween the financial reporting standards men -tioned earlier in this article for the recognition 
of pension liabilities. With market interest rates 
receding further in the first quarter of 2015, the 
74 large groups upped the measurement of 
their stock of pension provisions as at 31 March 
2015 by a further €21 billion compared with a 
figure of €171 billion one quarter earlier. The 
marked upward movement in interest rates ob -
served subsequently prompted these groups to 
adjust this figure down to €143 billion at mid- 
year 2015. While the pronounced volatility of 
this item has no bearing on the groups’ profit 
or loss, such expenses and income are recog -
nised outside profit or loss in comprehensive 
income, where they impact on equity. Single-  2015 business 
performance likely to be better  than in 
2014; one- off effects impeding profitability

entity financial statements prepared pursuant 
to German GAAP are immune to such abrupt 
swings in key balance sheet ratios, but this is 
another area where the persistent low- interest- 
rate environment will probably force businesses 
to set aside additional provisions.
Corporate groups’ tangible fixed asset ratio at 
the end of the third quarter of 2015 was largely 
the same as the 2014 year- end figure. This ratio 
had receded quite sharply in the course of 2014 
compared with a slight increase in tangible 
fixed assets as a share of the aggregate balance 
sheet of non- financial corporations at that 
time. If one assumes that the different financial 
reporting standards for groups and single en -
tities exert less of an influence on reported 
assets in the current setting, the data from the 
consolidated financial statement statistics may 
very well support the notion that fixed capital 
formation in the non- financial corporations 
sector has more or less continued to strengthen 
during the current year.Commercial

Deposit protection in Germany
The Deposit Guarantee Act (Einlagensicherungsgesetz) entered into force on 3 July 2015, trans -
posing into German law the harmonised requirements of the amended European Deposit Guar -
antee Scheme Directive. The new Deposit Guarantee Act supersedes the Deposit Guarantee and 
Investor Compensation Act (Einlagensicherungs- und Anlegerentschädigungsgesetz), which 
entered into force in 1998 and at the time implemented both the EU Deposit Guarantee Scheme 
Directive and the EU Investor Compensation Scheme Directive. The report begins by summarising 
the current legal situation and then goes on to explain the new harmonised provisions and how 
they are being implemented in Germany. The statutory depositor compensation scheme set up in 
1998 for private and public- sector banks will remain in place, while important changes will be 
made to the institutional protection schemes of the German banking industry. Overall, the protec -
tion level for depositors will improve further. On this basis, the German deposit protection system 
will remain anchored at the national level. The report will conclude by presenting and assessing 
the current plans for a common European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS).Deutsche Bundesbank

Experience of statutory 
depositor  compensation in 
Germany since 1998
The implementation of the EU Deposit Guaran -
tee Scheme Directive (94/ 19/EC of 30  May 
1994) in Germany created harmonised struc -
tures for a statutory depositor compensation 
scheme, which then entered into force on 
1 August 1998 as the Deposit Guarantee and 
Investor Compensation Act (Einlagensiche -
rungs- und Anlegerentschädigungsgesetz),  or 
DGICA.1 This act established two statutory 
compensation schemes, one for private- sector 
banks and the other for public- sector banks, 
located  at the level of the respective banking 
associations ; these compensation schemes and 
their tasks and powers have remained un -
changed since then. The structures created at 
the time have also been perpetuated by the 
transposition into German law of the recast 
Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive (2014/ 49/
EU) of 16 April 2014 through the Deposit Guar -
antee Act (Einlagensicherungsgesetz) , which 
entered into force on 3 July 2015.
Since the entry into force of the DGICA, all 
banks providing deposit- taking services have 
been required to belong to a statutory depos -
itor compensation scheme. The statutory com -
pensation schemes of the Association of Ger -
man Banks (EdB) and of German public banks 
(EdÖ) act here in a private- law capacity under a 
statutory mandate as “entrusted compensation 
schemes”.2 By contrast, the institutional protec -
tion schemes of the German Savings Banks and 
Giro Association (DSGV) and the Federal Asso -
ciation of German People’s Banks and Raiff-
eisen Banks (BVR), pursuant to Article 113 (7) of 
the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), are 
associations of multiple banks which have 
entered into a liability arrangement. Their main 
function is institutional protection, ie averting 
the bankruptcy of a member institution. They 
have been regarded thus far as “alternative” 
systems within the meaning of the 1994 EU 
Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive, which 
meant that their members were exempted from the provisions of the DGICA and thus did 
not have to belong to any statutory depositor 
compensation scheme. The term “alternative” 
refers to systems which protect depositors in -
directly through an existing institutional protec -
tion scheme.
The statutory deposit protection scheme is sup -
plemented by the voluntary deposit insurance 
arrangements within the separate deposit 
guarantee schemes established by each bank -
ing group association. Since the DGICA was 
originally introduced with a statutory guaran -
tee of up to 90% of liabilities up to a maximum 
amount of €20,000 per depositor and institu -
tion, the voluntary deposit protection systems 
at private and public banks have been provid -
ing additional deposit protection regarding the 
limit, volume of insured deposits and definition 
of protected depositors. For competitive rea -
sons, a large percentage of credit institutions 
also belong to a voluntary guarantee scheme. 
The type and scope of the protection for indi -
vidual investors are determined by the private- 
law statutes of the respective guarantee 
scheme. The private deposit protection fund of 
the Federal Association of German Banks cur -
rently voluntarily insures the deposits of each 
individual customer up to 20% of that respect -
ive bank’s regulatory own funds. As of 1 Janu -
ary 2012, the Federal Association of German 
Banks decided to gradually reduce the limit for 
its voluntary deposit insurance to 8.75% of its 
liable capital by 2025.
All statutory and voluntary deposit guarantee 
schemes in Germany are funded by members’ 
regular annual ex ante  contributions. Systems Statutory depos-
itor compensa-tion scheme in Germany created  in 1998

protection; it will not cover any aspects of investor protec -

2 The tasks and powers of a statutory compensation 
scheme may be transferred to legal entities under private 
law if they meet the requirements for fulfilling the statutory 
task. Non- public- law shareholders of a depositor compen -
sation scheme are given the function of “entrusted com -
pensation schemes” upon whom a public task is conferred. 
This means that compensation schemes organised under 
private law can issue administrative acts.Deutsche Bundesbank

funded systems in that funds which have 
already  been paid in can be used immediately 
in a compensation or insurance case; compen -
sation is thus independent of the paying insti -
tutions’ current profitability and liquidity. The 
size of contributions, method of calculating 
them, any relevant one- off contributions and, 
as appropriate, the minimum volume of the in -
surance fund are governed by the DGICA or 
the corresponding legal regulations as well as 
the associations’ own private- law articles of 
association  or statutes.In order to enhance depositors’ confidence in 
the security of their deposits, which suffered a 
heavy blow during the financial crisis, the EU 
Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive raised the 
protection limit in two stages, first to €50,000 
and then, as of 1 January 2011, to €100,000. In 
order to be able to cope with these higher har -
monised compensation claims, the deposit 
guarantee schemes needed a higher volume of 
DGICA funding. In the implementing contribu -
tion regulations adopted in 2009, the annual 
contribution was raised from 0.008% to 
0.016% of the assessment base (liabilities vis- à- Adjusting fund

vis customers).3 The moderate pattern in the 
number of compensation cases means that no 
significant financial sustainability risks have 
arisen for institutions required to make pay -
ments.
The Contribution Regulations of the Deposit 
Guarantee Scheme of German Banks were 
amended again on 12 December 2011 to intro -
duce criteria for the risk- based calculation of 
contributions. The aim of calculating contribu -
tions in a risk- based manner was to distinguish 
institutions’ contributions by default risk in 
order to fund the compensation scheme more 
in accordance with the “polluter pays” prin -
ciple. The procedures being considered are 
based largely on the method of calculating 
contributions that has been practiced for many 
years already by the voluntary deposit protec -
tion fund of the Federal Association of German 
Banks.
Since the introduction of statutory depositor 
compensation in Germany, there have been a 
number of individual compensation cases. In 
these cases, depositors’ claims pursuant to the 
DGICA were successfully satisfied out of the 
funds provided by the statutory compensation 
scheme. The compensation cases also included 
those in which only the statutory compensa -
tion claim applied since the institutions involved 
were not members of a voluntary deposit guar -
antee scheme established at the level of the 
respective  banking association.Further developing the EU 
Deposit Guarantee Scheme 
Directive of 1994 at the 
European level
Experience of and 
amendments  to the EU 
Deposit  Guarantee Scheme 
Directive since 1998
Directive 94/  19/EC was based on the principle 
of minimum harmonisation. Member states 
were given the right, in clearly defined cases, to 
insure depositors above and beyond the har -
monised amounts; however, cover provided 
under national rules was not permitted to be 
less than that under the binding harmonised 
rules. This initial harmonisation step within the 
European Union was not able to fully erase the 
differences between individual member states’ 
deposit guarantee schemes, such as with 
regard  to the definition of protected deposit -
ors. In addition, within the context of subsidiar -
ity, the systems were governed entirely by the 
member states. In order to comply with calls 
for harmonised conditions in the financial mar -
kets within the EU and to contribute towards 
the completion of the internal market, at EU 
level – also in the aftermath of the financial 
crisis  in 2008 – the aim of greater harmonisa -
tion of deposit protection was pursued. It was 
not least the financial crisis which showed just 
how important depositor confidence is for the 
ability of the banking market to function prop -
erly. Directive 2009/ 14/EC of the European Par -
liament and of the Council of 11 March 2009 
amending Directive 94/  19/EC on deposit pro -
tection schemes advanced the cause of har -
monisation by increasing the protection limit in 
stages to €100,000 and reducing the payout 
delay from three months to 20 working days. 
Moreover, the amending directive dropped the 
10% deductible introduced by the first Deposit Steps towards a

Guarantee Scheme Directive, which was in -
tended to encourage depositors’ risk aware -
ness; experience showed that the deductible 
had no material impact on depositors’ behav -
iour.
Consultation on a more fundamental reform of 
harmonised deposit protection standards at the 
European level began in 2010. They culminated 
in the adoption of the new EU Deposit Guaran -
tee Scheme Directive (2014/ 49/EU) on 16 April 
2014. The starting point was a European Com -
mission proposal which was published on 
12 July 2010. The aim was to achieve a more 
comprehensive harmonisation of national de -
posit guarantee schemes by largely doing away 
with the principle of minimum harmonisation 
and going toward maximum harmonisation 
and EU- wide harmonisation of the funding of 
protection schemes, which under existing legis -
lation had been regulated at the national level 
under the principle of subsidiarity.
Changes brought about by the 
new EU Deposit Guarantee 
Scheme Directive of 2014
The “new” EU Deposit Guarantee Scheme Dir -
ective (2014/ 49/EU) follows the principle of 
maximum harmonisation. This means that 
statutory protection above and beyond the 
harmonised level is no longer possible. The 
changes were so material that major sections 
of the directive had to be rewritten. However, 
member states, as before, have retained na -
tional responsibility for implementing deposit 
protection in their jurisdictions.
The new harmonised rules impose specific re -
quirements for the available financial means of 
protection schemes. The financial means of 
protection schemes should generally amount 
to 0.8% of “covered deposits”. These deposits, 
which are now a material determinant for 
quantifying the funding volume of national 
deposit  guarantee schemes, are defined as 
deposits  which do not exceed the repayable cover limit of €100,000 per depositor and 
bank. Under certain conditions based on the 
concentration of the national banking sector, 
the target level for available financial means 
can be reduced by member states to 0.5% of 
covered deposits. In Germany, with its numer -
ous institutions, the conditions for such a 
reduction  are not met.
The financial means have to be raised within 
ten years through mandatory ex ante  contribu -
tions by credit institutions. Contribution 
amounts are based not only on the amount of 
covered deposits but also on the degree of risk 
incurred by the credit institution. In order to 
bring about the uniform use of risk- based 
amounts with a view to creating a level playing 
field in the EU, the European Banking Authority 
(EBA) has developed guidelines for risk- based 
contributions within the meaning of the EU 
Deposit  Guarantee Scheme Directive. Financial 
means also include irrevocable payment com -
mitments of banks, the share of which shall not 
exceed 30% of the total amount of available 
financial means. The EBA has also developed 
guidelines on the uniform application of such 
irrevocable payment commitments pursuant to 
the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive (EBA/
GL/ 2015/ 09 of 28 May 2015).
Coverage remains limited to a maximum of 
€100,000 per customer and credit institution. 
This limit applies to any depositor known by 
name, ie to any “identifiable” depositor. Pursu -
ant to the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Direct -
ive, “eligible” deposits include primarily those 
by individuals. Deposits by financial institutions, 
investment firms, pension and retirement 
funds, insurance undertakings or public author -
ities are therefore not protected. Member 
states which had higher national statutory cov -
erage levels when the directive entered into 
force have until the end of 2018 to reduce the 
limit protection to €100,000.

welfare are given a higher level of protection. 
Such deposits include those resulting from real 
estate transactions relating to private residen -
tial properties or contributions which serve 
social  purposes laid down in national law. In 
the case of a depositor’s life events, such as 
marriage, divorce, retirement, dismissal, redun -
dancy or invalidity, deposits in excess of 
€100,000 are protected for a period of up to 
twelve months.
The statutory deposit protection scheme’s 
available financial means are primarily intended 
for repaying depositors. However, the funds 
can now also be used for the resolution of 
credit institutions. The resolution authority, fol -
lowing consultation with the deposit guarantee 
scheme, shall determine the amount by which 
the deposit guarantee scheme is liable.4
The directive also provides for alternative meas -
ures to be taken as part of an expanded de -
posit protection mandate. Within the meaning 
of the directive, alternative measures are con -
strued to be such uses of funds that serve to 
prevent the failure of an affiliated credit institu -
tion. However, this is permitted only if the reso -
lution authority has not undertaken any reso -
lution action, and only on the condition that 
the costs of the measure do not exceed the 
costs of fulfilling the statutory mandate of the 
deposit guarantee scheme.5
For depositors in Europe, the directive distinctly 
improves their potential claims to repayment in 
several ways. One is that the repayment period 
has been reduced from 20 to seven working 
days. Another is that the deposit guarantee 
schemes are now required to make available to 
depositors improved information about how 
their deposits are being protected. Moreover, 
there is, across Europe, an obligation to pro -
vide a pre- defined target level of ex ante fund-
ing, which means that the statutory deposit 
guarantee scheme has the means to satisfy its 
payment obligations in the same way across 
Europe.The directive allows member states to permit 
their deposit guarantee schemes to lend to 
other deposit guarantee schemes within the EU 
under certain conditions if the borrowing mem -
ber state’s available financial means are insuffi -
cient to fulfil obligations to its depositors. As 
lending between individual member states’ 
deposit  guarantee systems is voluntary, there is 
no provision for a general communitisation of 
risks arising from deposit insurance.

liabilities  from securities transactions and an 
equivalent value of €20,000.
In order to statutorily ensure a comprehensive 
protection requirement, all credit institutions 
covered by the Capital Requirements Regula -
tion (CRR) have been required to join a statu -
tory deposit guarantee scheme since July 2015. 
Institutions will continue as before to be as -
signed by group of institution to statutory de -
positor compensation schemes for private and 
public banks. In addition, those institutions 
which had previously been exempted from 
membership of a statutory depositor compen -
sation scheme owing to membership of an in -
stitutional protection scheme are now also sub -
ject to a statutory obligation to compensate 
depositors.
The Deposit Guarantee Act generally envisages 
two types of protection schemes in order to 
compensate depositors as required by law:
– deposit guarantee schemes which repay de -
positors only if a bank has declared insolv -
ency (statutory compensation schemes) and
– institutional protection schemes which focus 
on assisting member institutions and which 
can apply to be recognised as deposit pro -
tection schemes.
No provisions governing possible cross- border 
lending to deposit guarantee schemes in other 
EU member states were incorporated into the 
Deposit Guarantee Act.
The Deposit Guarantee Act sets forth general 
rules which are applicable to all deposit guar -
antee schemes with regard to statutory depos -
itor protection and also additional requirements 
which apply specifically to recognised institu -
tional protection schemes. In general, every 
depositor  at a CRR credit institution has a legal 
right to repayment up to the limit on protec -
tion of €100,000, irrespective of where the 
CRR credit institution is grouped; this means 
that as of now, depositors of an institutional protection scheme have this legal right as well. 
The act defines as protected deposits credit 
balances, including time deposits and savings 
deposits, to be repaid by a CRR credit institu -
tion pursuant to the applicable laws and con -
tractual terms. Even foreign currency deposits 
are protected, although they will be repaid in 
euro.
Since the directive has opened up the possibil -
ity of increasing the coverage amount for social 
welfare reasons, the Deposit Guarantee Act has 
envisaged an increase in the level of depositor 
protection to up to €500,000 for a period of 
up to six months after crediting of the amount 
provided the credited amounts are connected 
to certain major “life events” of the depositor 
such as those listed in the EU DGSD and are 
therefore deemed particularly worthy of pro -
tection.
As envisaged by the directive, all deposit guar -
antee schemes governed by the Deposit Guar -
antee Act are required to raise, by 2024, avail -
able financial means of up to 0.8% of covered 
deposits by collecting contributions from the 
institutions belonging to the respective 
schemes. If a deposit guarantee scheme has 
used more than 0.8% of the amount of the 
covered deposits for payouts by the end of 
3  July 2024, the period during which the 
respective  deposit guarantee scheme must 
reach the target level shall be prolonged until 
the end of 3 July 2028. In order to identify the 
respective target funding amount, institutions 
are required to report once a year (starting at 
the 31 January 2016 reporting date) the amount 
of covered deposits as of 31 December of the 
previous year to the deposit guarantee scheme 
pursuant to the Deposit Guarantee Act.7

possibility, envisaged in the directive, of fund -

The EBA guidelines are also of relevance here. 
Under these guidelines, for instance, the pay -
ment commitments should be able to be rec -
ognised only if they are fully collateralised and 
the collateral is available to the deposit guaran -
tee scheme. The collateral shall consist entirely 
of low- risk assets and shall be unencumbered 
by any third- party rights.
The protection schemes are entitled to levy a 
number of extraordinary contributions and 
extraordinary payments per accounting year. 
Extraordinary contributions are payments made 
to cover the funds required if a compensation 
event occurs, whereas extraordinary payments 
are used for the repayment of loans taken out 
to cover the required funds. There are, how -
ever, limits with regard to the amounts that can 
be demanded from contributory institutions. 
Each year, member institutions can be required 
to pay a maximum of 0.5% of their covered 
deposits as extraordinary contributions or 
extraordinary payments if accumulated funds 
prove insufficient to finance a current compen -
sation event. With the consent of the German 
Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), 
the statutory deposit guarantee scheme can, in 
exceptional circumstances, demand higher 
extraordinary contributions in order to safe -
guard the functional viability of the compensa -
tion scheme. The deposit guarantee scheme 
may also borrow funds to cover temporary 
financing  needs.
The risk- based calculation of contributions 
stipulated in the directive, and which has now 
been made compulsory by the Deposit Guaran -
tee Act, has essentially already been imple -
mented in Germany, as the German protection 
schemes already have risk- based contribution 
systems in place. The EBA’s guidelines for risk- 
based contributions drafted in accordance with 
the directive are to be implemented by the 
competent authorities by the end of 2015. 
They stipulate that 75% of the calculation base 
is to be constituted by compulsory, ie harmon -
ised, categories with predefined indicators, 
while the remaining 25% can be specified according  to national criteria in order to take 
account of particular national requirements. In 
Germany, the details governing the levying of 
contributions are not set out in the Deposit 
Guarantee Act, but rather in a separate regula -
tion for statutory deposit guarantee schemes 
and in articles of association for recognised 
institutional  protection schemes.
The Deposit Guarantee Act shortens the repay -
ment deadline for depositor compensation 
from 20 working days at present to seven 
working days as of 31 May 2016, as required 
by the directive. While it is true that the Direct -
ive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes provides an 
option of incrementally reducing the repay -
ment deadline from 20 to seven working days 
over a ten- year period, in Germany it has been 
decided to switch over in a single step in the 
interest of enhancing depositor protection.
The EU’s Directive on Deposit Guarantee 
Schemes gives member states the option of 
creating a legal basis that allows deposit pro -
tection schemes to also use their funds for sup -
port measures. On this basis, the German im -
plementing legislation allows officially recog -
nised institutional protection schemes to carry 
out such measures provided that they meet the 
requirements stipulated in the Deposit Guaran -
tee Act.
A statutory deposit guarantee scheme also pro -
tects deposits held at branches of German in -
stitutions in other EU member states. While the 
deposit guarantee scheme of the host member 
state is responsible for administering the de -
positor compensation, the necessary funds are 
provided by the deposit guarantee scheme of 
the home member state before payouts are 
made. Similarly, compensation in Germany for 
deposits at branches of institutions from other 
EU member states is carried out in the name of 
the deposit guarantee scheme of the home 
member state. As there are several statutory 
deposit guarantee schemes in Germany, BaFin 
designates the deposit protection scheme

event. In most cases, this will be the Compen -
sation Scheme of the Association of German 
Banks (EdB).
Changes affecting deposit 
guarantee schemes of private 
and public- sector banks
The Deposit Guarantee Act retains the exist -
ence of two statutory compensation schemes, 
one for private-  sector CRR credit institutions 
and one for public- sector CRR credit institu -
tions. The pre- existing statutory compensation 
schemes (EdB and EdÖ) can therefore continue 
to carry out their functions as “entrusted com -
pensation schemes”. BaFin assigns institutions 
to the relevant compensation scheme on the 
basis of the institution’s legal form. Upon 
request , BaFin can alter a credit institution’s 
assignment  to a compensation scheme.
The deposit guarantee schemes of private and 
public- sector banks must fulfil the provisions 
that have been transposed into German law on 
the basis of the new Directive on Deposit Guar -
antee Schemes, particularly those on compen -
sation and the accumulation and use of funds. 
On the whole, however, the changes in con -
nection with the new directive are relatively 
limited for this group of institutions, as they do 
not entail any major material changes to the 
deposit guarantee schemes.
Changes to institutional 
protection  schemes
Up until now, institutional protection systems 
were classed as alternative systems and did not 
fall within the statutory framework of the DG -
ICA and were essentially exempt from its rules. 
Pursuant to the DGICA, they were, however, 
already subject to supervision by BaFin.
Pursuant to the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Dir -
ective, all CRR credit institutions must join a 
recognised deposit guarantee scheme. For Ger -many, this comprehensive statutory protection 
requirement means that institutions which are 
members of the voluntary protection schemes 
of the Sparkassen- Finanzgruppe  (DSGV) or the 
Federal Association of German People’s Banks 
and Raiffeisen Banks (BVR) now explicitly fall 
within the remit of the Deposit Guarantee Act. 
The amended EU Deposit Guarantee Scheme 
Directive is therefore of special significance for 
institutional protection schemes in Germany.
The existing institutional protection schemes, ie 
the DSGV and the BVR, had to decide whether 
to be recognised as institutional protection 
schemes within the meaning of the Deposit 
Guarantee Act or whether to fulfil the statutory 
depositor compensation requirements through 
separate, organisationally segregated struc -
tures. Both institutional protection schemes 
have been recognised as deposit guarantee 
schemes by the competent authority, BaFin, 
and are thus subject to full BaFin supervision 
pursuant to the Deposit Guarantee Act. Institu -
tions that belong to an institutional protection 
scheme which is recognised as a deposit guar -
antee scheme are exempt from being assigned 
to another statutory deposit guarantee scheme 
(section 24 (5) Deposit Guarantee Act).
A recognised institutional protection system 
must provide identical depositor protection for 
all affiliated CRR credit institutions. Moreover, 
its organisation, financing and use of funds 
must comply with the statutory requirements. 
The basis of any institutional protection scheme 
continues to be its own articles of association, 
in which the requirements of the CRR and the 
Deposit Guarantee Act are implemented.
In addition to the general requirements applic -
able to all protection schemes, additional legal 
requirements apply for the recognition of insti -
tutional protection schemes. The conditions 
necessary for liability arrangements, which pro -
tect the institutions and, where necessary, 
ensure  their liquidity and solvency, must be 
fulfilled  in accordance with Article 113 (7) of 
the CRR. Institutional protection schemes must Previous system

additionally provide “reasonable assurance” of 
the orderly performance of their tasks pursuant 
to the Deposit Guarantee Act, which means 
there must be at least two reliable and suitably 
qualified managers. Furthermore, a suitable 
supervisory body is required which is subject to 
the conditions of reliability pursuant to section 
25d (1) of the German Banking Act (Kredit -
wesengesetz) . The available funds must be 
administered  and invested separately from the 
scheme’s other assets. Moreover, the institu -
tional protection scheme must dispose of suit -
able and uniformly regulated systems for the 
monitoring and classification of risk so as to 
enable a complete overview of the risk situ -
ations of all the individual members and the 
institutional  protection scheme as a whole. In 
order to be able to react to a deterioration in 
the risk situation, the institutional protection 
scheme must be able to exercise influence over 
its member institutions.
The articles of association must comply with 
the minimum statutory requirements stipulated 
in the Deposit Guarantee Act and include rules 
on the following points in particular: contribu -
tions, conditions for carrying out support meas -
ures, inspection rights, information rights and 
disclosure rights, conditions for and scope of

sion of a member institution and rules on 
changes to the articles of association. Further -
more, liability arrangements must ensure that 
the institutional protection scheme can meet 
its obligations and provide the necessary sup -
port using funds that are readily available to it.
On this statutory basis, a recognised institu -
tional protection scheme remains entitled to 
carry out measures to avert a going concern 
risk, particularly to ensure the liquidity and solv -
ency of a member institution. However, with 
regard to such support measures, the institu -
tional protection scheme is subject to new statutory requirements pursuant to section 49 
of the Deposit Guarantee Act, including the 
following:
– the resolution agency must not have under -
taken any resolution measures
– the costs of the measures to avert a going 
concern risk may not, in principle, be higher 
than the costs that would be incurred by 
providing compensation for the covered 
deposits 
– conditions must be imposed which, at the 
very least, entail stricter risk monitoring and 
more extensive inspection rights for the pro -
tection scheme than under the previous pro -
visions
– the funds used for support measures must 
be repaid, through extraordinary contribu -
tions where necessary, if depositors need to 
be compensated and funding equals less 
than two thirds of a statutory deposit guar -
antee scheme’s target level or if the avail -
able funds are less than 25% of the target 
level8
– BaFin must, following an evaluation, confirm 
the ability of the member institution to pay 
the required extraordinary contribution.
Contributions raised by recognised institutional 
protection schemes must comply with the EBA 
guidelines, the provisions of which are to be 
implemented by the competent authorities by 
the end of 2015. The EBA guidelines stipulate 
that contributions are not only to be based on 
the level of covered deposits, but must also ap -
propriately take institutional risk into account. 
This accommodates the institutional protection 
schemes in particular, as their central institu -
tions, on account of their business model, gen -Legally compli-

years of the Deposit Guarantee Act entering into force.Deutsche Bundesbank

erally have only a relatively low level of covered 
deposits in relation to total assets.
With regard to strengthening trust, it is to be 
welcomed that depositors at institutions that 
are members of a recognised institutional pro -
tection scheme will, in future, also have a 
statutory right to compensation for their 
deposits  up to an amount, in principle, of 
€100,000, even though this right will not need 
to be exercised if the institutional protection 
scheme is invoked. However, as the member 
institutions of the institutional protection 
schemes still do not have a legal entitlement to 
receive support measures and a default on the 
part of an institution cannot be completely 
ruled out, the statutory right to compensation 
for depositors now in place represents a sub -
stantial improvement for the depositor. There -
fore, in principle, the same statutory deposit 
protection conditions apply to all deposit-  
taking institutions in Germany.
Implementation at the level of 
the individual associations
The new Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive 
and the Deposit Guarantee Act do not provide 
detailed requirements on how the parts of the 
new legal requirements specific to institutional 
protection schemes are to be implemented. 
The associations therefore have a certain de -
gree of flexibility.
The requirements of Article 133 (7) CRR on the 
application of zero risk weights and on the 
non-deduction of participating interests in 
other institutions within the same institutional 
protection scheme stipulate that the institu -
tional protection scheme must be able to grant 
support necessary under its commitment using 
funds readily available to it. In addition, the in -
stitutional protection scheme must be able to 
monitor risks and take influence.
With regard to risk management of the institu -
tional protection schemes, Article 113 (7) CRR requires uniformly regulated systems for the 
monitoring of the classification of risk, which 
should provide a complete overview of the risk 
situations of all the individual members and the 
institutional protection scheme as a whole. In 
order to be able to react to a deterioration in 
the risk situation of member institutions, the 
CRR foresees possibilities to exert influence.
Due to their differing situations, the associ -
ations were faced with different challenges in 
terms of fulfilling the new statutory require -
ments to be recognised as institutional protec -
tion schemes.
The previous structure of the BVR’s institutional 
protection scheme consisted of a guarantee 
fund and a guarantee network (BVR protection 
scheme). In order to set up a system recog -
nised as an institutional protection system, the 
BVR set up a separate company as a wholly-  
owned subsidiary ( BVR Institutssicherung 
GmbH,  hereinafter referred to as BVR- ISG) with 
the aim of operating a recognised institutional 
protection scheme. BVR- ISG is operated in par -
allel to the BVR protection scheme with largely 
similar structures (hence the term “dual protec -
tion system”). The BVR protection scheme is 
still operated in its original form as an institu -
tional protection system at the level of the 
association , but without official recognition.
BSV- ISG has an opening balance of funds pro -
vided by the BVR protection scheme. Its funds 
must be accumulated in accordance with the 
requirements of the Deposit Guarantee Act by 
2024. A liability arrangement between the BVR 
protection scheme and BVR- ISG ensures that 
the funds of the BVR protection scheme are 
also readily available to BVR- ISG.
Membership in the BVR- ISG exists in parallel to 
membership in the BVR protection scheme. All 
domestic CRR credit institutions that are mem -
bers of the BVR and the BVR protection scheme 
are also members of BVR- ISG. Accession takes 
place via a special declaration of accession and 
commitment.Recognised insti-
tutional protec-tion schemes provide a statu-tory right to compensation

In contrast to the liability structure of the BVR, 
which was already centralised, the institutional 
protection scheme of the Savings Bank Finance 
Group undertook changes, on account of its 
decentralised and regional structure, to meet 
the requirements of a uniformly run system. 
This concerns, in particular, the decision-  
making framework necessary for support meas -
ures within the regional protection schemes.
The members of the DSGV adjusted the protec -
tion scheme of the Savings Bank Finance Group 
in May 2015 to bring it into line with legal 
requirements . The principle of institutional pro -
tection for all German savings banks, Landes -
banken  and state building and loan associ -
ations has been retained in this process. The 
function of institutional protection continues to 
be assumed by the existing protection schemes 
of the Savings Bank Finance Group.
However, as required by the Deposit Guarantee 
Act, the previous institutional protection 
scheme is being supplemented with a deposit 
protection function. In the case of a compensa -
tion event, the DSGV will perform the protec -
tion function centrally for the entire group.
Under the institutional protection schemes rec -
ognised in Germany, member institutions do 
not have a legal right to receive support meas -
ures. Although the provisions of the Deposit 
Guarantee Act do not provide member institu -
tions with an enforceable legal right to receive 
support, the private- law articles of association 
of the respective association do, however, con -
tain support commitments in the context of in -
stitutional protection that stress the associa -
tion’s mandate of solidarity. However, a new 
aspect for institutional protection schemes is 
that support measures within the statutory 
framework can only be granted if the afore -
mentioned conditions of section 49 of the 
Deposit  Guarantee Act (see page 56) are met.Outlook: deposit protection 
and banking union
The “five presidents” of the various European 
institutions presented a report in May 2015 
containing objectives for the completion of 
economic and monetary union. Among other 
things, it called for the creation of a common 
European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS). 
The European Commission has since added fur -
ther substance to this objective and presented 
a roadmap with a step- by- step approach to 
implementing  EDIS. According to this road -
map (see the box on page 59), the European 
deposit  insurance scheme would begin as a 
re- insurance system for national insurance 
schemes as of 2017 and enter a co- insurance 
phase as of 2020, by which time the share of 
contributions and possible compensation pay -
ments borne by EDIS would increase each year. 
As of 2024, EDIS alone would be responsible 
for covering all compensation events. The pro -
posal of the European Commission builds on 
the idea of creating a banking union, according 
to which the common deposit insurance 
scheme would constitute the third pillar along -
side the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) 
and the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). 
The European Commission’s rationale for EDIS 
is to be better able to contain, in a European 
context, the effects of economic shocks that 
affect one country and overwhelm its national 
deposit guarantee scheme. EDIS is also in -
tended to reduce the dependence of banks on 
the economic situation of their respective 
country. Overall, through this approach, it is 
hoped that the trust of depositors in the secur -
ity of deposits in a European context will be 
strengthened.
However, important preconditions for a Euro -
pean deposit insurance scheme are not yet 
met. Further steps towards integration in Eur -
ope are necessary before a European deposit 
insurance scheme can be created.
A key precondition for a common deposit 
insurance  scheme is de- risking at banks. In Institutional pro-
tection scheme will continue with a decen-tralised structure

European Commission’s plans for a European Deposit 
Insurance  Scheme
The European Commission published a pro-
posal to amend the Single Resolution Mech-
anism (SRM) Regulation on 24 November 2015. This outlines a European Deposit 
Insurance  Scheme (EDIS), to be established in three sequential stages.
The fi  rst stage would be a re- insurance 
scheme from 2017 to 2019, followed by a 
co- insurance stage from 2020 to 2023 and, fi  nally, full insurance from 2024 onwards. In the third stage, a central fund is to be cre-
ated which would ultimately assume the 
full deposit protection function for all mem-ber states participating in the Single Super-visory Mechanism, or SSM. In the full insur-ance phase from 2024 onwards, it is envis-
aged that the national deposit guarantee schemes, which have been established in 
line with the EU Deposit Guarantee Schemes 
Directive up until now, will cease to func-
tion independently. The share of the institu-tions’ contributions to the national guaran-
tee schemes – which have received all of the resources up until now – would grad-ually decrease over the individual stages, while the contributions to the common 
EDIS fund would increase correspondingly. 
As the European- level fund grows, the 
fi  nancial  contributions to be made by EDIS, too, would rise steadily during the fi  rst two 
stages. If compensation needs to be paid 
out during the fi  rst stage of “re- insurance”, 
the national fund would be fi  rst in line to 
cover these compensation payments. Once 
the compensation funds at the national 
level have been fully depleted, EDIS would, 
during this stage, provide liquidity of up to 
a maximum of 20% of the refund costs, 
and the national guarantee schemes would 
have to pay back these funds to EDIS. 
According  to the European Commission’s plans, in the second stage (co- insurance), the national deposit guarantee schemes would only have to pay part of the com-pensation from their own funds before 
seeking EDIS funding. There would thus be a gradual introduction of risk- sharing across all participating states. In the fi  nal phase, it 
is assumed that risks will be shared in full among all participating member states. In this phase, all compensation cases in the participating states would be paid out via EDIS. The European Commission’s plans 
envisage  that the Single Resolution Board, 
or SRB, which has already been established 
at the European level, should assume re-sponsibility for implementing European deposit  protection, in the form of EDIS, 
together  with the participating national de-posit guarantee schemes (or the authorities 
designated responsible for administering 
the participating deposit guarantee schemes). 
Participation would ultimately be compul-
sory for all euro- area member states, while 
the idea is that non- euro- area member states could voluntarily participate in the SSM and thus automatically enrol in the SRM and the common European Deposit 
Insurance  Scheme.Deutsche Bundesbank

addition to the supervisory rules that have 
already  been adopted, abolishing the preferen -
tial supervisory treatment of sovereign expos -
ures could also make a significant contribution 
in this regard, as it would help make the eco -
nomic situation of banks less dependent on the 
situation of their respective home country. 
Otherwise, were the home country to default, 
there would be a danger of the direct eco -
nomic fallout being communitised under EDIS 
via the direct effects on national banks. Ultim -
ately, there would be a danger that the deposit 
guarantee scheme would, indirectly via this 
contagion channel, be made liable for the sov -
ereign debt of other countries.
Another key point is insolvency law. Rules gov -
erning corporate or personal insolvency have 
direct consequences for the risk situation of 
banks and the burden that creditors must bear 
in the event of insolvency. If a common Euro -
pean deposit guarantee scheme were to be set 
up without the requisite preconditions being in 
place, the consequences of insolvency regimes 
that favour the national private sector over 
creditor banks could, for example, be commu -
nitised. Barriers to rapid compulsory enforce -
ment by lenders are an example of such favour -
able treatment. Differences in the speed of 
integration   would obviate the alignment of 
liability  and control, which is necessary for 
rational   economic decision- making. Significant steps are still needed in order to prevent false 
incentives and undesirable economic conse -
quences. Until these steps have been taken, a 
common European deposit insurance scheme 
must be rejected.
The European Commission also sees dangers in 
its plan and highlights the necessary steps that 
must be taken in advance, such as de- risking at 
banks, the harmonisation of insolvency law 
and the implementation of the Bank Recovery 
and Resolution Directive (BRRD) in all member 
states. The implementation of this directive 
across all EU countries would reduce the likeli -
hood of the deposit insurance scheme being 
called upon, as it increases banking supervisors’ 
powers of early intervention if institutions ap -
pear to be at risk and strengthens the position 
of covered deposits because of the bail-in rules 
for other liabilities. The European Commission 
also points out the need for the Deposit Guar -
antee Scheme Directive to be implemented in 
all member states and for the national target 
amounts to be attained in conformity with the 
directive. It is therefore important that the 
steps taken are made in the correct order, ie 
that all necessary preconditions are in place 
before  a common deposit insurance scheme is 
created and that the objective of stability is not 
jeopardised by an ambitious timetable for cre -
ating a common deposit insurance scheme, 
which could run counter to this objective.Harmonisation
