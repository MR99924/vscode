IndustryIndustrial activity continued at full speed dur-
ing the fourth quarter. In November, outputwas 1
1/C252% up on the month in seasonally and
working-day adjusted terms following a de-cline of 0.6% in October, not least owing to a“bridge day” effect. On an average of thetwo-month period of October and November,industrial output was barely higher than thethird-quarter average. There was a 6
1/C254% rise
on the year in November, compared with a4% increase in October.
New orders grew by a seasonally adjusted
1
1/C252% in November. Following the decline in
October, orders for October and Novembercombined were
3/C254% lower than the average
of the third quarter. This was primarily due tosignificantly fewer large orders being placed.For example, orders placed with manufactur-ers of capital goods were down by 3%. Bycontrast, there was a perceptible rise indemand for consumer goods which affectedboth domestic and export orders. On an aver-age of the October-November period, thesewere 3
1/C252% up on the level of the third
quarter.
The seasonally adjusted value of exports of
goods declined by1/C252% in November, com-
pared with a 21/C252% increase in nominal ex-
ports in the previous month. In October andNovember as a whole, nominal exports were6
3/C254% up on the high level of the third quar-
ter. By contrast, the value of imports fell by3

age level of the third quarter. The trade sur-plus expanded in November by 32 billion to

1/C254billion.
Construction
There was exceptionally strong growth in sea-
sonally and working-day adjusted construc-tion output in November at 6
1/C254%. This was
as much as 12% up on the year. The mildweather conditions played a large part in this.It is also possible that a greater number ofresidential construction orders were pro-cessed before the VAT increase came intoforce on 1 January 2007. In October and No-vember together, the increase was 1
1/C254%u p
on the third quarter. This applies to both gen-eral building and civil engineering work.
Demand for construction work had been at a
relatively high level since the middle of theyear. In October (more recent figures are notyet available) construction demand was,however, 1
1/C252% down on the month in sea-
sonally adjusted terms. The public sector re-duced its orders by more than 9%, and hous-ing construction orders decreased by 1
1/C252%.
By contrast, commercial construction orderswent up by 5
1/C252%.
Economy as a whole
According to the data available so far, the
cyclical upturn in the German economy con-tinued in the fourth quarter. Exports, in par-ticular, recorded further strong growth. Giventhe clearly more subdued pace of imports,this is likely to have led to real net exportsEconomic conditions in Germany*

7making a substantial contribution to growth
in mathematical terms. Domestic investmentremained on an upward path. This appies tomachinery and equipment as well as con-struction activity, which also benefited fromthe exceptionally mild weather and anticipa-tory effects at the end of the year. Privateconsumption, however, shows a mixed pic-ture. According to provisional data, retailsales (excluding motor vehicles) were on thedecline in October and November, whereasnew passenger car registrations recorded ex-ceptionally strong growth in November andDecember owing to the impending increasein VAT. By contrast, the inventory changes arelikely to have had a dampening effect owingto the fact that some of the additional ex-ports and the greater number of cars soldhad already been produced in the secondquarter and were now being taken fromstock. According to initial calculations by theFederal Statistical Office, on an annual aver-age of 2006, real GDP was up 2
1/C252%o n
the year. After adjustment for the varyingnumber of working days, this represents anincrease of 2
3/C254%.
Labour marketThe labour market took a decidedly favour-
able turn towards the end of 2006. Accord-ing to initial estimates by the Federal Statistic-al Office, the number of persons in workstood at 39.28 million in November. This was45,000 more than in October and 425,000more than 12 months previously. Accordingto estimates by the Federal EmploymentAgency, the number of employees subject tosocial security contributions in October wasup on the month again as well. The year-on-
year increase amounted to 390,000. Thescale of government-assisted forms of em-ployment declined in December. On an an-nual average of 2006, there were almost260,000 more persons in work than in 2005.On balance, new jobs were created only inthe services sector, while the decline in em-ployment in the production sector (excludingconstruction) became slower. It should, how-ever, be borne in mind that the hiring out oflabour is assigned statistically to the servicessector, which means that the level of employ-ment in the services sector is overrecordedand therefore underrecorded in the second-ary sector. Employment in the construction in-dustry was largely stable following the rapidprocess of contraction over the past fewyears.
According to the figures of the Federal Em-
ployment Agency, there was a sharp fall inregistered unemployment in December. At aseasonally adjusted 4.12 million, there were600,000 fewer persons registered as un-employed than 12 months previously. Theseasonally adjusted unemployment ratestood at 9.8%, compared with 10.1% in No-vember. Apart from cyclical factors, the de-cline is likely to have been favoured by themild weather conditions and the anticipatoryeffects of the VAT increase, particularly in thecraft trades.
PricesThere was a slight rise in prices in the inter-
national crude oil markets at the beginning ofDecember after OPEC had decided to make

8further cuts to the supply; prices did, how-
ever, go back down again during the month.At just over US$62
1/C254, the spot quotation for
a barrel of Brent North Sea oil in mid-monthwas 4% up on the previous month’s level. Atthe time this report went to press (18 January2007), the spot price stood at just US$51
1/C252.
The sharp decline in prices at the beginningof the year was primarily due to the unusuallymild weather conditions in the North-East ofthe USA and in western Europe. Futures con-tracts with a maturity of six months wereUS$3
1/C252up on the spot price and up by as
much as US$61/C254if taken over an 18-month
period. It is therefore expected that oil priceswill increase again over the medium to longterm.
The state of calm in the international crude
oil markets since the third quarter of 2006has significantly reduced price pressure in thevarious sectors of the economy. For example,import prices showed no more than a moder-ate increase on the month in November. Theyear-on-year rate of increase fell from 3.0%to 2.8%. Producer prices for industrial prod-ucts were only moderately higher than in theprevious month. In November, they were4.7% up on the year. The corresponding ratein October was 4.6%. Excluding energy, theyear-on-year increase was 2.9%.
Seasonally adjusted consumer prices in De-
cember were 0.1% down on the month.Whereas industrial goods (excluding energy)became cheaper, the prices of the other com-ponents remained unchanged. Year-on-yearconsumer price inflation (CPI) went downfrom 1.5% in November to 1.4% in Decem-ber.
On an annual average of 2006, the rate of
price increase was 1.7%, compared with2.0% in 2005. Half of this was due to themore moderate rise in energy prices than be-fore. The average annual rate of HICP infla-tion was 1.8%, compared with 1.9% in2005.
Public finances
1
Government debt
According to the latest calculations, the debt
of general government (central, regional andlocal government plus social security funds)as defined in the Maastricht Treaty reached31.568 trillion at the end of September 2006.
This is an increase of almost 347 billion since
the end of the previous year and represents adebt ratio of 68.7% of the gross domesticproduct of the preceding four quarters andgrowth of almost 1 percentage point sincethe end of 2005. However, this ratio shouldbe lower at the end of 2006, not least owingto the repayment of central government’ssubstantial money market deposits in theamount of approximately 310 billion.
Preliminary figures for central governmentdebt at the end of 2006 show that central

9government debt rose by 3321/C252billion on the
previous year.2The outstanding volume of
bonds grew by 3301/C252billion. Last year an
inflation-indexed bond worth 351/C252billion was
issued for the first time and was topped upby33
1/C252billion during the year. While the
amount of five-year Federal notes increasedby35
1/C252billion net, the amount of two-year
Federal Treasury notes and Federal savingsbonds outstanding decreased by almost 35
1/C252
billion and 31 billion respectively. Central gov-
ernment raised 35 billion net by issuing
money market instruments and moneymarket loans. Overall the structure of centralgovernment debt shifted further in favour ofbonds, whose share rose by almost 1
1/C252per-
centage points to 59%. At 191/C252%, the
relative weight of five-year Federal notesremained virtually unchanged while that ofthe two-year Federal Treasury notes de-creased by 1 percentage point to 11%. Theshare of money market debt, by contrast,grew by almost
1/C252percentage point to 6%.
As in the previous year, in 2006 central gov-
ernment made the largest refinancing savingsin the area of bonds. While the average nom-inal rate of interest weighted by volume forthe bonds maturing in 2006 still amounted to6.1%, new bonds – including 30-year Bunds –were issued at an average yield of 3.8%. Refi-nancing five-year Federal notes turned out tobe advantageous. At 3.7%, the average yieldon new issues was approximately 1.1 per-centage points below the average nominalrate of interest for maturing notes.
However, the cost of refinancing two-year
Federal Treasury notes went up. On averagethe issue yield was approximately 1 percent-
age point above the nominal rate of interestfor notes due, and this led to a noticeable im-pairment of savings in interest costs owing tothe large volume of redemptions in this seg-ment. Last year refinancing conditions at theshort end of the maturities range also deteri-orated noticeably. The issue yield for themonthly tender allotment of Bubills increasedby almost 1.1 percentage points to nearly3.6% over the period from January to De-cember.

2The increase in central government market debt differs
from net borrowing, which, according to the preliminary
figures for 2006, amounts to almost 328 billion (com-
pared to a budgeted amount of just over 338 billion)
owing mainly to the fact that the funds raised at the end
of a calendar year can be attributed to a different fiscal
year or are not needed for financing the budget at the
end of the fiscal year.Refinancing

neutralised.
The announced issue volume for the current
year includes gross borrowing in the capitalmarket of 3213 billion by means of one-off
issues, while the planned redemption volumetotals 3199 billion.
3In addition to the pub-
lished issuance programme, central govern-ment plans to expand the inflation-indexedbonds segment and does not rule out thepossibility of issuing additional foreign cur-rency bonds. In contrast to what happened inprevious years, the refinancing of paper thatwill become due during the current yearcould raise the interest costs as a whole.Local government finances
According to the recently published Federal
Statistical Office’s cash statistics, local govern-ment recorded a surplus of over 32 billion in
the third quarter of 2006 following a bal-anced result in 2005. This was attributablemainly to the sharp increase in income ofalmost 6
1/C252%. Tax revenue accruing to local
government went up by just over 171/C252%o r
almost 321/C252billion. Net earnings from trade
tax were 33% higher than in the previousyear, and the share in income tax receiptsgrew by 10%.
Local government expenditure, by contrast,
rose by no more than just over
1/C252%. At al-
most 31/C252%, expenditure on social benefits
continued to increase significantly. A majorfactor in this was the development of thecosts of accommodation for recipients ofunemployment benefit II. However, in com-parison with the first half of 2006 (+6
1/C252%),
growth continued to slow, and in easternGermany it actually came to a halt. The in-crease in other operating expenditure alsoslowed to 1
1/C252% after being up 41/C252% in the
first half of the year. The slight decrease inpersonnel expenditure observed at mid-yearaccelerated significantly in the third quarter(-3%). However, this could, in part, be due toentries that had still not been posted on thereporting date and is not a reliable indicatorthat more jobs had been cut. However, anupturn has been identified for investment in€b n

11fixed assets at local government level. Ex-
penditure in this area grew by 1% nation-wide, predominantly owing to a more signifi-cant rise in construction investment, wherebythe increase in southern Germany was par-ticularly pronounced. The volume of out-standing cash advances, which are actuallyonly allowed to be used to cover short-termliquidity shortages, decreased slightly onbalance in comparison with the end of theprevious quarter, a situation which had notbeen seen in a long time. With a total valueof327
1/C252billion, the budgets of many local
governments are still considerably strainedand therefore restrict investment accord-ingly.
Up until the end of September 2006, local
governments as a whole recorded a surplusof3
1/C252billion. This surplus is expected to
expand further in the final quarter, when rev-enue is traditionally high, as a result offavourable macroeconomic developments andthe positive trend in tax revenues. Local gov-ernment finances are also expected todevelop favourably in 2007. The official taxestimate from November predicts a slightdecrease in trade tax revenue not least due tothe augmented depreciation possibilities as aresult of the Federal Government’s 2006 eco-nomic stimulus programme. However, higherrevenue from income tax shares should morethan compensate for this. Local governmentsbenefit from additional turnover tax receipts,which result from raising the standard rate,via tax-revenue-sharing arrangements. More-over, instead of the almost 32 billion reduc-
tion that central government had originallyplanned in the share of accommodation costsAdditional information about
financial accounts and public financesin the Statistical Section of theMonthly Report
As of January 2007, the Statistical Section of the
Monthly Report has been revised. Particularchanges have been made to the financial accountssection, which now contains information from thecourse of the year, and to public finances, whichhave been expanded and reworked.
In section VIII of the Statistical Section, quarterly
information on the financial accounts based onthe European System of Integrated Economic Ac-counts (ESA 95) has been included for the firsttime. Since summer 2006, these quarterly datahave been produced in the same way as the usualannual financial accounts. The information in theStatistical Section focuses on households and non-financial corporations. Both the financial assetacquisition and its financing as well as the corre-sponding stock data in the form of financial assetsand liabilities are shown for these two sectors. Formore information about the definition of thesesectors and about the breakdown and definitionof the individual investment and financing instru-ments, see the methodological notes to the SpecialStatistical Publication 4 in which the annual resultsare published regularly.
In the public finances section (section IX), further
information about the Maastricht criteria and thenational accounts data has been included. Tablesshowing the budgetary development of the statu-tory health insurance scheme and of the statutorylong-term care insurance scheme have also beenadded to ensure a more complete picture of all sig-nificant government subsectors. As part of adjust-ments to other tables, government cash trends are,for the most part, no longer shown. At the begin-ning of section IX of the Statistical Section thereare two new tables, one showing the Maastrichtcriteria and one showing the general govern-ment’s position in the national accounts. These arefollowed by data in accordance with the budget-ary definitions starting with general governmentand proceeding to the individual subsectors. Aswell as the budgetary development of central,state and local government – and in particular taxrevenue – the budgetary development of the mostimportant branches of the social security funds isshown. This section concludes with a detailedbreakdown of government debt.

2007, there will be a top-up of almost 31/C252bil-
lion after negotiations with the states. At thesame time, a follow-up regulation agreed forsubsequent years makes provisions for areduction in central government’s participa-tion only if the number of people claimingbenefits declines. Against a backdrop offavourable macroeconomic perspectives,local governments now have the opportunityof regaining greater scope for budgetaryaction.
Securities markets
Bond marketIssuing activity in the German bond market
was somewhat weaker in November than inthe preceding month. Debt securities weresold for a total of 388.1 billion, compared
with 391.8 billion in the previous month.
After deducting redemptions and taking ac-count of changes in issuers’ holdings of theirown bonds and notes, the volume of domes-tic bonds outstanding went up only margi-nally by 30.5 billion. Furthermore, foreign
debt instruments were sold for 324.8 billion
in Germany, the majority of which were euro-denominated securities. All in all, therefore,net sales of German and foreign bonds raised325.4 billion in the German capital market in
the month under review.
A large percentage of the borrowing by resi-
dents in November ( 34.4 billion) was from
German credit institutions. They received32.8 billion and 31.9 billion from the sale ofother bank debt securities, which can bestructured flexibly, and public Pfandbrieferespectively. Specialised credit institutionsissued own debt securities in the amount of31.1 billion net. By contrast, mortgage Pfand-
briefe were redeemed for 31.4 billion.
Non-financial enterprises raised only 30.2 bil-
lion in the German bond market in Novem-ber. The amount raised from commercialpaper, at 31.6 billion, was offset by net re-
demptions of longer-term corporate bonds tothe value of 31.5 billion.
The public sector reduced the outstandingvolume of its own paper by 34.1 billion in No-
vember after issuing debt instruments worth314.2 billion net in October. Taking account
of the increase in its own holdings by 312.4
billion and its redemptions, central govern-ment reduced the outstanding amount of itsown securities by 36.3 billion. In doing so, the
volume of ten-year Federal bonds (Bunds),two-year Federal Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze) andfive-year Federal notes (Bobls) was reducedby32.8 billion, 31.5 billion and 31.1 billion
respectively. A small amount of Federal sav-ings notes and Treasury discount paper(Bubills) were also redeemed ( 30.1 billion
respectively). Central government borrowedfunds in the capital market ( 30.1 billion)
solely through the issuance of FederalTreasury financing paper. By contrast, stategovernments issued a greater amount of owndebt securities in November ( 32.2 billion)
than in the previous month.
On the buyers’ side, domestic credit institu-
tions and foreign investors were again the

13main purchasers of debt securities in Novem-
ber. Banks acquired bonds worth 320.6 bil-
lion, 317.0 billion of which was accounted
for by foreign paper. In the case of domesticdebt securities, they bought paper issued bythe public sector and private enterpriseswhile selling net amounts of bank debt secur-ities. As in October, the majority of issues byGerman private and public sector borrowerswere acquired by foreign investors in the re-porting month ( 318.2 billion). On balance,
domestic non-banks reduced their bond port-folios by 313.4 billion. They sold domestic
debt instruments issued by public sector andprivate issuers to the value of 319.0 billion
and32.3 billion respectively. By contrast, they
increased their holdings of foreign bonds by37.8 billion.
Equity marketIssuing activity in the German equity market
picked up somewhat in November. Listedenterprises placed new shares with a marketvalue of 30.7 billion and unlisted enterprises
issued shares worth 30.2 billion. Furthermore,
sales of foreign equities in cross-border trans-actions amounted to 36.5 billion net. On bal-
ance, German shares were purchased primar-ily by foreign investors ( 35.7 billion). In add-
ition, domestic credit institutions invested37.7 billion in the German equity market, al-
though notably in foreign equities. By con-trast, domestic non-banks reduced theirequity holdings – as in October already – by36.0 billion, primarily through the sale of Ger-
man paper.Mutual fund shares
Outflows of funds from domestic mutual
funds slowed down significantly in November(30.1 billion, compared with 31.3 billion in
October). These concerned exclusively mutualfunds open to the general public (- 31.4 bil-
lion), while specialised funds which are re-served for institutional investors sold ownshares worth 31.3 billion. Of the mutual

Balance of payments
The German current account recorded – in
unadjusted terms – a surplus of 312.5 billion
in November, up 30.8 billion on the month.
This can be attributed mainly to a larger tradesurplus. However, there was also a rise in thedeficit on invisible current transactions, whichcomprise services, income and current trans-fers.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the foreign trade sur-plus stood at 318.6 billion, compared with
317.4 billion in the previous month. After ad-
justment for seasonal and working-day vari-ations, the surplus increased by 32 billion to

of goods fell somewhat, the value of importsfell decidedly more sharply (4%).

15quarter; in real terms, however, they were
slightly up.
The deficit on invisible current transactions in-
creased in November by 30.4 billion on the
month to 34.2 billion. This can be attributed
to a 31.5 billion fall in net revenue from
cross-border income as well as a decrease inthe deficits on services and current transfersof30.6 billion in each case to 31.7 billion and
32.5 billion, respectively.
There were net capital exports amounting to
39.6 billion resulting from cross-border port-
folio investment in November, compared withimports in the previous month ( 35.8 billion
net). The main reason for the reversal was therise in residents’ cross-border investment(333.7 billion, up from 317.4 billion in Octo-
ber). In particular, they increased their de-mand for foreign debt securities ( 324.8 bil-
lion), primarily in the form of longer-termpaper ( 323.6 billion). In addition, residents ac-
quired foreign shares and mutual fund sharesto the value of 35.9 billion and 33.0 billion,
respectively. Foreign investors bought domes-tic securities worth 324.0 billion net. Here,
too, their interest was focused on debt secur-ities ( 318.2 billion). They acquired almost
equal amounts of public and private bonds.In the area of direct investment, there were
net capital imports of 34.5 billion in Novem-
ber (compared with outflows of funds in theprevious month). Whereas foreign proprietorsprovided their German affiliates with add-itional capital ( 32.4 billion), German direct in-
vestors withdrew funds from their subsidiar-ies abroad ( 32.1 billion net).
Other investment, which comprises loans
and trade credits as well as bank depositsand other assets, resulted in net capital ex-ports in November ( 312.1 billion), with the
activities of non-banks cancelling each otherout. Whereas general government reducedits bank deposits abroad ( 37.9 billion), the
transactions of enterprises and householdsled to capital exports ( 37.8 billion). In the
unsecuritised financial transactions of thebanks, there were (net) outflows of fundsamounting to 38.3 billion. The Bundesbank’s
external assets increased by 33.9 billion, pri-
marily as a result of transactions in connec-tion with the large-value payment systemTARGET.

in Germany
under the influence
of technological
change and
competition among
production locationsBy virtue of its dual function as a de-
mand factor and as a supply factor, in-vestment plays a key role in the busi-ness cycle and the growth process.From a cyclical standpoint, corporateinvestment has now become an im-portant second pillar in the currenteconomic upswing. Over the longerterm, investment is a crucial parameterin the process by which enterprises ad-just to structural change, which hasbeen increasingly marked since the1990s by technological and global fac-tors.
This article retraces the cyclical move-
ments and longer-term trends in cap-ital formation in Germany. If the ef-fects of reunification are taken into ac-count, the relationship between in-vestment behaviour and productionactivity in the corporate sector doesnot seem to have undergone any last-ing change in the past few years. Thisis a sign that, although structural fac-tors have changed the composition ofgross fixed capital formation, on bal-ance the diverging influences have hada neutral impact on the volume todate. However, there are still manychallenges associated with Germany asan investment location with which thebusiness sector, the social partners andeconomic policymakers are faced.

18Looking back at the development
of investment activity: cyclical andstructural factors
The German economy has been undergoing
a rapid cyclical upswing since 2006. Follow-ing a period of stubborn stagnation thatgradually came to an end in mid-2003, theensuing cyclical recovery was based initiallyalmost exclusively on extremely dynamic ex-port growth. Given declining corporatespending on new plant and equipment over anumber of years, it was debated at the timewhether investment was still capable of serv-ing as a link between external activity and abroadly based cyclical recovery at all.
1A year
later, however, the upturn in business activitybecame entrenched when corporate invest-ment
2strengthened further. The basis for
growth has broadened continuously sincethen. In the past year, private consumptionand housing investment – albeit influencedby special effects – contributed moderately toeconomic growth, and the labour markettook a turn for the better. In terms of the se-quence, at least, the recovery pattern typicalof the German economy seems to have re-mained intact so far in the current cycle. (Seealso the box on pages 20 and 21.)
Nevertheless, it is still worth asking what
strategies German enterprises have employedto adapt to other, more sustained changes inthe conditions for accumulating and allocat-ing investible funds in Germany. In a competi-tive environment, investment is subject to avariety of motives and determinants inherentin the domestic economy. However, in amicroeconomic context, it always reflects agap between the existing or available capitalstock and the desired (read: optimum) stockof fixed assets. The velocity and intensity atwhich companies adapt their investment pol-icies depend not only on their options andthe costs of capital adjustment but also onthe size of the aforementioned disparity.
The dominant lasting influences include both
the penetration of the economy with new in-formation and communication technologies(ICT) and the real and financial effects of theaccelerated pace of globalisation. Both havedone more than merely push forward sectoralstructural change in the German economy.They have also provided a key boost towardschanging the way factors of production aredeployed in Germany and thereby adaptingthe capital stock and financing structure.These factors can influence investment a
priori through various channels and in various
ways. Compared to overall economic devel-opment, the increasing percentage of ICTgoods in the stock of commercial fixed assetshas coincided with a tendency for gross fixedcapital formation to rise more sharply. At thesame time, in the wake of increasing global-isation (especially through the integration oftransition countries and emerging marketsinto the world economy), the domestic cap-ital stock is being called upon to deliver high-er yields than just a few years ago. The ad-justment to this trend, viewed in isolation, islikely to have had more of a dampening ef-

19fect on domestic corporate fixed asset forma-
tion. Finally, German reunification, throughwhich capital-intensive production methodsin the former East Germany were prioritisednot least for economic policy reasons, left animpact in commercial investment behaviourthat lingered for a longer period of time.
In addition, there are also signs that, in the
past few years, shocks to the real economyhave been modulated by the financial envir-onment in a different manner from past dec-ades. For instance, enterprises have striven toimprove their credit rating and thereby freethemselves from dependency on external fi-nance. Between 1997 and 2005, (adjusted)equity went up from 68.8% of fixed assets incorporate balance sheets to 112.9%. Ownfunds rose particularly sharply among smalland medium-sized enterprises.
3However, en-
terprises’ liquidity holdings rose during thesame period from 25.0% to 40.1% of fixedassets. A decline in borrowing, includingbank liabilities, was in line with an increase inown funds. Both short-term and long-termbank liabilities fell sharply during the periodunder review, namely by a combined total ofapproximately 27% of fixed assets.
This correction in financing relationships is at-
tributable partly to adjustment processes inthe banking sector, which was facing increas-ing competition and pressure on margins andwhich was needed to create the capital re-serves for risk required by Pillar I of the newBasel Capital Framework. However, it wasalso helped along by enterprises’ own effortsto restore stability to a financing structurethat had suffered from previous misalign-ments. During the adjustment period, this
“investment” in their own balance sheetstructures could also have occasionally com-peted with investment in machinery, equip-ment and structures. The attendant conse-quences for accumulation, however, shouldonly be of a primarily transitory nature.as a percentage of fixed assets

20Deutsche BundesbankDeterminants and indicators of commercial investment: empirical short-run and long-run results
According to theory, investment activity in the corpor-
ate sector is, over the long run, closely related to thedevelopment of value added. Indeed, the economet-ric study of these time series reveals the existence of astable long-run equilibrium relationship which can bedescribed adequately by the (log) price-adjusted in-vestment-to-GDP ratio. For the observation periodchosen here, however, a level shift coinciding with re-unification needs to be taken into account. Moreover,the empirical analysis shows that the (lagged) invest-ment-to-GDP ratio does not directly contribute to ex-plaining the contemporaneous rate of change in cor-porate sector value added (weak exogeneity of theactivity variable). Under these conditions, the invest-ment-to-GDP ratio may be regarded as the cyclicalcomponent of commercial gross fixed capital forma-tion, whereas, from the standpoint of time seriesanalysis, gross value added comprises the commontrend of both series.
1For entrepreneurial fixed capital
formation, therefore, the overall economic growthoutlook is the decisive factor over the long term. Onekey condition, however, is that the earning power ofthe capital employed can, in the long run, keep upwith the yield on alternative forms of use and thesystematic risk component of investment.
The pronounced fluctuation of the investment-to-
GDP ratio is influenced not only by the cyclical earn-ings component but also by the cost of capital ser-vices, the form of financing and, not least, fiscal fac-tors. At the macro level, many of these determinantscan be approximated by suitable indicators. The ex-tent of future earnings is surely correlated with assess-ments of current and expected business which are ob-tained in the business surveys run by the Ifo Instituteand the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry(Deutsche Industrie- und Handelskammer, or DIHK).
2
The costs of external funding can be approximatedwith the help of ex ante real interest rates.
3The
macroeconomic profit ratio – defined as the operatingsurplus as a percentage of nominal GDP – could serveas an indicator of the additional own funds availablein the corporate sector (if dividend distribution andprofit-taking remain constant).
4Whereas the informa-
tion on the degree of fixed capital utilisation and thestock of orders surveyed by the Ifo Institute can indir-ectly point to the need for investment in capacity ex-tensions, the enterprises taking part in the DIHK sur-vey are asked directly for information on their invest-ment plans.
The variables described above may be considered as
indicators of cyclical investment dynamics not only be-cause of their theoretical importance but also becausethey are recorded at multiple times during the year,are available without a long time-lag, and – at leastfrom a theoretical standpoint – are not trending overtime. Granger causality analyses may be used to re-view whether the indicators have any predictive con-tent for the cyclical component of commercial invest-ment.
5
The majority of the selected indicators feature favour-able forecasting characteristics. Survey data based onthe general economic situation seem to perform bet-ter than survey results on specifics such as productionexpectations and selling price expectations. The Ifo In-stitute’s utilisation indicators, much like the DIHK sur-vey of investment plans, are useful criteria for assess-ing the movement of commercial fixed asset forma-tion in a short-run perspective. To a slightly lesser ex-tent, this also applies to the profit ratio but not to ex

ever, it must be noted that the test results are basedon the relatively short period from the fourth quarterof 1989, which is marked by a downward trend ininterest rates.
6
The results for the ex ante real interest rates could
support the view that favourable external financingconditions alone are not sufficient to ensure lively in-vestment activity. Approaches to estimating the inter-est elasticity of the demand for capital based onmacro data, however, are not without problems. Forone thing, the (real) interest rate varies as a compon-ent of the user cost of capital over time because, aseconomic activity increases, market interest rates in-crease as well, and this, in itself, implies a positive cor-relation between the demand for investment and theinterest rate. In addition, risks to price stability areusually linked positively to real economic activity ortensions in the goods and factor markets, thus givingrise to corresponding risk premiums. Micro studies, bycontrast, are better able to take account of both as-pects, since macroeconomic effects can be filtered outand the user cost of capital contains numerous enter-prise-specific elements that are not subject to macro-economic endogeneity. If estimates are made usingmicro data from the Bundesbank’s corporate balancesheet statistics, investment demand turns out to besignificantly dependent on the user cost of capital.
7
The extraordinarily optimistic assessments of the busi-ness situation and business expectations at the currentend may lead to the conclusion that the rather dy-namic corporate investment activity will probably con-tinue in the near future. This assessment is also backedup by the investment plans surveyed by the DIHK andthe currently high level of capacity utilisation in the
manufacturing industry. Enterprises are likely to reactto a continuation of the lively ordering activity by ex-panding their production capacities, especially as cor-porate earnings have been high for some time nowand financing conditions remain favourable. Finally, itmust also be stated that investment in movables willstill benefit from the temporary increase in depreci-ation allowances in 2007 and that the resultant sur-pluses – as is intended by the planned corporate taxreform – will be taxed at lower rates from 2008.

22Whether – and to what extent – the struc-
tural influences exerted by technology andthe global environment have caused invest-ment activity to change overall is ultimatelyan empirical question. It turns out that, since1991, real gross fixed capital formation andreal gross value added in the corporate sectorhave grown largely in parallel, after eliminat-ing cyclical fluctuations. This represents thecontinuation of a pattern that could alreadybe seen in the former West Germany duringthe 1970s and 1980s. This evidence of astable long-run investment-to-GDP ratio atconstant prices shows that, on balance, theinfluences described above have so far largelycancelled one another out. All the same, eachof these “shocks” raises the need for adjust-ment in the domestic capital formation pro-cess.
Penetration of the economy
by information and communicationtechnology (ICT)
The technical progress associated with ICT is
penetrating the working environment in in-dustrial countries with increasing strength. InGermany, the percentage share of ICT goodsin total investment in machinery and equip-ment
4went up in real terms from just over
15% in 1991 to over 40% in 2005.5Al-
though this rise was temporarily halted whenthe New Economy bubble burst, it appears tohave resumed since 2004. This developmentshould not come as a surprise: companiesseeking to maintain their competitiveness al-ways have to keep up with the latest develop-ments in the ICT field. One aspect of this re-quirement is that companies are introducingcompletely new procedures and products.
6
Another is that ICT modernisation is com-paratively costly because the installed capitalgoods are prone to extremely rapid economicobsolescence despite their technical function-ality.
The growing share of ICT goods and the
shorter product lifecycles in this segmenthave led to a reduction in the average servicelife of capital, increasing the need for replace-ment investment. Thus, economic agents de-ciding upon new investments are faced witha rising depreciation rate which, through thischannel, raises the cost of capital and makesit optimal to keep a smaller capital stock thanunder unchanged conditions regarding de-preciation.
Data from the national accounts can be used
to calculate the average depreciation ratesfor the corporate sector. Whereas the averagedepreciation rate on structures has stood un-changed at just over 3% per annum since re-unification, for machinery and equipment thefigure rose from 14
1/C252% in 1991 to over 18%
in 2005. For this period, this means that thedepreciation rate on the representative cap-
4Machinery and equipment in this context also include
“other assets” (particularly software).
5In line with the Federal Statistical Office definitions, ICT
investment comprises the following categories of invest-ment in fixed assets, by group of goods: investment in of-
fice machinery and computers; investment in radio, tele-
vision and communication equipment and apparatus; in-
tangible fixed asset investment. See also Deutsche Bun-
desbank, The significance of information and communi-
cation technology, Monthly Report, April 2004, p 48.

23ital good has gone up by just under 11/C252per-
centage points to around 8% per annum.7
However, the higher productivity of the newmachinery and equipment means that a typ-ical capital unit now provides a higher degreeof service, suggesting that a smaller quantityof new capital goods will suffice to replaceolder plant.
The increasing penetration of ICT goods af-
fects the user cost of capital and thus invest-ment behaviour through further channels.The stock of ICT goods already installed in agiven configuration loses market value prac-tically every year of its service life becausecontinuous quality improvements generallytend to reduce prices in this segment. Owingto the rapid penetration of the market by ICT,the average price of machinery and equip-ment has therefore been falling continuouslysince 1993. Even the slight overall price in-creases in structures were not enough to off-set this trend: in 2005 the price of the invest-ment good which is representative for Ger-man enterprises stood at 5% below its 1991level. In fact, compared with the price whenthe construction boom peaked in 1995, thedecline was even twice as large. It is not justthe absolute price of the capital good but itsprice relative to the selling price of commer-cial products which is relevant for businesses’investment decisions. However, relative cap-ital goods prices, too, have been on a pro-nounced and nearly uninterrupted downwardtrend since reunification, averaging around1
1/C252% a year.
If the market price for fixed assets falls rela-
tive to the (net) selling price of the manufac-tured goods, corporate investment decisions
are affected in two ways. One is that entre-preneurs will be likely to prefer capital-intensive production technology, becausefixed assets are cheaper to procure, therebymaking their use more profitable than that ofother factor inputs. However, if the trend to-wards falling prices is expected to continue,entrepreneurs must also reckon with the pos-sibility that the new capital good will losevalue in real terms. If, for instance, the invest-or expects the post-1991 relative price devel-opment of the representative capital good tocontinue at a similar pace in the future, too,he will assume a loss in real value of 1

When a profit-maximising enterprise is decid-ing on investments, this negative valuationeffect will increase the user cost of capital inthe same manner as a lasting increase in realfinancing costs or in the allowance for wearand tear. This effect only raises the profitabil-ity threshold, reducing ceteris paribus the op-
timal capital stock in a one-off manner. Asthe former effect, however, accumulates overtime, the sustained slide in the relative priceof capital goods is expected to – at least overthe longer term – increase investment.
Theoretically, the rapid proliferation of ICT
goods has had disparate impacts on invest-ment activity. The stimulating influence is like-ly to outweigh the dampening effects, whichmeans that, on the whole, gross fixed capitalformation in the corporate sector shouldhave grown must faster, on average, thanvalue added.
International competition among
production locations
The second major trend that was of primary
importance for corporate investment behav-iour over the past decade was the globalisa-tion in large areas of economic activity.
8The
increasing international competition for cap-ital as the mobile factor of production is a tell-ing feature of this development. This compe-tition has intensified significantly since theearly 1990s and evolved into an element ofcompetition among production locationsowing to the opening of the markets ofemerging economies and transition countries,the advance of European integration and therelative decline in transport and communi-cation costs. To prevail in this competitiveenvironment, German companies are increas-ingly facing the challenge of meeting therequirements regarding returns on fixed assetsimposed by the global market.

products over the past few years ultimatelyshows that companies and their employeeshave generally embarked on the right path to-wards maintaining or even expanding theirmarket position in the age of globalisation.
The industrial sector,
9which is, on the whole,
subject to especially powerful international
competitive pressure, has seen its returns onfixed assets increase noticeably since the mid-1990s. In 2005 the operating surplus per cap-ital unit at replacement cost was just over11
1/C252% (before taxes and depreciation), re-
turning to double digits for the first timesince reunification. Leaving aside phenomenaspecific to individual companies, this develop-ment is the upshot of cost cutting, productiv-ity increases and changes in the use of factorinputs. Moreover, wage moderation and thereduction in non-core payments readjustedthe remuneration structure of labour, whichhad not been productive enough for theinternational competitive environment. Long-er operating hours for machinery, achievedthrough extended working hours and flexi-time agreements, as well as employee train-ing measures served to increase capital prod-uctivity. However, non-replacement and thetargeted downsizing of machinery and equip-ment through, for instance, shifting produc-tion activities requiring a low-skilled work-force to foreign countries with a more favour-able (wage) cost structure, also increasedproductivity.
10Both capital adjustment meas-
ures led to a lower volume of gross domesticinvestment. With a fixed production technol-ogy, companies influence capital productivityby changing the use of factor inputs or the%

26capital intensity.11Over the past decade, cap-
ital intensity in the industrial sector has, in
fact, seen a visible decline (see adjacentchart). Given exogenous factor price move-ments and a predetermined production tech-nology, reducing domestic capital intensity isthe optimum reaction by the corporate sectorto the increase in the required return on fixedassets. To that extent, more subdued domes-tic investment in the industrial sector maytherefore also be regarded as a reaction tothe challenge of globalisation.
Even in the initial post-reunification period,
retailers’ and wholesalers’ return on capitalstood at just over 10% on average. In con-trast to industry, the profitability of the tradesector kept pace with that of the businesssector. In terms of production theory, it there-fore comes as no surprise that the capital in-tensity of the trade sector has since de-veloped virtually in parallel to that of the cor-porate sector as a whole. The existing differ-ence in levels is probably also a reflection ofthe relatively large labour input, especiallyamong retailers.
Finally, a look at the business-related services
sector is of particular interest with regard tothe developments in returns on fixed assetsand in capital intensity. For reasons related toproduction theory, the latter quantity is calcu-lated without considering the segment offixed assets rented to third parties without anoperator. Early in the 1990s, the return oncapital in this economic sector was just under30%, significantly exceeding that in the in-dustrial and trade sectors. However, the gapin returns between the sectors has narrowedconsiderably in the past 15 years; as of late,however, the capital stock belonging to thissector was still creating a return that wasabout one-half greater than the average ofthe entire corporate sector. In the past, theserelatively large returns may have attracted in-creasing investment in the sector forbusiness-related services. The rise in capitalintensity during the period under review maybe regarded as empirical evidence of this de-velopment. The fact that capital intensity hasactually accelerated since 1999 makes itseem likely that this process, which may beregarded as structural change, has probablynot come to an end.

27reached until the (if need be, risk-adjusted)
returns on capital of all economic sectors,after deducting taxes and depreciations, haveconverged completely.
The above table lists the percentage shares of
the aforementioned sectors in corporatevalue added and fixed assets in five-yearperiods since 1991. The three sectors takentogether produced three-quarters of eco-nomic output using just over two-thirds ofthe capital stock tied up in the corporate sec-tor. While these overall ratios remained rela-tively stable during the period under review, alook at the individual sector informationshows that, during the past 15 years, the per-centage of fixed assets tied up in the indus-trial sector has gone down by nearly one-sixth to just under 40%. By contrast, pro-viders of business-related services increasedtheir share in the commercial capital stockfrom around 15% in the early 1990s to justover 20% on average during the first half ofthe current decade. However, it must benoted that, in the national accounts, mova-bles rented to users in other sectors, such asindustrial enterprises, are posted to business-related services. The increasing significance ofoperating leases is probably the main reasonbehind the notional shift in asset shares fromthe secondary sector to the tertiary sector.The weight of the industrial sector in capitaluse probably declined less sharply.
Industrial enterprises hold a volume of capital
stock that is, at the very least, nearly doublethe size of that held by business-related ser-vices providers. With regard to investment ac-tivity, the dampening influences from the pro-duction sector will thus probably have morethan compensated for the capital intensifica-tion in the tertiary sector. Therefore, the in-creased mobility of capital, fostered by theneed for higher returns on the fixed assets inthe production sector, would have caused thegrowth path of gross fixed capital formationin the entire corporate sector to flatten, whenviewed in isolation.
Results of econometric analysis
The question as to whether, and if so, how
the aforementioned structural factors have,in the aggregate, influenced domestic invest-ment can also be empirically tested in a moresystematic fashion using econometricmethods. Since the impact of penetrationwith ICT goods and intensified internationalcompetition for fixed assets can influence in-vestment in different ways, the aggregate ef-fects are difficult to isolate and identify at themacro level. Were the globalisation effect toprevail, the investment-to-GDP ratio shouldbe expected to decline. However, were theICT shock predominant, a rising trendinvestment-to-GDP ratio should be visible.
In principle, growth theory implies a constant
long-run relationship between commercial in-vestment and production. In an econometricanalysis, this theory can be considered valid ifthe time series of real gross fixed capital for-mation and real gross value added in the cor-porate sector follow a common trend suchthat their ratio, the (price-adjusted)investment-to-GDP ratio, is itself not trending

in the former West Germany between 1970
and 1990, once the west German economyhad completed the accumulation of capitalthat was characteristic of the reconstructionperiod.
13It is questionable, however, whether
this empirical outcome was still valid in thefollowing period in the light of the factors de-scribed above.
The need to use data for reunified Germany
from 1991 makes it more difficult to test thehypothesis of a stable investment-to-GDPratio during the entire observation period.However, it is not only the statistical breakcaused by the change in the territorial basisthat make the empirical analysis more diffi-cult. Account must also be taken of the factthat German economic and monetary unionsuddenly threw the east German productionsector into a competitive situation whereefficiency was of the essence and where,owing to the delayed structural change andthe previous dominance of central planning,it was often unable to survive.

29government granted generous tax breaks,
financial assistance and inexpensive loans forinvestment in the new Federal states. Thesemeasures not only promoted economic devel-opment in eastern Germany but also servedto distort the allocation of factors of produc-tion by favouring capital-intensive productionmethods in eastern Germany, for instance.
14
Thus, in connection with the integrationof eastern Germany, the share of grossfixed capital formation in gross value added– shown in the above chart using the indus-trial sector as an example – initially jumpedsharply in the first half of the 1990s. The gapbetween east and west, which then declinedbut was still visible even as late as 2003, wasprobably associated with a relatively largeamount of replacement investment due tothe relatively capital-intensive structure of theeast German industrial sector.
If the study of the long-run relationship be-
tween investment and production is extendedto cover the entire period between the firstquarter of 1970 and the third quarter of2006, econometric tests do, in fact, provideevidence of a structural break that coincidedwith reunification. The existence of an evi-dent level shift not only in the time series butalso in the long-run relationship between in-vestment and production is most likely due tothe higher investment-to-GDP ratio in theproduction structure in eastern Germany.Over and above that, though, there are hardlyany signs that the parallel movement of grossfixed capital formation and gross value addedin the corporate sector could not have con-tinued since 1991. On balance, the effects ofchanges in the structural factors seem tohave largely cancelled one another out.
Conclusion
In the past 15 years, corporate investment
has been largely exposed to disparate influ-ences. Of these, neither technological changenor global competition between productionsites seems to be predominant at present. Asthings now stand, however, it cannot be as-Price-adjusted

30sumed that the process of converging to an
optimum capital stock has been completedyet in an increasingly internationally-orientedproduction environment, especially as ICT willfurther penetrate the working environmentand return expectations engendered by glob-alisation are hardly likely to decline.
Since, by contrast, competition among pro-
duction sites both within and outside the en-larged EU will probably intensify further, itwill be possible to increase fixed asset forma-tion in Germany only if the supply conditionsare also adequate by international standardsand are regarded as sustainable. Wage mod-eration and reliability are therefore still keyconditions. Even if domestic investment ishardly able to react to changes in the usercost of capital or factor price ratios in theshort term owing to, for instance, technicalrestrictions in capital adjustment or problemsgauging the sustainability of recent develop-ments, their knock-on effects will be all themore severe over time. Moreover, capitalproductivity will also increase if the efficiencyof labour is upgraded. This is necessary notleast in the light of the fact that modern ICTis making increasingly exacting demands onlabour and that complex capital goods andhuman capital are often complementary fac-tors of production.The international competition for returns isaffecting not only financial assets but also, inincreasing measure, fixed assets. The impend-ing corporate tax reform should account forthis insight as well as for the fact that alltypes of investment – replacement, exten-sions or rationalisation – initially represent apositive decision in favour of production sitesin Germany; with a large amount of technol-ogy embodied in capital, great importanceshould be given to tax modalities regardingdepreciation allowances. This is also neces-sary given that, despite the rising share of ICTgoods, capital accumulation in machineryand equipment has remained weak through-out the period under review, thereby causingthe modernity of plant and machinery to suf-fer over the years.
Along with the intensive use of new tech-
nologies, it will also be important for Ger-many to maintain its traditional strengthseven in the production of fixed assets, withinthe framework of European and global spe-cialisation patterns. Only then will it be pos-sible to exploit the productivity effects of newtechnologies to the full. It is also an empirical-ly well-founded finding that, in this respect,the best results can be obtained in deregu-lated, highly competitive markets.

31The labour market in
Germany: general
developments seen
in an international
contextAfter several years of weak growth,
the economic upswing in Germany hasnow also reached the labour market.There is a rising demand for labourfrom enterprises, employment subjectto social security contributions is onthe increase, and unemployment isgoing down. Despite this, the labourmarket situation still poses the greatestchallenge in terms of economic policy.With this in mind, the question arisesas to whether lessons from other coun-tries can show us a way to boost em-ployment.
This article outlines some general de-
velopments in countries of the euroarea as well as in the United Kingdomand the United States. It is shown thatthe deterioration in the German pos-ition in the past ten years has beenmore relative than absolute, but hasnevertheless been considerable. Whilesome European partner countries havemade notable progress in the labourmarket, this was lacking for a longtime in Germany. One likely factor inthis was the generally rather weakpace of growth in Germany during thisperiod. It should be noted in this con-text, however, that a labour marketwhich is sufficiently flexible will by it-self generate positive stimuli for theeconomy, whereas rigidities prolongeconomic downturns.

32Comparison of labour market
performance
An economy’s labour market performance
can be assessed mainly by the degree towhich it succeeds in meeting the population’swish to find employment with an adequatenumber of suitable, competitive jobs. For aninternational comparison, initial indications ofthis are provided by the unemployment andemployment rates.
1During the period under
consideration from 1995 to 2005, a positivepattern (more people in work, fewer un-employed) is especially evident in the case ofFinland, Ireland and Spain, and to a lesser ex-tent also that of some other countries andthe euro area as a whole (see chart onpage 33). By contrast, the situation in Luxem-bourg, Portugal and Greece is characterisedby a marked improvement in the employmentsituation as well as a certain increase in un-employment along with a rising labour sup-ply. The United States and Austria are excep-tions to these two patterns. In the USA, thereduction in unemployment was accompan-ied by a slightly falling employment rate. InAustria, the unemployment rate increasedwhile the employment rate remained virtuallyunchanged. However, the two countriesshow a very similar, exceptionally positive la-bour market situation, with the USA perform-ing even somewhat better than Austria.
In terms of the unemployment and employ-
ment rates, there were only relatively minorchanges in Germany during the period underreview. Both employment and unemploymentshowed a moderate increase.
2Owing to the
marked improvement in the labour marketsituation in a number of other euro-areacountries, Germany’s relative position deteri-orated considerably, however. While the Ger-man unemployment rate in 1995 was still agood 2
1/C252percentage points below the euro-
area average, it was 1 percentage pointabove the corresponding average in 2005.Measured by the rate of employment, Ger-many was still 6
1/C252percentage points above
the euro-area average in 1995. But, in 2005,the figure was no more than 2 percentagepoints. Germany’s position also deterioratedin relation to the United Kingdom.
As the labour market situation showed the
greatest improvement in those euro-areacountries in which it had been especially un-favourable in the mid-1990s, the spread ofcountry-specific unemployment rates withinthe euro area narrowed perceptibly from be-tween 3% and 18
1/C252% in 1995 to between
41/C252% and 10% in 2005. With regard to the
employment rates, too, there was a generalrise along with a simultaneous convergence;the spread between the countries with thehighest and lowest job density declined from22 percentage points to 15
1/C252percentage
points. This strong labour market conver-gence was due to a clear divergence in em-ployment growth. While employment in Ire-land, according to the figures of the nationalaccounts, went up by no less than 55% inthe period under review – ie around 4

2The unemployment rate calculated on the basis of the

due to the statistical break from 2004 to 2005. The ad-
justed harmonised rate increased by “no more” than just

33per year – the figure for Germany as a whole
was merely 11/C252% (or1/C254% per year). In the
euro area as a whole, employment increasedjust as quickly, at 1
1/C254% annually, as in the
USA. Especially in the period following thecyclical low in the second quarter of 2003,euro-area employment growth was bolsteredby the fact that labour costs showed only amoderate rise (see explanatory notes onpages 38-39). Nevertheless, the starting pos-ition in Europe with an average unemploy-ment rate of 10
1/C252% and an employment rate
of 58% in 1995 was markedly poorer than inthe USA (5
1/C252% and 721/C252% respectively). Al-
though the differentials had narrowed by2005, they were still considerable (unemploy-ment rate 8
1/C252% compared with 5%, employ-
ment rate 631/C252% compared with 711/C252%).An analysis restricted to the number of per-
sons in work is of no more than limited in-formative value, however. For example, therelatively favourable growth in per capita em-ployment in Germany is due exclusively towhat was – even in international terms – asharp increase in jobs with reduced workinghours, in particular, the expansion of “mini-jobs” in two surges from 1997 to 1999 andfrom 2003 to 2004. This idiosyncratic effect isalso reflected in the average annual workinghours of part-time workers, which has beenfalling in Germany over the past few yearsand is now clearly below the euro-area aver-age. Furthermore, there has been a compara-tively strong increase in the percentage ofpart-time workers who would actually preferChange between 1995    and 2005    - -

34Deutsche BundesbankData and methods
For an international comparison of the situation
and development of national labour markets, alarge degree of comparability between the rele-vant data is required. For unemployment rates,there are figures conforming to the Inter-national Labour Organisation (ILO) standard.Employment data in the national accounts mustmeet the minimum requirements of the Eur-opean System of Accounts (ESA 95), which ismodelled on the System of National Accounts(SNA 1993). These data are primarily based onregular surveys of the workforce which distin-guish between those in employment, the unem-ployed and the economically inactive on thebasis of ILO criteria. A person is categorised asemployed if he or she has worked as an em-ployee or in self-employment in the reportingperiod. Those who have not been in paid em-ployment but have actively sought work andwere immediately available to the labour mar-ket in the reporting period are considered to beunemployed. The remaining persons are cate-gorised as economically inactive.
These indicators, which are based on numbers
of persons, are problematic in that employedpersons who do not work many hours may wantadditional employment. Disincentives stemmingfrom taxes, social security contributions andsocial security benefits can also lead to a reduc-tion in labour participation. Consequently, it isalso necessary to compare data on the desirednumber of working hours and actual workinghours of persons in employment.

The data underlying this report are largely con-sistent with the adjusted results of the LabourForce Surveys published by Eurostat.
2The
OECD’s LFS (Labour Force Survey) database hasalso been utilised. However, owing to variousstatistical breaks and only partially standardisedmethods of data collection, these data are notentirely comparable over time and across allcountries.
3The advantage lies in the deeper
breakdown of results.
Of the labour market indicators, the number of
persons unemployed and the corresponding un-employment rate – as a percentage of the labourforce – usually receive the greatest public atten-tion. However, a given unemployment rate maybe accompanied by high or low labour force par-ticipation, which is calculated as a quotient ofthe number of persons in the labour force andthe working age population (usually defined asthose aged from 15 to 64).

Working Paper no 575, January 2006. — 2However, owing to a differ-
ence in the reference variable, the ensuing unemployment rate for
Germany differs from the unemployment rate calculated in accord-ance with the ILO method which is published by the Federal Sta-tistical Office. The Federal Employment Agency’s unemployment rate,which is not referred to in this study, records registered unemploy-
ment and is therefore not directly comparable with the rates based
on survey findings. — 3For example, in the time series for Germany

35of persons in the labour force also depends on
the tax, social security and transfer system. Poli-cies which encourage non-participation in thelabour market could possibly keep the unem-ployment rate low owing to a reduced labourforce participation rate – through generous reg-ulations on early retirement or disability bene-fits, for example. Tax and social security contri-butions policy may also stand in the way ofgreater participation in the labour force. A com-parison of unemployment as defined herewould therefore be incomplete.
While for unemployment it is the current rate
– as an indicator of imbalance – that receives themost attention, for the employment rate it ismainly the year-on-year percentage change. Inparallel to the unemployment and labour parti-cipation rates, however, the corresponding em-ployment rate (the ratio of persons in employ-ment to the working age population) can alsobe calculated and observed over time. This com-bination, whereby both the level and the devel-opment over time are observed, particularlylends itself to international comparisons. Forexample, a robust increase in the number of em-ployed persons in a country may be due to asharp rise in the population, and the employ-ment rate may therefore remain unchanged.
Such an increase could also be the result of a suc-cessful reform in economic, labour market andsocial policy, and would then be accompaniedby an increase in the employment rate. Conver-sely, in countries that have a weak populationdynamic but have traditionally had a successfullabour market policy (low unemployment rate,high employment rate), it is highly unlikely thatthe number of persons in employment will in-crease significantly.
The year 1995 has been selected as the reference
year for the intertemporal comparison. The publi-cation of the OECD Jobs Study in 1994 had her-alded an international reorientation of labourmarket policy, aiming for deregulation of labourand product markets and a reform of socialsecurity systems. In Germany, the special effects ofreunification were also already less pronouncedin 1995 than in previous years. The data currentlyavailable from the Labour Force Surveys extendup to 2005. Alongside the countries the euro area(in its 2005 composition), the comparison also in-cludes the United Kingdom and the United States,which, in contrast to most continental Europeancountries, have less heavily regulated labour andgoods markets and a “leaner” welfare system.
there is a statistical break between 2004 and 2005 owing to an adjust-
ment to the microcensus – the German labour force survey – withthe consequence that some developments are somewhat overstated,
although trends are not seriously distorted. For the adjusted Euro-
stat series, the earlier results of the microcensus were retroactivelyadjusted on the strength of newer survey results. See M Rengers,
Die monatliche Erwerbslosenzeitreihe der ILO-Arbeitsmarktstatistik,Wirtschaft und Statistik, vol. 10/2005, pp 1049-1070. — 4In addition,
in the case of labour force participation, a distinction should be made
between general availability for work and the number of hours.

36longer paid working hours.3In this respect,
the sharp increase in jobs with a small num-
ber of working hours in Germany points tostructural problems in the labour market. Thetotal number of hours worked in the econ-omy as a comprehensive measure of labourutilisation does show a comparatively sharpdecline for Germany (-3
1/C254%) in the period
under review. According to OECD estimates,the total number of hours worked in Germa-ny’s European partner countries has, by con-trast, increased (ranging from 3
1/C254% in France
to 37% in Ireland). The figure went up by9
1/C252% in the USA and as much as 7% in the
United Kingdom.
The labour force participation rate, defined as
the percentage of the working-age popula-tion that is either actually in employment oractively seeking paid work (labour force), ex-presses – as a measure of willingness to par-ticipate in the labour force – the relative prox-imity of the population to the labour market.Nevertheless, the distinction between mem-bers of the labour force and persons outsidethe labour force invariably represents nomore than a rather blurred “snapshot”, sincea greater or smaller number of individualsmake an effort to find paid employment de-pending on the general situation in the la-bour market. Moreover, the participation ratevaries with the age structure of the popula-tion.
In all of the countries under consideration –
with the notable exceptions of the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom, where par-ticipation in the labour force has, in any case,traditionally already been much higher thanthe euro-area average – the propensity toparticipate in the labour force showed amarked increase in almost all age groups dur-ing the period under review. This means thattrend labour force participation in the euro-area countries is approaching the high USand UK rates. In Germany, the increase in la-bour force participation during this periodwas rather below average, although the par-ticipation rate had been clearly above theeuro-area average in 1995. This lead de-creased slightly in the years that followed.
The increase was particularly marked in those
countries – for example, Spain, Ireland andthe Netherlands – which recorded sharpgrowth in employment along with a simultan-eous decline in unemployment. When com-paring countries, too, there is a statisticallysignificant negative correlation between thepropensity to participate in the labour forceand the corresponding unemployment rate.Even though, given the existing mutual de-pendencies, one should guard against hastyconclusions about causalities, it is apparentthat an increasing supply of labour does notnecessarily lead to higher unemployment. Bythe same token, there is not a great deal toindicate that a policy geared to reducing thesupply of labour can be effective in combat-ing unemployment.
The flexibility of an economy’s labour market
is revealed mainly by how easily certaingroups of persons find access to paid employ-ment. In virtually all the industrial countries,prime-age males who have completed voca-

37tional training are comparatively successful in
doing so. The same now increasingly appliesto women with a continuous work history. Bycontrast, individuals entering the workforcefor the first time or wishing to re-enter it areoften faced with particular problems. At theend of a person’s working life, very generouswage substitutes – such as a more than aver-agely extended period of entitlement to un-employment benefits or early retirement pro-grammes – may create negative incentives foractive participation in working life. Wagestructures favouring seniority rather thanproductivity make enterprises inclined to letgo of senior staff when making redundancies.Persons without vocational training or whosevocational training is of diminished value areoften exposed to unstable employment rela-tionships with frequent spells of unemploy-ment. Making greater active use of this po-tential and making access to the labour mar-ket easier for these groups of persons offerthe prospect not only of boosting prosperityin general but also, in particular, of reducingfiscal burdens and coping more easily withdemographic change.
The key reason for the increase in the average
labour force participation rate, which hasbeen seen in all the countries of the euro areaover the past few years, is the greater involve-ment of women in the labour market. Theirparticipation rate rose from an average of54% in 1995 to 61
1/C252% in 2005, while, in the
case of men, there was only a slight increase,albeit starting at a significantly higher level,from 76
1/C252% to 78%. Simultaneously, there
was a certain convergence in women’s occu-pational patterns across the euro area. The in-crease in labour force participation tended to
be particularly marked in those countrieswhere it had been very weak at the beginningof the observation period. There was an espe-cially sharp increase in Spain, where only43
1/C252% of women aged between 15 and 64
had been available to the labour market in1995, whereas the figure in 2005 was58
1/C252%. In the ten-year period under review,
the propensity of women to participate in thelabour force increased somewhat more slowlyin Germany than the euro-area average butwas clearly above the mean figure in both1995 and 2005. A further rise in female la-bour market participation means that Ger-many has now largely caught up in this re-spect with the reference countries, the UnitedKingdom and the United States.Change between 1995 and 2005 - -

38Deutsche BundesbankEuro-area labour market dynamics in the current economic cycle
Following the economic upswing at the turn of the 
millennium, the euro-area economy went though an protracted period of weak growth. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased by little more than ¾ % year on year in both 2002 and 2003. Although the pace of expansion picked up in the two years which followed, it failed to exceed the potential rate. It was not until 2006 that actual output showed a noticeably sharper increase than production potential with growth of approximately just over 2½ %. The labour market also beneﬁ  ted from this, with employment likely to have 
risen by some 1¼ %. Whether – and to what extent – the 
current upswing differs from earlier recovery periods is 
to be made clear below.
Making such a comparison requires a precise dating of 
the economic cycles in the euro area. The Business Cycle 
Dating Committee of the Centre for Economic Policy 
Research (CEPR), which was set up especially for this 
purpose, has identiﬁ  ed three recessions since 1970 and 
pinpointed the ﬁ  rst quarter of 1975, the third quarter 
of 1982 and the third quarter of 1993 as cyclical low points.
1 In September 2003, the latest downturn was 
still a new phenomenon and the Committee had not yet dated its cyclical low. There is, however, much to 
suggest pinpointing it as the second quarter of 2003.
2 
The subsequent recovery is here compared with the average of the three earlier cyclical upswings identiﬁ  ed 
by the CEPR‘s Business Cycle Dating Committee.
3
This reveals that, in the past few years, real GDP has been noticeably lagging behind the ﬁ  gures for earlier 
periods of recovery. It was only during 2006 that there was a perceptible increase in the pace of growth of the 
economy as a whole. The weak upward movement in 
the years prior to this should also be seen against the 
background of the comparatively mild downturn, how-
ever. At the low point of earlier cycles, real GDP was, on average, 1 % down on the year, whereas it still showed 
an increase of ½ % between the second quarter of 2002 and the second quarter of 2003.
4
The different patterns in the numbers of persons in work are also striking. In earlier downswings, employment showed a marked decline and began to increase again slowly during the recovery only with some time lag. In the most recent cycle, however, there was virtually no recordable fall in employment in the euro area. The rise in employment did falter temporarily in the wake of the cyclical slowdown, but accelerated perceptibly from the second quarter of 2003 onwards. This means that, on the whole, the development of employment was considerably more positive than in earlier cycles.
In order to determine more precisely the reasons for 
this stronger growth in employment, a simple labour 
demand function (in terms of rates of change) is esti-
mated for an aggregate of the four largest euro-area economies over the observation period III/1980 to 
III/2006:
l
t = 0.72lt-1 + 0.18yt - 0.16wt
 (14.80) (6.89) (- 4.74)
Accordingly, the expansion rate of the number of per-
sons employed (l) depends positively on the concurrent 
percentage increase in real GDP (y) and, with a time 
lag, on itself. The rate of expansion is, however, slowed 
down by a rise in real labour costs per employee5 (w) 
in the same period.6 Given the relatively weak pace of 
growth, developments in employment in the past few 
years have therefore been supported, in particular, by 
restraint in wage increases. In actual fact, real labour 
costs per employee remained almost constant, whereas 
they had shown a distinct increase in earlier recovery 
periods.
1 In some cases, the European Commission’s Directorate General for 
Economic and Financial Affairs assumes a different dating of the eco-
nomic cycles in the euro area. See European Commission, Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, Annual Report on the Euro Area – 2006, p 7 ff and http://www.cepr.org/data/Dating/. — 2 Between 
the third quarter of 2002 and the second quarter of 2003, there was barely any change in seasonally adjusted euro-area real GDP. The Hodrick-Prescott ﬁ  lter, too, identiﬁ  es the second quarter of 2003 as the 
cyclical low point. — 3 Where available, seasonally adjusted Eurostat 
data from the national accounts for the euro area were used. However, in some cases, especially for earlier periods, our own estimates also had to be used. — 4 For this reason, it cannot be said unequivocally 
whether this was actually a recession or, rather, a marked, extended period of weak growth. It was only in the second quarter of 2003 that real GDP showed a marginal fall on the quarter. — 5 Nominal labour 
costs were adjusted using the GDP deﬂ  ator. — 6 The estimated coef-
ﬁ cients are all statistically highly signiﬁ  cant (t-values in brackets). If the 
preceding growth rate of the number of persons in work is dropped as an explanatory variable, lags of real GDP and of real labour costs per employee also become signiﬁ  cant. Their impact is summarised in the 
lagged endogenous variable. This simple relationship provides quite an accurate description of the percentage increase in the number of

39persons in work over the entire estimation period, with a good three-
quarters of its variability being explained overall. A similar regression can also be estimated for the rate of change in the total number of hours worked. — 7 ECB estimates arrive at a similar outcome. See ECB, 
Recent developments in total hours worked in the euro area, Monthly Bulletin, September 2006, pp 59-61. — 8 Upon closer inspection, the 
number of hours worked per employee fell relatively sharply during the downturns of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, whereas they more or less stood still in the ﬁ  rst few quarters of each of the recovery periods. 
This probably points to the “hoarding” of labour in a downswing, when the number of hours is reduced more sharply than the number of persons employed in order, say, to avoid redundancy costs (and, 
later, recruitment costs). At the start of the upswing, labour is then deployed more intensively. — 9 The European Commission’s Direc-
torate General for Economic and Financial Affairs has presented an econometric estimate of the demand for labour in the euro area which contains a structural break in the form of an upward level shift in the second half of the 1990s. Labour market reforms are likewise cited in explaining this break. See European Commission, Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, Quarterly Report on the Euro Area – III/2006, p 30 ff.The subdued rise in labour costs is likely to be linked to 
labour productivity, calculated here as the ratio of real GDP per employee. This stagnated in the most recent downswing, its pattern nearly completely matching that of comparable parts of prior business cycles. The robust growth in employment in this period thus pri-marily reﬂ  ects the mild cyclical slowdown. But even 
after the economy had bottomed out, the productivity 
gains achieved in the past few years – in contrast to 
earlier cycles – were no more than modest.
This development could indicate that the rise in the 
number of persons in work is due in large part to the 
increase in part-time work and marginal employment. 
In this case, the number of hours worked per employee 
ought to have shown a marked fall. According to the 
Bundesbank’s estimates of the total number of hours 
worked in the euro area, the average number of hours 
worked per employee has hardly changed in the past 
few years, however.
7 This contrasts with an almost con-
tinuous decrease in earlier cycles.8
These factors suggest that a relatively weak growth in 
hourly productivity, which cannot be explained by cyc-
lical factors alone, are behind this ﬁ  nding.
Exogenous factors may also have had an impact on the 
labour supply side. For example, in the past few years 
there has been quite a sharp inﬂ  ux of immigrants in 
some euro-area countries, particularly in Italy and 
Spain. Furthermore, labour market reforms have been 
introduced in some member states, above all, with the 
aim of increasing employment among the low-skilled. 
As a result, the overall productivity growth rate may 
have been dampened or the employment content of 
GDP growth may have been raised. However, this has 
reduced the expansion of leeway in income distribu-
tion, at least in the short term.9Indices, cyclical low = 100, seasonally adjusted, log scale

40Over the past few years, the additional supply
of female labour has been successfully inte-grated into the employment process. Al-though the average unemployment rate forwomen in the euro area was, at 10%, higherthan that for men (7
1/C252%) even in 2005, the
differential had halved compared with 1995(2
1/C252against 5 percentage points respectively).
The improvement in Germany was even moreobvious: the differential in the gender-specificunemployment rates narrowed from 5 to1
1/C252percentage points. Nevertheless, the per-
centage of women in jobs with reducedworking hours is especially high in Germany,and an increasing percentage of women inpart-time work would like to work longerhours. This contrasts with the USA where, forsome time now, there have not been anymarked differences in men’s and women’srisk of unemployment. In Austria, the UnitedKingdom and, recently, Ireland, too, the ratesfor women are, in fact, lower than those formen. By contrast, women in Greece, Franceand Italy spend more time than men lookingfor paid employment.
For young people, the transition from school
to vocational training and then into workinglife in each case poses high hurdles. Discover-ing and developing individual abilities andskills, reconciling individual wishes with theconditions of the labour market and finding afirst, suitable employer who is willing to re-cruit can sometimes be a protracted process.Accordingly, unemployment among youngpeople is typically higher than average. Incountries with a two-track vocational trainingsystem (such as Germany), it was possible fora long time to ease such transition problemsand make the entry into working life easier. In1995, the unemployment rate among under25-year-olds in Germany was, at 15%, belowthe euro-area average (23%), approximatelysame as that of the United Kingdom and onlyslightly higher than in the USA.
4Whereas
youth unemployment in the euro area hassince fallen to (what is still a high figure of)17
1/C252%, there has been no improvement in
Germany. Germany’s traditional advantage inintegrating younger persons into the labourmarket has therefore largely been lost. More-over, Germany has fallen behind the UK andUSA.
At the same time, young adults’ participation
in the labour force has gone down – from52% in 1995 to 49
1/C252% in 2005. This may be
seen as an indication of the declining import-ance of the two-track vocational system overthe medium to long term. With the sectoraltransformation and shift away from industrialproduction and crafts towards the tertiarysector, vocational training colleges ( Berufs-
fachschulen ), specialised colleges of higher
education ( Fachhochschulen ) and universities
are becoming more and more important. Alonger period of time spent in secondary andtertiary education generally also means a de-cline in younger persons’ participation in the
4OECD data – derived from the original data of the la-
bour force surveys – produces a somewhat different pic-
ture with regard to youth unemployment in Germany.
According to these data, it was still at only 8% in 1995,
but then almost doubled by 2005. The reason for the
large deviations in the 1990s is that the Eurostat series
were subsequently adjusted upwards on the basis of Fed-
eral Statistical Office calculations because more recent
surveys point to an underrecording of youth unemploy-
ment in the earlier microcensus. See Martina Rengers,

41labour force. Remarkably, the labour force
participation rate as well as the actual em-ployment rate are higher in the United King-dom and the United States – two countrieswith widespread secondary and tertiary voca-tional training – than in Germany and mostother euro-area countries. This is probablydue in part to the shorter training periods inthe UK and USA, but may also indicate thatthe low participation rate of young persons insome European countries is a reflection of thedifficult conditions in the labour market.
As at the start of working life, the labour
market policy problems also increase as theend of working life approaches. First, afterlosing a job, older persons generally find itmore difficult to find new, regular employ-ment again. Second, the social security sys-tems often generate incentives for prematureretirement from working life. Given the asso-ciated fiscal burdens and rising life expect-ancy, it will be crucial to induce more personsin the 55 to 64-year-old age group – and, inthe light of demographic developments, evenbeyond that in future – to remain active inthe labour force. Over the past few years,measures to achieve this have been initiatedin a number of countries, including Germany.As a result, the participation and employmentrates of older persons showed an increase inall the countries included in the analysis. Theincrease in the Netherlands and in Finlandwas very sharp. In Germany it was somewhatabove the euro-area average.
When analysing the age-specific unemploy-
ment rates, Germany appears to perform verypoorly in terms of the labour market situationfor older persons. Although the unemploy-
ment rate for 55 to 64-year-olds, at just over12%, has remained largely unchanged inGermany since 1995, this is clearly higherthan the current euro-area average (7
1/C252%)
and far higher than the level for the UK andUSA (both at roughly 3%). At the same time,the participation and employment rates ofolder persons in Germany, at 52% and45
1/C252% respectively, are above the euro-area
average. While there is a negative correlationbetween unemployment and employmentrates in terms of the working population aswhole, there is no similar relationship in thecase of older persons. This is probably due tothe fact that, in many countries, drawing so-cial benefits, say, in the form of a disability orearly retirement pension, represents a quitefeasible alternative to working or seeking em-Change between 1995 and 2005 - -

42Deutsche BundesbankIs the labour market situation for formally low-skilled persons
in Germany exceptionally unfavourable?
In Germany, the labour market situation for “low-skilled” 
individuals is usually regarded as being particularly  unfavourable. This would suggest that labour market 
policy should focus on this section of the population. However, the question arises as to the extent to which the statistical evidence supports this theory.
In international comparative studies, those who have 
completed no more than a level two education (ie 
lower secondary education) on the six level ISCED (Inter-national Standard Classiﬁ  cation of Education) scale are 
categorised as “low-skilled”. In Germany, this includes all persons without school-leaving certiﬁ  cates as well 
as those with school-leaving certiﬁ  cates from a lower 
secondary or intermediate secondary school or with an intermediate grammar school qualiﬁ  cation, who do not, 
however, have any vocational training or further aca-demic education. Although this purely formal criterion in itself says little about the actual skills and productivity of this group of persons, experience shows that voca-tional training or further academic education improve individuals’ chances on the labour market and their job prospects – in some cases, signiﬁ  cantly.
Indeed, according to OECD data, in 2004 the speciﬁ  c 
unemployment rate for individuals in Germany falling within this deﬁ  nition and aged from 25 to 64 was, at 
20½ %, far higher than in most other OECD countries (see chart “Unemployment of selected groups”, in main text).
2 Furthermore, a smaller proportion of this section 
of the population was in paid employment in Germany than in other countries.
How can this situation be accounted for? First, the high 
speciﬁ  c unemployment rate for those with no more 
than lower secondary school qualiﬁ  cations and no voca-
tional training could reﬂ  ect the general above average 
underemployment in Germany. This would explain the differences to countries with a successful employment policy, such as the United States. However, one would then expect that in countries with a similarly problem-atic overall labour market situation this group would be at the same risk of underemployment as in Germany.
Nevertheless, in France and Spain, two countries with 
similar overall unemployment rates to Germany, the 
 situation for low-skilled persons seems considerably 
more favourable. At 12 % and 11 %, respectively, the speciﬁ  c unemployment rates in France and Spain are 
not only signiﬁ  cantly lower than in Germany, they 
are scarcely higher than in the United States (10½ %), despite the generally poorer labour market situation in these countries.
However, the OECD data shows that while the percent-

43demonstrated using econometric methods. The picture for Germany is 
even more favourable if one considers the fact that a particularly large proportion of participants in the Labour Force Surveys in Germany donot specify their level of education. The speciﬁ  c unemployment rate 
for this group is lower than that of the “low-skilled” group, but higher than that of the group with the next level of qualiﬁ  cation.than ISCED level two in 2003 was slightly higher in Ger-
many (13 %) than in the United States (just 10 %), it was still distinctly lower than in France (30 %) or Spain (50 %). Thus, in Germany and the United States formally low-skilled persons are in a relatively small group, while in France just under a third and in Spain half of the labour force falls into this category.
This puts into perspective Germany’s unfavourable 
position in comparison with France and Spain. As it can be assumed that, in terms of labour market risk, the boundaries between the individual qualiﬁ  cation groups 
are ﬂ  uid and that there is a similar distribution of ability 
in the various countries, the group with no more than a lower secondary education is likely to include more per-sons with comparatively high productivity and a lower labour market risk in France and Spain than in Germany or the United States.
In order to establish whether the labour market situation 
for this group is particularly unfavourable in Germany, the percentage which this group accounts for in the unemployment (and employment) ﬁ  gures is compared 
with their share in the labour force aged between 25 and 64 and with the total population in this age group. This factors out the disparate overall unemployment level.
As expected, the corresponding ratios reveal that the 
relative contribution of persons with fewer formal 
 qualiﬁ  cations to overall unemployment (overall employ-
ment) is above (below) average; similarly, the expected disproportionately low increase in this contribution in the case of the proportion of formally low-skilled persons in the labour force (and the population as a whole) is conﬁ  rmed. The charts suggest that, although 
the relative contribution of those with no more than a lower secondary education and no vocational training to overall unemployment (overall employment) in Germany 
is high (low), it is not exceptional.
3
In summary, it can be seen that there is no clear empir-ical basis for the claim that the labour market situation in Germany is exceptionally unfavourable for those often categorised as “low-skilled”. While the speciﬁ  c 
unemployment rate for this group exceeds almost all 
international comparative values and the corresponding 
employment rate is lower than average, the ratio of the group to the labour force is at the same time unusually low. In addition, overall unemployment in Germany is higher than in many reference countries. If allowance is made for these two factors, a comparative analysis of different countries reveals that there is barely any indication of a particularly unfavourable situation in the low-skilled segment of the German labour market.

tries, only Finland, Ireland and Portugal ex-ceed the German rates. In the UK and USA,however, 57% and 61% of the population inthis age group respectively were in employ-ment at the end of the period under review.
The employment prospects of the lower-
skilled and the long-term unemployed areother major indicators of labour market per-formance. In collective pay bargaining, thereis a tendency to keep wages for unskilledwork high. The incentive distortions gener-ated by the social security system may alsohave a greater impact on persons who canearn no more than comparatively low wageson account of poor productivity. If periods ofunemployment last for a long time, returningto the labour market becomes more andmore difficult owing to the increasing devalu-ation of previously acquired skills.
In the case of both the unemployment rate of
“formally” low-skilled persons (defined hereusing the international standard classificationas persons aged between 25 and 64 whohave no more than a lower secondary educa-tion and do not have any vocational training)and the long-term unemployed (percentageof the unemployed who have already beenwithout work for more than one year), Ger-many compares very unfavourably with theother euro-area countries. It should be noted,however, that, according to OECD data for2003, in Germany the group of persons withno more than lower secondary education andno vocational training is – relative to theworking population – significantly smallerthan in all the other euro-area countries.

45should not then be surprising that the specific
unemployment rate in this small subgroup ishigher than in countries in which a larger partof the population is classified in this category(see the further explanatory notes onpages 42-43).
In 2005, every second person out of work in
Germany had already been unsuccessfullylooking for a job for more than one year.A similarly high percentage of long-term un-employed is to be found in Belgium, Greece,Italy and Portugal. While it has been possibleto reduce the scale of unemployment in thesecountries – with the exception of Greece –the level has increased in Germany. Thus, notonly was there a rise in the number of per-sons out of work in the ten-year period underreview, the figure also included more andmore long-term unemployed. Precisely the re-verse development took place in Ireland andSpain where the periods of unemploymentbecame shorter in parallel with the reductionin unemployment. In terms of the length ofperiods of unemployment, too, the UnitedKingdom and, above all, the United Statesperform noticeably better than the countriesof the euro area.
Institutions and reforms
Virtually all of the figures used here reveal a
better labour market performance in theUnited Kingdom and, above all, the UnitedStates than in the euro-area countries. TheUK and the USA are characterised by a lowerdensity of regulation in the labour and prod-uct markets as well as a more “frugal” socialsecurity framework. Something like “freedomof contract” applies in the UK and US labourmarkets, for instance.
5The lack of extensive
employment protection does, on the face ofit, reduce job security. However, lack of flexi-bility harbours greater risks when entering orreturning to the labour market. This probablyexplains why the specific unemploymentrates in the UK and the USA – mainly that ofolder persons, although it also applies toyounger persons – diverge less sharply fromthe general unemployment rate than inthe euro area. By contrast, more stringentunemployment protection runs the risk ofentrenching unemployment.
6
In the past few years, a number of euro-areacountries, including Germany, have reducedthe statutory employment protection of exist-ing or new employment relationships. How-ever, the reforms are geared to the regulationof “atypical” forms of employment such astemporary employment, fixed-term em-ployment or new forms of self-employment.They encourage job creation but have some
5The synthetic indicator of statutory employment pro-
tection calculated by the OECD assumes the value of 0.7
for the USA in 2003. The figure for the UK is 1.1. The
countries of the euro area range between 1.3 (Ireland)
and 3.5 (Portugal): 2.1 for Finland, 2.2 for Austria, 2.3
for the Netherlands, 2.4 for Italy, 2.5 for Belgium and
Germany, and 3.1 for Spain.
6On the poorer labour market prospects of young per-
sons, women, migrants and the long-term unemployedgiven strict employment protection regulations, see, for
example, G Bertola, F D Blau and L M Kahn, Labor Mar-
ket Institutions and Demographic Employment Patterns,
NBER Working Paper No 9043, 2002, and OECD, Em-
ployment Outlook, Paris, 2004. Furthermore, there is em-
pirical evidence that employees feel their position in the
labour market to be more uncertain if stricter employ-
ment protection is in place. A likely factor in operation
here is the perception of more difficult access and/or re-
entry into protected jobs, see A E Clark and F Postel-

46problematic side-effects. The most notable
example is that of Spain in the mid-1980swhen fixed-term contracts were largely de-controlled with general regulations on jobprotection remaining in place. Even now, des-pite certain efforts at containment, one-thirdof all employment contracts in Spain arefixed-term, which is roughly twice as much asthe euro-area average. As employment pro-tection for permanent employees is still verystrict, adjustments take place mainly in thederegulated subsector, in which workers ex-perience alternating spells of employmentand unemployment. As a result, long-termunemployment is at a comparatively lowlevel. However, those affected are exposed toa high degree of income uncertainty, andthere is underinvestment in career and firm-specific human capital.
7The growing discrepancy between the un-changed protection of traditional, unlimitedfull-time employment and the waning protec-tion as well as increasing spread of otherforms of employment have fostered a grow-ing segmentation of the labour markets,which was one of the reasons for the currentEuropean Commission consultations on themodernisation of labour law.
8In Austria,
however, it has long been possible to termin-ate employment contracts without specificgrounds provided given notice periods arecomplied with. In 2003, the obligatory cus-tomary severance payments were replaced byregular payments by employers to funds allo-cated to each employee. These funds canthen be paid out in the event of job loss. Ifnot sooner, the amounts saved in this way falldue upon retirement. The low flexibility costsare likely to be one reason why Austria’s per-formance, measured against a large numberof criteria, is not very much poorer than thatof the United Kingdom or the United States.
9
The fact that countries such as Finland, Ire-land and the Netherlands perform compara-tively well should also be seen in this context.
In the USA and the UK, both the amount and
the (maximum) duration of unemploymentbenefits as well as the basic social safety netare set at a much lower level than in most%

47euro-area countries. In the United States, wel-
fare benefits are granted only for a limitedperiod. At the same time, wage subsidiesexist in both countries: in other words, low-wage earners have their labour income sup-plemented by transfer payments – not re-duced by taxes and social security contribu-tions. How tight the social security safety netshould be and at what level and for how longunemployment benefits should be grantedare questions that give cause to reflect on avariety of factors. It should be remembered,however, that wage substitutes and the basicsocial safety net have inherent incentive ef-fects. At the individual level, being entitled todraw benefits for long periods, in particular,leads to the unemployed becoming less per-sistent in looking for a new job.
10At the
same time, there is an increase in the reserva-tion wage level – ie the level of remunerationthat a new job vacancy has to be exceed inorder to be accepted. The more generoussuch social transfers are, the more difficult itis to contain unintended side-effects of thiskind or to counteract them with other meas-ures, such as the obligation to attend trainingcourses or take part in government-assistedwork schemes. Seen in this light, it is hardlysurprising that, in euro-area countries whichhave a comparatively generous benefit sys-tem, unemployment tends to be higher andlabour force participation lower than in theUK and the USA.
Over the past few years, reform efforts in the
euro area have been geared to reconcilingthe continued existence of a large degree ofsocial security with the demands of the la-bour market. In Germany, for example, thiswas the reason why, at the second level of so-
cial security in the event of unemployment,flat benefits were introduced in place ofbenefits based on previous earnings from em-ployment.
11The new “unemployment bene-
fit II” can be understood as a kind of wagesubsidy, although the withdrawal rate ismarkedly higher than in the US and UKmodel. However, a flatter withdrawal ratewould necessitate a reduction in the basic al-lowance level if the fiscal burdens are to re-main limited. If – in contrast, say, to theUnited States – a comparatively generous,unlimited basic allowance is to be granted onhigher principles, it is then necessary to useactive measures to counter their undesirableincentive effects.

In the United Kingdom and the United States,both social security and employment protec-

ments has been established in large number of studies,

We Know?, Economic Journal, 115 (500), pp 1-27, 2005.
Nevertheless, the prolonged duration of periods of un-
employment can have the side-effect that subsequent
employment relationships last longer and yield a higher
income since the benefit recipients have more time to
find a suitable job. See R G Ehrenberg and R L Oaxaca,

49tion are rather modest by international stand-
ards. By contrast, various combinations arefound in continental Europe: comparativelyhigh unemployment benefit entitlementswith reduced employment protection (mainlyin northern Europe), very strict employmentprotection and weak social protection (mainlyin southern Europe), and a medium level ofboth employment protection and wage sub-stitutes (mainly in western and central Eur-ope). The north European model – termed“flexicurity” – has become increasingly popu-lar in recent years. The particular attraction ofthis approach lies, first, in the labour marketbeing allowed to have greater flexibility and,second, in the individual employee being pro-tected by public transfer payments against se-vere losses of income. Nevertheless, a systemof this kind depends on the recipients ofbenefits making every possible effort to findpaid work again and on the relevant pay-ments actually being claimed only in an emer-gency. This will most readily be the case ifwrongful benefit claims are regarded as un-fair. Surveys show that this is largely true ofcountries in northern Europe, but only to alimited extent of most west and central Euro-pean countries, and tends to be even less thecase in southern Europe. This means that akey requirement for implementing the flexi-curity model is lacking in these countries.
13
Even in northern Europe, however, consider-able resources have to be expended as part ofactive labour market policy in order to get theunemployed back into paid employment.
An additional feature which the USA and the
UK have in common is the existence of a gen-eral statutory minimum wage. In the coun-tries of continental Europe, on the other
hand, management and labour in many caseslay down de facto sector-specific minimumwages in pay negotiations. Besides this, thereare, however, also some – mostly quite high –statutory minimum wages. The US Federalstatutory minimum wage is only US$5.15(about 34), although some US states do,
nevertheless, set a higher minimum wage. Bycontrast, the UK minimum wage is as muchas £5.35 (roughly 38), although there are ex-
ceptions for school and college leavers andpersons re-entering the labour market. Ac-cording to OECD calculations, in 2003 theregular minimum wage in the USA and thePosition: 2004

50UK was around 33% and 45%, respectively,
of the median wage rate.14In those euro-
area countries which have a statutory min-imum wage, the figure was mostly higher (inFrance, for example, it was roughly 60% ofthe median wage, and in Belgium, Greeceand the Netherlands roughly 50%; Ireland, atnot quite 40%, and Spain, at just under 30%of the median wage, are exceptions). More-over, the minimum wages in continental Eur-ope coexist with generally more restrictiveemployment protection, which reinforces thepotentially adverse effects of minimumwages. If the minimum wage is set too high,work will not be found by persons whoseproductivity is too low to cover the labourcosts. If restrictive employment protection isadded to this, there is a deterioration in theemployment prospects of everyone who is ex-pected not to be able to perform a certain jobof work. According to the German Institutefor Economic Research (DIW), the medianwage in Germany in 2003 was 313.60 per
hour.
15A minimum wage of 37.50 per hour,
for which calls are often made, wouldamount to roughly 55% of the median wageand, compared with the otherwise customarywage rates in Germany, would therefore besignificantly higher than in the USA, the UKand most European countries.
16
Spending on active labour market policy – inother words, government measures designedto get unemployed persons (back) into work,such as vocational training schemes, trainingcourses and government job creation pro-grammes – is rather modest in both the USAand UK. According to OECD figures, their ex-penditure on such measures is less than 0.2%of GDP .
17By contrast, the figure for a number
of euro-area countries lies between3/C254% and
11/C254% (Belgium, Finland, France, Germany
and the Netherlands).18Seen in this light, it is
reasonable to ask how productive this use ofpublic resources is. A recent study on behalfof the European Commission evaluated 137analyses of the effectiveness of active labourmarket policy.
19The outcome was that taking
part in public employment programmes re-duces the probability of successful reintegra-tion into the labour market. No more thanminor positive effects were found in the caseof traditional training and reskilling measures.Assistance in job finding, sanctions for failingto demonstrate sufficient personal initiative,and wage cost subsidies – which are com-paratively expensive – performed better. To aconsiderable extent, these measures help tooffset the adverse side-effects generated byrestrictive employment protection and highwage substitutes.
14More recent data from the OECD are unavailable. The
median indicates the middle wage rate in the distribution
of individual wage rates. Precisely one-half of employed
persons receives lower wages and the other half receives
higher wages. Given an annual median wage of £11.12
in 2006 (see National Statistics, 2006 Annual Survey of
Hours and Earnings, First Release, 26 October 2006), the
UK minimum wage was latterly 48% of this reference
value.

51Summary
The economic upswing in Germany has now
also reached the labour market and – in con-trast to earlier years – with the advancing cyc-lical recovery there is also likely to be an im-provement in the labour market situation inGermany in relation to its partner countries.Germany will benefit from the fact that themany years of wage restraint has led to amarked fall in relative labour costs. The re-forms of recent years – such as the lifting ofrestrictions on the hiring out of labour – havealso reduced the adjustment costs in the la-bour market, at least in some areas. Further-more, the reservation wage has been loweredby cuts in transfer payments to the long-termunemployed. Inefficient public job creationprogrammes have been scaled down and theincentives for older persons to participate inthe labour force have been strengthened. Allof this should help to alleviate the problemsof the labour market in Germany. Despitethis, it is not to be expected that low un-employment figures similar to those in theUSA and UK or some European partner coun-tries can be achieved without further reforms.With regard to the idea of implementing suc-cessful reforms from abroad in Germany, isol-ated elements of a model that has been suc-cessful in another country as part of an over-all package cannot be adopted without tak-ing account of the interdependency involved.This applies to both minimum wages andwage subsidies.
