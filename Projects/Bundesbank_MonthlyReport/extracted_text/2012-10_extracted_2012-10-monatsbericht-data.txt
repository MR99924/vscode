Economic conditions
Underlying trends
There are growing signs that a marked expan -
sion in economic output in the third quarter of 
2012 could be followed by stagnation or even 
a slight decline in gross domestic product (GDP) 
in the final three months of the year. After sea -
sonal adjustment, there was a significant rise in 
industrial output in the holiday months of July 
and August; forgoing interruptions in produc -
tion in some automotive manufacturing plants 
played a part in this. This effect no longer ap -
plies to the final quarter. Moreover, declining 
demand for industrial goods will make itself 
felt. While industrial orders from other euro-
area countries showed no further fall after a 
massive decline in the preceding quarters, the 
expansion of demand from non-euro area 
countries came to a standstill in the wake of 
the global dip in economic activity. Surveys like -
wise reflect the gloomier outlook for exports 
and uncertainty about the prospects of the 
world economy. This setting is to be seen as 
the main reason for the recent considerable fall 
in orders of capital goods. The fact that import 
activity is quite weak in comparison with ex -
ports of goods similarly suggests that a damp -
ening of output might be in the offing. By con -
trast, economic activity continues to be bol -
stered by housing construction, which is bene -
fiting from favourable financing conditions, a 
lack of alternative investments and the height -
ened uncertainty, as well as from private con -
sumption, which remains on an expansionary 
course owing to substantial gains in real in -
come.
Industry
Seasonally adjusted industrial output in August 
was ½% down on the month, not least owing 
to an above-average number of holidays. On an average of July and August, which is only 
slightly affected by the shift in holidays, growth 
was 1½% up on the preceding three-month 
period. The fact that some automotive plants 
did not interrupt production for holidays was a 
factor in this. This is also reflected in a sharp 
increase in capital goods output (+3¼%). There 
was little change in the output of intermediate 
goods (-¼%) and consumer goods (+¾%).
German industry received significantly fewer 
orders in August than in July. Overall, the sea -
sonally adjusted volume of orders fell by 1¼% 
on the month. A major part in this was played 
by the restrained demand for capital goods at 
home (-6¾%) and abroad (excluding the aero -
space industry: other euro-area countries -6%; 
non-euro-area countries -3%). Although this 
decline may be somewhat overstated on ac -
count of a holiday effect, many enterprises in 
Germany and other countries are likely to have 
deferred investment projects in light of the 
greater uncertainty.
Compared with the average of the second 
quarter, there was an overall 1¼% fall in orders 
in July and August. This was concentrated on 
capital goods (-1½%). Intermediate goods were 
only slightly down (-½%) and orders of con -
sumer goods were unchanged. It was mainly 
domestic orders that tended to be weaker, 
while, in terms of export demand, a slight in -
crease in orders from the rest of the euro area 
(+¼%) virtually offset a decline in orders from 
non-euro-area countries (-½%).
In line with output, seasonally adjusted indus -
trial sales on an average of the months of July 
and August were 1¼% up on the preceding 
three-month period. While manufacturers of 
intermediate goods suffered slight losses, pro -
ducers of capital goods saw a 3¼% growth in 
turnover, due mainly to a rise in sales of motor 
vehicles. Sales of consumer goods went up by 
¼%. Domestic sales increased by ½% and ex -Further marked

port sales grew by 2%. The value of goods ex -
ports in August was 2½% up on the month, 
while there was no more than a slight rise in 
the value of imports despite sharp price in -
creases.
Construction
There was quite a noticeable month-on-month 
fall in construction output (-2¾%) in August in 
seasonally adjusted terms. Even so, the ele -
vated level of the second quarter was main -
tained on an average of July and August. 
Orders increased perceptibly in July (more re -
cent data are unavailable). There was a further 
fall in building construction orders, while civil 
engineering recovered from its poor showing in 
the previous month.
Labour market
Following an extended period of expansion, 
employment growth came to a virtual standstill 
in the summer months. The number of persons 
in work in Germany in August showed a sea -
sonally adjusted month-on-month increase of 
no more than 4,000. The year-on-year increase 
was as much 420,000, or 1.0%, however. 
 According to the initial estimate, July saw a 
 further quite sharp rise of 56,000 in the sea -
sonally adjusted number of employees subject 
to social security contributions. The year-on-
year rise was 546,000, or 1.9%. The number of 
short-term workers reached its lowest level in 
July but has shown a marked increase again 
since then. According to the Ifo employment 
barometer, enterprises will be more cautious in 
their deployment of personnel. This is also indi -
cated by the Federal Employment Agency’s 
BA-X job index.
The official unemployment figure went up 
again slightly to a seasonally adjusted 2.91 mil -
lion in September. Even so, the seasonally ad -
justed unemployment rate (using the Federal 
Employment Agency’s definition) remained at Marked fall in

6.8%. Underemployment, as reported by the 
Federal Employment Agency, fell again some -
what, however. While the number of persons 
registered as being out of work was approxi -
mately as high as in the previous year, under -
employment was 174,000 down on the year. 
This coincided with a cutback in labour market 
policy measures. The seasonally adjusted num -
ber of jobless persons claiming insurance bene -
fits went up slightly, while the slight downward 
trend in longer-term job seekers receiving the 
basic welfare continued.
Prices
The price for a barrel of Brent crude oil rose 
only moderately in September and, at US$113, 
was ¾% up on the average for August. Owing 
to weak global economic activity and high in -
ventory levels, prices began to ease somewhat 
for a time. As this report went to press, the 
price was US$112½. Crude oil futures were still 
being quoted at marked discounts: US$2½ for 
deliveries six months ahead and US$5½ 12 
months ahead.
Owing to higher energy prices, the overall cost 
of imports went up by a seasonally adjusted 
1.1% on the month in August. If energy is ex -
cluded, there was a slight 0.1% fall on the 
month. Domestic producer prices went up by 
1.0% overall between July and September, with 
energy prices going up by 2.3% and the prices 
of other industrial goods rising 0.3%. The year-
on-year figures for import prices and producer 
prices went up to 3.2% and 1.7% respectively.
There was a steep seasonally adjusted month-
on-month rise in consumer prices of 0.4% in 
August, which was followed by a further 
marked increase of 0.3% in September. The fall 
in the annual rate of inflation from 2.1% in Au -
gust to 2.0% in September according to the 
national Consumer Price Index (CPI) and from 
2.2% to 2.1% according to the Harmonised 
Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) was due solely 
to the fact that the price trend was similarly unfavourable in the same period of 2011. En -
ergy was the main reason for the surge in 
prices in August and September. The rise in the 
prices of other goods and of services was much 
more subdued.
Public finances1
Local government finances
According to the latest cash data from the Fed -
eral Statistical Office, local government2 re-
corded a surplus of almost €2 billion in the 
second quarter of 2012, compared with close 
to €1 billion one year previously. Revenue rose 
by 2½% (or €1 billion). Following weaker 
growth in the first quarter of 2012, tax revenue 
expanded faster (+8%, or €1½ billion). The rise 
was largely due to the favourable development 
of local business tax (+11%, or €1 billion, after 
deduction of the revenue shares accruing to 
other government levels). But local govern -
ment’s share in income tax also recorded con -
siderable growth (+8½%, or €½ billion). Gen -
eral grants from state government increased by 
4% (just under €½ billion), although this was 
more than offset by the decline in investment 
grants (by just over one-quarter) following the 
phasing out of payments from the Investment 
and Repayment Fund. The expenditure allo -
cated to the second quarter was up by less 
than ½% on the year. Personnel expenditure 
increased significantly (by 4½%, or €½ billion) 
as the pay rise of 3.5% negotiated in March 
entered into force. However, there was virtually 
no change in the volume of other operating ex -International

1 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Reports (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
the development of public finances during the preceding 
quarter. For detailed data on budgetary developments and 
public debt, see the statistical section of this report.
2 Core budgets plus off-budget entities which belong to 
the general government sector. In 2011, the Federal Statis -
tical Office’s reporting population was extended to include 
these outsourced entities. This change means that, in prin -
ciple, marked distortions in the data, which had previously 
arisen as a result of organisational reforms, can be avoided.

penditure, and the budgetary burdens arising 
from social benefits grew only very moderately 
overall (by ½%), owing to the sharp decline in 
expenditure on accommodation for the 
long-term unemployed. Real investment fell 
substantially on balance. The expiry of the 
2009 economic stimulus programmes resulted 
in a decline of 15½% (almost €1 billion).
Given the significant growth in local govern -
ment tax revenue and current grants, if the 
moderate growth in spending continues, the 
aggregate deficit of almost €3 billion recorded 
in 2011 might even be completely cancelled 
out. Nevertheless, in those federal states in 
which relatively large local government deficits 
have regularly been posted in recent years, in 
particular in Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, 
Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, it is likely 
that the high deficits will persist.
At the end of June, local government’s credit 
market debt (€85 billion) was only slightly below the figure recorded at the end of March, 
in spite of the marked surplus. The volume of 
cash advances outstanding stagnated at €48 
billion. While many federal states reported 
small declines, North Rhine-Westphalia posted 
a further increase in local government cash ad -
vances in the amount of €½ billion. At €24½ 
billion, this source of financing, which is actu -
ally only intended to bridge short-term liquidity 
shortfalls, was almost on a par with the level of 
regular credit market debt there (€25½ billion). 
The four above-mentioned federal states with 
high local government deficits each recorded 
cash advances of more than €1,100 per inhab -
itant. Moreover, compared with the average 
figure of €80 for the other eight non-city 
states, the level of €650 recorded by local gov -
ernments in Lower Saxony indicates that this 
federal state also has a clear problem, even 
though it recently recorded a significant decline 
in the deficit.
Securities markets
Bond market
In August 2012, the issue volume in the Ger -
man bond market stood at €97.7 billion in 
gross terms, down on the previous month’s fig -
ure (€141.8 billion). After deducting redemp -
tions, which also decreased, and taking ac -
count of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own bonds, the volume of outstanding domes -
tic bonds increased by €2.2 billion, compared 
with €15.3 billion in July. Foreign debt securities 
worth €2.4 billion were sold on the German 
bond market; these sales were exclusively ac -
counted for by euro-denominated debt secur -
ities. On balance, the outstanding volume of 
bonds in Germany rose by €4.6 billion.
In the reporting month, the public sector raised 
€11.3 billion in the capital market. This was 
largely attributable to central government 
(€10.5 billion), which, on balance, sold mainly 
two-year Schätze (€5.2 billion) and five-year 
Bobls (€4.1 billion). By contrast, it was largely Deficit could be

thirty-year Bunds (€1.1 billion net) that were re -
deemed. In the month under review, the state 
governments tapped the capital market for 
€0.8 billion net.
In August, domestic enterprises redeemed 
bonds totalling €3.7 billion, compared with a 
net issuance of €3.2 billion in July. The majority 
of redemptions concerned bonds and notes 
with maturities of more than one year.
German credit institutions reduced their capital 
market debt by €5.4 billion in the reporting 
month. This included redemptions of debt se -
curities issued by specialised credit institutions 
(€3.8 billion net) and public Pfandbriefe (€2.6 
billion net). By contrast, net issuance of mort -
gage Pfandbriefe amounted to €1.3 billion.
Foreign investors were the main net buyers on 
the German bond market in August, adding 
debt securities with a total value of €5.7 billion 
to their portfolios. Domestic credit institutions 
likewise purchased bonds amounting to €2.9 
billion net, whereas German non-banks sold 
debt securities with a net value of €3.4 billion.
Equity market
In the month under review, domestic enter -
prises, most of which were non-listed com -
panies, issued €0.1 billion worth of new shares 
on the German equity market. At the same 
time, the amount of foreign shares outstanding 
on the German market decreased by €2.6 bil -
lion. Resident credit institutions were the sole 
purchasers of equities in net terms (€2.1 bil -
lion). By contrast, non-banks and foreign in -
vestors sold shares on balance (€4.5 billion and 
€0.1 billion respectively).
Mutual funds
German mutual funds recorded a net inflow of 
€3.1 billion in August (July: inflow of €15.0 bil -
lion). The sole beneficiaries were specialised funds reserved for institutional investors, while 
funds open to the general public saw outflows 
of €0.9 billion. Of the funds open to the gen -
eral public, predominantly mixed funds (€0.5 
billion), equity funds (€0.3 billion) and money 
market funds (€0.2 billion) repurchased shares. 
During the reporting month, foreign funds 
traded in the German market sold share units 
to the tune of €3.0 billion. Residents were the 
sole purchasers of mutual fund shares on bal -
ance (€6.8 billion), with the vast majority (€6.4 
billion) being bought by domestic non-banks. 
By contrast, non-resident investors sold mutual 
fund shares in the amount of €0.8 billion.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus – in unadjusted terms – of €11.1 billion in 
August 2012. The result was €0.5 billion down 
on the level of the previous month. This was

and a larger deficit on invisible current transac -
tions, which comprise services, income and 
current transfers.
According to provisional figures released by the 
Federal Statistical Office, in August the foreign 
trade surplus went down by €0.6 billion on the 
month to €16.3 billion. However, after adjust -
ment for seasonal and calendar variations, it 
rose by €2.0 billion to €18.3 billion. This was 
because the increase in the value of exports, at 
2.4%, was considerably greater than the 0.3% 
rise in the value of imports. In seasonally ad -
justed terms, nominal exports and imports dur -
ing the July-August period were 2.0% and 
0.7% above the second-quarter average re -
spectively. Price effects, both in terms of rev -
enue and expenditure, played only a minor 
role.
In August, the deficit on invisible current trans -
actions expanded from its previous level of 
€2.3 billion to stand at €2.6 billion. The larger 
deficit in current transfers contributed to this 
outcome. At €3.5 billion during the reporting 
period, it was up on the month by €1.0 billion, 
largely as a result of an increase in net pay -
ments by the public sector to international in -
stitutions. Cross-border income also deterior -
ated inasmuch as it recorded a slight decline in 
surplus by €0.3 billion to €4.8 billion. By con -
trast, the deficit in the services sub-account 
was down on the month by €1.0 billion, result -
ing in a deficit of €3.9 billion. This was mainly 
attributable to higher net income from financial 
services.
Given the slight easing of tensions on the inter -
national financial markets, cross-border port -
folio investment again generated net capital 
exports in August. However, at €0.6 billion, 
they were less substantial than in July. These 
outflows of funds were mainly due to the con -
tinued activity of German investors as net 
buyers of foreign securities (€5.3 billion). 
Among other areas of focus, German investors 
increased their holdings of mutual fund shares 
(€3.0 billion). Parallel to this, they acquired Exports rise

debt securities to the tune of €2.4 billion, of 
which €1.8 billion was accounted for by bonds 
and notes and €0.6 billion by money market 
paper. Foreign investors purchased German 
 securities amounting to €4.7 billion net in 
 August. They added €5.7 billion worth of debt 
securities to their portfolios and disposed of 
mutual fund shares and shares in the amount 
of €0.8 billion and €0.2 billion respectively.
Direct investment likewise generated net cap -
ital ouflows (€4.4 billion) in the month of Au -
gust. This can be attributed to the fact that for -
eign firms withdrew funds from their German 
affiliates (€7.6 billion). On balance, this oc -
curred exclusively in the form of intra-group 
credit transactions (€8.5 billion), primarily in 
the form of financial loans (€6.2 billion). Ger -
man direct investors also scaled back their for -
eign investment activity, by €3.3 billion. The 
credit relationships between affiliated enter -
prises (€7.2 billion) played a decisive role here, 
too, while capital interests were expanded 
(€2.8 billion).Other statistically recorded investment, com -
prising financial and trade credits (where these 
are not allocated to direct investment) as well 
as bank deposits and other assets, saw net cap -
ital exports of €11.1 billion in August. Non-
banks recorded net outflows (€5.9 billion), 
largely on account of the operations of general 
government which recorded capital exports 
(€9.7 billion), whereas the activities of enter -
prises and households resulted in capital im -
ports (€3.8 billion). The banking system also 
experienced outflows (€5.2 billion). Net capital 
imports of €19.2 billion on the part of credit 
institutions were outweighed by the Bundes -
bank’s net capital exports (€24.4 billion). A fur -
ther increase in claims within the TARGET2 
large-value payment system played a major 
role in this development.

The financial crisis and balance of payments 
developments within the euro area
Some euro-area countries built up considerable and persistent current account deficits prior to 
the financial crisis. Their external debt consequently rose substantially, causing a significant 
increase in lenders’ funding risks. The financial crisis highlighted these imbalances and risks. Mat -
ters were made worse by negative feedback effects between the problems facing government 
budgets and the risks confronting national banking systems, which caused private investors to 
question the sustainability of these countries’ overall external debt position. As a result, private 
capital inflows no longer suffice to offset their (albeit contracting) current account deficits. It fol -
lows that these countries are experiencing not just a loss of confidence in their public finances but 
also severe balance of payments difficulties.
Prior to the launch of the euro, many experts underrated the likelihood of such balance of pay -
ments risks in the euro area as well as their repercussions. Moreover, the crisis has shown that the 
usual adjustment mechanisms for external imbalances are slower to take effect within the Euro -
pean monetary union than in other exchange rate regimes. One reason for this, as confirmed by 
empirical studies carried out by the Bundesbank, is that, in a monetary union, not only are the 
exchange rates between member states fixed, but the adjustment process is cushioned and pro -
tracted by the single monetary policy through harmonised short-term interest rates and liquidity 
assistance measures.
This prevents an overly abrupt macroeconomic adjustment process and the considerable knock-on 
costs that this would have on the real economy and the financial systems of the affected coun -
tries. But as this weakens market-driven adjustment processes, it is crucial to put in place eco -
nomic and fiscal policy coordination and conditionality so as to underpin the macroeconomic 
adjustment processes needed to help create sustainable external positions within the single cur -
rency area. In addition, the risk premiums reflected in the interest rates should not be completely 
levelled out. This requires both appropriate regulation and heightened risk awareness on the part 
of market participants, especially if – as in the euro area – the institutional and legal framework 
is still built mainly around national competencies.
At the same time, a weakened adjustment mechanism in the euro area imposes more exacting 
demands on member states’ homogeneity. The newly implemented macroeconomic imbalance 
procedure in the EU and the Fiscal Compact are steps in the right direction. However, it remains 
to be seen to what extent this will help to quickly detect and rectify undesirable developments in 
future.Deutsche Bundesbank

The single currency does  
not preclude cross-border 
 financing constraints
The first few years of the new millennium lead -
ing up to the international financial crisis in 
2007 and 2008 saw an enormous accumula -
tion of external imbalances both globally and 
within the euro area, where there was a clear 
divergence between states with persistent and 
increasing current account deficits and the 
“surplus countries”. As a result, the “deficit 
countries” built up ever-larger external liabil -
ities.
However, large external liabilities, especially 
when they are funded through short-term fi -
nancing, can worsen existing national dysfunc -
tions and vulnerabilities. This is exactly what 
happened to peripheral euro-area countries 
during the current sovereign debt crisis: they 
could no longer finance their current account 
through private inflows. They had to adjust 
their external imbalance through public funds.1
The funding gaps that appeared were a reflec -
tion of the international financial markets’ 
growing scepticism about the sustainability of 
the accrued liabilities to other countries and 
– connected with this – the state of the banks 
in the countries affected by the crisis. In add -
ition, the countries concerned experienced 
negative feedback effects between the prob -
lems in public finances and in the banking sys -
tem. These feedback effects affected each crisis 
country differently depending on the specific 
situation. In Ireland and Spain, the stress in the 
national banking system triggered by correc -
tions on the real estate markets strained the 
government sector’s solvency, while in Greece, 
the sovereign solvency crisis led to the subse -
quent national banking crisis. These differences 
aside, however, the interdependencies exacer -
bated national problems and contributed sig -
nificantly to the sudden reversal in private cap -
ital flows. The current crisis therefore extends 
beyond the narrower fiscal issue of debt to in -clude problematic developments in the balance 
of payments of some euro-area countries.
Balance of payments deficits that change the 
public external position by reducing foreign re -
serves or increasing liabilities to foreign govern -
ment or supranational institutions can only be 
sustained for a time. According to Milesi-
Ferretti and Razin’s definition of current ac -
count deficit sustainability (1996), such a crisis 
is defined as a situation which requires a drastic 
economic policy shift in order to maintain the 
ability to service the foreign obligations within 
the existing currency regime.2
The possibility of national balance of payments 
crises occurring in the euro area was largely 
disregarded in economic policy discussions 
prior to the current crisis. Because it was be -
lieved that individual countries would no longer 
experience funding shortages after exchange 
rate risk had been eliminated, it was long 
deemed unnecessary even to analyse national 
balances of payments. It was thought that a 
single currency area would prevent balance of 
payments crises from occurring in individual 
member states.3Accumulation

1 As is usual in economic literature, private capital flows 
here include all cross-border financial flows that do not in -
volve transactions between a domestic and foreign central 
bank (eg foreign reserves, TARGET2 balances) or inter -
national assistance programmes. However, this does not 
exclude the involvement of government entities.
2 The term current account sustainability refers to an as -
sessment of “whether a continuation of the current policy 
stance is going to require a ‘drastic’ policy shift (such as a 
sudden tightening of monetary and fiscal policy, causing a 
large recession) or lead to a crisis (such as an exchange rate 
collapse, resulting in an inability to service external obliga -
tions)”. See G M Milesi-Ferretti and A Razin (1996), Cur -

This theory proved incorrect.4 Essentially, bal -
ance of payments crises can occur whether or 
not an economy is part of a single currency 
area. Although the balance of payments is an 
ex post  accounting record, from an economic 
perspective it expresses an important budget 
constraint: deficits need to be financed. If they 
can no longer be financed, or only with diffi -
culty, adjustments must be made. This budget 
constraint also applies to the members of a 
monetary union, although they face the extra 
restriction that they are unable to use the ex -
change rate or national monetary policy to 
make these adjustments. Furthermore, the cur -
rent crisis has shown that national imbalances 
can create significant contagion effects in a 
monetary union.
The build-up of intra-
European current account 
imbalances in the euro area
In the early stages of European economic and 
monetary union, interest rates in the member 
states converged at a low level following the 
elimination of exchange rate risk. From the per -
spective of deeper financial market integration, 
this was desirable in principle. At the same 
time, however, the favourable financing condi -
tions in the peripheral countries stimulated do -
mestic demand. A procyclical real interest rate 
effect then ensued. Above-average price in -
creases for non-tradeable goods made invest -
ment in this area appear particularly attractive, 
to the detriment of exports. These economies 
also received large foreign private capital in -
flows over an extended period. The real estate 
sector boom associated with the capital flows 
further fuelled domestic demand in various 
countries by creating a positive wealth effect.
The dampening export momentum on the back 
of deteriorating price competitiveness did not 
suffice to significantly affect wage develop -
ments in the countries concerned and trigger 
an adjustment process. These contrasting ex -
ternal developments therefore constantly widened the existing macroeconomic diver -
gences between the euro-area member states 
in the run-up to the financial crisis, which re -
sulted in considerable and persistent current 
account imbalances in the euro area.5
Current account surpluses in Germany, Austria, 
Denmark, Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands 
and Luxembourg, for example, have risen fairly 
continuously since the turn of the millennium. 
In 2007, Germany’s current account surplus 
peaked at nearly 7½% of gross domestic prod -

count positions of the remaining euro-area 
countries showed growing deficits in some 
cases. Most notably, the peripheral countries 
Spain, Portugal and Greece recorded deficits of 
10%, 12½% and 15% of GDP in 2007 or 2008.
For a long time, persistent surpluses and def -
icits in national current accounts were inter -
preted as a normal side-effect of a rapid and 
successful catching-up process in the periph -
eral countries of southern Europe. However, 
the fast and excessive increase in private de -
mand in the years leading up to the financial 
crisis was not fully warranted by the conver -
gence process. The often inefficient use of cap -
ital inflows, the emergence of capital market or 
real estate market price bubbles and the extra -
ordinarily large credit growth were not taken 
seriously enough as warning signs, nor were 
they reflected in rising interest rate spreads.6
High ratios of net external liabilities to GDP in 
Greece (86%), Ireland (103%), Portugal (110%) 
and Spain (94%) at the end of 2009 indicated 
considerable vulnerability to a withdrawal of 
foreign investment. External liabilities in the 
form of debt represent a particular risk because 
they create specific payment obligations and 
an acute requirement for funding due to the 
need to refinance maturing loans as well as to pay consistently high interest to the rest of the 
world.7
Change in risk perception 
after the onset of the 
 financial crisis
As the financial crisis spread across Europe, 
confidence that the convergence process could 
continue permanently and without setbacks 
began to falter. As a consequence, the ability 
of some euro-area countries to sustain their ex -
ternal debt levels was increasingly called into 
question. Funding from private sources was 
harder to obtain and the terms were less fa -
vourable.
After the collapse of Lehman Brothers in Sep -
tember 2008, non-euro-area EU member 
states, primarily those with fixed exchange 
rates, were the first to face significant capital 
outflows, which forced them to suddenly ad -
just their current account balances. At the time, 
international investors still saw the euro area as 
a haven of stability, so that even member states 
with considerable current account deficits ini -
tially remained protected from abrupt reversals 
in cross-border private capital flows.
However, risk perception of exposure to euro-
area countries changed dramatically following 
the onset of the sovereign debt crisis. The per -
ipheral euro-area countries experienced a turn -Current account

7 In cross-country comparisons of gross external liabilities it 
should be noted, however, that this number depends heav -
ily on the particular economic structure. At the end of 
2011, for example, Ireland, where the financial sector con -
tinues to play an important role, reported a debt ratio of 
over 1,000% of GDP , a far higher figure than Greece,

around in private gross capital flows as they 
lost international investors’ confidence. On bal -
ance, foreign private lenders divested from the 
euro-area countries hit hardest by the current 
debt crisis. A significant share of the funds 
flowed out through the national banking sys -
tems.8 Instead of private capital inflows, some 
countries with current account deficits (such as 
Greece, Portugal, Spain or Italy) even recorded 
private net capital exports on balance.
In absolute terms, the largest capital outflows 
took place in Spain and Italy, where private in -
vestors withdrew a total of €307 billion and 
€211 billion net respectively between the start 
of 2011 and the end of the second quarter of 
2012. In addition, these countries had cumula -
tive current account deficits of €50 billion and 
€66 billion.9 In Greece and Portugal too, how -
ever, private net capital exports were signifi -
cantly higher than the financing shortage aris -
ing from these countries’ current account def -
icits.
Financial assistance and 
 additional bank funding 
through the Eurosystem 
 replace  private payment 
flows
Increasing outflows of private capital meant 
that, despite shrinking current account deficits, 
some euro-area countries were no longer able 
to balance private cross-border payment trans -
actions without outside help.
Alongside extensive international financial as -
sistance in the form of bilateral loans and EFSF/
IMF adjustment programmes, the Eurosystem’s 
single monetary policy in particular eased na -
tional funding shortages by introducing a broad 
range of liquidity policy measures from which 
these countries benefited especially.10 Growing 
mistrust between credit institutions meant that 
many commercial banks in the crisis countries 
found it difficult or impossible to refinance 
themselves on the interbank market. Deposit withdrawals and difficulties in refinancing ma -
turing bonds also had an negative impact on 
the liabilities side of some banks’ balance 
sheets. As a result, the countries which were 
hit hardest by the financial crisis and which had 
the most vulnerable banking sectors increased 
their refinancing operations with their national 
central banks. A large percentage of

8 From the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2012, 
the exchange-rate-adjusted decrease in the external liabil -
ities of Irish commercial banks totalled over €100 billion. In 
Spain, the cumulative outflows from the banks’ balance 
sheets to the rest of the world reached just under €50 bil -
lion. In both Portugal and Italy, this figure was almost €30 
billion. Foreign investors also withdrew over €20 billion 
from the Greek banking system during this period, al -
though the sovereign debt crisis had already taken hold 
there in spring 2010.

10 In May 2010, Greece was granted bilateral assistance 
initially amounting to €80 billion from individual euro-area 
countries, plus a further €30 billion contributed by the IMF. 
This first support package was replaced by a second pack -
age in May 2012, which is intended to provide a further 
€130 billion of external payments by 2014. In addition, the 
EU provided various support measures associated with the 
haircut on Greek bonds in March 2012. In November 2010, 
Ireland received a three-year international support package 
which included external financial assistance totalling €67.5 
billion. In April 2011, Portugal applied for external assis -
tance. Like the package for Ireland, the assistance pro -
gramme granted to Portugal by the EU and IMF in May is 
intended to last three years and will provide financial as -
sistance amounting to €78 billion. In each country, the re -
form measures agreed and actually taken are reviewed by

capital transactions was therefore financed by 
Eurosystem funds.
The growing substitution of private cross-border 
payment flows by Eurosystem funds is reflected 
in developments in national TARGET2 bal -
ances.11 Spain has recorded the sharpest rise in 
corresponding liabilities to the ECB since the 
beginning of 2011. On 31  August 2012, its 
TARGET2 liabilities stood at €434 billion com -
pared with €51 billion on 31 December 2010. 
At the end of December 2010, Banca d’Italia 
even reported a small surplus of €3 billion, but 
this became a negative figure of €289 billion 
over the next 20 months. The TARGET2 bal -
ances of the programme countries of Greece 
(€108 billion), Ireland (over €90 billion) and 
Portugal (72 billion) were still extremely nega -
tive at the end of August 2012, too.
By contrast, some national central banks have 
significant and constantly growing claims on 
the ECB. On 31 August 2012, Germany had the 
highest TARGET2 claims, at €751 billion. How -
ever, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Finland 
also reported high positive TARGET2 balances.
The massive expansion of TARGET2 balances is 
the result, on the one hand, of private financial 
flows drying up and, on the other, of monetary 
policy easing and the raft of non-standard monetary policy measures introduced by the 
Eurosystem during the financial crisis, such as 
full allotment in refinancing operations since 
October 2008 or the broadening of the range 
of eligible collateral. The emergency liquidity 
assistance (ELA) facility also allows individual 
central banks, on their own account, to provide 
commercial banks with additional liquidity in 
the event of severe payment squeezes. How -
ever, cause and effect should not be confused 
when interpreting these developments. The 
TARGET2 balances are the result of the factors 
described in the context of a monetary policy 
that is implemented locally by the Eurosystem’s 
national banks. They are not an independent 
source of primary risk in the European monet -
ary union. Risks arise from the provision of li -
quidity itself, not from its subsequent regional 
distribution via the TARGET2 payment system.
In total, the wide-ranging support measures of 
the EU and the IMF, together with the Eurosys -
tem’s non-standard monetary policy measures, 
have reduced the intensity of the crisis-related 
adjustment process in the affected countries 
and the euro area as a whole, thus providing 
some breathing space. However, they can only 
lastingly boost confidence in the functioning of 
the euro area if they remain temporary and are Sharp rise in

isms in the member states. This can be illus -
trated by comparing the main adjustment 
channels used in various monetary policy re -
gimes.
Thus the adjustment of external imbalances in 
a monetary union is fundamentally different 
from the correction mechanism in a fixed ex -
change rate regime. This is due in particular to 
the fact that the common monetary policy in a 
monetary union is oriented to developments in 
the currency area as a whole. This rules out a 
regionally diverse monetary policy that reacts 
singly to specific developments in individual 
parts of the common currency area. The situ -
ation is different in a fixed exchange rate re -
gime. Although in this case, too, assuming free 
movement of capital and ongoing price stabil -
ity in terms of the anchor currency, the national 
central bank cannot freely determine national 
monetary policy (the “impossible trinity”),12 in 
the event of an imbalance on the foreign ex -
change market, it can, at least in the short 
term, choose between directly intervening by purchasing or selling foreign currency or influ -
encing private capital flows by lowering or rais -
ing its key interest rate.
In a fixed exchange rate regime, both these 
measures lead to a squeeze in the domestic 
money supply and therefore in credit demand, 
which ultimately impacts on the demand for 
goods and services in the real economy. In the 
long term, international competitiveness is re -
stored through the reduction in relative prices 
and wages that this imposes. The economy 
therefore has to live with the consequences of 
this exchange rate-oriented monetary policy. 
However, the accompanying domestic eco -
nomic contraction has a stabilising effect on 
the balance of payments, which means that it 
helps to reduce existing imbalances.
A central bank can temporarily sterilise the 
monetary policy consequences of a fixed ex -
change rate regime through expansionary 
lending to the domestic banking sector if the 
aim is to counterbalance temporary fluctu -
ations and cushion the real economy from un -
wanted effects. But because sterilisation neu -
tralises the rise in interest rates needed for do -
mestic corrections, there is a delay in reducing 
the external imbalance. However, the central 
bank cannot equalise persistent excess demand 
for foreign currency at the prevailing exchange 
rate in the long term because its foreign re -
serve holdings are finite. Sterilisation is there -
fore only a short-term option. In the long term, 
an increase in short-term interest rates for fun -
damental reasons is unavoidable. Therefore, in 
a fixed exchange rate regime, the money sup -
ply develops endogenously, as a function of the 
fixed exchange rate target.Adjustment pro-

12 Because of interactions between interest rates and ex -
change rates (interest rate parity), it is not possible to sim -
ultaneously keep the exchange rate stable, pursue an inde -
pendent monetary policy and allow cross-border financial 
flows to fluctuate freely. See M Fleming (1962), Domestic 
financial policies under fixed and floating exchange rates,

By contrast, the member states of a monetary 
union share a common key interest rate, re -
gardless of whether their private balance of 
payments transactions currently show a surplus 
or a deficit. At the same time, the national 
stock of money in circulation in an individual 
deficit country is not generally reduced to the 
same extent as private net capital outflows. In-
stead, if they have sufficient collateral, com -
mercial banks can cover their existing financing 
needs via greater refinancing from the central 
bank. Interest rate effects, as are expected in a 
fixed exchange rate regime, are therefore 
largely eliminated at the short end of the yield 
curve. As a result, there is less monetary policy 
pressure to adapt prices. In this respect, the ad -
justment process of balance of payments im -
balances within the euro area is similar to the 
mechanism of a country with a fixed exchange 
rate regime and a sterilising monetary policy. In 
this case, the single currency acts as an auto -
matic stabiliser.
Furthermore, the single monetary policy not 
only causes a convergence of short-term inter -
est rates but also tends to narrow the spread at 
the long end. This was clearly evident in the 
bunching of interest rates in the run-up to the 
crisis, which was magnified by the financial 
markets’ scepticism regarding the strict en -
forcement of the EU Treaty’s no bail-out clause. 
Even in the event of a country-specific deterior -
ation in banks’ financing conditions, the impact 
on the balance of payments is initially more 
limited than in other currency regimes because 
commercial banks can resort to Eurosystem li -
quidity operations at a standard interest rate if they find it significantly more expensive to ob -
tain finance on the capital market.
The connection between domestic financing 
conditions and global developments was also 
weakened in the run-up to the recent crisis. As previously mentioned, for a long time the mon -
etary union evidently functioned as a kind of 
firewall which prevented country-specific finan -
cing terms from directly mirroring develop -
ments in global stress factors. For example, the correlation between the volatility index VIX S&P 
500, which measures global financial market tensions, and national credit default swap 
(CDS) spreads was significantly higher outside 
than inside the euro area.13 The weaker re -
sponse of country-specific risk perception in 
the euro area to global developments ultim -
ately helped to prevent the emergence of a 
suitable risk pricing system in the euro area as 
an early warning system and a timely adjust -
ment mechanism. However, this is due less to 
the euro area’s operating framework and more 
to the financial markets’ failure to adequately 
recognise mounting imbalances and to price in 
these risks sufficiently as they developed.
The sudden re-evaluation of risk during the cri -
sis and the subsequent reversals of private cap -
ital flows have meanwhile triggered consider -
able macroeconomic adjustments, accompan -
ied by severe recessions and high levels of 
 unemployment in the countries affected. How -
ever, the stabilising function of the single mon-
etary policy has been evident even during the 
crisis. It significantly mitigates the adjustment 
process through low short-term interest rates 
and monetary policy support measures. On the 
other hand, the Eurosystem’s balance sheet 
risks have increased. This highlights the conflict 
between the common monetary policy and the 
primacy of national autonomy for euro-area 
member countries established in the current 
legal framework. The more effectively monet -
ary policy measures support the financial sys -
tems of the crisis countries, the more risks are 
transferred to the Eurosystem’s balance sheet 
and, ultimately, redistributed among taxpayers 
in the member states as a whole. The resulting 
tensions become acute, at the latest, when 
monetary policy measures are specifically tar -Adjustment

geted at alleviating the difficult situation in 
countries affected by the crisis. Although this 
may be justified on the grounds of ensuring fi -
nancial stability or upholding the smooth trans -
mission of the single monetary policy, monet -
ary policy thereby takes on a stabilising role 
which is clearly a fiscal policy task in a monet -
ary union of sovereign member states. This risk 
transfer is consequently substituting support 
measures that really should be taken by polit -
ical entities equipped with a democratic man -
date to do so.
Empirical evidence confirms 
weakened balance  
of  payments adjustment  
in euro area
Econometric studies carried out by the Bundes -
bank support the hypothesis that the balance 
of payments adjustment in the euro area is de -
termined by different factors than in other cur -
rency regimes. The study examines the adjust -
ment of current account balances. The advan -
tage of this approach compared with looking 
at the overall private balance of payments pos -
ition is that floating exchange rate regimes, in 
which the balance of payments is by definition 
in equilibrium, can be included in the dataset. 
In addition, the financial account shows ex -
tremely high levels of volatility, which creates 
difficulties in the estimations, particularly where 
longer-term interactions are concerned.14
Moreover, balance of payments crises predom -
inantly occur when current account deficits 
exist. Ultimately, the considerable build-up of 
current account deficits in peripheral countries 
before the crisis, which was only partially ex -
plainable by the fundamentals, also indicates 
that the balances had risen far beyond a sus -
tainable level and that the rapidly rising foreign 
debt that accompanied this represented a sub -
stantial risk that was not adequately recognised 
at the time. On top of this, capital outflows as 
a result of the sovereign debt crisis were par -ticularly large in the countries with the highest 
current account deficits.15
Based on a dataset comprising the 27 EU coun -
tries spanning the period 1994 to 2011, the 
study confirms that higher levels of exchange 
rate or interest rate flexibility cause the current 
account to adjust to its equilibrium value sig -
nificantly faster. According to the calculations 
performed, more than half of the deviations 
from the equilibrium were reduced within a 
year in the case of freely floating exchange 
rates, and only 40% persisted in the following 
year. However, a return to equilibrium does not 
always imply a balanced current account. In -
stead, positive or negative current account bal -
ances may represent an equilibrium phenom -
enon; for example, an economic catching-up 
process over a protracted period may justify the 
existence of current account deficits. The model 
only describes the adjustment process from a 
given starting value to long-term equilibrium, 
which is determined endogenously by the 
model. Country-specific differences in equilib -
rium values are permitted without being de -
fined as imbalances (see the box from pages 23 
to 25).
In countries with fixed exchange rates, 
long-term interest rates are much more volatile 
than in countries with flexible exchange rates. 
The reduced impact of exchange rate volatility 
on the adjustment of external balances can 
thus be at least partially offset by the higher Empirical study

ment under dif-ferent exchange rate regimes

ments crises mostly con-nected to imbal-ances in the real economyPermanent devi-

14 However, the basic reasoning for a delayed adjustment 
mechanism is also true for balance of payments crises 
which originate from developments in the financial ac -
count.
15 The current crisis in the euro area cannot be explained 
in isolation from the real economic developments of the 
1990s and the early 2000s. For example, the dislocations 
in the euro area only became more dramatic after govern -
ment and private debt problems began to emerge and the 
cumulated current account deficits simultaneously became 
apparent, whereas the euro area had previously acted as a 
protective shield against the disruptions of the financial cri -
sis. See P R Lane and B Pels (2012), Current Account Imbal -
ances in Europe, CEPR Discussion Paper 8958, CEPR, Lon -
don; M Obstfeld and K Rogoff (2010), Global Imbalances 
and the Financial Crisis; Products of Common Causes,

cial Crisis, Federal Reserve Bank San Francisco, p 131 ff.Deutsche Bundesbank

volatility of interest rates. Nonetheless, the per -
sistence of current account positions is signifi -
cantly higher in a fixed rate regime than in a 
system with flexible exchange rates. During the 
observation period the existing divergences 
were only reduced by 40% within a year, with 
60% of deviations carried forward into the 
next year.
In terms of the estimated impact of the prevail -
ing current account balance on the following 
year’s value, the persistence of current account 
deficits in the euro area, at 75%, is distinctly 
greater than in the case of floating or fixed ex -
change rate regimes. This is due, in particular, to the lower interest rate volatility than in a 
fixed exchange rate regime, which cannot off -
set the absent or small impact of exchange rate 
volatility. The lower elasticity of interest rates in 
relation to global stress factors has also delayed 
the balance of payments adjustment in the 
euro area in statistically significant terms.
The studies therefore indicate that the adjust -
ment of the current account depends on the 
particular exchange rate regime, and that the 
current account generally balances more slowly 
in a monetary union. A slower adjustment pro -
cess in the euro area does not necessarily imply 
that balance of payments problems will ensue. Persistence of

Adjustment of current account balances under different 
 exchange rate regimes
In the following empirical studies an autore-
gressive model is used to test whether be-
longing to a particular exchange rate re-
gime signifi  cantly affects the speed at which 
the current account rebalances.1 Theory 
suggests that nominal exchange rate 
changes, and therefore differing exchange 
rate regimes, have no impact on the current 
account balance in the long term. In the 
short term, however, prices are subject to 
considerable rigidities, so that international 
competitiveness, especially in connection with adjustment processes, might well be 
affected by nominal exchange rate develop-ments.
2
The current account equilibrium is deter-mined endogenously to the model by the 
incorporated variables. The approach used 
here thus does not assume a balanced cur-rent account, even in the steady state, and 
accepts individual country-specifi  c equilib-
rium values. However, the model presented in this article provides no answers regarding 
the extent to which these levels are de-pendent on the underlying exchange rate 
regime.3
With regard to the current account adjust-
ment process, this study makes an explicit 
distinction between the impact of a fi  xed 
exchange rate regime and that arising from membership of a monetary union.
4 The ap-
plied dataset covers the 27 EU countries 
over the period 1994 to 2011. The estima-
tions are based on the following regression equation:
5
(1) CAGDP it = p 0 + p 1 CAGDP it–1 + 
p2 CAGDP it–1 × ER_REGIME it–1 + 
p3 ER_REGIME it–1 + e it ,
where CAGDP  is the current account bal-
ance as a percentage of GDP , p1 is an au-
toregressive coeffi   cient and ER_REGIME  
is the exchange rate regime, based on vari-ous indicators. The sub-indices i and t de-
note the countries and the observation year respectively, and 
e is the error term.
In a fi  rst step, the rate of current account 
adjustment is calculated for fl  oating, hybrid and fi  xed exchange rate regimes as well as 
1 The empirical studies use the current account as an 
explanatory variable rather than the overall private bal-
ance of payments position. Like the main text, they 
therefore focus on the origins of balance of payments 
disequilibria emanating from the real economy. For 
econometric purposes there is an advantage in expli-
citly restricting the focus of analysis to the current ac-count since private transactions are per se balanced in 
the case of fl  oating exchange rate regimes. Hence, it 
would be impossible to include countries employing fl  oating exchange rates in an empirical study. More-
over, the current account is a good proxy for the over-all balance of payments if the current account and pri-vate transactions are highly correlated or their changes have the same sign. In this case, an econometric study can benefi  t from the lower volatility of current account balances compared with international capital fl  ows.

gimes and the Behavior of Real Exchange Rates: Evi-dence and Implications, Carnegie Rochester Confer-
ence Series on Public Policy 25, pp 117-214.3 Since the focus is on the process of adjustment, the 
model does not specify any concrete values for bal-anced current accounts, nor does it incorporate any fundamental variables. By contrast, Arratibel et al 
(2008), Real Convergence in Central and Eastern Euro-
pean EU Member States – Which Role for Exchange Rate Volatility?”, ECB Working Paper 929, European 
Central Bank, Frankfurt, examine the relation between exchange rate volatility and the level of the current ac-count.

5 The studies were run using a feasible generalized 
least squares (FGLS) estimator, applying fi  xed effects, 
panel-corrected standard errors and, where necessary, 
an AR term to adjust the autocorrelation. Dynamic 
models with fi  xed effects indicate a Nickel bias, which 
arises from the correlation of the mean-adjusted, 
lagged endogenous variables with the mean-adjusted 
error term. However, since the number of periods T 
contained in this dataset is suffi   ciently large, the error should not be exceptionally high. All estimations were

for countries belonging to a monetary 
union (Model 1).6 A simple dummy ap-
proach, which defi  nes the exchange rate 
regime using a 0/1 variable, is applied to 
show the extent to which the various re-
gimes differ, without specifying any reasons 
for the varying speeds of adjustment.7
In a second step, the various exchange rate 
regimes are modelled according to their 
specifi  c features (Model 2),8 thus allowing 
information about the underlying transmis-
sion channels to be derived. In order to dif-
ferentiate between fi  xed and fl  oating ex-
change rates, the z-score index after Gosh, 
Gulde and Wolf is used to gauge exchange 
rate volatility; a corresponding variable for 
interest rate volatility makes it possible to 
distinguish between the adjustment process 
under fi  xed exchange rates and within a 
monetary union.9
The persistence of current account balances 
p is derived from the autoregressive coeffi   -
cient of the lagged current account balance 
p1 plus the coeffi   cient of the interaction term of the lagged endogenous variable 
and the exchange rate regime p2. The rate 
calculated using Model 1 and indicating the 
pace of reduction of existing current ac-
count imbalances, ie of rebalancing a cur-
rent account balance following a disrup-
tion, is 1 –(p1+p2) . Accordingly, the persist-
ence factor in Model 2 likewise comprises 
p1+p2 , but in this instance p2 is multiplied 
by the degree of exchange rate and interest 
rate volatility. A negative sign for the par-
ameter p2 implies a speedier current ac-
count adjustment as the autoregressive 
term (with a positive sign) is being reduced 
and with it the persistence of the current 
account imbalance.
The empirical studies show that the ex-
change rate regime has a signifi  cant impact 
on the current account adjustment rate. For 
example, greater exchange rate fl  exibility 
increases the speed with which the current 
account rebalances. Under a freely fl  oating 
exchange rate regime, 60% of existing de-
viations are reduced within a year while 
40% of the imbalance persists in the fol-
6 Hybrid exchange rate regimes are neither fully fl  oat-
ing nor based on fi  xed exchange rates. They include 
regimes with fl  uctuation bands as well as arrange-
ments under which central banks intervene unoffi   cially 
and intermittently on the foreign exchange markets 
with a view to infl  uencing the price of the currency 
(managed fl  oating).
7 See M D Chinn and S -J Wei (2008), op cit.
8 A continuous variable is able to refl  ect developments 
in an exchange rate regime much more precisely than 
a dummy variable. In addition, the inherent problems 
of a dummy approach are avoided, eg arbitrary classi-
fi  cation, particularly in the case of hybrid regimes. 
Nevertheless, the risk of possible endogeneity in-
creases, ie if the explanatory variables – exchange rate 
volatility and interest rate volatility – are affected by 
the underlying current account developments and are 
not fully exogenous, this may lead to biased estimation 
results. To avoid this effect, the volatility of the ex-
change rate and of the interest rate are incorporated 
into the estimation on a lagged basis.
9 Exchange rate fl  uctuations are taken into account 
according to the following equation: zt =   /uni03BC2
t + σ2
t where /uni03BCt  denotes the arithmetic average of the daily 
percentage changes in the nominal exchange rates in 
year t and σt is the standard deviation of the daily 
 percentage changes in the nominal exchange rates in 
year t. Interest rate volatility is calculated analogously.

lowing year. At 59%, the persistence of the 
imbalance is much more pronounced under 
a hybrid regime.10 Under a fi  xed exchange 
rate regime, deviations from the balanced level only persist for a marginally longer 
period ( p=0.6). The current account rebal-
ances by far the most slowly within a mon-
etary union. In the case of the euro area, the rate of rebalancing within a year is merely 25%. Therefore, during the period under observation, current account imbal-
ances in the European monetary union not 
only persisted much longer than that in 
fl  oating exchange rate regimes but also sig-nifi  cantly longer than in a fi  xed rate regime.
The fi  ndings of Model 2 make it clear that 
higher exchange rate and interest rate  volatility facilitates the process of current 
account adjustment. The autoregressive co-
effi   cient is reduced by 0.34, multiplied by the previous year’s level of exchange rate volatility, and by 4.38, multiplied by the 
level of interest rate volatility in the previous 
period. The coeffi   cients themselves cannot 
be interpreted as they depend on the re-
spective composition of the variables. How-ever, using a contribution analysis it is pos-sible to map the extent to which these two 
factors contribute to a faster adjustment. 
Specifi  cally, it is interesting to measure the 
respective contribution to current account adjustment in the various exchange rate 
 regimes since 1999 of exchange rate volatil-
ity and interest rate volatility (see table 
below right).11
The fi  ndings highlight the fact that in a 
fi  xed exchange rate regime the small contri-bution of exchange rate volatility to the ad-
justment process is offset by the higher 
volatility of interest rates. By contrast, in the 
case of the European monetary union, interest rate volatility is lower than under fi  xed-rate regimes and therefore cannot counteract an absence or smaller level of 
exchange rate volatility. Overall, the empir-
ical studies therefore support the hypoth-esis that current account adjustment is 
hampered in a monetary union. This holds above all in comparison with fl  oating-rate 
regimes owing to the lower exchange rate 
fl  exibility; but compared with fi  xed-rate 
 regimes, too, the euro area exhibits a much 
higher persistence in its current account 
balances due to less volatile interest rates.
10 The hybrid exchange rate regime corresponds to 
the initial scenario as it is not explicitly included in the 
estimation as an additional dummy.11 In each case, the contribution is calculated on the 
basis of the estimated coeffi   cients of the incorporated 
variables multiplied by the average values of the vari-
able in an exchange rate regime.Persistence and speed of current  account adjustment in different  exchange rate regimes

Given the identified persistence of current ac -
count positions, however, imbalances are more 
likely to accumulate. In the past, the corrective effect of market discipline was not sufficient to 
counteract this. However, the change in risk perception triggered by the crisis was abrupt 
and was no longer restricted to one country. In 
this context, non-linear reactions frequently 
play a role since they involve certain thresholds 
which, if exceeded, cause the financial markets 
to react suddenly.
Implications for economic 
policy
These findings imply central economic policy 
challenges. These relate both to short-term cri-
sis management and to the need to make the 
institutional framework of the euro area more 
resilient to these types of risk. From a monetary policy perspective, the key task is to ensure that 
the single European monetary policy remains 
geared towards price stability in both these 
areas.16
In short-term crisis management, it is essential 
to keep monetary policy and fiscal policy segre -
gated. In a crisis, central banks play an import-
ant role as lenders of last resort to solvent 
banks. This involves short-term refunding oper -
ations in return for high-quality collateral. Every 
support measure for a financial institution that 
clearly goes beyond this function as a lender of 
last resort during periods of temporary illiquid-
ity means that the central bank is performing a 
quasi-fiscal role which rightly belongs in the 
domain of elected governments.
In addition to short-term crisis management, 
the experience of the past few years has under -
scored the need to strengthen the resilience of 
the institutional framework in future. All meas -
ures that help to reduce the vulnerability of the 
national banking and financial systems are therefore to be welcomed. The initiative 
launched to streamline and harmonise financial 
market regulation in the European Union can help to nip the build-up of unsustainable debt in the bud and to prevent balance of payments 
crises. Furthermore, the efforts to strengthen 
banking supervision at European level are like -
wise a step in the right direction as long as the focus is not on redistributing risk but rather on 
improving credit institutions’ resilience to cri -
ses. A precondition for this is to significantly re -
duce the interdependence between sovereigns 
and their national financial sector. However, in 
addition to a single European supervisor, a 
change in the regulatory approach in the form 
of differentiated capital and liquidity rules for 
government bonds is needed to achieve this 
aim.
A general conclusion is that the current basic 
structure of European monetary and fiscal pol -
icy places exacting demands on member states’ 
homogeneity and/or willingness to adjust. This 
underlines the importance of greater economic 
policy surveillance, which is to be achieved 
through the Euro Plus Pact, the macroeco -
nomic surveillance procedure and the en -
hanced Stability and Growth Pact. It is essential to use these tools for the timely detection and 
swift counteraction of unhealthy developments 
in future.
This also applies to the Fiscal Compact, which 
will enter into force on 1  January 2013 and 
which will require the signatory countries (all 
EU member states except the United Kingdom 
and the Czech Republic) to incorporate a struc-
turally close-to-balance general government 
budget into their national legislation. In add -
ition, they must introduce debt brakes which 
trigger an automatic correction mechanism if 
targets are missed. However, the terms of the 
Fiscal Compact do not envisage any powers to 
intervene in national fiscal policy beyond those Balance of pay-

Pact.17
The surveillance procedures adopted can help 
to “communicate” problems to market partici -
pants earlier on in the expectation that markets 
will have a greater disciplinary effect on the 
countries concerned than in the past via higher 
interest rate spreads. Experience from the first 
ten years of the euro area has made it clear 
that public pressure alone may not be sufficient 
to set the necessary adjustments in motion. 
Another key need is for effective sanctions 
which are actually applied if the provisions are 
breached. It remains to be seen, however, 
whether the adopted procedures will meet this 
requirement.18
Furthermore, wider interest rate spreads could 
lead to a faster adjustment of international 
capital flows (ie before a balance of payments 
crisis occurs) and could also cause corrections 
to take place in the real economy, eg in domes -
tic demand. The convergence of nominal inter -
est rates within the euro area is not an end in 
itself and is therefore only desirable if it is war -
ranted by real convergence and does not 
undermine the steering function of financial 
market prices.
Greater coordination and the threat of poten -
tial sanctions for member states at European 
level do not exempt individual countries from their individual responsibility. Under the euro 
area’s current regulatory framework, economic policy measures ultimately have to be adopted 
and implemented at national level. The euro 
area is different to federally organised nations 
such as the United States or Germany, which 
may likewise experience regional economic di-
vergences, because there is no central, demo -
cratically elected political body under parlia -
mentary control with extensive decision-making 
authority to manage internal debt crises.
For the euro-area countries, evolution towards 
a political union would be a logical approach to 
making the monetary union more resilient. 
However, the loss of sovereignty at the national level that this would inevitably entail would be a seismic shift for the member states and could only be achieved on the basis of a broad social 
consensus and popular acceptance, regardless 
of any purely economic considerations.
If such a quantum leap towards greater inte -
gration is considered politically undesirable or 
unenforceable, the primacy of national respon-
sibility will remain in place.… and EU

The development of state government 
 finances in Germany since 2005
State government finances have undergone sharp fluctuations in recent years. Having temporarily 
achieved a balanced budget in the aggregate, state government saw its finances deteriorate con -
siderably in 2009 following the financial and economic crisis. While the deficit of the 16 states 
has since declined significantly overall, state government is not expected to come close to balan -
cing its budget until around the end of the fiscal planning period in 2016.
The current fiscal situation varies greatly across the individual states. Whereas some states already 
posted surpluses last year, others still had very high deficits. Although the interest burden stem -
ming from high levels of debt was a key factor in many cases, revenue and other expenditure also 
partly differed considerably among the federal states.
In order to curb government debt, including that of the federal states, strict borrowing limits were 
enshrined in the German constitution (Basic Law, or Grundgesetz) in 2009. All states will have to 
balance their budgets (in structural terms) from 2020 onwards. However, some key details regard -
ing the debt brake’s design have been left to state legislators, and the transitional period specified 
in the national constitution seems very long for most of the states. Following amendments to 
some federal state constitutions, the first states have now passed implementing legislation. How -
ever, most have set only imprecise or unambitious requirements (to date) for the minimum deficit 
reductions during the transitional period. Like those that have not yet revised the requirements 
governing their borrowing limits, these states risk delaying necessary consolidation measures and 
ultimately encountering difficulties in achieving the budget targets. The later consolidation begins, 
the higher the future interest burden will be, distinctly narrowing the scope for other expenditure. 
It is particularly important for states with high starting deficits to take prompt action. Generally 
speaking, it makes sense to leave significant safety margins below the constitutional borrowing 
limits to avoid any need for short-term and potentially procyclical adjustments in the event of 
negative shocks. When preparing the reform of the state government revenue-sharing scheme, 
which is also scheduled to take effect by 2020, it would seem appropriate – not least in view of 
the differing starting positions of the individual federal states – to increase flexibility on the rev -
enue side too, and to permit, for instance, state-specific surcharges or discounts on taxes raised 
jointly with other tiers of government.Deutsche Bundesbank

Developments in state 
 government budgets
Overview of the core budgets
State government finances have undergone 
sharp fluctuations in recent years. Given the 
trend towards spin-offs from core budgets and 
new off-budget entities, it is generally neces -
sary to look beyond the core budgets in order 
to analyse developments in state government 
finances. However, statistical problems in the 
period under observation make this task more 
difficult. Germany’s Federal Statistical Office 
has since expanded the reporting population 
beyond the core budgets for its quarterly cash 
statistics, which have included all government 
sector entities from the 2011 reporting year on -
wards. Developments in the preceding years 
are distorted by the fact that additional entities 
were successively added to the reporting popu -
lation. This article therefore looks first at 
changes in the core budgets since 2005 before 
comparing the figures for 2011 from the nar -
rower reporting group with those from the ex -
panded group.
In 2005,1 the first year in this analysis and one 
that saw relatively weak economic activity, the 
core state government budgets posted a very 
large deficit (€23½ billion). This shortfall dwin -
dled rapidly during the subsequent upturn, and 
a clear surplus of €7 billion was recorded for 
one year only in 2007. Having balanced its 
books in 2008, state government then saw a 
dramatic deterioration in its finances during the 
financial and economic crisis; this resulted in a 
deficit of €27 billion in 2009, which had fallen 
to €10 billion again by 2011.
After deducting the calculated impact of the 
business cycle2 on tax revenue and adjusting 
for financial transactions,3 which are generally 
excluded under the EU budgetary surveillance 
procedure and the debt brake, developments 
were much less volatile but somewhat less fa -
vourable on balance. In this structural analysis, 
the deficit was reduced continuously between 2005 and 2008, falling from €18 billion to €1 
billion. It rose again to €17 billion in 2010 in 
the wake of the financial and economic crisis, 
before then declining to €9½ billion. The fact 
that this approach only partly factors out the 
high volatility of profit-related taxes across the 
business cycle – as is the case with any sche -Spin-offs from

3 Expenditure and revenue associated with transactions in 
loans and equities do not change financial assets and 
therefore do not affect the Maastricht deficit. Financial 
transactions are factored out of central government’s debt 
brake, and this principle has also been applied in all of the 
state government rules adopted to date. Significant trans -
actions include the recapitalisations of Landesbanken in 
2005, the proceeds of €4½ billion obtained in 2007 from 
the sale of Berlin’s Landesbank, and capital injections total -
ling €10 billion into BayernLB in 2008 and 2009.Deutsche Bundesbank

matic cyclical adjustment procedure – contrib -
uted to the fluctuations in the recorded struc -
tural balances.
As a ratio of trend gross domestic product 
(GDP), structural revenue grew by a total of 
0.6 percentage point in the period under re -
view. Tax bracket creep and, above all, the 
positive overall trend in profit-related taxes 
contributed to this rise. However, at last report, 
the structural revenue ratio was still 0.2 per -
centage point below its 2008 peak, despite the 
large investment grants that were received 
under central government’s second economic 
stimulus package. In particular, this develop -
ment reflects the fact that the tax increases ap -
plied up to 2007 were followed by a number of 
tax relief measures between 2008 and 2010. 
The structural expenditure ratio fell slightly until 
2007 and rose gradually in the subsequent 
years. The 2011 expenditure ratio was 0.2 per -
centage point higher than in 2005, not least 
because of investment stemming from the eco -
nomic stimulus packages. All in all, the rise in 
both the revenue and expenditure ratios was 
probably dampened by the numerous spin-offs 
from core state government budgets.
Revenue in the core budgets
Between 2005 and 2011, revenue increased by 
an annual average of just over 3% in total, 
while expenditure rose somewhat less sharply 
(by just over 2%). This growth in revenue was 
due to positive developments in tax receipts.4 
These fluctuated sharply over time, particularly 
owing to macroeconomic developments and 
the high volatility of profit-related taxes. Tax in -
creases such as the 3 percentage point rise in 
the standard rate of VAT in 2007 (with state 
government participation of a third, currently 
almost €10 billion) also had an impact towards 
the beginning of the period, while the similarly 
extensive tax cuts between 2008 and 2010 af -
fected revenue later on. Over the period under 
review, revenue developments were more fa -
vourable than would have been suggested by the estimated financial impact of legislative 
changes, movements in the key macroeco -
nomic indicators for tax (gross wages and sal -
aries, private consumption, entrepreneurial and 
investment income) and fiscal drag. All in all, 
tax revenue has thus made a significant contri -
bution to the structural improvement in the 
state government budget.
Revenue from current transfers (mainly from 
central government) increased, primarily be -
cause of the compensation paid to state gov -
ernment for ceding motor vehicle tax receipts 
(€9 billion per year) to central government. By 
contrast, the special supplementary central 
government grants to the east German states 
and Berlin were reduced by €¾ billion each 
year from 2009 onwards, as stipulated in the 
Revenue-Sharing Act (Finanzausgleichsgesetz). 
Meanwhile, however, there were higher central 
government compensation payments for costs 
incurred by local government in connection 
with long-term unemployment.
Before 2009, state government had receipts of 
around €7 billion per year from investment 
grants. During the 2008-09 financial and eco -
nomic crisis, central government launched a 
€10 billion investment programme for state 
and local government via the Investment and 
Repayment Fund. Between 2009 and the end 
of 2011, refunds were available for measures 
taken under this programme. Despite the min -
imum target of €5 billion established by law for 
2009, the volume of refunds actually disbursed 
that year amounted to only €1½ billion, before 
rising to €4 billion in 2010 and €4½ billion in 
2011. The funds were thus paid out much later 
than planned, which would suggest that the 
stimulus also came later than originally in -
tended. Excluding the Investment and Repay -
ment Fund, the volume of investment grants Rise in structural

almost entirely attributable to tax revenue developments.Deutsche Bundesbank

received by state government fell by €½ billion 
in the period under review.
Expenditure  
from the core budgets
Personnel costs traditionally account for a large 
portion of state government expenditure 
(nearly two-fifths) given its key responsibilities 
in education, domestic security and the judicial 
system. These costs include wages for both sal -
aried employees and civil servants, and spend -
ing on pensions and healthcare subsidies for 
civil servants. Moderate average growth of 
1½% per year was recorded between 2005 
and 2011. The bulk of this expansion took place 
in the last three years of the period under re -
view; whereas a decline of almost 2% was re -
corded for 2006, for example. There were op -
posing factors at work in this context. On the 
one hand, collective wage agreements for non-
civil servants and associated adjustments to civil servant salaries led to annual average 
growth of around 1% in the first half of the 
period under review, which accelerated signifi -
cantly to around 2½% from 2009 onwards.5 
On the other, the number of employees in -
cluded in the core budgets declined distinctly 
overall, dropping by just over 6½% between 
2005 and 2011. However, this decrease is sig -
nificantly overstated by spin-offs from state 
government budgets. Excluding the effects of 
spin-offs, the number of employees included in 
the core budgets probably fell by an estimated Moderate rise in 
personnel ex-penditure but understated by spin-offs …Developments in state government budgets (core budgets)*

5 It therefore seems that the federal states’ entitlement to 
pass legislation setting civil servant salaries – over and 
above exceptional payments – independently, which was 
introduced during the first stage of the federal structure 
reform in 2006, has not yet led to lower wage adjustments 
on average. In many cases, wage increases have largely 
been copied – sometimes with a slight delay – from the 
collective wage agreements for non-civil servants, which 
are mostly uniform across Germany. Deutsche Bundesbank

2½% overall.6 This decline is likely to have been 
caused, in particular, by further adjustments in 
the east German states, which brought their 
staffing levels closer to those of west German 
states once negotiated wages had been aligned 
with those of western Germany. By contrast, 
increased efforts to expand education oppor -
tunities had the opposite effect.7 After adjust -
ing expenditure growth for the effect of 
spin-offs, the annual average rise in personnel 
expenditure came to an estimated 2%. There 
was a disproportionately large rise (an average 
of 4% per year) in payments for pensions and 
healthcare subsidies for civil servants, which 
made up an ever greater percentage of person -
nel expenditure (28½% at the end of the period 
under review). The salaries of staff still in active 
service ultimately accounted for only half of ab -
solute expenditure growth.
At an average of 3% per year, growth in other 
operating expenditure was stronger than that 
in personnel costs. However, there were no -
ticeable spin-offs in this area too, which means 
that actual expansion in other operating ex -
penditure is likely to have been understated by 
up to 1 percentage point per year.
Developments in interest expenditure, which 
declined by an average of just over 1% per 
year, had a favourable impact on state govern -
ment budgets. Although core budget debt in 
the form of credit market debt, cash advances 
and liabilities to public budgets grew by a fifth 
on aggregate, reaching nearly €550 billion by 
the end of 2011, interest expenditure only rose 
until 2006, falling steadily thereafter. The aver -
age interest rate, calculated as interest expend -
iture in relation to the debt level at the end of 
the preceding year, fell by 1 percentage point, 
reaching 3½% in 2011.
Current transfers to other budgets in the gen -
eral government sector – mainly to local gov -
ernment – are a particularly important expend -
iture item for state government.8 Under Article 
106 VII of the German Basic Law, the federal 
states are obliged to make a certain proportion of their own tax revenue available to the muni -
cipalities in their state. In cases where local 
government tax receipts are additionally redis -
tributed via the state government budget under 
the local government revenue-sharing scheme, 
this increases the volume of state government 
expenditure by that amount. Furthermore, 
under state constitutions, the federal states

6 Between 2006 and 2008, spin-offs reduced personnel 
expenditure by just over 3½% in total. See Federal Ministry 
of Finance, Einnahmen und Ausgaben der Länder im Jahr 
2006, and the corresponding data for the following years 
at www.bundesfinanzministerium.de. It is assumed that 
salaries in the off-budget entities are at average levels and 
that there was a percentage change of the same size in 
staffing levels.
7 For the 2006-2011 period, the staffing levels – expressed 
as full-time equivalents – for the state government public 
sector (which also includes some entities outside the gov -
ernment sector) rose by 3% in schools and by 11% in uni -
versities and colleges of higher education. See Federal Stat -

8 The east German states and Berlin also pay fairly large 
sums to central government for special and supplementary 
pensions for former employees (2011: €2½ billion). Deutsche Bundesbank

for tasks allocated to them.9 Moreover, in cases 
where central government pays a contribution 
towards municipalities’ expenses – such as ac -
commodation costs for the long-term un -
employed – these funds flow through state 
government budgets. Changes in state govern -
ment transfers to the municipalities may thus 
be attributable not only to developments in 
state government tax revenue and changes to 
the tasks assigned to the municipalities, but 
also to specific measures taken to correct local 
government finances.
All in all, current transfers to other budgets in 
the general government sector increased by an 
average of 4% per year. They rose particularly 
sharply in 2007 and 2008, mainly as a result of 
favourable developments in state government 
tax revenue – partly because of legislative 
changes – and back payments relating to the 
unexpectedly strong growth in state govern -
ment tax receipts in 2006. A clear counter -
movement began in 2010, when the tax cuts 
adopted between 2008 and 2010 had a par -
ticularly strong impact. The sharp rebound in 
current transfers in 2011 reflects not only the 
rise in tax revenue due to the macroeconomic 
recovery but also higher central government 
payments to municipalities in connection with 
long-term unemployment, which were chan -
nelled via state government budgets. At the 
same time, it was probably also partly due to 
the effect of rulings by constitutional courts in 
favour of the municipalities.10 Active cuts to the 
revenue-sharing scheme for municipalities, eg 
in Hesse, were overcompensated. Alongside 
transfers to municipalities, payments to special 
funds, which hardly carried any weight at the 
beginning of the period under review, also 
grew strongly on balance, reaching as much as 
€2 billion in 2011. In many cases, the federal 
states are using these funds to make provi -
sions, eg for growing civil servant pension pay -
ments or for liabilities to Landesbanken, tend -
ing to pay more into them when their budget 
situation is favourable.Investment grants to other budgets in the gen -
eral government sector, which have a much 
smaller volume than current transfers, are like -
wise influenced by developments in state gov -
ernment tax revenue – part of which is trans -
ferred to local government for these purposes. 
Yet the economic stimulus package adopted by 
central government at the beginning of 2009 
had a far greater impact on investment grants. 
This stimulus package was primarily targeted at 
local government investments, and its funds 
were to be increased by at least a third – a task 
mainly fulfilled by state government at first. 
Supplementary packages adopted by individual 
federal states, such as Hesse, boosted invest -
ment grants still further, substantially overcom -
pensating for the cuts that would otherwise 
have been likely given a fall in tax revenue.
There were particularly sharp fluctuations in 
spending on acquisitions of participating inter -
ests. State government made considerable pay -
ments in 2005, in particular to recapitalise Lan -
desbanken – which, following an EU decision, 
had been obliged to compensate the federal 
states for having received capital too cheaply.11 
Spending on acquisitions of participating inter -
ests peaked again in 2008-09, when BayernLB 
received a capital injection totalling €10 billion 
from Bavaria’s budget. While other Landesban -
ken also received substantial support from the 
federal states in which they are domiciled, 
these transactions are not recorded in the core 
budgets – although they are allocated to the 
government sector. The state of Baden-Würt -
temberg injected capital of €2 billion into its 
Landesbank in 2009 (and also acquired a size -Only temporary

10 In its ruling on 12 October 2010 (VerfGH 12/09), the 
Constitutional Court of North Rhine-Westphalia decided 
that this federal state had to pay much higher compensa -
tion for tasks transferred to the municipalities under the 
Childcare Act (Kinderförderungsgesetz). Following this rul -
ing, higher compensation payments were expected in 
other federal states, too.

able shareholding of €5 billion in a large energy 
provider in 2011) via a state government enter -
prise. The states of Hamburg and Schleswig-
Holstein created a joint agency to finance a €3 
billion capital injection into HSH Nordbank in 
2009. Until the end of 2011, WestLB was re -
capitalised (by €3 billion) by the central govern -
ment special fund SoFFin rather than North 
Rhine-Westphalia, its federal state of domicile. 
All in all, core budget figures provide a very in -
complete picture of these financial transac -
tions, which primarily arose in the wake of the 
financial crisis.
Core budgets and off-budget 
entities in 2011
Off-budget entities which had been newly cre -
ated or spun-off from core budgets had a 
marked impact overall in 2011 and restrict the 
informative value of the recorded core budget 
developments. Broadening the analysis of the 
federal states’ cash statistics – by including 
their off-budget entities which belong to the 
government sector – provides a better over -
view of state government finances in 2011.12 
The volume of expenditure in 2011 was €20 bil -
lion (or just over 6½%) higher in the broader 
analysis than that recorded in the core budgets 
alone. In absolute terms, the difference for per -
sonnel costs, at €15 billion (or a seventh), is 
particularly large. In the expanded reporting 
group, the figure for other operating expend -
iture was €10½ billion (around two-fifths) 
higher. As a number of construction companies 
had been spun off from core budgets, fixed 
asset formation was €4 billion (just over 50%) 
higher. By contrast, current and investment 
transfers to entities outside core government 
budgets were much lower, as a large propor -
tion of them are included in the expanded re -
porting group and the relevant payment flows 
are netted against each other. The much higher 
consolidated aggregate expenditure in the ex -
panded cash statistics was largely offset by 
additional revenue, eg from the user fees of 
the entities that were spun off from core budgets. On balance, however, the 2011 deficit 
was up to €1 billion higher for the expanded 
reporting group (despite the inclusion of civil 
servant pension reserves and respective special 
funds, which currently have clear structural sur -
pluses). Confining the analyses or budgetary 
rules to the core budgets would allow a not 
insignificant and probably increasingly weighty 
share of the necessary consolidation to be fac -
tored out. From now on, the focus should 
therefore be on the expanded cash statistics, 
which will also be available for year-on-year 
comparisons in the future.
In view of these circumstances, it is very diffi -
cult to compare the individual federal state 
budgets. Nevertheless, it is clear that there are 
large differences between the states even after 
adjustment for spin-offs, the various burdens 
shifted to local government level, financial 
transactions and payments made under the 
state government revenue-sharing scheme (see 
box from pages 36 to 41).
Implementing the debt brake 
and the Fiscal Compact
Implementing the debt brake 
at state government level
A debt brake was enshrined in the German 
Basic Law in 2009,13 introducing a general ban 
on borrowing for state government in Article 
109. The states are permitted to adopt special 
provisions for budget burdens caused by cyc -
lical developments, natural disasters and emer -
gency situations. Article 143 d of the German 
Basic Law lays down provisions on the ban’s Off-budget 
 entities in 2011: 
substantial add-itional expend-iture and limited deficitsLarge differ-ences between federal states
States initially 
took wait-and-see approach to including debt brake in their constitutions, …
12 However, with regard to financial transactions con -
ducted outside the core budgets, there are gaps in the cash 
statistics for off-budget entities, too. For example, they do 
not record acquisitions of participating interests and re -
capitalisations settled via state government enterprises 
which use commercial double-entry bookkeeping. The cash 
statistics thus ultimately provide an incomplete overview of 
the overall budget, too.

Major budgetary differences between the federal states
An overall view of state government ﬁ  -
nances masks major differences between 
the individual federal states. To ensure that comparisons are as meaningful as possible, 
this analysis draws on per capita budget ﬁ  gures from the 2011 cash statistics.
1 Be-
cause responsibilities and the associated ex-
penditure are assigned differently between 
state and local government depending on the federal state in question, and consoli-
dated data are available anyway for the city 
states, it makes sense to include the local 
authorities in the analysis. Using cash statis-
tics which include government sector off-budget entities prevents any distortions arising from differences in spin-offs from the individual states’ core budgets. How-ever, because a full data set for this ex-tended coverage is available only for last year, no comparisons may be drawn with 
previous years. In addition, it would appear 
useful to exclude ﬁ  nancial transactions 
which purely involve a shifting of ﬁ  nancial 
assets, as occurs under the European deﬁ  cit rules and the debt brakes for which details have so far been drawn up in Germany. This 
also prevents sizeable one-off transactions 
from distorting the underlying picture.
Range of deﬁ  cits
Under the deﬁ  nition outlined above, the 
per capita deﬁ  cit averaged €120 across the federal states in 2011. However, there were extremely large differences between the  individual states. Saxony, Bavaria, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and Baden-Württemberg recorded surpluses of over €100. Brandenburg’s revenue also ex-
ceeded its expenditure. The largest per cap-
ita deficit (€1,200) was registered in 
Bremen, while the ﬁ  gure for Saarland was 
also very high at almost €900. The ratio of these two deﬁ  cits to expenditure (after ad-justment as described above) was 15% and 
17% respectively. Very unfavourable results 
were also recorded in Hesse with a ﬁ  gure of €650 and Rhineland-Palatinate with €440 (almost 11½% and 9% of expenditure re-spectively). Furthermore, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state, the per capita deﬁ  cit was almost three times the federal state average at 
€320 (6% of expenditure).
Signiﬁ  cance of differing interest costs
The debts accumulated through past def-
icits play an important part in explaining 
this wide range of budgetary positions, on 
account of the differing amounts of interest

government revenue-sharing scheme, which is 
produced with a three-month time lag, has also been 
included in order to capture the structural position 
more precisely. In addition, charges required by federal 
law from donor states under the state government 
revenue-sharing scheme are deducted from 
expenditure and receipts.Budget balances in 2011

the federal states have to pay as a result. 
Because the capital markets assume joint 
and several liability2 within the German fed-
eration, there are no major yield differen-tials between the federal states. However, the states’ debt levels vary very widely. 
While per capita credit market debt (includ-
ing cash advances) averaged more than €9,100 across the federal states in 2011, 
Saxony and Bavaria were carrying the light-
est debt burdens at just over €2,200 and €3,400 respectively. By contrast, Saarland 
– the most heavily indebted of the non-city 
states  – and Bremen had totals of well above €15,000 and close to €29,000 re-
spectively.3 These differences have a direct 
effect on per capita interest costs. The 
interest burden ranged from somewhat in excess of €100 in Saxony and Bavaria to nearly €400 in almost all non-city states. 
Saarland alone had a fi  gure close to €600. 
The cost came out higher still in the city states of Berlin and particularly Bremen, 
with the latter shouldering an interest bur-
den of more than €950 per capita.
Varying interest payments account for a large proportion of the difference in the 
defi  cits. Adjustment for interest expenditure (ie looking at the primary budget balances) reduces the range of variation in states’ per 
capita budget balances by more than half, 
and the rankings also change to a certain 
extent. However, it should be borne in mind 
that states which have accumulated rela-
tively large debts in the past now require a more ambitious primary total if they are to 
balance their budgets. Whilst on average 
the states had a primary surplus of €200 per 
capita, Hesse and Saarland stand out with 
primary defi  cits well above €300. Bremen 
and Rhineland-Palatinate also recorded pri-
mary defi  cits (of €240 and €90 respect-
ively). With a surplus of €550, Berlin came 
out top, followed by Saxony. However, 
even when interest payments are factored 
out, there are still large differences among 
the federal states between receipts and ex-penditure which do not balance out.The revenue side
Taxes account for by far the largest share of 
receipts. This means that the multi-level 
state government revenue-sharing scheme 
–  which is set to continue in its present 
form only until the end of 2019 – is also of 
crucial importance (see table on page 38).

ceipts, per capita fi  nancial strength in tax-
2 Ultimately, this assumption is based on Germany’s 
federal system, which involves a mutual guarantee 
obligation. The Federal Constitutional Court upheld 
requests for assistance from the states of Bremen and Saarland in 1992. Although it rejected a similar request from Berlin in 2006, this was mainly because the court 
found that Berlin had further consolidation potential 
available to it; had the large defi  cits persisted once this 
potential had been exhausted, Berlin would probably 
also have been entitled to assistance.3 It should be noted that higher debts are not generally 
associated with correspondingly larger asset totals. In 
fact, they often go hand in hand with below-average holdings of fi  nancial assets (as in the case of Saarland and Bremen). Thus, overall the states with higher debt 
levels usually also have a wider differential between 
interest expenditure and income on their assets.Credit market debt in 2011

raising terms ranged from just over half the 
federal state average in the eastern states, 
to a quarter above the average in Baden-
Württemberg, Hesse and Bavaria, to more 
than 50% above the average in Hamburg.
Even before the state government 
revenue-sharing scheme (under the nar-rower defi  nition) is factored in, however, 
these differences were evened out to a con-siderable degree – in particular by the sup-plementary revenue shares granted to some states as part of the distribution of turnover tax receipts (totalling €11 billion in 2011). A further levelling effect was achieved by the 
state government revenue-sharing scheme 
under the narrower defi  nition. Under the provisional settlement for 2011, this in-volved transfers of almost €7½ billion. Among the donor states, Bavaria paid the largest single contribution (€3½ billion). However, the share paid by Hesse was somewhat higher in per capita terms (€300). Berlin was granted the largest trans-fer (€3 billion), which equated to €870 per 
capita. Bremen received €780 per capita  
given that the fi  nancial needs of city states are weighted 35% higher across the board. 
The differences between the states were 
then reduced further still by general supple-mentary central government grants of €2½ 
billion. Special supplementary central gov-ernment grants, usually involving tapered 
payments, are additionally awarded for le-
gally defi  ned exceptional burdens, and to-
talled €9½ billion in 2011. These special 
grants are intended to cushion the effect of 
above-average costs for political adminis-
tration in smaller states, the relatively large 
burdens arising from long-term unemploy-
ment in the non-city states of eastern Ger-many and, above all, the consequences of a 
divided Germany in the fi  ve eastern states 
and Berlin.Federal states’ per capita fi  nancial strength before and after revenue-sharing

Following all of these redistributions 
through revenue-sharing, Berlin had the greatest per capita  fi  nancial strength at 
over a third above the federal state average, 
followed by Hamburg. The eastern states exceeded the average by more than 10%. Despite having the highest tax receipts within this group before distribution of 
turnover tax, Brandenburg was placed last, 
because the special supplementary central 
government grants are paid out according 
to fi  xed quotas, whilst population growth in 
this state has been far stronger. The states 
of Bavaria and Hesse, which originally had 
particularly high levels of fi  nancial strength, 
were now 2% below the average, but still 
more than 5% stronger than the weakest group, comprising Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-
Palatinate.4
Adjusted total receipts (ie not including pro-
ceeds from fi  nancial transactions and after 
deduction of any revenue-sharing charges) 
are also strongly affected by other factors in 
addition to the revenue-sharing scheme. 
For instance, the federal states receive sub-stantial non-tax income (approximately half of tax receipts on average across the federal states) – not least from fees
5, principally at 
local government level, and other transfers. 
In this case, too, the results for different 
states varied considerably.6 The federal state 
average for adjusted total revenue per cap-
ita was just short of €5,100 last year. The 
figures for Saarland (€4,340) and 
 Rhineland-Palatinate (€4,400) were lowest, 
while Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein 
were also well below average at around €4,650. Amongst the western non-city states, Hesse also came in slightly below average. Amongst the eastern states, Sax-ony recorded below-average revenue des-
pite receiving special supplementary central government grants of more than €500 per 
capita, whilst Mecklenburg-West Pomer-
ania had the highest receipts at €5,650. The 
city states achieved far higher levels. Berlin 
recorded the lowest result for a city state 
(€6,500) despite having the highest level of fi  nancial strength after revenue-sharing, whilst Hamburg had signifi  cantly more 
funds at its disposal with a fi  gure of €6,900.
The (primary) expenditure side
As with the revenue analysis above, in the 
following comparison of expenditure ad-
justed for interest payments, charges arising 
4 However, the differences arising in particular from 
the portion of local government tax receipts not 
included in the revenue-sharing scheme remain. Pursuant to section 8 of the Revenue-sharing Act (Finanzausgleichsgesetz), only 64% of these tax receipts are included in the scheme. For real estate 
taxes and trade tax, it is not the actual development in 
states’ receipts which is referred to, but an 
extrapolation using the distribution code derived from the previous year’s revenue capacity.5 In line with cost recovery rules, however, higher fee 
income is likely to go hand in hand with higher expenditure in many cases, which means that any 
effect on the budget balance will probably be limited 
overall (the same applies to reimbursements of costs).6 For example, Bremen’s other income per capita was around double that of Saarland. Nonetheless, 8 of the 13 non-city states were within a range of approximately €100 above or below the average.Revenue and expenditure in 2011

from the revenue-sharing scheme and from 
fi  nancial transactions are factored out. With 
an average of almost €4,900 for adjusted primary expenditure per capita across all 
the federal states, Lower Saxony, Rhineland-
Palatinate, Schleswig-Holstein and Saxony had the lowest fi  gures at around €4,500, 
whilst Hesse was at the top of the scale for non-city states with expenditure of €5,400. 
The levels of expenditure among the city 
states were signifi  cantly higher still. With a 
fi  gure of more than €6,900, however, 
Bremen was still €400 above Hamburg, and exceeded Berlin’s total by close to €1,000.
A breakdown of these adjusted primary spending totals shows that personnel ex-penditure – including pension payments – 
accounts for a substantial proportion (two-fi  fths).
7 In the eastern states and to a lesser 
extent in Berlin, transfers are also paid to 
central government in connection with the 
special and supplementary pension pay-
ments made to former employees from the period prior to reunifi  cation (a total of €2½ billion a year). These payments are compar-able with pension payments in the western states and are therefore added to personnel 
expenditure in this analysis. Defi  ned in this 
way, personnel expenditure averaged 
around €2,100 per capita across the federal 
states, with Schleswig-Holstein recording the lowest fi  gure at just under €1,900, 
whilst Hesse and Saarland – which bears a 
particularly large pension burden – led the 
non-city states with totals of around 
€2,250. Per capita personnel expenditure in 
the city states was signifi  cantly higher still. 
Bremen posted by far the largest fi  gure 
within this group (almost €2,950); reducing 
it to the level recorded in Berlin, for in-stance, would have approximately halved 
Bremen’s defi  cit.

for 13% of adjusted primary expenditure

across the federal states – also differed sig-
nifi  cantly from state to state. Whilst the 
average was €640 per capita, Saarland had 
the lowest fi  gure at €460, just ahead of 
Baden-Württemberg, whilst North Rhine-
Westphalia came out highest amongst the 
non-city states with a total of €790, only 
slightly below Bremen at €810.
Real asset formation is largely carried out by 
local authorities, but the states also often 
contribute to its funding through invest-ment grants. In 2011, the year under re-
view, the 2009 central government invest-
ment programme with quotas for the indi-vidual states continued to affect real invest-ment fi  gures, as the states were still able to 
draw residual funds from the programme. Thus, where individual states had been slower than originally intended in imple-menting investment projects, this metric was higher in 2011 (which was also re-fl  ected in the associated revenue from grants). Overall, real asset formation ac-
counted for almost 9% of adjusted primary expenditure in 2011. Average real asset for-mation amounted to €430 per capita. Sax-
ony and Bavaria –  both of which already 
had a budget surplus – surpassed this level 
particularly clearly (by €610 and €600 re-spectively), but it was also noticeably ex-
ceeded in western Germany by Hesse and 
Bremen (by more than €100). Despite the special assistance it received under the in-frastructure reconstruction scheme in the eastern federal states (Aufbau Ost),  Berlin 
recorded the lowest value (€250), closely 
followed by North Rhine-Westphalia.
OutlookThe European fi  scal rules and fi  scal compact 
require that budget limits be made effective 
not only at central and state government 
level but also for the municipalities in order 
to achieve a close-to-balance general gov-
ernment budget. By 2020 at the latest, a constitutional general ban on borrowing will apply, which means that receipts will 
have to at least balance out expenditure (in structural terms) in each federal state. If the 
new revenue-sharing arrangements from 2020 –  which have yet to be decided 
upon – do not create a means of evening 
out the states’ very varied budgetary situ-
ations, then the adjustments required in the 
individual states will differ greatly. In this case, particularly those states with below-
average fi  nancial strength, larger debts and corresponding interest payments will either 
have to reduce their primary expenditure 
considerably further or utilise more of their 
own revenue-raising potential in order to achieve a (structurally) balanced budget. 
With this in mind, it may make sense to in-
clude a greater degree of fl  exibility in the upcoming reform of revenue-sharing ar-rangements, particularly on the revenue 
side, for instance through state-specifi  c sur-taxes.Real asset formation in 2011

entry into force in 2020. Until then, the federal 
states are allowed to continue borrowing to 
fund their budgets in accordance with state 
government rules. At central government level, 
the Basic Law and the implementing legislation 
passed at the same time promptly established 
more comprehensive provisions, eg regarding 
adjustment for financial transactions, cyclical 
adjustment, a control account and a structural 
deficit reduction path. For the individual federal 
state budgets, the specifics of how the debt 
brake is implemented – which are key to its 
 effectiveness – were left to state government 
legislators, who initially took a wait-and-see 
approach. From summer 2010, the first federal 
states – starting with Schleswig-Holstein, fol -
lowed by Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse and 
Mecklenburg-West Pomerania – began to en -
shrine debt brakes in their state constitutions. 
Given that the ban on borrowing established in 
Article 109 of the German Basic Law is to take 
direct effect from 2020, the main focus was ul -
timately to have access to the exemptions 
offered in the national constitution.14 In 2012, 
Hamburg and Bremen also included a debt 
brake in their constitutions.
Overall, all of the amended constitutions make 
use of the entire transitional period despite the 
fact that state government was actually only 
given more time than central government be -
cause of the comparatively high adjustment 
burdens faced by some federal states and even 
though the direct burdens caused by the 2008-
09 financial and economic crisis have proved to 
be considerably smaller than assumed when 
the debt brake was incorporated into the Basic 
Law. In addition, the deficit reduction require -
ments have often tended to be fairly lax. While 
the voting requirements to invoke exemptions 
for emergency situations are tougher in some 
federal states than at central government level, 
Rhineland-Palatinate and Bremen have both 
introduced an exemption for budget burdens 
not caused by state government legislation – 
such as substantial nationwide tax cuts or 
spending increases. It is worth noting that 
these are treated on a par with natural disas -ters and unavoidable, severe emergency situ -
ations despite the fact that the federal states 
are essentially in a position to influence such 
decisions in the upper house of parliament 
(Bundesrat).
Alongside their constitutional provisions, the 
implementing legislation in the federal states is 
also important (see box from pages 43 to 45). 
If they do not stringently limit the possibilities 
for circumventing the rules – offered, say, by 
the definition of financial transactions or by 
cyclical adjustment procedures – they could fail 
to meet the objective enshrined in the Basic 
Law of curbing debt levels. By resolutely and 
rapidly cutting their deficits, however, the fed -
eral states can help to ensure that they comply 
with the borrowing limits, even in the event of 
negative shocks, without needing to introduce 
short-term consolidation measures (which 
often have a procyclical effect).
Developments in highly 
 indebted federal states
To facilitate compliance with the debt brake, 
Article 143 d of the German Basic Law also 
provides for the possibility of the other mem -
bers of the German federation granting the five 
particularly highly indebted federal states (Ber -
lin, Bremen, Saarland, Saxony-Anhalt and 
Schleswig-Holstein) transitional assistance to -
talling €800 million per year until 2019. These 
states’ administrative agreements with central 
government specify conditions aimed at ensur -
ing that they consolidate their budgets. To 
achieve this, a minimum reduction path was 
set for the structural deficits; their ceilings are 
lowered by a tenth of the 2010 starting value 
each year. Germany’s new Stability Council is 
responsible for monitoring these federal states’ 
compliance with the minimum reduction path.… but six fed-
eral states have done so since summer 2010

The recent legislation implementing the debt brakes 
in Schleswig-Holstein and Rhineland-Palatinate
The specifi  c implementation of the general 
ban on (structural) borrowing pursuant to 
Article 109 of the German constitution 
(Basic Law, or Grundgesetz) for the budgets 
of the individual federal states is the re-
sponsibility of federal state legislators. The 
fi  rst German states enshrined debt brakes in 
their constitutions in summer 2010. While the state parliament in Hesse had already reached a consensus on a number of key aspects of an implementation act, legisla-
tors in the other states had still not fl  eshed out any of the legislative details. Schleswig-
Holstein enacted implementing legislation 
in spring 2012, notably including provisions 
on the obligation enshrined in the state 
constitution since 2011 to reduce the initial 
structural defi  cit –  which had not been clearly defi  ned hitherto  – by a tenth per 
year. Rhineland-Palatinate followed suit by 
adopting legislation on specifi  c details in summer 2012, although its state constitu-tion only contains rather vague defi  cit re-
duction obligations.
Adjustments for fi  nancial transactionsBoth sets of implementing legislation share 
one thing on common: the ban on borrow-ing is adjusted for net fi  nancial transactions, 
which are defi  ned, like at central govern-
ment level, on the basis of the classifi  cation 
scheme for public budgets. The European defi  cit rules, by contrast, apply the defi  n-
itions used in the national accounts, which generally lay down strict profi  tability criteria 
for classifi  cation as a fi  nancial transaction, 
particularly for capital injections into public 
enterprises. Like at central government 
level, the implementing acts for Schleswig-
Holstein and Rhineland-Palatinate do not set out any provisions for cases of debt  relief, in which fi  nancial transactions are 
transformed into transfers. The intention of 
the debt brake is for these transactions to 
be counted towards the borrowing limit 
even if payment is not made in the year in 
question. One aspect of the legislation that 
appears to have been closely modelled on 
the EU defi  cit rules, however, is the require-
ment to adjust for movements in reserves, 
which means that, like fi  nancial transac-
tions, additions to and withdrawals from reserves do not count towards the new borrowing limit. Reserves (formed out of 
borrowing authorisations not used for cur-
rent budget funding) are traditionally used 
to bridge temporary budget shortfalls. Fac-
toring movements in reserves out of the 
borrowing limit means that this option, like 
the use of privatisation proceeds to plug 
gaps in the budget, will no longer be avail-
able in the future. Under the terms of the 
debt brake, it will therefore no longer be 
possible to cover future pension payments 
using the reserves formed during the past decade or so. Expenditure resulting from 
the release of reserves will have to be fully counterfi  nanced in the current budget.
Cyclical adjustmentThe implementing legislation also incorpor-
ates cyclical adjustment requirements. Un-
like the central government procedure, which is largely based on the method ap-
plied for budgetary surveillance at European 
level, the legislation in Schleswig-Holstein 
and Rhineland-Palatinate requires the “nor-
mal tax revenue” to be approximated by ex-
trapolating a past estimate using a typical 
rate of change. The precise calculation pro-
cedures still have to be specifi  ed in imple-
menting regulations. Differences between Deutsche Bundesbank

actual and normal tax revenues are then 
treated as a cyclical effect and factored out 
of the structural balance.1 The likely out-
come for Schleswig-Holstein is that the 
budget ceiling under the state  legislation implementing the debt brake will usually 
deviate from the budget ceiling determined 
under the administrative agreement with 
central government regarding the granting 
of consolidation aid. Generally speaking, 
employing different cyclical adjustment pro-
cedures makes it more diffi   cult to coordin-
ate budgetary policies within a federal sys-
tem. However, the legislation for both 
Schleswig-Holstein and Rhineland-Palatinate 
reiterates a key provision of the German constitution, namely the requirement to avoid a systematic rise in debt  resulting from a predominance of reported cyclical 
downswings – although both federal states 
will need to adopt a regulation to imple-
ment this requirement. A suitable corrective 
mechanism which takes account of nega-
tive deviations from the normal tax revenue 
would appear to be crucial in this respect. 
The growth rate of normal tax revenue 
should be determined on the basis of a ref-
erence period that includes full economic 
cycles wherever possible, and should not be 
infl  uenced by past changes in tax legisla-
tion. The effects of any legislative changes 
during the planning period would then 
have to be classifi  ed as structural – as is the 
case in the implementing legislation in Rhineland-Palatinate  – and the trend tax 
revenue adjusted accordingly.
Off-budget entitiesAnother important factor is how the scope 
of the debt brake is defi  ned. Article 109 III 
of the German constitution refers only to central and state government budgets, 
meaning that exceptions for off-budget en-
tities do not appear out of the question. 
However, the obligation stated in the pre-ceding Article 109 II to comply with EU re-quirements (such as the objective enshrined in the Stability and Growth Pact to achieve 
at least close-to-balance or fully balanced general government budgets in the me-dium term) suggests that the strict con-
straints must also be applied to all entities 
outside the core budgets, provided they be-long to the general government sector. The 
legislation in Schleswig-Holstein does not 
specify the scope of the debt brake. Yet the 
state’s administrative agreement with cen-
tral government on the granting of consoli-
dation aid until the end of 2019 prevents 
the transfer of debt fi  nancing to off-budget 
entities. The Rhineland-Palatinate constitu-
tion, meanwhile, specifi  es that the borrow-
ing limit should also include capital bor-
rowed for state government-owned enter-
prises whose debts must be serviced by the 
state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The imple-
menting legislation makes it clear that the 
road construction and real estate manage-
ment enterprises which have hitherto been 
recipients of debt fi  nancing will therefore 
have to be taken into account as well. The 
fact that Rhineland-Palatinate has defi  ned 
the scope of the debt brake so extensively 
and at such an early stage is to be wel-comed as it will encourage a rapid and 
comprehensive consolidation of state gov-
ernment fi  nances, as is generally required.2
1 This approach aims to ensure that, assuming tax le-
gislation remains unchanged, the estimated structural 
revenue will develop more evenly than would be the 
case in the usual cyclical adjustment procedures, 
thereby permitting greater planning certainty. Given the high estimation uncertainty, however, regular re-assessments of the structural budget situation will 
probably ultimately be unavoidable if the objective of 
curbing public debt stipulated in the German constitu-tion is to be fulfi  lled.2 By contrast, the relevant clause included in the deci-
sion by Hesse’s state parliament to enact legislation 
implementing the debt brake contains loopholes. Al-
though borrowing by special funds requires statutory 
authorisation, it will apparently not be included in the borrowing limit.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
October 2012

Control account
Both sets of implementing legislation also 
provide for the creation of a control ac-count. Like those at central government level, the borrowing limits for Schleswig-
Holstein and Rhineland-Palatinate apply to 
both budget planning and budget outturn. 
Any differences between the budget out-turn and the budget target are posted to this account. While a negative balance of 5% of trend tax revenue is defi  ned as the ceiling for this account in Schleswig-
Holstein, in Rhineland-Palatinate, much like at central government level, it is as high as 
15% and thus offers a much wider toler-ance interval for budgetary deviations. As  deviations between the actual and budgeted tax revenues are considered en-
tirely cyclical under the cyclical adjustment 
procedure used here and thus exempted 
from the borrowing limit, the actual risk of 
the control account being debited on ac-
count of unforeseen developments is much lower, however. Against this backdrop, the 
option available to Rhineland-Palatinate, 
like central government, to take out struc-
tural borrowing amounting to 3% of trend tax revenue in supplementary budgets does 
not appear appropriate as it could encour-
age the state government to pass supple-
mentary budgets which create defi  cits.
Repayment rules if targets are not met
The borrowing limit can be temporarily 
breached by invoking exemption clauses or, 
on a limited scale, if unexpected develop-
ments occur when the budget is being im-
plemented. The repayment rules applicable in such cases might cause diffi   culties if they 
are not strict enough – a problem that could also beset central government. Par-ticularly if repayment can be postponed with a vague reference to unfavourable macroeconomic developments, this could ultimately undermine the objective of curb-
ing government debt (as occurred under 
the previous investment-related rule with its 
reference to averting a “disruption of the macroeconomic equilibrium”). For the ex-ceptional case of budgetary burdens not 
caused by the federal state itself, the imple-
menting legislation in Rhineland-Palatinate 
specifi  es that annual borrowing must be 
 reduced in stages over four years and sub-
sequently repaid in eight equal annual tranches. Repayment can be postponed if central government’s Annual Economic 
 Report expects real economic growth to be 
negative for the year in question. As a  result, the scope for payment deferrals in such a case is governed by a clear set of rules and regulations.
3 As far as the other 
exceptional circumstances are concerned, the implementing legislation merely states that debt should be repaid in an unspeci-fi  ed, “cyclically appropriate” manner. The implementing act in Schleswig-Holstein provides for the possibility of deferring 
 repayment on cyclical grounds, though only 
if the control account ceiling is breached. 
However, the constitutional rule governing 
the reduction of debts incurred when the exceptional clause is invoked is not speci-
fi  ed in greater detail (“within an appropriate 
time frame”). Specifying a fi  xed repayment 
relative to the budget volume or to trend 
tax revenue is an option worth considering here.
3 The Annual Economic Report is not available until 
late January, ie after regular budgetary legislation has 
been passed, thus rendering budget planning some-
what more diffi   cult.Deutsche Bundesbank

The Stability Council concluded in May 2012 
that all five federal states receiving consolida -
tion assistance had met their commitments in 
2011.15 However, the fact that the ceilings – like 
that for central government – were set on the 
basis of inflated starting deficits should be 
viewed critically. This has resulted in relatively 
unambitious reduction paths and opened up 
the problematic but politically attractive possi -
bility of postponing the necessary overall con -
solidation.16 Nonetheless, under the cyclical ad -
justment procedure which the Bundesbank ap -
plies to budgets in the general government 
sector, last year’s structural developments were 
indeed favourable in the states receiving con -
solidation assistance (see chart above). The 
consolidation achieved by these states ranges 
in size from three-tenths of the 2010 structural 
deficit in Saarland to three-fifths in Berlin. How -
ever, it must be borne in mind that the condi -
tions for reducing deficits were particularly 
good in 2011. The improvements were there -
fore due, not least, to very favourable tax rev -enue developments. In addition, the fact that 
the one-off burdens which had inflated the 
starting structural deficits, such as the crisis 
management measures in 2009-10, are now 
absent will probably make it much easier to 
meet the deficit reduction requirements in the 
first couple of years. Interest savings resulting 
from the very favourable refinancing conditions 
likewise had an impact. Despite the positive de -
velopments, the volatility of cyclically adjusted 
tax revenue means that there is by no means 
any room for complacency. Experience shows 
that, without substantial structural adjustment 
measures in the budget of the federal state 
concerned, a structural improvement should 
not simply be projected into the future.
In future, restructuring reports for the states of 
Berlin, Bremen, Saarland and Schleswig-
Holstein, which the Stability Council classified 
in 2011 as being at risk of a budgetary emer -
gency, must be compiled in order to provide 
more detailed information on the progress 
made in improving their finances through con -
solidation measures.17 While the interim reports 
submitted by these federal states in May show 
that they made substantial efforts last year, the 
reports themselves leave something to be de -
sired. Some of the required consolidation 
measures were not specified in detail and 
barely extend beyond 2012.18 Bremen’s report 
in particular does not contain many details. Requirements 
for 2011 fulfilled but inflated starting deficits allow consolida-tion to be post -
ponedRestructuring  reports only offer very limited insightStructural deficits of the federal states receiving consolidation assistance

15 Under the administrative agreements, structural deficits 
are calculated using a special approach, one consequence 
being that discrepancies between actual tax revenue and 
the values estimated when the budget was drawn up are 
classified as cyclically induced. See the relevant documents

17 One of the main responsibilities of the Stability Council, 
which was set up in 2010, is to review on an annual basis 
whether any of the 16 federal states or central government 
is in danger of experiencing a budgetary emergency. If such 
a danger is identified using a system of ratios with alert 
thresholds, the government entity in question must take 
measures to counter this danger as part of a restructuring 
programme.

Both the stated justification for this – that only 
non-specific deficit reduction objectives could 
be prescribed in view of the top-down budget -
ing approach which generally applies – and the 
report’s reference to the efforts made by 
Bremen over many years to improve its finances 
are unconvincing given that this state faces a 
particularly pressing need for consolidation. In 
addition, the planning in the report appears to 
be based on relatively optimistic assumptions, 
not least regarding personnel expenditure. All 
in all, to ensure that the new surveillance pro -
cedure is successful, it is important to base the 
programmes on cautious assumptions and pro -
vide details right at the beginning of the pro -
gramme on the consolidation measures re -
quired to plug the identified budget gap for the 
entire restructuring period.
The fact that many of the federal states under -
going a restructuring programme have re -
corded safety margins below the deficit ceilings 
is a welcome development, not least in view of 
the considerable uncertainty regarding near-
term macroeconomic developments and the 
course that the European sovereign debt crisis 
may take. Federal states would be well advised 
not to curtail consolidation efforts if develop -
ments in their budgets are temporarily more 
favourable than expected and to keep an eye 
on the gap between their deficits and the aver -
age of the other states, and not just focus on 
their own absolute deficit levels. Should the 
other states decide to take measures which 
create budget burdens – eg distinct tax cuts – 
because their financial situation is significantly 
better, there is a danger of state government 
falling considerably behind in the task of deficit 
reduction. It remains essential to critically as -
sess the efficiency of all expenditure, including 
that in key areas of responsibility such as edu -
cation and security. In addition, depending on 
the amount of consolidation required, it could 
become necessary to make full use of all po -
tential avenues for boosting revenue above 
and beyond the increases in real estate pur -
chase tax that have already been implemented. 
In particular, the degree to which fees cover costs or the possibility of extending user 
charges to further services could be key areas 
to look at.
Fiscal Compact
In addition to the consolidation requirements 
imposed through the debt brake, which have 
more of a long-term focus, the federal states 
were concerned that the ratification of the 
European Fiscal Compact would lead to an 
additional need for short-term adjustments. 
While the debt brake in the German Basic Law 
sets few requirements for the transitional 
period up to 2020, the Fiscal Compact ultim -
ately obliges general government to achieve a 
close-to-balance budget in structural terms. As 
the social security schemes currently have con -
siderable surpluses, which are likely to recede 
again in the foreseeable future, central, state 
and local government may have to reduce their 
deficits more rapidly than required by the na -
tional rules.19 Central government made certain 
concessions in late June 2012 in return for the 
federal states approving the Fiscal Compact in 
the Bundesrat. It agreed to provide additional 
funds for childcare places for infants, bring for -
ward its assumption of the costs incurred by 
municipalities for basic allowances for the eld -
erly and the disabled and contribute to integra -
tion payments for the disabled. In addition, it 
was agreed that issuance of joint central and 
state government bonds would be permitted 
from 2013 onwards, although probably with -
out joint and several liability. Nonetheless, 
given that there are only limited yield spreads 
between Federal securities and those of even 
highly indebted federal states, it is safe to as -
sume that market participants generally already 
take it as read that the German federation Rigorously 
 reduce deficit and plan in safety margin below ceilingsConcessions by central govern-ment in connec-tion with Fiscal Compact
19 The draft Act concerning the implementation of the 
 Fiscal Compact within Germany ( Entwurf eines Gesetzes 
zur innerstaatlichen Umsetzung des Fiskalvertrages; 
Bundesrats-Drucksache  571/12) envisages a deficit ceiling 
for general government. As a general principle, the federal 
states appear to have accepted that the structurally bal -
anced budget required of them will have to include the 
municipalities.Deutsche Bundesbank

would step in if a budgetary emergency were 
to arise in one of the federal states. Finally, the 
Act governing contributions to sanction pay -
ments (Sanktionszahlungs-Aufteilungsgesetz)  is 
to be amended so that central government will 
pay any sanctions applied up to 2020 as a re -
sult of the stricter requirements.
Outlook
Following the clear decline in the deficit in 
2011, the favourable developments in the fed -
eral states’ core budgets continued up to the 
end of August 2012. The 4% year-on-year rise 
in revenue was still mainly attributable to the 
strong growth in tax receipts (+7½%). At 2%, 
the rise in expenditure was much slower in the 
first eight months of 2012, resulting in a year-
on-year decrease of almost €3½ billion in the 
deficit. Stronger growth – mainly in current 
transfers to municipalities and personnel ex -
penditure – contrasted with a clear decline in 
investment spending, primarily as a result of 
the expiry of the 2009 programmes. Although 
in the summer the Federal Ministry of Finance 
did not forecast any actual decline in the deficit 
for state government core budgets in 2012, it 
did predict that the deficit would fall continu -
ously in the subsequent years (to €1 billion in 
2016) provided that tax revenue continues to 
grow significantly by 4½% per year.20 These fig -
ures already include the foreseeable burdens 
stemming from the reduction in the special 
supplementary central government grants for 
the east German states and Berlin – which cur -
rently fund as much as around a tenth of state 
and local government expenditure in these re -
gions – and a steady rise in civil servant pension 
costs. However, projections of this kind which 
indicate that deficits will be reduced in the me -
dium term have often been proved wrong in 
the past. In some cases the projected consoli -
dation was not actually implemented, in others 
macroeconomic developments did not live up 
to expectations. Notably, near-term develop -
ments with regard to the European sovereign debt crisis hold substantial risks for state gov -
ernment finances, too.
To ensure that their deficits are actually re -
duced, it would seem appropriate for the fed -
eral states to rapidly and rigorously enshrine 
the debt brake in their state legislation. They 
would be well advised to set binding minimum 
reduction paths which require the ceilings to 
be lowered steadily in equal steps, beginning 
with the budgetary status quo  – which, at last 
report, was more favourable than forecast. As 
the budget burdens caused by the 2008-09 
 financial and economic crisis turned out to be 
smaller than initially expected, it would make 
sense, in the interests of limiting future debt 
servicing costs, for most states not to use all of 
the lengthy transitional period granted in the 
German Basic Law before the general borrow -
ing ban comes into force. The states should use 
the favourable environment at present as an 
opportunity to take swift measures which have 
a lasting impact. This is especially important for 
states whose per capita  deficit is still particu -
larly high and which therefore still need to con -
solidate particularly extensively. Otherwise, 
they risk having to make substantial cuts shortly 
before the general borrowing ban comes into 
force – under intense time pressure and, 
 potentially, in a more difficult macroeconomic 
setting.
As the federal states are benefiting from dis -
tinctly higher tax revenue and lower interest 
rates than were expected when the new debt 
rules were adopted in 2009, the objective of 
ensuring a balanced budget – including safety 
margins below the limit – by 2020 should be 
achievable even for the states with high def -
icits. However, unlike states starting from a bet -
ter position, these high-deficit states will have 
barely any room for notable tax cuts. To ensure 
that the debt brake requirements are met from 
2020 onwards, it is therefore necessary, where Budget forecasts

tax cuts exceed the level deemed necessary in 
accordance with the German Basic Law, to ei -
ther offset them on the revenue side or only 
allow states which already have sound finances 
to lower tax rates (eg through regional dis -
counts).
Given the uncertainty involved in estimating 
structural deficits, and the negative shocks 
which occur from time to time, it is also ex -
tremely important for all states to leave a dis -
tinct safety margin below their borrowing 
limits, at least when drawing up their budgets. 
Otherwise, they risk being forced to take pro -
cyclical measures in order to meet the require -
ments should developments take an unex -
pected turn for the worse. To obey the letter 
and spirit of the new budgetary rules, there 
ultimately needs to be a fundamental change 
in budgetary policy, which often still seems 
more focused on optimally exploiting the gen -
erally permissible borrowing leeway – and in -
terpreting it loosely where necessary.
The administrative agreements for the states 
receiving consolidation assistance and the bor -
rowing limit introduced in Rhineland-Palatinate 
explicitly include government sector off-budget 
entities in the debt rules. In view of the exten -
sive spin-offs from core budgets, this is particu -
larly important in order to limit the debt of all 
federal states effectively. Such an inclusion 
would be in keeping with the letter and spirit 
of the German Basic Law and would increase 
the likelihood of curtailing debt growth on a 
long-term basis. In this respect, strictly defined 
financial transactions can be factored out of 
the borrowing limit. Given the estimation un -
certainty involved in cyclical adjustment, it is 
also important to have an effective means of 
ensuring that distortions in the cyclical com -
ponents that are actually taken into account do 
not incrementally inflate the debt level (eg an 
additional control account).21Alongside the debt brake, the state govern -
ment revenue-sharing scheme has also been 
the focus of growing attention. The rules 
adopted at the start of the previous decade will 
expire at the end of 2019, and the German 
Basic Law stipulates that follow-up provisions 
have to be adopted. It will also be necessary to 
clarify what differences in tax revenue capacity 
are compatible with the “equal living condi -
tions throughout Germany” mentioned in the 
Basic Law. Given the regional price differences 
within Germany, which are usually also linked 
to the economic strength and population dens -
ity of the areas concerned, a certain degree of 
divergence would seem justified. Under the 
existing rules, which largely even out differ -
ences in financial strength among the individ -
ual states and do not fully include local govern -
ment taxes, a divergence of around 10% from 
the average is currently accepted in reality. To 
take account of differences on the revenue 
side, it would make sense for the federal states 
to systematically use the existing possibilities 
for creating regional differences in civil servant 
salaries and pensions. All in all, given their vary -
ing debt levels, the individual states will also 
need to compensate for substantial differences 
in interest expenditure in their budgets. Not 
least in view of this situation, and with an eye 
to setting the right incentives, it would be 
worth considering the option of giving individ -
ual states the right to introduce surcharges or 
discounts – on income tax for example – which 
would be included on a harmonised basis in 
the state government revenue-sharing scheme. 
In addition, this would allow greater account 
to be taken of divergences in public service 
preferences between the populations of differ -
ent federal states.Necessary to

The importance of trade credit for 
 corporate financing in Germany – evidence 
from financial statements statistics
For non-financial corporations in Germany, trade credit is one of the most important Instruments 
of external financing. In some cases this special corporate credit market is an alternative to, and 
in other cases it supplements, short-term bank lending.
The basic types of trade credit are payments on account and trade payables. In the form of pay -
ments on account, trade credit is based on payment practice which has evolved and which, in 
economic sectors that have order-based production, partly offsets the prefinancing burden and 
the increased economic risk borne by suppliers with long-term production processes. On the 
whole, however, this area of trade credit accounts for roughly 5% of total assets, which is only 
around half of what the corporate sector reports on the liabilities side as supplier credit. This lat -
ter source of financing is used in particular by enterprises with a high turnover of goods. Thus it 
represents an important part of the short-term external funds needed to finance current assets. 
However, in some cases it is also used to refinance the associated large accounts payable pos -
itions that arise for German enterprises in foreign business.
Based on special analyses of the Deutsche Bundesbank’s financial statements statistics, the study 
presented in this article shows that the use of trade credit as a short-term financing instrument 
depends above all on sector-specific factors or financing requirements that result from the busi -
ness model of the enterprises concerned. Through the redistribution of liquidity within the corpor -
ate sector, the resulting trade credit chains play an important part in safeguarding the flexibility 
and stability of corporate financing. Because trade credit is collateralised by goods, it is closely 
interlinked with the business cycle. Not least, it facilitates short-term start-up financing when 
working capital is needed at the beginning of a cyclical recovery phase.
In certain sectors, however, the amount of trade credit granted involves a long-term, non-cyclical 
exposure that can reach a considerable magnitude. The systematic control of the associated risks 
calls for a professional credit and liquidity management system on the creditor side.Deutsche Bundesbank

The importance of trade 
credit in corporate financing
Supplier credits and payments on account 
(buyer credits) are usually referred to by the 
generic term “trade credit”. As the term sug -
gests, the counterparties involved maintain 
both trade relations and credit relations. Trade 
credit is a short-term debt financing instrument 
that enterprises use in connection with the sale 
of products and the performance of services, 
making it a direct component of the sales con -
tract entered into.
Where customers – upon concluding the sales 
contract but before delivery, or in the case of 
partial delivery of the goods or services – pay 
the purchase price in its entirety or in part as an 
advance payment or a payment on account,1 in 
return for which payment they sometimes re -
ceive a discount, such payments constitute 
(from the seller’s viewpoint) payments received 
on account or (from the buyer’s viewpoint) 
payments made on account. This financing ar -
rangement entails considerable advantages for 
the seller, who receives all or at least part of the 
financing for the sale from the customer.
With supplier credit, on the other hand, the 
seller grants the buyer of its goods or services a 
deadline for payment, effectively granting the 
buyer credit for a limited period of time. This 
saves the buyer having to obtain funds some 
other way and eases its short-term financial 
plan. However, once the discount period ex -
pires, this arrangement usually entails a higher 
purchase price that is not reduced by the dis -
count. On the other hand, buyers who opt not 
to use the deadline for payment and instead 
pay the invoice amount within a fixed, shorter 
period generally receive a price reduction in the 
amount of the agreed discount.2 Thus, trade 
credit gives the buyer greater financing flexibil -
ity than short-term bank credit, which is often 
made available to enterprises as a current ac -
count credit that is tailored to their operational 
requirements.When the initial supplier credit is also offered 
to the subsequent buyer in the next value 
added step, a succession of new credit rela -
tionships is created, forming a chain which may 
reach an amount that is several times the initial 
loan. Provided this process is unbroken through 
the various stages of production and sales, 
without the granted supplier credits being re -
paid by sales proceeds, say, or by bank loans, 
the credit chain can continue or may overlap 
with others. The process is limited only by the 
discount period and by the relatively high inter -
est rates charged if it is exceeded, which gener -
ally encourages punctual repayment.
Besides intra-group liabilities, supplier and cus -
tomer credits are the most important source of 
external finance for non-financial corporations 
in Germany. They even rank first in terms of 
short-term external funding.3 Whereas supplier 
credits have been at the heart of economic pol -
icy debate in the United States and France for a 
number of years,4 they have so far attracted 
relatively little attention in Germany despite Trade credit as a

1 These two financing instruments differ in that, with an 
advance payment, a repayment obligation exists in the 
event that the goods or services are not duly delivered; this 
is not the case with a payment on account. See K Küting,

2 According to surveys conducted by the credit insurer 
Atradius, roughly 50% of German enterprises grant dis -
counts; this is well above the European average of 37%. 
However, only 15% of foreign and 26% of domestic cus -
tomers take advantage of this offer. See Atradius

4 In order to limit the structural disadvantage for small and 
medium-sized enterprises due to their having less access to 
supplier credits, in France there even exist statutory pay -
ment periods with penalties for delay. The maximum period 
was recently fixed at 60 calendar days under the Law to 
modernise the economy (LME, loi no 2008-776) at the be -
ginning of 2009. In Germany, the Act to accelerate due 
payments ( Gesetz zur Beschleunigung fälliger Zahlun gen) 
of 30 March 2010 merely stipulates the point in time from 
which a debtor is overdue (30 days after the invoice is 
drawn up). Under the Directive on combating late payment 
in commercial transactions (Directive 2011/7/EU) of 16 Feb -
ruary 2011, which must be transposed into national law by 
2013, the term for payment is, as a general principle, 
limited to 60 days for enterprises in the European Union.Deutsche Bundesbank

their outstanding importance for short-term 
corporate financing.
Trade credits from the 
 supplier’s and the buyer’s 
perspective
Trade credit offers enterprises an alternative 
source of finance to, and in some cases also 
complements, the short-term bank loan. Above 
all, then, the use of these sales-related credits 
primarily depends on the extent to which they 
meet enterprises’ specific financing needs or on 
the economic advantages such credits offer 
supplier and buyer compared with other trad -
itional short-term corporate financing instru -
ments.
Payments received on account constitute a par -
ticularly important instrument for enterprises 
with long-term order-based production and 
the financing problems that entails. According 
to the contractual provisions governing the 
transfer of ownership set forth in the German 
Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch),  a claim 
for payment is generally not created until the 
final acceptance of the ordered product or ser -
vice by the customer. However, the prefinanc -
ing burden resulting from such provisions under 
the law of obligations and the attendant, 
heightened economic risk for the service pro -
vider can be offset, in part at least, by agreeing 
in the sales contract that the buyer will make 
payments on account of the order.5 The cus -
tomer usually has these payments guaranteed 
by an advance payment bond (guarantee is -
sued by the supplier’s bank) to protect itself 
against the supplier’s insolvency.
One key argument in favour of supplier credits 
is that this form of financing is initially less ex -
pensive than borrowing from a bank, because 
payment of the purchase price is deferred on 
an interest-free basis for the duration of the 
discount period. On the other hand, if the cus -
tomer overshoots this relatively tight time -
frame, the supplier credit usually turns into a rather expensive financing instrument because 
the effective interest rate that is actually 
charged when the customer forgoes the dis -
count amounts to several times the current ac -
count interest rate normally charged. For ex -
ample, with a deadline for payment of 30 days 
and a 2% discount for an eight-day discount 
period, the effective interest rate works out at 
roughly 40% per year. Even though creditors 
may, to an extent, tolerate the deadline being 
overshot, the resulting interest rates are still 
likely to be clearly in excess of those that are 
usually charged for current account credits in 
the commercial sector, and which according to 
the interest rate statistics of the Deutsche Bun -
desbank were between 5% and 7% per year 
over the last few years.
A comparison of financing cost would very 
likely produce the same results, even if the 
credit and default risks of the two financing in -
struments were assessed as being different or if 
there were differences in dunning and collec -
tion cost. Thus, supplier credits are particularly 
advantageous to business customers if they 
can be repeatedly revolved without compound 
interest effects, so that the formally agreed dis -
count deadline de facto  never comes into ef -
fect or – owing to tough competition in the 
sales market – a suitable discount has already 
been priced into the selling price and a longer 
cost-free payment period is granted.6
Supplier credit is also an option for enterprises 
seeking credit as a short-term financing solu -
tion when lending to companies is rationed by 
banks because of information asymmetries, for 
example because of high cost in and obstacles Main source

6 According to the most recent study on enterprises’ pay -
ment behaviour conducted by the credit insurer Atradius, 
44.2% of German companies surveyed made use of dis -
count arrangements for sales on deferred terms. See Atra-

to procuring information about a potential cus -
tomer’s creditworthiness. Such adverse selec -
tion problems affecting the credit market have 
been observed in the United States, for ex -
ample, in connection with particularly dynamic 
enterprises experiencing their first business 
growth phase, yet with only low capital ratios 
and cash flows. In such a case, supplier credit 
represents an important substitute for the 
short-term bank loan.7 In the trade sector, 
which is characterised by a high turnover of 
goods, supplier credit is particularly attractive 
because the payment obligations can be paid 
in their entirety or in part from the proceeds 
from the goods purchased (pay-as-you-earn 
principle). Thus, fewer short-term bank loans 
are needed to finance current assets.
Use of supplier credit is also an attractive finan -
cing instrument from the customer’s viewpoint 
as it entails little effort and gives a great deal of 
flexibility. Financing provided by banks might 
call for lengthier negotiations. What is more, 
additional information and, in some cases, 
additional collateral would have to be furnished 
depending on the amount and life of the loan 
arrangement.8 This – not inconsiderable – ef -
fort is not necessary when supplier credit is 
agreed, as it is usually part and parcel of the 
general business conditions and therefore a 
constituent part of the preformulated wording 
of the sales contract.
Seen from the seller’s perspective, supplier 
credits serve as a marketing instrument by 
allowing the buyer generous periods for pay -
ment, and thus stimulate or safeguard sales. 
This allows the seller to strengthen customer 
loyalty or establish new customer ties.
In addition, supplier credit gives the seller a var -
iety of ways to hide price discrimination by 
granting more generous payment deadlines 
and discount arrangements. These aspects 
come to the fore when it is legally prohibited to 
openly grant price advantages,9 or when 
openly giving individual customer groups pref -erential treatment could trigger a severe coun -
terreaction on the part of the other buyers.
From the creditor’s viewpoint, this form of 
short-term financing also offers particular ad -
vantages with regard to the ongoing monitor -
ing of exposures. Looming sales and financing 
problems are reflected very early on by the ac -
tual order and payment behaviour of the buyer, 
and so provide indications of the risk of de -
fault. Even in the event of bankruptcy, the pro -
vider of supplier credit is in a better position 
than other providers of capital, as the liquid -
ation of the former’s claims ranks before the 
claims of all other creditors and enjoys 
far-reaching and systematic protection in that 
the goods – up to and including the finished 
product – are ring-fenced under reservation of 
ownership provisions. Thus, the value of the 
collateral in the form of the delivered goods 
and services is high, and the far-reaching con -
sequences in the event of the buyer’s refusal to 
pay have in themselves a certain preventive dis -
ciplining effect with regard to the buyer’s pay -
ment behaviour.
Yet another argument in favour of supplier 
credit is that this instrument can also serve as 
an efficient means of overcoming the informa -
tion asymetry that exists between supplier and 
buyer with regard to the quality of the prod -
ucts and services offered. If the supplier gives 
the buyer a payment deferral after providing 
the product, the supplier can largely dispense 
with furnishing detailed information on the 
quality of the product, as the buyer is able to 
gain an accurate impression of the quality prior 
to paying the invoice. By granting a period for Supplier credit 
leads to flexibil-ity and efficiency gains

payment, the seller signals to the buyer that he 
is buying a product that indeed complies with 
the agreed quality attributes.
Finally, supplier credit also constitutes an im -
portant liquidity management parameter for 
enterprises. This is seen in particular in the con -
cept of working capital management (WCM).10 
Amongst other things, WCM entails a targeted 
debtor management system under which com -
panies set as tight payment deadlines as pos -
sible for their own customers and rigorously 
send out reminders in respect of deadlines that 
are not met. At the same time, they systemat -
ically take advantage of the payment deferrals 
that are granted by suppliers. This enables en -
terprises to reduce the cost of financing current 
assets and use the available financial resources 
for other operational purposes. The aim of this 
approach is to reduce the length of time capital 
is tied up in the company’s current assets. The 
financial leeway thus obtained can be used, for 
example, to finance fixed assets, external 
growth and innovation.
Trade credit reflected in 
 financial statements analysis
The extrapolated results for the years 2002 
to 2009 of the Bundesbank’s financial state -
ments statistics show that trade credit – with 
an average of €345.2 billion for the observa -
tion period – is the second most important ex -
ternal financing instrument used by 
non-financial corporations in Germany after 
intergroup loans (€399.4 billion), and is the 
most important source of short-term external 
financing.11 Measured in terms of the balance 
sheet total, trade credit reached a ratio of 
15.8%. Long and short-term borrowing from 
banks is one percentage point lower. In con -
trast, bonds posted on the liabilities side of in -
dividual accounts, as the capital market’s con -
tribution to corporate financing, chalked up a 
volume of only €22.3 billion, which is equiva -
lent to a share in the balance sheet total of 
only 1.0%. However, we should bear in mind when interpreting these figures that the Bun -
desbank’s financial statements statistics do not 
cover all economic sectors and are based solely 
on individual financial statements of domestic 
enterprises. The latter factor means that the fi -
nancing of groups is reflected in the reported 
results only to a limited extent. Within a group, 
bank loans are often taken out and bonds is -
sued through foreign financing subsidiaries or 
parent companies, and then appear in the indi -
vidual financial statements only partially as 
 intra-group liabilities.
Roughly one-third of trade credits reported on 
the liabilities side of annual financial statements 
comprise payments received on account 
(€116.9 billion); enterprises take up the remain -
ing €228.3 billion in the form of trade payables 
to suppliers.12 All in all, however, payments on 
account – unlike supplier credits – generate a 
net contribution to corporate financing, as the 
payments made on account are much lower in 
total than the payments received on account 
from the corporate sector. This finding is attrib -
utable to the fact that payments received on 
account are made not only by domestic enter -
prises but also by the government and by 
buyers abroad, for instance.Important par-

10 The aim of working capital management is to minimise 
net current assets while bearing in mind that there must be 
no short-term liquidity bottlenecks. Working capital is de -
fined as liquid funds plus short-term receivables and inven -

11 Given the strong cyclicality of trade credit, the following 
information does not relate to the financial statements 
statistics of a single year but to average figures for the 
years 2002 to 2009.
12 In the present study the total amount of supplier credits 
is understated due to the accounting standards of the Ger -
man Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch ). Pursuant to 
section 265 (3) sentence 1 of the German Commercial 
Code, the group-related shares in trade payables and re -
ceivables must be stated in the intra-group claims and li -
abilities. Since the amount of the claims and liabilities that 
are reclassified under this provision is shown separately 
only in large-scale financial statements and the utilisation 
of financing sources shows substantial size-specific differ -
ences, it is not possible to make comprehensive and reli -
able corrections to this reclassification of supplier credits 
carried out under the above legal provision.Deutsche Bundesbank

A breakdown of payments on account by eco -
nomic sector demonstrates that they represent 
a special financing instrument that is commonly 
used in certain sectors with a prolonged pro -
duction period and to-order fabrication. Total -
ling €36.2 billion and €20.6 billion respectively, 
payments received on account are predomin -
antly focused on the construction sector and 
mechanical engineering; measured in terms of 
total assets, these sectors have a share of 
29.0% and 13.9% respectively. Only business-
related services likewise show a relatively large 
share of €14.3 billion (7.6%); this is likely due 
above all to the terms of payment agreed in 
connection with the production of software 
and similar firm-specific services. In the case of 
the corporate features “legal form” and “enter -
prise size”, which are highly correlated with 
each other, there are very few differences. For 
example, the shares for payments made on ac -
count range from 0.6% for micro-enterprises 
to 2.0% for large enterprises. Medium-sized 
enterprises benefit most from payments on ac -count carried on the liabilities side (7.1%), while 
the shares calculated for firms in the lowest 
size category (5.6%) and large enterprises 
(4.7%) were at a significantly lower level.
The stock of supplier receivables, which as an 
average for the years 2002 to 2009 is just over 
€57 billion higher than the corresponding li -
abilities, is due primarily to German industry’s 
strong focus on exports. This is because, par -
ticularly for deliveries abroad, it is usual to 
grant considerably longer payment periods 
than in Germany. To an extent, however, these 
high supplier receivables are also the result of 
overdue payments,13 and so indicate that 
non-resident customers’ payment behaviour is 
poorer (see also the box on pages 58 and 59).14 
This is probably due, amongst other things, to 
the lower status attributed to creditor protec -
tion in the legal systems of those countries. As 
the breakdown of supplier receivables by eco -
nomic sector shows, they are concentrated on 
export-oriented sectors as well as on sectors 
with, for the most part, order-based produc -
tion. The wholesale trade is at the forefront, 
accounting for 25.4% (€62.6 billion), followed 
by business-related services (18.3%, €34.2 bil -
lion), construction (16.7%, €20.9 billion) and 
mechanical engineering (14.0%, €20.7 billion).
The volume of supplier liabilities in Germany is 
closely related to the financing needs as a re -
sult of trade receivables. This financing instru -
ment is used, above all, by enterprises from the 
trade sector (wholesale trade €45.4 billion, re -
tail trade €34.1 billion and trade of motor ve -
hicles and repairs €11.8 billion) and the con -
struction sector (€15.7 billion). This reflects the 
fact that commercial enterprises with their high 
turnover of goods specifically use trade credits 
to finance their stocks, and then settle their in -German indus-

generate. In this way they are able to finance 
very large holdings of current assets with com -
paratively little own funds. Retailers in particu -
lar do not need to offer nearly as much supplier 
credit as the corresponding liabilities they are 
able to use. Thus, they benefit most from this 
form of corporate financing. In contrast, whole -
sale enterprises and providers of business-
related services tend to be net creditors, as 
they (have to) grant their buyers generous pay -
ment periods while they themselves (are able 
to) take out less credit with their suppliers.Finally, the extrapolated results show that small

many are not disadvantaged with regard to 
supplier credit.15 Whereas mainly medium-sized 
German enterprises have the largest share of 
supplier receivables in relation to total assets 
(18.1%) – and not micro-enterprises (16.9%) –

The importance of trade credit in selected euro-area 
 countries
The importance of trade credit in the manu-
facturing sectors in Germany, France, Italy 
and Spain is very heterogeneous. This is the 
result of an evaluation of the period from 
2002 to 2010 of the BACH database1 of the 
European Committee of Central Balance 
Sheet Data Offi   ces (ECCBSO), which con-
tains harmonised data on non-fi  nancial cor-porations in selected European Union coun-
tries. The smallest share of this fi  nancing 
instrument in relation to the balance sheet 
total is held by Germany – at around 6%. 
The trade credit ratio in the southern Euro-
pean countries is generally around three 
times higher, whereby Italy is clearly in the 
lead with well over 20%. With somewhat 
lower share values, France and Spain have 
attained a similar level. Moreover, it is worth 
noting that the economic downturn brought about by the fi  nancial and eco-
nomic crisis has had a much greater effect 
on the fi  nancing structure in those three 
countries as a result of the weight of trade 
credit declining by around fi  ve percentage points compared with what was observed 
for German manufacturing corporations.
The greater importance attributed to trade 
credit in the southern European countries compared with Germany was initially as-
sumed to be the result of the low availabil-ity of short-term bank loans.
2 However, this 
assumption is refuted by the fact that Italian 
fi  nancial corporations in particular record 
relatively high short-term bank liabilities and 
by the comparatively low short-term ratio 
of bank indebtedness of the respective Ger-man corporations. Instead, the strong devi-
ations refl  ect structural differences in pay-ment behaviour. According to a study by 
Creditreform, it is relatively commonplace in 
Italy and Spain for payment periods to be 
exceeded by more than 30 days; this holds true in around 25% of all cases.
3 In France, 
where a comparable value of 15% was es-tablished, the exceeding of deadlines is sub-
ject to statutory regulation, which, how-ever, only takes effect once the threshold value of 60 days has been overshot. The higher the actual maturity of trade credit, the higher also per se the share of liabilities 
in the annual accounts. Alternatively, high 
trade credit ratios may also stem from tak-
ing up revolving short-term trade loans. 
However, this scenario would require an ac-
celerated turnover of goods and strongly concentrated relationships with suppliers, 
which is a rare occurrence in the manufac-turing sector.
The exceptional situation of German cor-porations can partly be explained by the relevant regulations of German property law, which – through its reservation of ownership provisions – gives trade credit providers direct access to the delivered goods as well as the fi  nished products a 
preferential status when it comes to liquid-ating claims. The effects relating to the size 
of enterprises also come into play here. 
These effects are due, inter alia, to the fact 
that the non-extrapolated results of the 
BACH database in the case of German cor-
porations are very strongly affected by the 
situation of large enterprises, which make considerably less use of trade credit and 
which – on the whole – carry substantially 
more weight than large enterprises in the 
other countries.4
Furthermore, German data are compara-tively understated, as German accounting law stipulates that trade payables and re-ceivables as well as services within the group must be recorded as intra-group li-

are not taken into account in the BACH database. Moreover, German large enterprises are substantially 
larger than their foreign competitors in terms of single-entity fi  nancial statements, which means that the data provided by them infl  uence the cumulated results to a much greater extent.Deutsche Bundesbank

comparison, large enterprises represent the 
group of firms with the smallest shares of sup -
plier receivables and supplier liabilities; this 
finding is probably to be explained – in part, at 
least – by their special financial strength. Large 
enterprises usually generate relatively high in -
come and cash flows, and are more likely to be 
interested in receiving discounts rather than 
long payment periods in view of their ample li -
quidity and their professional debtor manage -
ment.
Empirical findings based on 
an evaluation of micro-data
In order to conduct more in-depth structural 
analyses of the use and provision of trade 
credit, use is made of anonymised micro-data 
from the Deutsche Bundesbank’s data pool.16 
Here, the enterprises on which data are avail -
able for the observation period are grouped ac -
cording to whether they report relatively high or relatively low supplier receivables and sup -
plier liabilities in their balance sheets.17 Because 
of the strong effect that individual large enter -
prises could potentially have, ratios for these 
categories are calculated not on the basis of 
weighted averages, but of median values which 
represent group-typical means.
The findings of the evaluation of the micro-
data illustrate that, to a considerable extent, 
the firms with the largest shares of trade re -
ceivables are at the same time those with large 
holdings of supplier liabilities. Moreover, this

German enterprises’ detailed fi  nancial state-
ments, an exact quantifi  cation is not pos-sible. However, if a similar defi  nition were 
used, it is likely that the data for Germany 
would exceed the corresponding values in 
the BACH database by a few percentage 
points.Trade credit in selected euro-area

ities side is reflected in comparable balance 
sheet and income statement ratios. For ex -
ample, enterprises with high trade receivables 
also have a much higher ratio of supplier liabil -
ities (16.8%) compared with the benchmark 
group (9.3%). Similarly, enterprises which make 
greater use of supplier credit to finance their 
business operations have, on average, debtor 
portfolios stemming from trade receivables 
which are roughly two-thirds higher (22.5% as 
opposed to 13.9%). This relative symmetry on 
the assets and liabilities side of the enterprises 
concerned suggests that, in Germany, supplier 
credit primarily serves the function of compen -
sating, at least in part, the financing needs as a result of the large portfolios of trade receiva -
bles.
Enterprises with relatively large supplier credit 
volumes on their balance sheets are character -
ised on the one hand by significantly less cap -
ital intensity and correspondingly lower depre -
ciation of tangible fixed assets. On the other 
hand, however, they also have a tighter capital 
base and less production depth. This group of 
enterprises uses comparatively larger cash 
holdings and bank deposits to meet unforesee -
able short-term liquidity needs.
In the case of bank liabilities, enterprises which 
act to a greater extent as trade credit providers 
have a share of 11.8% (roughly one-third below 
the corresponding ratio for enterprises with 
relatively low supplier receivables), which is 
also reflected in a markedly lower interest ex -
pense ratio. However, the lower level of bank 
borrowing is primarily due to lower investment 
needs (which is seen in the considerably lower 
tangible fixed assets ratio) and, therefore, also 
in the lower demand for long-term investment 
credit on the part of trade credit providers. This 
is also revealed by the fact that there are no 
appreciable differences between the two 
groups with regard to short-term bank loans. 
To an extent, these group-specific differences 
in financing are also attributable to the fact 
that the substantial refinancing via supplier li -
abilities that arises for enterprises which pro -
vide corporate financing leads to a reduction in 
the demand for credit from this classic source 
of funding. Finally, it can be observed that, in 
the case of the lower margins that result from 
the lower production depth and from the com -
paratively high cost-of-materials ratio in rela -
tion to gross revenue (64.9% compared with 
56.4%), the enterprises’ earnings and cash 
flows are distinctly lower than for the group of 
enterprises that have only small trade receiva -
bles portfolios and whose production is signifi -
cantly more capital intensive. All of these fac -
tors indicate that the supply of supplier credit 
hinges on product market aspects.Other balance

The findings of the study show that enterprises 
which make more use of supplier credit also 
have particularly high liquidity needs, are less 
integrated in intra-group financing systems and 
manage their working capital needs more sys -
tematically (working capital ratio 10.7% com -
pared with 19.2%) than firms that avail them -
selves less of this source of financing. Supplier 
credit users’ greater financing needs, which 
arise, in particular, in order to purchase current 
assets, are largely the result of low production 
depth and, correspondingly, of particularly high 
material cost. The consequence of the business 
model of these enterprises is also that they 
generate a significantly lower profit for the year 
(almost one percentage point lower) and a 
cash flow that is only just under half that gen -
erated by enterprises that make considerably 
less use of payment deadlines given by sup -
pliers. Moreover, the less favourable earnings 
situation is reflected in an equity capital ratio 
that is clearly lower (-7.9 percentage points) 
and in a markedly lower ratio of provisions to 
total assets (-3.1 percentage points) for this 
group. Similarly, their interest expense ratio is, 
at ¼ percentage point, distinctly lower than 
the corresponding figure for enterprises with a 
low supplier liabilities ratio.
Development in trade credit 
over the business cycle
Trade credit typically “moves” with economic 
activity; this is demonstrated by the direct rela -
tionship that exists between trade credit and 
sales. At the beginning of an economic up -
swing, suppliers have an opportunity to deliver 
to customers, on credit, the inventories that 
have accumulated in the meantime. In this 
way, creditors reduce their storage cost and 
debtors are able for the time being to make 
sparing use of their liquidity, which in this phase 
is often still under pressure. Thus, trade credit 
plays a part in financing the upswing, as it is 
through trade credit that short-term liquidity 
needs are covered at a time when banks have 
generally not yet adjusted their tightened credit conditions to the more upbeat economic situ -
ation. On the other hand, there is a risk in 
periods of recession or heightened economic 
uncertainty that this financing instrument may 
amplify a downward trend at a time when en -
terprises, under such circumstances, usually 
scale back the periods given for payment and 
are more rigorous in their debtor management 
as they prepare themselves as early as possible 
for incipient or imminent liquidity bottlenecks.
Furthermore, an increase in supplier credits 
granted may also result in financial risks for, 
and the danger of contagion to, the inter -
national economy as a whole. Particularly when 
supplier credits are extended on a revolving, 
permanent basis, which is sometimes common 
practice in domestic and foreign trade, there is 
a risk that considerable amounts of residual 
debt may accumulate which is made available 
to customers as quasi permanent credit and 
which suppliers de facto  have to refinance on a Relationship be-

long-term basis.18 Not least, such sector-
specific exposures in the form of large long-term 
loans reinforce international economic relation -
ships and create a mechanism for transmitting 
worldwide financing shocks.19
The extrapolated results from the Bundesbank’s 
financial statements statistics show that sup -
plier liabilities developed largely in synchrony 
with production-sector output momentum 
during the observation period. Between 2004 
and 2007, they rose continuously by €38.1 bil -
lion. By contrast, in the last two reporting years 
they decreased by more than €40.8 billion and 
dropped below their initial level of 2002. The 
decline in trade credit witnessed in 2008 and 
2009 in the wake of the financial and eco -
nomic crisis is primarily attributable to deterior -
ating conditions for trade credit insurance with 
which suppliers protect themselves against the 
risk of their buyers defaulting. In view of the 
rising economic risks, trade credit insurers had 
reduced their coverage volumes and raised their retention amounts and risk premiums dra -
matically. Because this worsening of insurance 
policy conditions had a particularly negative 
impact on German exporters, the reduction in 
coverage volumes was mitigated by imple -
menting a government top-up model under 
the “Business Fund Germany”.20 When eco -
nomic activity picked up again in 2010, supplier 
credits increased markedly again at the current 
end, and in 2011 exceeded the 2007 peak on 
the balance sheets of DAX and MDAX-listed 
groups.
By contrast, the development of payments re -
ceived on account is not driven solely by the 
general fluctuations in the level of economic 
activity in the production sector; instead, its 
time profile also reflects different movements 
specific to sectors for which this financing in -
strument is of great relevance (such as con -
struction and mechanical engineering). Thus, 
the broad consistency in payments received on 
account in 2008 and 2009, years of economic 
downturn, can probably be explained by the 
business activity seen in the construction sec -
tor. Here, output remained relatively stable 
– unlike industrial output – due to the preced -
ing sustained market consolidation process and 
the government’s extensive fiscal stimulus pro -
grammes.21

use is determined not only by the cyclical pat -
terns of the economy as a whole but also by 
sector-specific particularities and by financing 
practice that has evolved over time. Payments 
received on account constitute a financing in -
strument with which prefinancing needs stem -
ming from long-term to-order fabrication or 
order-based production and, resulting from 
that, the producer’s increased economic risk 
can in part be passed on to the buyer. More -
over, enterprises with large debtor portfolios 
resulting from trade receivables abroad also 
need to be able to refinance their higher finan -
cing requirements via inter-company loans at 
home. In addition, financing strategies in trade 
are based on the idea of covering the liquidity 
needs resulting from the purchase of the trade 
goods in whole or in part out of the proceeds 
generated by selling these goods. In Germany, 
trade credits show hardly any effects that are 
specific to size categories; certainly they are not 
associated with larger net financing needs spe -
cifically for SMEs.
The results of the present study illustrate that, 
in Germany, trade credits are a short-term fi -
nancing instrument for enterprises that is 
geared to the specific liquidity needs of individ -
ual sectors. Thus, it substantially eases, in the short term, enterprises’ financing burden as a 
result of certain business models, without the 
involvement of financial intermediaries or tak -
ing recourse to own funds that have already 
been earmarked under long-term planning. In 
offering an alternative to short-term bank loans 
as a means of bridging short-term liquidity 
bottlenecks, this special corporate loan market 
plays an important part in ensuring that cor -
porate financing in Germany is more broadly 
based.
However, this source of financing also entails 
potential risks, notably the risk of substantial 
long-term credit exposures accumulating and 
contagion risks due to increased lending in the 
context of national and international trade rela -
tionships. Against this background it appears 
all the more important that, particularly when 
financing conditions are more difficult, enter -
prises systematically analyse and manage their 
debtor portfolios by applying a professional 
credit and liquidity management system on the 
basis of regular and up-to-date risk assess -
ments. In so doing, they will be able to benefit 
from the advantages of trade credit on an on -
going basis and to keep potential risks arising 
from use of this financing instrument to a min -

The use of cash and cashless payment 
 instruments: a microeconomic analysis
Various payment instruments are available to consumers to pay for goods and services. They can 
choose between cash and cashless payment instruments. The Bundesbank regularly conducts sur -
veys on this topic in order to obtain more detailed information about consumers’ payment habits. 
In this issue of the Monthly Report, the results of a recently completed study are presented and 
compared with those of a similar study from 2008.
The current study concludes that individuals use cash for 53% of total expenditures – excluding 
regularly recurring payments such as rent. This makes it still the most-used payment instrument in 
Germany, despite a nearly 5 percentage-point decline in usage compared with 2008. Debit cards 
(in Germany principally the girocard, formerly known as the “ec-card”) are used in 28% of pay -
ments, making them the premier cashless payment instrument; their share has gone up by nearly 
3 percentage points. They are followed at some distance by credit transfers and credit cards.
In principle, the significance of cashless payment instruments has risen in recent years, whereas 
the intensity of cash usage has declined. However, this is a slow but continuous process which 
has already been evident for some years. In the short to medium term, a continued substitution 
of cash by cashless payment instruments may therefore be expected.
The increase in online shopping is likewise having an impact on payment habits. The use of cash -
less payment instruments is now virtually unavoidable in order to purchase products online which 
used to be purchased in traditional retail outlets and paid for in cash. Internet payment instru -
ments are the beneficiaries. In addition, payment innovations – especially contactless payment 
instruments using payment cards or mobile phones – could accelerate the substitution of cash.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
October 2012

Issue to be discussed
The payment behaviour of consumers is the re -
sult of a multitude of individual microeconomic 
decisions, which are dependent on both the 
range of payment instruments available as 
well  as on the socio-economic and socio-
demographic characteristics of the payer. Gen -
erally speaking, the payer has a choice between 
cash and various cashless payment instruments, 
especially debit and credit cards.
In order to gain a better understanding of why 
consumers choose certain payment instru -
ments when paying for goods, the Bundesbank 
commissioned an empirical study to be carried 
out in the autumn of 2011 in which more than 
2,000 individuals were asked to keep a pay -
ments diary for a period of seven days. This 
was supplemented by individual interviews dur -
ing which the respondents were asked ques -
tions about their payment habits.
A similar study was conducted by the Bundes -
bank in 2008,1 which consequently allows 
comparisons to be drawn as to how the use of 
cash and cashless payment instruments has 
evolved over time. Cash was the most com -
monly used method of payment back in 2008, 
although debit and credit cards were also used 
on a considerable scale. This article focuses on 
whether and how the results have changed 
since the previous study was conducted.
Familiarity with and posses -
sion of payment instruments
Consumers generally have the choice between 
various payment instruments when paying for 
goods and services. As in 2008, the 2011 sur -
vey started off by ascertaining how much cash 
consumers carry in their wallets and how many 
and what type of payment cards the respond -
ents carry with them.2
The individuals surveyed carried roughly €103 
in their wallets, around €5.90 of which was in coins. This is €15 less than in 2008. In particu -
lar, there was a slight decline in the number of 
individuals who carry more than €100 on them.
However, the amount of cash that people carry 
on them varies depending on an assortment of 
socio-demographic characteristics. Women 
carry much less cash than men. This is probably 
due to the lower value of the individual pay -
ments conducted by women. Furthermore, the 
amount of cash carried by individuals increases 
as the level of net household income rises. 
However, given that higher-earners tend to 
have a lower preference for cash than people 
with a lower income, this finding is based on 
the higher absolute expenditure of this group 
of individuals. Besides gender and income, age, 
in particular, influences the amount of cash 
that people carry on their person. Younger per -
sons (18 to 24 year-olds) carry much less cash 
than those in the middle (25 to 54 year-olds) 
and the older (55 year-olds and above) age 
groups. The larger amounts of cash carried by 
respondents in the middle age group is prob -
ably due to a higher level of income or, among 
persons in retirement, to their much greater 
preference for cash. This is also supported by 
the fact that almost half of the older survey re -
spondents stated that they pay exclusively in 
cash.
The following section looks at the two most 
significant types of payment cards in Germany, 
measured in terms of intensity of use as re -Decline in the

many, 2009.
2 The Bundesbank’s 2008 survey on payment behaviour in 
Germany looked at the criteria which are crucial to the us -
er’s decision regarding whether to acquire a new payment 
instrument. Here it is to be assumed that, on the whole, 
the general attitude of consumers that was observed re -
mains relatively stable over time. Overall, the respondents 
said that protection against financial loss and a high level 
of acceptance in retail outlets are the most important cri -
teria when selecting a payment instrument. In addition to 
these two criteria, more than 50% of the respondents re -
garded cost, speed and anonymity as indispensable. The 
option of being able to use the payment instrument on the 
internet and to collect bonus points or qualify for discounts 
were seen as the least significant criteria. See Deutsche

credit cards.3 The most widely used payment 
card on the German market is the debit card, 
which is issued to virtually every current ac -
count holder in Germany.4 Of those surveyed, 
94% said that they owned a debit card (2008: 
91%).5 Particularly sharp growth in debit card 
ownership was recorded in the 18 to 24 age 
group (84% to 92% since 2008). What is also 
striking is that 98% of respondents in gainful 
employment said that they owned a debit card, 
compared with 89% in the case of those re -
spondents who are out of work.
Credit cards6 followed in second place (meas -
ured in terms of distribution), though at a con -
siderable distance behind debit cards. 33% of 
the respondents said that they owned a credit 
card, which represents a surprisingly high 
growth rate of 6 percentage points compared 
with the previous study. Both the rise in de -
mand, owing for example to their usability for 
making online purchases, together with the 
greater efforts by card issuers to promote their 
products have contributed towards the greater 
prevalence of credit cards. Respondents’ famil -
iarity with credit cards and their possible uses 
has risen by 18 percentage points to 64%. 
Credit institutions’ risk management policies, in 
particular, influence their attitude towards 
credit card issuance given the risk of default. 
This would explain why higher-earners, those 
in gainful employment and older persons more 
frequently own a credit card. Given that credit 
cards, which are usually subject to a fee in Ger -
many, face strong competition from the free-
of-charge (from the consumer’s perspective) 
debit card, credit cards play a less significant 
role than in Anglo-Saxon countries, for ex -
ample. One of the main reasons for the rela -
tively low prevalence of credit cards in Ger -
many is likely to be that German credit cards 
are often issued as charge cards7 and not as 
“fully-fledged” credit cards. Added to this is the 
fact that consumers in Germany generally have 
access to an overdraft facility on their current 
account as a short-term financing option.Cash in people's wallets

3 Observations on the frequency of usage of the Geld-
Karte , pre-paid credit cards and store cards with a payment 
function can be found in the Bundesbank’s detailed study 
on payment behaviour in Germany.
4 Payments made by debit card are immediately debited to 
the current account to which the card is assigned. The Ger -
man banking industry operates a joint solution for debit 
cards known as the girocard , which can be used for mak -
ing payments in retail outlets and for withdrawing cash 
from ATMs.
5 The actual diffusion of cards does not necessarily have to 
be consistent with the answers provided by the respond -
ents, as it is possible that some respondents are not entirely 
sure which cards they actually have in their wallets.
6 Unlike in the case of debit cards, credit card payments 
are generally debited to the account holder’s account with 
a time-lag, either as a lump sum (in the case of charge 
cards) or in instalments.
7 Charge cards are payment cards which the card holder 
can use to make purchases and/or to withdraw cash from 
ATMs. All the transactions made within a given period are 
charged to the card holder’s account as a single amount 
(up to an agreed limit) at the end of the period.Deutsche Bundesbank

Choosing between cash and 
cashless payment instru -
ments at the point of sale
Given that payment cards are becoming ever 
more widespread, the majority of consumers 
are able to choose between cash and various 
cashless payment instruments at the point of 
sale. The study therefore analysed the factors 
which influence a consumer’s decision at the 
point of sale based on the data collected from 
the self-assessments completed by the re -
spondents.
28% of those respondents who carry both cash 
and payment cards with them said that they 
still generally pay in cash. 12% of the respond -
ents said that they primarily use cashless pay -
ment instruments.8 This means that 40% of the 
respondents have already decided in advance 
which form of payment they intend to use at 
the point of sale. Those who pay solely in cash 
are generally under 25 or over 55 years of age and often have a household income of less 
than €1,500 per month. Furthermore, there 
were a greater number of women who stated 
that they pay exclusively in cash. The majority 
of those respondents who pay by cashless 
means are between 25 and 54 years of age, 
have a monthly household income of over 
€3,000, are male and live in eastern Germany. 
These socio-demographic trends, which were 
observed on the basis of the self-assessment 
completed by the respondents, are also re -
flected in the actual payment behaviour re -
corded in the payment diaries. This will be in -
vestigated in greater detail in the following sec -
tion.

ment in advance, the remaining 60% of the re -
spondents do not decide how they are going 
to pay until they arrive at the point of sale. This 
group of respondents was asked to specify the 
criteria which determine their choice of pay -
ment instrument.9
According to the results of the predecessor 
study,10 the amount of cash available in one’s 
wallet is the decisive factor when deciding how 
to pay. This would appear to be due to liquidity 
reasons. Even though the amount of cash avail -
able in one’s wallet may be sufficient to make 
a purchase, people like to keep a certain cash 
reserve in their wallets in order for them to be 
able to make other, unexpected payments, 
which possibly can only be settled in cash 
(back-up reserve and liquidity motive). For this 
reason, people use cashless payment instru -
ments above a certain subjective threshold 
amount so as not to further reduce the amount 
of cash they carry on them. The amount of 
cash available in one’s wallet is particularly sig -
nificant for younger respondents between 18 
and 24 years of age. People with a college or 
university degree attach less importance to the 
amount of cash that they have on them com -
pared with those respondents with other 
school-leaving qualifications.
According to the results of the previous study, 
the transaction amount was the second most 
important criterion when deciding which pay -
ment instrument to use. The importance of this 
factor when deciding whether to pay in cash or 
by card rises continuously with the age and 
level of education of the respondents. Further -
more, this criterion was particularly significant 
for German citizens compared with those per -
sons surveyed living in Germany as foreign na -
tionals.
Now that the factors influencing the choice be -
tween cash and cashless payment instruments 
have been analysed based on the self-
assessments completed by the interview par -
ticipants, the following section will analyse the 
results of the payment diaries and describe the actual payment behaviour observed and the 
payment decisions that respondents actually 
made.
Payment behaviour recorded 
in payment diaries
The interview participants were asked to keep 
a payments diary detailing every transaction 
that they made over a seven-day period, taking 
note of the place or location and the type of 
transaction and method of payment (selected 
from a list of 14 predefined payment instru -
ments) they used. They were also asked to spe -
cify the transaction amount. The respondents 
were given the choice between all the com -
mon payment instruments, such as cash, debit 
card or credit card. Payment instruments which 
were still classed as “exotic” at the time of the 
survey, such as contactless card payments or 
prepaid credit cards, were also available for se -
lection. This allowed the Bundesbank to ascer -
tain how prevalent these payment instruments 
actually are. With regard to the payment loca -
tions and the type of transaction, the selection 
options ranged from retail payments for 
day-to-day needs (eg supermarkets), online 
and mail order trade to payments effected be -
tween individuals. Regularly recurring pay -
ments, which are generally settled by cashless 
means (such as rent), were not included as part 
of this study.
The study revealed that cash is still the most 
commonly used method of payment, account -
ing for a total share of 53% of all transactions. 
Compared with the previous study on payment 
behaviour, the cash share has declined by al -
most 5 percentage points, which is equivalent 
to an annual decline of around 1.4 percentage 
points. This development is in line with the Amount of cash 
available in one’s wallet is decisive, …
… transaction 
amount is the second most im-portant criterion
Cash still domin-ant despite growing share of card pay-ments
9 The fact that not all retail outlets are equipped with ter -
minals for settling payments using payment cards also inev -
itably plays a role when deciding which payment instru -
ment to use at the point of sale.

long-term trend. By contrast, the use of pay -
ment cards is on the increase. The payment 
share accounted for by debit cards, which were 
the second most frequently used payment in -
strument during the seven-day payment diary 
recording period, increased by 3 percentage 
points to over 28%. Credit cards also became 
more popular, accounting for a share of 7.4% 
(2008: 3.6%). It is therefore the “classic” cards, 
which are already well established on the mar -
ket, that are partly displacing cash. By contrast, 
the acceptance of certain products which were 
once thought to be innovative, such as the 
GeldKarte , is declining (turnover share 0.1%), 
whereas today’s innovative payment instru -
ments (contactless payment cards, payment in -
struments based on mobile phone technology) 
are still not very widespread on the market and 
are therefore rarely used.
It is not just the share of cash payments which 
has fallen, however. Direct debits (0.7%) and 
credit transfers (8.2%) are also being used less frequently than in the past. Instead, the re -
spondents said that they are increasingly using 
internet payment schemes, such as PayPal , 
Giropay  or SOFORT Überweisung . Their turn -
over share now stands at 1.7%, which is attrib -
utable primarily to the dynamic growth in on -
line shopping (see also the box on page 73).
Similar results can also be seen if the shares ac -
counted for by the individual payment instru -
ments are examined based on the number of 
transactions instead of the turnover share. 
While the share of cash payments measured in 
terms of transaction volume is significantly 
higher (82%) than when measured in terms of 
turnover share, the opposite holds true for vir -
tually all other payment instruments. This ob -
servation can be explained by the predominant 
use of cash for small-value payments. Other 
payment instruments are generally only used 
for payments above a certain amount.Payment instruments broken down by turnover and number of transactions

A detailed overview of the usage of certain 
payment instruments broken down into various 
transaction amount categories can be found in 
the table above. Cash is the most commonly used payment instrument not only for small payments, but also for medium-sized pay-
ments. The very high level of usage for transac -
tion amounts below €20 is certainly also con -
nected with the fact that it is often not possible 
to pay by card in shops where transaction amounts tend to be smaller (eg in bakeries). Furthermore, retailers often set a minimum transaction amount below which debit cards are not accepted. It would appear that con -
sumers also set themselves certain transaction 
limits before resorting to paying by card. More 
than 95% of those surveyed stated that they only use cashless payment instruments for transaction amounts of €20 and above. It is therefore not surprising that debit cards are only frequently used for transactions above €20, but also for amounts up to €500 and more. Credit transfers and credit cards play a 
more significant role for amounts above €100. 
These latter two payment instruments are 
therefore used for certain transaction amounts 
or transaction types (eg when travelling), whereas debit cards have almost become an 
“all-purpose” payment instrument.Whereas the previous section focused on the 
general indicators for the intensity of usage of 
individual payment instruments, this section analyses the influence that the respondents’ 
socio-demographic characteristics have on pay -
ment behaviour. The impact that individual 
 socio-demographic characteristics have on the 
intensity of usage of the individual payment in-
struments are generally analysed separately. 
There is, however, sometimes a correlation be -
tween the individual socio-demographic char -
acteristics.11 Unless otherwise stated, all per -
centage figures refer to the share accounted for by the individual payment instruments in 
the respective groups.
A key finding of the 2008 cash study was the 
significant impact that age has on payment be-
haviour. While younger respondents up to the 
age of 24 and older respondents over the age of 55 generally pay in cash, respondents in be-tween these two age groups make greater use of cashless payment instruments. This finding is also confirmed in the latest study. Cash was the 
most frequently used payment instrument 
among the group of respondents over the age of 65, accounting for a share of 58% of all ex -Cash is used pri-

penditure during the payment diary recording 
period. The group of 25 to 34 year-olds use 
cash much less frequently (transaction share of 
49%). By contrast, respondents in the middle 
age group (25 to 44 year-olds) use cashless 
payment instruments particularly frequently, 
with a preference for debit cards, which they 
use for around 36% of their total payments.
This finding can first be explained by the fact 
that younger and older persons tend to make 
lower-value purchases, which are very fre -
quently settled in cash.12 Second, older per -
sons, in particular, own far fewer payment 
cards than would be expected on the basis of a 
proportional distribution across the population. 
Furthermore, the positive assessment of certain 
characteristics which older respondents con -
sider important for a payment instrument, such 
as convenience and familiarity, also seems to 
support the use of cash. Older respondents feel 
that cash fulfils these requirements particularly 
well.13
Age is not the only factor that has an impact 
on payment behaviour, however. The propen -
sity to use cashless payment instruments also 
rises with the level of education of the payer. 
Whereas respondents who left school with a 
lower secondary school leaving certificate pay 
for 65% of their total expenditure in cash,14 
this share is just slightly above 40% in the case 
of college or university graduates. This means 
that, in the highest level of education category, 
the cash payment share is equally as high as 
that of debit and credit cards. Credit card own -
ership and usage is significantly higher in the 
case of those respondents with a certificate of 
aptitude for higher education and those with a 
college or university degree than in the other 
level of education categories.
In addition to age and level of education, net 
household income also has an impact on the 
intensity of use of cash and cashless payment 
instruments.15 Respondents with a low house -
hold income generally settle their payments in 
cash, whereas higher-earners make greater use of cashless payment instruments. In the cat -
egory with a monthly net household income of 
less than €1,500, 72% of all payments are set -
tled in cash. By contrast, this share is 44% of all 
payments in the category of respondents with 
a net household income of over €3,000. The 
large percentage of low-value transactions 
conducted by respondents in the lowest in -
come category is one reason for the dispropor -
tionately high use of cash. Another is that indi -
viduals with a low household income have a 
greater need to keep their spending in check. 
Cash would appear to be an appropriate pay -
ment instrument for this purpose.16 By con -
trast, respondents with a household income of 
€3,000 and above make a greater number of 
payments with a value of over €50 and dispro -
portionately frequently own payment cards, es -
pecially credit cards.17
The differences in payment behaviour between 
citizens in eastern and western Germany are 
particularly striking. Respondents living in east -
ern Germany settle only 45% of their expenses 
in cash, compared with 55% in western Ger -
many. The socio-demographic factors of age 
and income would tend to suggest that resi -
dents in eastern Germany pay in cash more fre -… better edu-
cated people use cards more frequently

12 Only 8% of all transactions effected by 18 to 24 year-
olds have a value of over €50. Around 12% of purchases 
made by respondents aged over 65 have a value of over 
€50. In all other age categories, transactions in this amount 
range account for as much as 15% to 19% of all effected 
transactions.
13 See Deutsche Bundesbank, Payment behaviour in Ger -
many, 2009, pp 8-9.
14 In this regard, age is a more significant determining fac -
tor than level of education. Older respondents often left 
school with just a lower secondary school leaving certifi -

hold income were not included in the analysis (160 persons

Paper, Series 1, No 22/2011.
17 The impact of net household income dovetails with 
other socio-demographic factors. People with a high in -
come are generally in the middle age group and relatively 
highly qualified. Young and older persons are very heavily 
represented in the low-income group of respondents.Deutsche Bundesbank

Internet payments
With increasing internet use, the question 
of how payment is made when shopping 
online is gaining in relevance. An increase in 
the relative importance of payment instru-
ments on the internet compared with their use in traditional retail outlets could exert a growing impact on general payment behav-iour.
In contrast to payment at physical retail outlets, most internet payments are made 
without using cash,1 with e-payment instru-
ments becoming increasingly important. 
One example is PayPal. On the other hand, services have emerged which are based on the buyer’s online banking application. This 
includes Giropay, which allows customers 
to buy securely from an internet trader’s 
website by means of direct online transfers from their bank account, and SOFORT Über-
weisung, in which a technical service pro-
vider (non-bank) places a transfer request in the customer’s own online banking applica-
tion. Such online payment instruments are 
not only supplementing traditional cashless payment instruments, they are also increas-
ingly displacing them. Besides payment by 
credit transfer upon delivery (48%), most people surveyed preferred online payment instruments (31%).
2 While the use of such 
payment instruments showed a marked in-
crease of 21 percentage points compared with the previous study, payment in ad-vance declined by 16 percentage points 
to 26%. By contrast, the use of credit cards remained constant at 21%. Particularly men and users between 25 and 34 years of age 
are very open to online payment instru-
ments, while paying by credit card is clearly 
becoming more relevant for those persons 
surveyed who were aged 45 years or older.
In a second step, the e-payment schemes 
actually used by the respondents were ana-lysed on the basis of the data provided in 
their self-assessment. A clear 87% majority 
of all users of e-payment schemes stated 
that they used PayPal; transfers by SOFORT 
Überweisung and Giropay were used by 9% and 3% respectively. It is striking that 
very young and older surveyees use PayPal 
more often than the average, whereas PayPal is used by only 77% and SOFORT 
Überweisung by 15% among the category 
of 25 to 34 year olds. Female surveyees also 
used SOFORT Überweisung relatively more 
often, although this had no impact on the 
intensity of use of PayPal within this cat-egory. Surprisingly, in contrast to general payment behaviour, neither educational 
background nor the level of net household 
income had an obvious impact on the use 
of the individual payment instruments. Moreover, in contrast to general payment behaviour on the internet, it was likewise irrelevant whether those surveyed came from eastern or western Germany. Those paying exclusively in cash at the point of sale use PayPal to the same extent as the average user of e-payment schemes, al-
though the percentage of users of SOFORT 
Überweisung  (14%) is somewhat higher in 
their case.
The marked trend towards using online 
payment instruments instead of traditional 
cashless payment instruments, such as 
credit transfers, points to a perceptible de-
mand for specialised payment instruments 
for specifi  c shopping situations.

a questionnaire, ie they are based purely on the self-
assessment of interviewees rather than on actually ob-

quently than residents in western Germany.18 A 
greater prevalence of payment cards in eastern 
Germany cannot be substantiated on the basis 
of the survey data, ruling out this explanation, 
too. This leaves just the transaction amount as 
the sole factor which could explain the greater 
affinity of east Germans to payment cards. In 
actual fact, transactions with a value of €50 
and above account for a 17% share of total ex -
penditure in eastern Germany, compared with 
14% in western Germany. Moreover, east Ger -
mans make fewer transactions than west Ger -
mans. Payment card usage in eastern Germany 
is supported by the fact that, on average, east 
Germans do not go shopping as frequently as 
their west German counterparts, but conse -
quently make larger-value transactions when 
they do.19 Furthermore, residents in eastern 
Germany purchase a disproportionately large 
number of goods online. The use of cashless 
payment instruments is virtually unavoidable 
when making purchases online.
On the whole, the results recorded back in 
2008 are confirmed in the 2011 study. Socio-
demographic characteristics, such as age, level 
of education and household income had a sig -
nificant impact on payment behaviour in the 
2008 study, too. In addition to these socio-
demographic characteristics, payment card 
ownership, transaction frequency and the 
transaction amount also have an impact on 
whether consumers pay in cash or by cashless 
means.
Innovative methods of 
 payment at the point of sale
The internet is not the only technological ad -
vance which is affecting payment behaviour. 
With this in mind, the following section looks 
at three innovative methods of payment at the 
point of sale: contactless payment using pay -
ment cards or mobile phones as well as other 
methods of payment based on mobile phone 
technology.In recent years, contactless payment methods, 
in particular, have been attracting greater at -
tention. Here, the main focus has been on con -
tactless payment cards, which are based on 
NFC technology.20 With this technology, the 
customer’s payment card no longer has to be 
inserted in a terminal, but just held in front of a 
card reader. The advantage for the customer is 
that the card no longer has to be handed over 
to the cashier. Retailers benefit first and fore -
most from the accelerated payment process at 
the point of sale as payments up to an amount 
of €20 or €25 (depending on the system) can 
be made without having to enter a PIN.
In Germany, this technology is already in use in 
a pilot area using a contactless debit card as 
well as at a number of contactless terminals 
throughout the country using contactless Visa 
or MasterCard credit cards. In addition, a num -
ber of sports venues are using both open and 
closed systems, the advantage of the open sys -
tem being that the card can also be used for 
making payments outside the venue.
Despite the fact that these systems are still not 
very widespread across the country, 6% of the 
respondents said that they had heard of and 
were using contactless payment cards. On the 
whole, almost half of the respondents said that 
they have heard of card-based contactless pay -
ment schemes, even though only a small num -
ber of them have actually had any practical ex -
perience using such methods of payment. 
E-payment 
schemes are gaining in  importanceContactless pay-ment by card
18 In eastern Germany, persons aged over 55 were over -
represented in the survey. Furthermore, a disproportion -
ately high number of those respondents living in eastern 
Germany were represented in the lowest income category 
of below €1,500. The only factor that would explain the 
greater preference for card payments of east Germans is 
the disproportionately large number of persons with a col -
lege or university degree in eastern Germany compared 
with western Germany.
19 A similar behavioural pattern was observed in the case 
of cash withdrawals. Residents in eastern Germany with -
draw cash at tellers and from ATMs less frequently, but 
consequently take out larger amounts than individuals liv -
ing in western Germany when they do withdraw cash. See 
Deutsche Bundesbank, “Where does the cash in your wal -
let come from?”, 2010, page 30.

What is particularly interesting here are the rea -
sons stated by those respondents who said 
that they have heard of these instruments but 
do not use them. Contrary to the expectation 
that the inadequate infrastructure would be 
one of the main reasons why these methods of 
payment are rarely used, a number of respond -
ents said that they are primarily concerned 
about the security of such systems.
Given the increasing popularity of smart -
phones, more and more providers are trying to 
get their products to function as payment in -
struments. The providers are adopting various 
approaches in this regard. The most popular 
approach involves integrating the payment 
card function into the smartphone itself and 
then initiating the payment using NFC technol -
ogy. As not all mobile phones are equipped 
with the technology required to do this at 
present, an interim solution under consider -
ation is to attach the required technology to 
the casing of the smartphone in the form of an 
NFC sticker.
The survey results revealed that contactless 
payment via mobile phone is already more 
widely known than card-based contactless pay -
ment schemes. This is possibly due to the very 
high media attention being given to smart -
phones and thus greater consumer interest. 
Young and male respondents seemed to be the 
best informed about these instruments. Here, 
too, the primary concern was the security of 
such methods of payment.
In addition to contactless forms of payment via 
mobile phone based on NFC technology, there 
are also other innovative forms of payment 
which enable payments to be settled via mo -
bile phone. These include applications which 
allow the user to purchase goods and services 
and settle the transaction amount later via the 
customer’s mobile phone bill. Much like in the 
case of the aforementioned payment innov -
ations, only around half of the respondents 
had heard of these other mobile phone-based payment instruments and only 2% actually use 
them.
In summary, innovative payment instruments at 
the point of sale may currently play only a 
minor role, yet they do have potential for the 
future. One in three respondents did, however, 
say that they do not see any need for new in -
novations on the payments market. The major -
ity of potential users, however, did cite security 
concerns as the main reason for not using 
these cashless payment instruments.
Outlook
At the time of the survey, cash was still the 
most commonly used method of payment in 
Germany. Nevertheless, the share of cash pay -
ments effected during the payment diary re -
cording week fell from around 58% in 2008 
to 53% in 2011. The substitution of cash by 
cashless payment instruments is consistent 
with the long-term trend. The share of retail 
payments settled in cash, for example, has de -
clined by 22 percentage points over the past 17 
years.21
This process is being influenced by a number of 
factors. One important factor is the greater 
prevalence and usage of payment cards.22 
While debit cards have already reached a sig -
nificant diffusion rate of 94% in Germany, 
credit cards still have potential for growth. The 
intensity of use of debit cards and credit cards 
has increased by 7 percentage points on the Contactless 
 payment via mobile phone
Other innovative 
methods  
of payment via mobile phoneSlow but steady decline in the 
share of cash 
payments
Payment card 
ownership and usage are on 
the increase
21 This is the finding of a study carried out by the EHI Retail 
Institute. The EHI is a research institute which focuses on 
the German retail industry. Its survey looks at retail turnover 
in the narrower sense, ie excluding turnover in the auto -
mobile industry, petroleum industry, in pharmacies and in 
mail order trade. The slight deviations between the turn -
over shares of various payment instruments in the Bundes -
bank’s and the EHI’s surveys are due to the much greater 
scope of the survey conducted by the Bundesbank.
22 The question relating to the respondents’ payment 
habits today compared with ten years ago revealed that 
over half of the respondents use cashless payment instru -
ments more frequently today and only 5% said that they 
now use cashless payment instruments less frequently than 
they did ten years ago.Deutsche Bundesbank

whole compared with 2008. Furthermore, the 
increase in the number of retail outlets accept -
ing payment cards has also encouraged greater 
use of cashless payment instruments. The num -
ber of terminals required to process electronic 
payments has consequently risen from 593,000 
in 2008 to 710,000 in 2011, which corresponds 
to a 20% increase.
Nevertheless, it is not just payment behaviour 
that is changing. The growth in online trade 
that has been evident for a number of years is 
also an indication of a transformation in con -
sumer payment habits. The use of cashless pay -
ment instruments is virtually unavoidable given 
that goods and services are being increasingly 
purchased online rather than in traditional re -
tail outlets. This is indicated by the growing 
popularity of e-payment schemes.
There are also a number of factors which pro -
mote the use of cash. The vast number of 
ATMs and the dense branch network of credit 
institutions in Germany make it easy for cus -tomers to withdraw and to use cash. The num -
ber of ATMs and combined deposit and with -
drawal machines has risen from 55,500 in 
2008 to 56,500 in 2011. In addition, it is now 
also possible to withdraw cash at supermarket 
and filling station cash registers.
On the whole, the trend is slowly but steadily 
moving towards an increase in the use of cash -
less payments. It should, however, be noted 
that this is not self-propelling. Consumers and 
retailers ultimately decide which payment in -
strument they wish to use or accept and thus 
determine which instruments will be used and 
offered in future. Added to this is the fact that 
German consumers are conservative when it 
comes to their payment habits. Almost 60% of 
respondents said that they intend to continue 
using the payment instruments that they are 
familiar with, which is likely to counter any 
rapid change in payment behaviour and would 
suggest that cash is likely to remain a popular 
method of payment in the years to come.Changes in pur-
chasing patterns affect payment behaviourFuture develop-
ments will ultim-
ately depend on 
consumers and retailersDeutsche Bundesbank
