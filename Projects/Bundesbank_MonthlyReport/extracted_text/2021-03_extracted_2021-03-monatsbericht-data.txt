Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The coronavirus pandemic is continuing to 
shape economic activity in Germany. On an 
average of the current quarter, measures to 
contain the pandemic are stricter than in the 
previous quarter, which is likely to have led to a 
steep fall in economic output in the first quar -
ter of 2021. In particular, activity in services sec -
tors with high frequencies of interpersonal con -
tact will probably have declined again sharply. 
Retail sales were down considerably in January, 
for example. In addition to the containment 
measures, the rise in VAT since the beginning 
of the year is also likely to have been a factor. 
The latter also probably contributed to the 
quite substantial decline in construction output 
in January. By contrast, industry, which like the 
construction sector is not directly affected   by 
the measures, is set to have bolstered eco -
nomic activity in the current quarter, helped 
by  a boost from dynamic foreign demand. 
Although  industrial output suffered a slight 
setback  at the beginning of the year, indus trial 
enterprises received significantly more orders. 
Furthermore, the ifo Institute’s surveys show 
that their sentiment improved to a favourable 
level in February.
Industry
German industrial production declined some -
what in January 2021, by a seasonally adjusted 
½% on the month. This was mainly attributable 
to the automotive sector, where supply short -
ages for semiconductors were a drag on pro -
duction.1 On the other hand, industrial output 
excluding motor vehicles remained on an up -
ward trajectory. Industrial production was 
markedly higher than the average of the fourth 
quarter of 2020 overall (+1%). Broken down by 
main grouping, the production of intermediate goods showed strong growth. The production 
of capital goods was virtually unchanged in 
spite of the steep decline in motor vehicle out -
put, while the manufacture of consumer goods 
was down distinctly. In January, overall indus -
trial production was still markedly below the 
pre- crisis level of the final quarter of 2019.
New orders in industry remained strong in 
January, rising clearly on the month in season -
ally adjusted terms (+1½%). They were also 
slightly higher than in the previous quarter 
(+¾%) and, excluding large orders, the in -
crease was distinctly more substantial. Looking 
at the individual sectors, demand was up 
slightly on the quarter in the case of manufac -
turers of capital goods, while producers of 
intermediate goods saw a considerable in -
crease over the same period. Manufacturers of 
consumer goods received distinctly fewer 
orders, however. Broken down by region, Ger -
man industrial enterprises benefited from dy -
namic demand on the part of non- euro area 
countries, with the inflow of orders from this 
group of countries rising steeply. By contrast, 
orders from the euro area remained virtually 
unchanged and domestic demand even con -
tracted significantly. Overall, new orders were 
significantly above the pre- crisis level of the 
final quarter of 2019 (+6%).
Nominal industrial sales in January 2021 de -
clined clearly on the previous month (-1½%), 
having risen strongly from May 2020 up to the 
end of the year, with the exception of August, 
when the trend was interrupted. By contrast, 
sales were up slightly on the previous quarter 
(+¼%). In a sectoral breakdown, as was the Steep fall in

1 See German Association of the Automotive Industry 
(2021a). According to data provided by the Association of 
the Automotive Industry (VDA), semiconductors were also 
still in short supply in February (see German Association of 
the Automotive Industry (2021b)). The number of passen -
ger cars produced rose again in seasonally adjusted terms 
but was still considerably below the average of the fourth 
quarter of 2020.Deutsche Bundesbank

case for industrial output, the decline chiefly 
affected  the automotive sector, where sales in 
January were down by 12% on the previous 
quarter’s average. This likewise brought sales 
of capital goods into negative territory. Exclud -
ing motor vehicles, however, sales by manufac -
turers of capital goods rose steeply, with Ger -
man manufacturers of machinery reporting a 
particularly strong increase in turnover. Sales of 
intermediate goods were also significantly 
higher, while the producers of consumer goods 
saw a marked drop in turnover. In regional 
terms, German industrial enterprises suffered a 
perceptible drop in domestic sales. By contrast, 
sales to the euro area rose somewhat, while 
those to non- euro area countries climbed 
strongly.
Seasonally adjusted nominal exports of goods 
continued to rise in January 2021, increasing 
clearly by 1½% on the previous month. They 
were up considerably by as much as 2¼% on 
the average of the previous quarter, with ex -
ports to both non- euro area countries and to 
the euro area rising fairly steeply. Exports to the 
United Kingdom fell by almost one- quarter 
compared with the previous quarter. The tran -
sitional period ensuring reciprocal market ac -
cess under EU Single Market rules ended and a 
provisional trade and cooperation agreement 
came into force. This was more than offset, 
however, by strong growth in exports to many 
other countries. After adjustment for price 
effects , total goods exports rose distinctly 
(+1½% on the quarter) and the shortfall against 
the pre- crisis level narrowed to 2½%. On the 
other hand, nominal imports of goods de -
creased strongly, falling by 4¾% on the month 
and by 3½% compared with the final quarter 
of 2020. Excluding the United Kingdom, where 
exports to Germany collapsed, the decline was 
somewhat less pronounced (-2% on the quar -
ter). In real terms, total imports fell more 
sharply (-5½%) in January compared with the 
previous quarter. They thus clearly slipped 
below the pre- crisis level (4½%) again, having 
distinctly exceeded it in the previous two 
months.… but exports

Construction
After seasonal adjustment, construction output 
in January 2021 was down strongly (-12¼%) on 
the previous month, the figure for which was 
revised upwards substantially. There was also a 
considerable contraction compared with the 
fourth quarter (-8½%). In particular in the fin -
ishing trades, where the data are prone to revi -
sion, the decline may also be partly related to 
anticipatory effects owing to the expiry of the 
temporary VAT reduction. Production in this 
area showed a particularly strong decrease in 
January, after an extremely substantial rise in 
December. Output in the main construction 
sector likewise dropped significantly. According 
to ifo Institute surveys, the unfavourable wea -
ther conditions hampered construction activity. 
However, the leading indicators suggest that 
the slowdown in construction does not mark a 
turning point. Orders received in the main con -
struction sector in the fourth quarter of 2020 
– the latest period for which statistics are avail -
able – climbed steeply in seasonally adjusted 
terms. The reach of the order books, as meas -
ured by the ifo Institute, was still at a high level 
in February. Furthermore, equipment utilisation 
in the main construction sector rose again and 
was still significantly higher than its long- term 
average.
Labour market
The labour market remained very stable in spite 
of the continued restrictions to contain the 
pandemic. This was partly attributable to the 
fact that greater use was again made of short- 
time work for economic reasons. According to 
the latest estimate by the Federal Employment 
Agency, just under 2.4 million employees sub -
ject to social security contributions were in 
short- time work in December, almost one- fifth 
more than in October. The figure for April 2020 
was 6.0 million people. The number of short-  
time workers may have risen again slightly at 
the beginning of the year. In any case, the 
number of notifications of short- time work remained  relatively high, with repeated notifi -
cations through back- to- back extensions of 
containment measures also being a factor. Just 
over half of all registrations for short- time work 
since November were for employees in the fol -
lowing areas heavily affected by the contain -
ment measures: wholesale and retail trade, 
accom modation and food services, culture, 
enter tainment, recreation and other personal 
services .
In January, employment continued its slight up -
ward trend from the second half of 2020. Total 
employment increased by a seasonally adjusted 
16,000 in the first month of 2021. Employment 
subject to social security contributions recently 
recorded a fairly steep rise (according to data 
current as of December). By contrast, the num -
ber of persons working exclusively in low- paid 
part- time employment and self- employment 
continued to decline. These forms of employ -
ment are heavily represented in the economic 
sectors particularly hard hit by the containment 
measures. The leading employment indicators 
remained mixed, but close to the neutral 
threshold. The level of employment is there -
fore unlikely to change much in the next few 
months.
There was no further decline in registered un -
employment in February. After seasonal adjust -
ment, the number of unemployed rose margin -
ally by 9,000 compared with January, with the 
unemployment rate remaining constant at 
6.0%. Unemployment had dropped signifi -
cantly in the previous four months. The recent 
increase was confined to unemployment under 
category SGB II, where persons receive basic 
social benefits, with the continued scaling- back 
of labour market policy measures possibly hav -
ing a boosting effect. Total underemployment 
(excluding short- time work), which also in -
cludes persons taking part in these measures, 
fell again slightly, in fact. On the other hand, 
unemployment within the statutory insurance 
scheme continued to decline somewhat.Strong decline

Prices
Crude oil prices increased distinctly in February, 
mainly due to output cuts by OPEC and its part -
ners, weather-  related production stoppages in 
the United States and an improved outlook for 
demand. Prices rose by more than 13% on the 
month, which was an increase of more than 
one- tenth from the previous year’s level. They 
rose again perceptibly in March. As this report 
went to press, the price of a barrel of Brent 
crude oil stood at US$63. Crude oil futures 
were trading at marked discounts. The dis -
count on crude oil futures was US$1¾ for 
deliveries  six months ahead and US$3¾ for 
deliveries  12 months ahead.
Import prices rose steeply in January. This was 
true of both energy and other products. A simi -
lar picture emerged for domestic producer 
prices, for which data up to February are al -
ready available. Towards the end of the period 
under review, import prices were only just over 
1% down on the year. In the case of producer 
prices, the positive year- on- year growth rate 
widened to 1.9%.
Consumer prices as measured by the Harmon -
ised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) increased 
in February by a seasonally adjusted 0.3% on 
the month.2 Energy prices were up distinctly as 
a result of the higher crude oil prices. Total 
food inflation was likewise significant due to 
steep rises in the prices of a small number of 
food products. While price inflation for indus -
trial goods excluding energy remained weak 
due to lower prices for clothing, it was some -
what stronger in the case of services. Annual 
headline HICP inflation held firm at +1.6% but, 
excluding energy and food, dropped from 
+2.0% to +1.7%. This easing is down to a stat -
istical one- off effect  mainly affecting the contri -
bution of package holidays and which already 
drove up the rate markedly in January.3 It de -
creased somewhat in February, but still ele -
vated the headline rate by 0.3  percentage 
point. This effect  did not appear in national 
consumer price index (CPI) inflation, the head -line version of which rose from +1.0% to +1.3%. 
HICP core inflation excluding clothing and 
travel increased slightly to 1.4%. The statistical 
effect will still have a distinctly positive impact 
on HICP inflation in the current month. There -
after, it will temporarily decrease to zero before 
having a discernibly negative effect on inflation 
from June to October. On an annual average, 
this effect  will have no notable impact on HICP 
inflation. There is likely to be an upward under -
lying trend for HICP inflation in the next few 
months, partly due to the marked increase in 
crude oil prices. Due to the base effect caused 
by the lowering of VAT in the previous year,4 
high HICP rates can then be expected tempor -
arily in the second half of 2021. As things stand 
today, they could be significantly higher than 
3% for a time towards the end of the year.
Public finances5
Statutory health 
insurance  scheme
The statutory health insurance (SHI) scheme 
(comprising the health insurance institutions 
and the health fund) finished 2020 with a high 
deficit of €6 billion, according to provisional 
data.6 This represented an increase in the def -
icit of €5 billion on the year, and was chiefly 
due to pandemic- related costs weighing on the 
health fund.

of €3½ billion, following a surplus of €½ billion Crude oil prices

the previous year. This was primarily the result 
of additional expenditures that were only par -
tially offset by central government (see the list 
below) as well as crisis- induced contribution 
shortfalls of roughly €3 billion. The situation 
was further compounded by the fact that SHI 
contributions payable on occupational pen -
sions were reduced by just over €1 billion. An 
additional lump sum of €3½ billion from cen -
tral government only partially offset these bur -
dens. Overall, contribution receipts increased 
by 2%, with supplementary contribution rates 
remaining unchanged on average at 1.0%. 
Higher receipts from contributions payable on 
short- time working and unemployment bene -
fits mitigated the shortfalls resulting from nega -
tive employment effects. Contributions payable 
on pensions continued to rise markedly, un -
affected by the pandemic. Spending by the 
health fund rose by 9%. This includes the regu -
lar transfers to the health insurance institutions, 
which are set in advance and which climbed by 
4%. Furthermore, central government assigned additional tasks to the health fund during the 
pandemic. These were financed partly using 
the fund’s reserves and partly through larger 
amounts of specific central government funds. 
A withdrawal was made from the fund’s re -
serves to cover:
– financial assistance granted to providers of 
therapeutic treatment (€1 billion) and re -
habilitation establishments (€½ billion);
– investment grants for additional intensive 
care beds (just over €½ billion);
– spending on coronavirus tests (€½ billion).
Central government funds, in particular, were 
transferred:
– to hospitals in the form of compensation for 
vacant beds due to the pandemic (€9½ bil -
lion);
– for the purchase of protective face masks for 
risk groups (€½ billion).Considerable

At the end of the year, the fund’s reserves 
amounted to €6½ billion,7 which was €2½ bil -
lion over its statutory lower limit.
The statutory health insurance institutions fin -
ished 2020 with a deficit of €2½ billion (2019 
deficit: €1½ billion). Their revenue (for the most 
part, transfers from the health fund) grew by 
4%, while their expenditure saw a slightly 
steeper increase of just over 4%. Spending on 
hospital treatment, a particularly large expend -
iture item, only rose by just under 1½%,8 while 
spending on outpatient medical treatment 
surged upwards by 7%. As usual, the data still 
consist to a great extent of estimates, and un -certainty is likely to be particularly high in this 
regard on account of the pandemic. This is true 
both of the utilisation of regular services as well 
as health insurance institutions’ expenditure on 
coronavirus tests. Spending on pharmaceut -
icals grew by 5½%. Here, the VAT cut in the 
second half of the year continued to have a 
pronounced relieving effect. Sickness benefit 
also saw steep growth (+11%). Overall, spend -
ing on benefits rose by 3½%. Administrative 
expenditure went up by 6%. The fact that the 
health insurance institutions expanded their 
pension provisions by €½ billion more than in 
the previous year was a contributing factor 
here. Adjusted for this factor, growth amounted 
to 3½%. The health insurance institutions’ 
finan cial reserves declined significantly due to 
the deficit, but still remained very high on bal -
ance at €17 billion. Overall, their deficit stood 
€1 billion higher than had been anticipated in 
autumn 2019, assuming unchanged supple -
mentary contribution rates.
A very large deficit is anticipated for the SHI 
scheme in 2021; but, again, uncertainty is still 
high. Last autumn, the group of SHI estimators 
still expected the health fund to record a deficit 
of €1 billion. This was essentially because €0.9 
billion is being paid out from the liquidity 
reserve  to the health insurance institutions as 
partial compensation for lower contributions 
payable on occupational pensions. Moreover, 
transfers are being made to the innovation and 
structural funds. For the health insurance insti -
tutions, the estimators predicted an acceler -
ated rise in spending amid subdued contribu -
tion base growth. To partially close their fund -
ing gaps, central government is providing the 
institutions with an additional grant of €5 bil -
lion via the health fund in the current year. 
Additionally, at the start of the year, supple -
mentary contribution rates rose on average to Increased deficit

around 1.3%, the rate set by the Federal Minis -
try of Health. The health insurance institutions 
will have to finance a remaining deficit of €8 
billion (according to the official estimate of 
autumn  2020) out of their exhaustive reserves.
Even after the pandemic, the SHIs will continue 
to experience extensive structural financing 
problems. As things currently stand, a strong 
increase in supplementary contribution rates is 
already expected next year. If this were to be 
financed  via higher central government grants 
in the long term, sustainable counterfinancing 
would ultimately have to be planned into the 
central government budget.
Public long- term care 
insurance  scheme
In spite of the pandemic, the public long- term 
care insurance scheme finished 2020 with a 
surplus of €1½ billion in the core area.9 How -
ever, the result was roughly half that of the pre -
vious year.10 This was due to contribution short -
falls stemming from the economic downturn 
and extraordinary pandemic- related expend -
iture. By the end of the year, the reserves had 
risen to €8½ billion and were therefore €6½ 
billion over the statutory minimum requirement 
of half of a month’s average expenditure.
Revenue went up by 7% overall on the year. 
Around half of this increase was attributable to 
the central government funds of just under €2 
billion paid out for the first time. Other revenue 
increased by almost 3½%. Significantly higher 
contributions payable on unemployment and 
short- time working benefits almost offset re -
duced contribution receipts from regular em -
ployee earnings. In addition, contributions pay -
able on pensions rose markedly, unaffected by 
the pandemic. Meanwhile, expenditure in -
creased by a very substantial 12%. Just over 
half of this is attributable to the coronavirus 
special payments to care homes11 and corona -
virus bonuses for nursing staff. Adjusted for 
extraordinary pandemic- related expenditure, though, spending on benefits still saw robust 
growth of 5½%. Without adjustments to bene -
fit rates, total cash benefits increased by 11%, Funding

care services on account of the coronavirus (e.g. as a result 
of a facility closing or freezing admission of new patients to

scheme also shouldered extraordinary expenses, such as 
for personal protective equipment and additional person -

which was slightly more strongly than in the 
preceding year. By contrast, spending on non- 
cash benefits, a larger expenditure item, rose 
by 2½% – significantly more weakly than in 
previous years.
In the current year, the coronavirus crisis could 
weigh on the finances of the public long- term 
care insurance scheme even more. The contri -
bution base is only likely to see subdued 
growth. In addition, the coronavirus special 
payments to care homes have been extended 
to the middle of the year. Of greater structural 
importance is the scheduled rule- based rise in 
benefit rates of 5%. Overall, therefore, a signifi -
cant deficit is to be expected for the current 
year. However, the additional funds from the 
steep contribution rate rise of 0.5 percentage 
point at the start of 2019 made it possible to 
top up the reserves substantially. This means 
that, from the current perspective, the lower 
reserve limit is not set to be reached this year 
already. The special funds pledged by central 
government for such a case would therefore 
not be drawn on. However, funding pressures 
are not likely to abate in the years to come. 
Demographic trends are not the sole reason for 
this. The extensive benefit expansions intro -
duced in recent years have also exacerbated 
the pressure on contribution rates.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €159.4 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in January 2021 was significantly 
up on the previous month’s figure (€83.2 bil -
lion). After taking account of increased re -
demptions and changes in issuers’ holdings of 
their own debt securities, the outstanding vol -
ume of domestic bonds rose by €27.4 billion, 
following a drop of €38.4 billion in December 
2020. The outstanding volume of foreign debt 
securities in the German market grew by €20.1 
billion, which meant that the outstanding vol -
ume of domestic and foreign debt securities in Germany in January increased by €47.5 billion 
on balance.
The public sector issued bonds worth €19.9 bil -
lion net in the reporting month. Central gov -
ernment increased its capital market debt by 
€10.7 billion on balance. It primarily issued 
Treasury discount paper (Bubills: €9.2 billion) 
and two- year Federal Treasury notes (Schätze: 
€6.9 billion), but also auctioned other secur -
ities, including five- year Federal notes (Bobls: 
€4.9 billion), albeit on a smaller scale. This con -
trasted with net redemptions of ten-  year Fed -
eral bonds (Bunds) totalling €10.0 billion. State 
and local governments issued bonds in the 
amount of €9.3 billion on balance.
Domestic credit institutions issued bonds total -
ling €4.0 billion net in January, following net 
redemptions of €11.8 billion in the previous 
month. The market saw net issuance of debt 
securities issued by specialised credit institu -
tions (€4.1 billion) and mortgage Pfandbriefe 
(€1.9 billion), in particular. Meanwhile, public 
Pfandbriefe and other bank debt securities that 
can be structured flexibly were redeemed to 
the tune of €1.2 billion and €0.8 billion net, re -
spectively.
Domestic enterprises expanded their capital 
market debt by €3.5 billion in January, follow -
ing net redemptions of €12.0 billion in Decem -
ber. The bulk of this net issuance was attribut -
able to other financial intermediaries.
On the buyer’s side of the market, all investor 
groups were active in January, with purchases 
at a similarly high level across the board. For -
eign investors added a net €14.2 billion in do -
mestic debt securities to their portfolios. The 
Bundesbank acquired debt securities amount -
ing to €13.5 billion net, predominantly under 
the Eurosystem’s asset purchase programmes. 
Domestic non- banks bulked up their bond 
portfolios by €11.4 billion net, concentrating 
exclusively on foreign securities on balance.

Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
raised fresh capital resources of €1.4 billion on 
balance from placing new shares in the Ger -
man equity market. Net issuance of foreign 
equities in Germany totalled €1.2 billion in the 
same period. The majority of purchases were 
made by foreign investors, who acquired Ger -
man shares totalling €3.2 billion net. Domestic 
credit institutions expanded their equity port -
folios by €0.9 billion net, while domestic non- 
banks sold equities for €1.4 billion in net terms.
Mutual funds
Domestic mutual funds recorded inflows of 
€12.2 billion in January. Specialised funds re -
served for institutional investors were the main 
beneficiaries (€10.4 billion). Of the various asset 
classes, mixed securities funds (€4.6 billion), 
open- end real estate funds (€2.6 billion) and 
equity funds (€2.4 billion) attracted the most 
investment. Foreign mutual funds placed shares 
worth €7.3 billion in the German market in 
January. On balance, domestic non- banks were 
virtually the only purchasers of mutual fund 
shares in the reporting month (€18.9 billion). 
Domestic credit institutions and foreign invest -
ors purchased mutual fund shares worth €0.6 
billion and €0.1 billion net, respectively.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €16.9 billion in January 2021, down €8.9 bil -
lion from the previous month’s level. This was 
primarily due to the decline in the surplus for 
invisible current transactions – which comprise 
not only services but also primary and second -
ary income – but also to the narrower surplus 
in the goods account.In January, the surplus in the goods account fell 
by €1.1 billion on the month to €13.5 billion, 
with exports of goods decreasing more sharply 
than imports.
In January, the surplus in invisible current trans -
actions narrowed by €7.8 billion to €3.4 billion, 
largely because net receipts in primary income 
declined by €4.9 billion to €9.7 billion. Most of 
this was due to the normalisation of other in -
come after the bulk of the EU’s agricultural 
subsidies were paid out in December, as is 
standard practice at year’s end. Moreover, the 
deficit in the secondary income account ex -
panded by €1.5 billion to €7.3 billion. Receipts 
fell here, a development to which lower gen -
eral government revenue from current taxes on 
income and wealth contributed significantly. 
Expenditure also rose, mainly due to higher 
payments to the EU budget. Moreover, the sur -
plus in the services account decreased by €1.4 
billion to €1.0 billion. Although expenditure

and IT services playing a role, receipts saw a 
larger decline overall.
Sentiment in the international capital markets 
continued to pick up in January 2021. This op -
timism was founded on the likelier prospect of 
another fiscal package in the United States and 
the growing momentum behind the global 
vaccination campaigns against the coronavirus. 
It was against this backdrop that Germany’s 
cross- border portfolio investment recorded net 
capital exports of €11.3 billion (after €80.1 bil -
lion in December). Domestic investors pur -
chased foreign securities worth €28.7 billion on 
balance. Their demand was focused mainly on 
bonds (€16.1 billion), with foreign currency 
bonds outweighing euro- denominated paper 
slightly. They also purchased mutual fund 
shares (€7.3 billion), money market paper (€3.9 
billion) and shares (€1.3 billion). Foreign invest -
ors added German securities worth a further 
€17.4 billion to their portfolios on balance. 
They primarily acquired money market paper 
(€13.4 billion) and, to a lesser extent, shares 
(€3.2 billion); net purchases of bonds (€0.7 bil -
lion) and mutual fund shares (€0.1 billion) were 
modest.
In January, the balance of financial derivatives 
showed net capital exports of €5.9 billion, fol -
lowing net capital imports of €1.2 billion in De -
cember.
Direct investment generated net capital exports 
of €3.8 billion in January, down from €1.2 bil -
lion in December. Domestic enterprises in -
creased their foreign direct investment by €22.7 
billion. They boosted their equity capital by 
€5.7 billion, almost exclusively through re -
invested earnings. Non- resident group com -
panies provided additional funds worth €17.0 
billion through internal loans. Foreign enter -
prises supplied their affiliates in Germany with

billion. As in the reverse direction, they in -

German balance of payments in 2020
In 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, the German economy’s current account surplus 
decreased by ½ percentage point to 7% of nominal gross domestic product (GDP). As a result of 
the global shock caused by the pandemic, the current account surplus collapsed to less than 5% 
of GDP in the second quarter, but quickly rebounded in the second half of the year. During the 
year under review, the pandemic was reflected in lower surpluses in goods trade and primary 
income, while the balance of the services account, which traditionally runs a deficit, moved mar -
ginally into positive territory. The broadly based slump in foreign demand as well as composition 
effects had a considerable negative impact on Germany’s exports, whilst imports fell to a lesser 
extent. The deep recession in the global economy depressed import prices, especially for crude 
oil, which dampened the decline in the balance of foreign trade. The surplus on primary income 
declined substantially as a result of lower earnings from German direct investment, in particular. 
The services account was affected especially by the lower deficit in travel. Aggregate net lending/ 
net borrowing relative to GDP fell due to the sharp decrease in aggregate savings, which exceeded 
the cyclically- induced decline in investment. The fall in saving was triggered by the government 
budget’s turnaround into a deficit, which was primarily a reflection of the comprehensive govern -
ment assistance measures. By contrast, there was a surge in household saving.
The saving and investment behaviour of an economy is also reflected in its capital flows. In terms 
of cross- border investment and funding decisions, the increasing diversification of investments, 
the continuing globalisation within the corporate sector, and the changing political risks and 
monetary policy measures in particular played key roles in this context. This also holds true for 
German capital flows. Furthermore, the coronavirus pandemic and its evolution were of great sig -
nificance in 2020. In addition, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union 
(Brexit) left its mark on Germany’s capital flows. Financial corporations relocated certain financial 
services that had previously been conducted in the United Kingdom to group entities in Germany, 
which primarily impacted the gross figures for individual items in the balance of payments.
Overall, Germany’s net capital exports totalled €227½ billion and were thus higher than in the 
preceding year (€204 billion). Securities transactions as well as other investment and financial 
derivatives recorded outflows of funds on balance. With regard to other investment, Germany’s 
TARGET2 claims vis- à- vis the European Central Bank (ECB) rose considerably over the course of the 
year. Direct investment saw marginal net capital imports for the first time since 2003.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current account
Underlying trends in the 
current  account
In 2020, Germany’s current account surplus 
went down by €26½ billion to €232 billion.1 In 
relation to nominal GDP , this corresponded to a 
decline of ½  percentage point to 7%.2 The 
coronavirus pandemic and the measures taken 
to contain it triggered unusual fluctuations in 
Germany’s current account over the course of 
the year. Due to the global shock caused by the 
pandemic, the current account surplus col -
lapsed from more than 7% to less than 5% of GDP in the second quarter. In the second half 
of the year, it quickly rebounded and stood at 
more than 8% of GDP in the fourth quarter.
The sub- accounts of the current account bal -
ance were, in some cases, pushed in opposing 
directions by the coronavirus pandemic. The 
surplus in goods trade declined considerably in 
the reporting year. This was chiefly attributable 
to the lower surplus in foreign trade. By con -
trast, receipts and expenditure in the services 
account, which traditionally runs a deficit, were 
almost balanced; this supported the surplus. 
The lower deficit in foreign travel was decisive 
here and reflected the restrictions to cross-  
border travel resulting from the pandemic. The 
surplus in primary income recorded a consider -
able decrease mainly due to lower earnings 
from German foreign direct investment against 
the backdrop of pandemic- related recessions in 
most of the countries of domicile. The deficit in 
the secondary income balance rose slightly.
These tendencies largely continued until the 
end of the year. Consequently, the one- off de -
velopments in the sub- accounts did not fully 
normalise, even though the total fourth- quarter 
balance slightly exceeded the prior- year figure.
In 2020, German enterprises were faced with a 
global economic recession on a remarkable 
scale. According to figures from the World 
Trade Monitor published by the Centraal Plan -
bureau, the volume of global trade dropped

1 Owing to the measures taken to contain the coronavirus 
pandemic, public life has at times been subject to consider -
able restrictions since mid- March 2020. These restrictions 
had no noticeable negative impact on the process of pre -
paring the balance of payments and thus on the overall 
quality of the results. However, the data sources for the 
items “travel” and “income from direct investment” are 
more limited or subject to greater uncertainty than usual. 
These items could therefore potentially undergo significant 
revision going forward.
2 The threshold of 6% of GDP set by the European Com -
mission as part of the procedure for preventing and cor -
recting macroeconomic imbalances thus continued to be 
exceeded. In its in- depth review as part of the 2021 Euro -
pean Semester, the European Commission once again clas -
sified Germany as having macroeconomic imbalances. See

in trade during the global financial crisis. The 
fall in international goods trade was, however, 
significantly faster and the subsequent recovery 
took hold more quickly than it had back then, 
which meant that global trade exceeded its 
pre- crisis level by the end of the year. While the 
trade shock hit virtually all of Germany’s part -
ner countries at the same time, China, for ex -
ample, saw a stronger and faster recovery in 
demand for imports than other countries due 
to its early and seemingly radical measures to 
contain the pandemic. In light of the magni -
tude of the demand shock, the slight appreci -
ation of the euro in the reporting year is likely 
to have had hardly any bearing. Significant de -
clines in the prices of intermediate goods and 
commodities, especially crude oil, provided re -
lief for the German economy. A barrel of Brent 
crude oil cost an average of just over US$42 in 
2020 – roughly one- third less than in the previ -
ous year.
Goods exports declined sharply as a result of 
the collapse in global demand as well as the 
temporary business closures and disruptions to 
international supply chains. In addition, com -
position effects weighed on German export 
sales, as the global recession hit the capital 
goods sector particularly hard. Imports likewise 
fell, but to a lesser extent than exports. On bal -
ance, the foreign trade surplus decreased by 
€44 billion to €180 billion in 2020. In this con -
text, price effects resulting from more favour -
able import prices significantly dampened the 
volume- related decline.
In regional terms, the decrease in the current 
account surplus was attributable to a decline in 
the balance vis- à- vis countries outside of the 
euro area (from 5% to 4½% of GDP). Here, the 
decreases in the goods trade balance and pri -
mary income balance were larger than the in -
creases in the services account. At the same 
time, the current account balance vis- à- vis euro 
area countries remained almost unchanged at 
2½% of GDP , as countervailing crisis- related 
developments in the sub-  accounts largely bal -
anced each other out.The decline in the current account balance is 
also reflected in the developments in domestic 
saving and investment. Although investment in 
Germany decreased, domestic saving fell to an 
even greater extent.3 Highly heterogeneous 
changes between sectors were also observed 
in this context. Enterprises’ investment in ma -
chinery and equipment dropped massively in 
light of both the collapse in demand as well as 
the uncertainty surrounding the economic out -
look. By contrast, private housing investment 
and government investment proved to be ro -
bust. In the reporting year, there was a surge in 
household saving, as consumer expenditure fell 
considerably more sharply than disposable in -
come. Here, the key factor was that certain op -
portunities for consumption were either un -
available or not utilised by consumers due to Unfavourable

the risk of infection.4 At the same time, saving 
among non- financial corporations remained 
largely unchanged. However, the government 
budget posted a strong deficit after having re -
corded a surplus the year before. The govern -
ment deficit is, alongside the impact of the 
automatic stabilisers, primarily attributable to 
the comprehensive government measures 
aimed to support the healthcare system, house -
holds, and enterprises.5 On balance, net lend -
ing by households and non- financial corpor -
ations rose to a very significant degree, while 
the general government fiscal balance fell con -
siderably.Goods flows and balance of 
trade
In the first half of 2020, German foreign trade 
activities declined massively due to pandemic-  
related containment measures and changes in 
behaviour both in Germany and abroad. The 
sharp downturn was fuelled by the fact that, in 
addition to sales channels being affected, the 
goods supply experienced disruptions at times 
as a result of business closures and missed de -
liveries. At the low point in the second quarter, 
goods exports and goods imports were around 
one- quarter and one- eighth below their re -
spective pre- crisis levels in price- adjusted terms. 
As coronavirus containment measures were 
eased, exports and imports of goods caught up 
quickly in the summer and continued to re -
cover during the autumn despite the renewed 
tightening of pandemic- related restrictions. In 
this context, a key role was played by the rising 
industrial activity in Germany and its partner 
countries at this time. In the final quarter of the 
year, exports still fell short of their pre- crisis 
level in real terms by around 4%, whilst imports 
had already surpassed their pre- crisis level.
On average over the year, goods exports in 
2020 were down 8¾% on the year in price-  
adjusted terms. With a price-  adjusted decline 
of 3%, goods imports fell to a lesser extent 
than exports. Here, a contributing factor was 
the fact that, compared to exports, the range 
of imported goods is less strongly focused on 
certain capital goods such as machinery or 
motor vehicles; international trade in these 
goods decreased especially sharply. Further -
more, there was increased domestic demand 
for computer and telecommunications technol -
ogy as well as for specific consumer goods 
such as pharmaceutical products and textile 
protective equipment, which were increasingly 
sourced from abroad.Foreign trade

In regional terms, German exporters saw their 
revenue fall in practically every euro area coun -
try. In this context, especially hard hit were de -
liveries to France – which was chiefly due to 
the decline in other transport equipment  – 
Spain, and Portugal.6 After price adjustment, 
exports to countries outside of the euro area 
decreased almost as sharply as those to euro 
area countries. Revenue from sales to the 
United Kingdom experienced a particularly 
strong decline, with both the relatively sharp 
drop in UK demand as well as composition 
effects  playing a part. Export business with the 
United States likewise contracted sharply. In 
addition, there was a very steep decline in de -
liveries to commodity- exporting countries such 
as Russia and the OPEC countries, with their 
more limited scope for expenditure from their 
sales of oil and gas likely being a contributing 
factor. Heterogeneous developments were ob -
served in export business to Asian countries. 
While deliveries to the emerging market econ -
omies in South and East Asia as well as to 
Japan saw relatively sharp declines, sales to 
China almost reached the previous year’s level. 
These sales benefited from the fact that the 
Chinese economy had already passed the peak 
of the pandemic in the first quarter of 2020 
and subsequently saw a considerable recovery, 
which meant that goods exports to China in 
the final quarter were markedly up on the year.
Among the exports of intermediate and capital 
goods, exports of motor vehicles, trailers and 
semi- trailers contracted especially sharply in the 
previous year in price- adjusted terms. In this 
context, a role was played by the fact that pro -
duction and sales were, at times, almost 
brought to a standstill in the spring due to slug -
gish deliveries from within Germany and from 
abroad as well as due to the government-  
mandated closures of businesses and show -
rooms. A very considerable downturn was ex -Very sharp

Deutsche Bundesbank6 Germany’s foreign trade in other transport equipment 
comprises, in particular, ships, railway locomotives and roll -

countries involved in the joint European manufacturing 
arrange ment – aircraft and spacecraft.Deutsche Bundesbank

perienced by exports of other transport equip -
ment, such as aircraft, which suffered under 
the highly depressed outlook for global travel 
resulting from the pandemic. In addition, sig -
nificant cutbacks had to be made by exporters 
of traditional capital goods such as machinery, 
as the acquisition of these goods was especially 
curtailed due to the elevated uncertainty; at 
the end of the year, deliveries still fell consider -
ably short of the previous year’s level. Less 
strongly affected were deliveries of computer, 
electronic, and optical products as well as 
metals and fabricated metal products as a 
whole, electrical equipment and chemicals to 
foreign countries. At the same time, among 
consumer goods, global demand for German 
pharmaceutical products rose.
In terms of deliveries to Germany, manufactur -
ers of machinery and equipment and, in par -
ticular, manufacturers of motor vehicles, trailers 
and semi- trailers abroad recorded sharp down -
turns on average in 2020, though their receipts 
were practically at pre- crisis levels in the final 
quarter. In the reporting year, there was a con -
siderable fall in imports of other transport 
equipment. The losses suffered by manufactur -
ers of metals and fabricated metal products as 
a whole and manufacturers of chemicals were 
less severe. By contrast, there was noticeable 
expansion in deliveries of electrical equipment as well as computer, electronic, and optical 
products to Germany. In this context, the 
greater expenditure for imports of computer 
and telecommunications technology is likely to 
have been attributable to the increased digital -
isation of work and telework activities as a re -
sult of the coronavirus pandemic. Imports of 
consumer goods saw strong growth, which 
was fuelled in part by the considerable expan -
sion in deliveries of pharmaceutical products 
and textile protective equipment (such as face 
coverings).
In regional terms, there were declines in goods 
imports from almost all of Germany’s major 
partner countries, with euro area producers 
suffering more than manufacturers in other 
countries from the fall in German demand. A 
notable exception was China, which recorded 
strong growth in revenue from business with 
Germany. The most important factor in this re -
gard was that China supplied the majority of 
Germany’s coronavirus- related import demand 
for textile protective equipment, such as face 
coverings.7 In addition, a large proportion of 
the increased imports of computer and periph -
eral equipment also originated from China. Ex -

from the euro area. In this context, other major 
suppliers from South and East Asia as well as 
central and eastern European EU Member 
States, the United Kingdom and the United 
States suffered significant declines in their sales 
to Germany. Revenue among major energy 
suppliers such as Russia and the OPEC coun -
tries experienced very considerable contraction, 
with the fall in the prices of energy products 
playing a role.
The other components of goods trade – which 
comprises supplementary trade items, net 
goods exports in merchanting trade, and trade 
in non- monetary gold – had a countervailing 
effect overall on the decline in the balance of 
foreign trade. In 2020, the balance of goods 
trade fell by €27 billion in net terms and thus 
less sharply than the balance of foreign trade. 
The decisive factor here was the lower negative 
balance in the supplementary trade items, 
which, amongst other things, was attributable 
to the subdued activities in contract process -
ing. At the same time, there was a slight de -
crease in net receipts from merchanting trade, 
as sales declined to a greater extent than pur -
chases overall. The automotive industry con -
tributed to this as it generally comprises a large 
proportion of these transactions. The balance 
of trade in non- monetary gold remained essen -
tially unchanged.
Invisible current transactions
Cross- border trade in services was impaired by 
the pandemic to an even greater extent than 
trade in goods. In comparison with the decline 
in the wake of the financial and economic crisis 
of 2008-09, the fluctuations in 2020 were also 
greater. Receipts from the export of services fell 
by nearly 14% on the year, whilst expenditure 
on services from abroad fell by nearly one- fifth. 
The balance of the services account, which 
traditionally runs a large deficit in Germany, re -
corded a slight surplus last year, following a 
deficit of €20½ billion in the year prior to the 
pandemic.The main reason for the large deficit in the ser -
vices account in the past was the high expend -
iture on travel abroad by German residents. In 
connection with the travel warnings and re -
strictions to contain the pandemic – including 
border closures in some cases – this position 
shrunk by more than half from over €83 billion 
in 2019 to €36 billion last year. Whilst expend -
iture on trips to Germany’s neighbours was 
down by nearly one- half, which is already a 
huge fall, expenditure on long- haul journeys 
plummeted by more than three- quarters. Fur -
thermore, travel receipts from non- residents 
also fell by nearly half to €19½ billion. For trips 
to Germany, a large role was played by the 
sharp decline in travel for trade fairs, events 
and business trips. Overall, the deficit in the 
travel account fell from €46 billion to €16½ bil -
lion in 2020, and thus to the lowest level since 
German reunification.
Due to the slump in economic activity last year 
in Germany and abroad, turnover fell in nearly 
all other sub- items of the services account. As a 
result of the decline in the trade in goods, both 
receipts for and expenditure on transport ser -
vices fell considerably. In contrast to the bal -
ance in the travel account, the balance in the 
transport services account had the effect of 
considerably reducing the surplus, as receipts in 
this position fell by €14½ billion, which was 
significantly greater than the fall in expend -
iture. Other sub- items of the services account 
related to the trade in goods, such as manufac -
turing, maintenance and repair services, re -
corded only marginal changes in the balance 
compared to 2019, though turnover here was 
likewise lower.
Trade in knowledge- based services and other 
business services also suffered a setback in the 
reporting year, following years of strong 
growth in the international division of labour. 
Nonetheless, the large surplus in the use of in -
tellectual property remained virtually un -
changed. Stable earnings from cross-  border 
communication and IT services coupled with 
simultaneously falling expenditure led to a con -Supplementary

traction of nearly €3 billion in the deficit in this 
sub- account. However, the deficit in other busi -
ness services grew by €2 billion, as earnings 
from abroad from research and development, 
professional, technical and commercial ser -
vices, as well as management consultancy ser -
vices fell to a greater extent than expenditure 
in these categories.
While most positions in the services account 
contracted, financial services constituted an 
excep tion. There were barely any changes on 
the year for insurance activities, either on the 
receipts  or the expenditure side. Nonetheless, 
receipts  for financial services grew by €2 billion and expenditure by €3 billion, causing a slight 
decline to the surplus in this sub- account.
Germany’s primary income from abroad ex -
ceeded its corresponding payments to the rest 
of the world by €92½ billion in the reporting 
year. As in previous years, cross- border invest -
ment income accounted for the lion’s share of 
primary income, while flows of employee com -
pensation led to a slight surplus and flows of 
other primary income resulted in a slight def -
icit. The coronavirus pandemic also had a con -
siderable impact on cross- border investment in -
come in the year under review. The surplus fell 
by €20 billion and, according to provisional cal -
culations, totalled €91½ billion, after having 
risen very substantially in the preceding years.8 
In this context, income to residents from their 
investments abroad plummeted by one- sixth to 
€175½ billion. However, payments to investors 
and capital donors from abroad fell less 
strongly, down by one- seventh to €84 billion. 
In arithmetical terms, the fall in net receipts is 
fully attributable to the lower net earnings 
from direct investment.9
Cross- border secondary income – which con -
sists of unilateral transfers – saw its deficit rise 
by €3 billion in the reporting year to €51½ bil -
lion. This was mainly attributable to increased 
payments to the rest of the world. General 
government payments increased by €4 billion, 
around half of which was attributable to cur -
rent transfers relating to international cooper -
ation and the other half to contributions to the 
EU budget. One factor in this was that Germa -
ny’s payment obligations increased as a result 
of the United Kingdom’s departure from the

Update of the international standards for external sector 
statistics and the system of national accounts
The external sector statistics and the system 
of national accounts provide key macroeco-
nomic indicators, such as the current ac-
count balance, net international investment 
position and gross domestic product, which 
can be used to assess a country’s economic 
and fi  nancial situation. They form an indis-
pensable foundation for monetary and eco-
nomic policy decision- making, enterprises’ 
business policy considerations, and also 
analysis  and forecasting in research and 
academia. As, in the world of today, eco-
nomic relationships between individual eco-
nomic agents as well as between entire na-
tional economies are in a constant state of 
fl  ux, the underlying statistical measurement 
concepts and methodologies behind these 
indicators must be reviewed on a regular 
basis in order to determine, for example, 
whether the increasing development of 
international production chains by multi-
national enterprise groups is being correctly 
captured and appropriately refl  ected in the 
macroeconomic core indicators. In March 
2020, the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) and the United Nations Statistical 
Commission initiated a comprehensive up-
date of the underlying macrostatistical 
framework, which is formed by the Balance 
of Payments and International Investment 
Position Manual (BPM6) and the System of 
National Accounts (SNA 2008).1,2 These 
international statistical standards are sub-
ject to extensive updates of this kind around 
every 20 years.
The overarching aim is to enable the exter-
nal sector statistics and the system of na-
tional accounts to more accurately depict 
more recent and increasingly relevant 
macroeconomic developments such as 
globalisation, digitalisation, fi  ntech, and sustainability. At the same time, the gaps 
and ambiguities that have become appar-
ent since the last revision process are in-
tended to be rectifi  ed. In order for this to 
be achieved, existing concepts (model as-
sumptions) need to be reassessed and ad-
justed if necessary, and the data collection 
and estimation methodologies must be ex-
panded and refi  ned.3
The update process is divided into two 
phases. In Phase I, which will run until the 
spring of 2022, task teams of international 
experts recruited from national central 
banks and statistical offi   ces as well as inter-
national organisations around the world are 
developing proposals for adjustments, 
1 These international manuals set out statistical con-
cepts and methodologies. The principal document 
governing the balance of payments and international 
investment position is the IMF’s Balance of Payments 
and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth 
Edition (BPM6). See International Monetary Fund 
(2009). The framework governing the national ac-
counts is the United Nations’ System of National 
 Accounts (SNA 2008). See European Commission et al. 
(2009).
2 For EU Member States, the statistical reporting re-
quirements based on these are laid down in regula-
tions adopted by the European Commission (Regula-
tion (EC) No  184/ 2005 of 12  January 2005 and 
amending regulations, most recently (EU) 2016/ 1031 
of 8 June 2016). Moreover, the reporting requirements 
for Eurosystem national central banks vis- à- vis the 
European Central Bank (ECB) are stipulated in detail in 
an ECB guideline. As of March 2021, reporting require-
ments are governed by Guideline (EU) 2018/ 1151 of 
the European Central Bank of 2 August 2018 amend-
ing Guideline ECB/ 2011/ 23 on the statistical reporting 
requirements of the European Central Bank in the fi  eld 
of external statistics (ECB/ 2018/ 19).
3 With regard to the respective national practices for 
producing external sector statistics, it should be taken 
into account that the international manuals as well as 
the EU Regulation and ECB Guideline are conceptual 
parameters for the respective statistical output (“out-
put orientation”). The question of which data collec-
tion methods provide the conceptually desired infor-
mation in each individual case is a matter for each na-
tional producer of offi   cial statistics and their own stat-
istical expertise and depends not least on the economic 
structures of the respective country.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
March 2021

amendments and additions to each man-
ual. The guidance notes drawn up by these 
task teams will then undergo a multi- stage 
approval process, which also includes a 
public consultation period in which all 
stakeholders can participate via the IMF 
website.4 Phase II will involve incorporating 
the approved guidance notes into the draft 
versions of the new manuals as well as con-
ducting additional rounds of consultation; 
this phase is scheduled to be completed in 
spring 2025. In the years thereafter, Euro-
pean data reporting requirements will be 
adjusted and, fi  nally, the German external 
sector statistics will be switched over to the new system. The complex organisational 
structure and the approval process in the 
current update cycle are intended to ensure 
extensive consistency between the external 
sector statistics and the system of national 
accounts. This will be crucial for amalgam-
ating and comparing statistical results at 
both the national and international levels.
The variety of topics identifi  ed over recent 
years have been divided into a number of 
blocks. The three topic areas that primarily 
concern the external sector are the respon-
sibility of the IMF Committee on Balance of 
Payments Statistics (BOPCOM).5 Due to the 
thematic overlap with the national ac-
counts, statisticians from both fi  elds are 
represented in fi  ve additional task teams.6 
The Bundesbank also participates in these 
committees and task teams.
The Balance of Payments Task Team (BPTT) 
is responsible for overarching conceptual 
issues concerning external sector statistics. 
In particular, additions to the international 
investment position aim to improve its ana-
lytical potential, including with regard to as-
sessing a country’s asset and debt pos-

Comments can be submitted via the websites of the 
individual task teams. A public consultation period of 
four weeks, which will begin at different times de-
pending on the progress of the work, is scheduled for 
each guidance note.
5 The committee, which was established in 1992, ad-
vises the IMF on methodological and conceptual issues 
in the context of balance of payments and inter-
national investment position statistics. At present, its 
membership consists of 15 external sector statisticians 
from national central banks and additional representa-
tives from international organisations. For more infor-
mation, see https://www.imf.org/external/bopage/

6 Alongside the BOPCOM, these fi  ve task teams also 
work in conjunction with the Intersecretariat Working 
Group on National Accounts (ISWGNA). The ISWGNA 
is an interagency body set up by the United Nations 
Statistical Commission in the early 1980s which coord-
inates the statistical work of international organisa-
tions. The fi  ve members of the ISWGNA are the Euro-
pean Commission, the IMF, the Organisation for Eco-
nomic Co- operation and Development (OECD), the 
United Nations (UN), and the World Bank.The procedure from draft to approval of

itions. A detailed account explaining bal-
ance sheet changes in the international in-
vestment position is envisaged as a new 
standard component of the statistics and, 
at the international level, is intended to be 
incorporated into the IMF’s External Sector 
Report, amongst other publications. While 
this is already standard practice in most 
European countries, the Bundesbank ex-
pects that valuable analytical insight will be 
gained from regularly publishing these data 
in other countries as well. Furthermore, for 
the fi  rst time, the new balance of payments 
manual will discuss the introduction of a 
standardised defi  nition of net international 
reserves as well as how these are reported. 
Net international reserves are a metric that 
also play a major role in the context of IMF 
lending programmes. The goal is to more 
transparently capture the international re-
serves actually available to a given country. 
The task team is also investigating the pos-
sibilities of recording “sustainable fi  nancing instruments” separately in the accounting 
systems. This is part of a topic area that the 
Bundesbank is working on with high prior-
ity at various levels.
The Current Account Task Team (CATT) pro-
vides consultation on issues including how 
global phenomena – such as the growing 
cross- border activities of what are known as 
“factoryless goods producers”  – can be 
measured more effectively. Likewise, the 
multifaceted impacts of globalisation and 
digitalisation have necessitated, amongst 
other things, clearer delineation between 
trade in goods and trade in services as well 
as an expanded depiction of trade accord-
ing to enterprise characteristics in order to 
better identify the role of multinational 
groups. As the current account refl  ects the 
global production structures of these agents 
and their corresponding repercussions on 
national value added, there is broad cross-
over with the Globalization Task Team Committees and task teams in the update process

(GZTT) in this subject area. In light of Ger-
many’s signifi  cant degree of interconnect-
edness in global trade and international 
value chains, the treatment of these topics 
plays a key role for the Bundesbank since 
they have an impact on Germany’s macro-
economic results and indicators as well.
A major challenge facing the Direct Invest-
ment Task Team (DITT) is establishing a 
clearer distinction between foreign direct 
investment fl  ows and foreign direct invest-
ment stocks with regard to business object-
ives. This comprises topics such as the def-
inition and identifi  cation of the country of 
ultimate ownership of a corporate associ-
ation or the actual country of investment, 
differentiated treatment of direct invest-
ment for the purpose of creating new pro-
duction capacity as compared with pure 
corporate restructuring, and the statistical 
recording of corporate inversions of multi-
national groups. Alongside improved possi-
bilities for analysis, this also presents poten-
tial repercussions on real economic indica-
tors – such as the current account (via in-
come fl  ows) – that must likewise be taken 
into consideration and weighed up appro-
priately.
Of the approximately 75 total guidance 
notes that need to be drawn up by the vari-
ous task teams, around 20 have been sub-
mitted at present. The guidance notes that 
have already been subject to discussion il-
lustrate the fact that the authors mostly do 
not want to change the conceptual prin-
ciples of the statistical accounting system, 
but would prefer to maintain the existing 
framework, including the territorial system 
and the measurement of transfers of eco-
nomic ownership. Instead, they are propos-
ing additions and adjustments to the break-
downs that need to be reported in order to 
meet new analytical requirements. From the 
Bundesbank’s perspective, this is a funda-mentally welcome development, as the 
existing conceptual principles continue to 
be analytically relevant despite the more re-
cent phenomena mentioned above. How-
ever, care must be taken to avoid overload-
ing the macroeconomic accounting systems 
with excessively detailed requirements. In 
this regard, the Bundesbank believes that 
the relevant data should be taken from the 
baseline statistics, such as the foreign trade 
statistics or trade in services statistics, or 
that adjustments should be made to those 
statistics instead, if necessary.Deutsche Bundesbank

EU. By contrast, there was a slight decline in 
private payments to the rest of the world, des -
pite somewhat higher remittances from immi -
grants to their countries of origin. Transfers 
from the rest of the world to general govern -
ment fell slightly due to a decline in the tax col -
lected on non- residents’ income and assets.
Capital movements
Underlying trends 
in capital movements
In 2020, Germany’s current account surplus 
was mirrored by net capital exports of €227½ 
billion.10 In portfolio investment, purchases of 
foreign assets by residents outweighed pur -
chases of German securities by non- resident in -
vestors. Transactions in financial derivatives and 
other investments also led to outflows of funds, 
while direct investment saw inflows and out -
flows of funds in roughly equal measure. 
Alongside the fundamental economic factors 
that determined the current account balance 
to some extent, the pandemic- related uncer -
tainty in particular had an impact on German 
capital flows over the course of the year. This 
uncertainty was very high in the first half of the 
year in particular. Following the strong eco -
nomic downturn in the second quarter, mas -
sive monetary policy interventions and exten -
sive government support measures – alongside 
subsequent progress in the development of 
vaccines  – led to the resumption of positive 
tendencies in economies and the financial mar -
kets.11 In the German financial account, these 
factors had an impact not only on portfolio in -
vestment, but also on other investment, with Germany’s net 
capital exports 
higher than in 
previous yearMajor items of the balance of payments

Deutsche Bundesbank10 Germany’s net capital exports rose slightly last year in 
spite of the fall in Germany’s current account surplus. Diver -
gent developments in current and financial transactions 
can result from different recording and reporting systems 
and from reporting errors. Potential discrepancies are re -
corded in errors and omissions. While these had been 
markedly negative in 2019, they were vanishingly small in 
2020.

German TARGET2 claims once again rising 
markedly, following a decline in the previous 
year.12
In addition, the Brexit- related intra- group re -
location of financial sector business segments 
from the United Kingdom to Germany also had 
an impact on Germany’s financial account.13 
However, this was largely limited to gross cross- 
border capital flows, with balances being only 
marginally affected.
Portfolio investment
In 2020, portfolio investment saw net capital 
exports of €42½ billion, which was the lowest 
value since 2011 (2019: €73½ billion). This de -
cline has to be seen in the context of sharply 
increasing capital flows in both directions. The 
main reason for the net capital exports was 
that domestic investors boosted their holdings 
of foreign securities by €186½ billion on bal -ance, following a rise of €137 billion in the pre -
vious year. Resident investors purchased for -
eign equities and mutual fund shares in extra -
ordinarily large volumes amounting to €66 bil -
lion and €64½ billion respectively. The fact that 
some foreign financial markets, such as the 
stock markets in the United States and China, 
outperformed those in Germany may have 
played a part in this. In addition to purchasing 
equities from the United States –  which ac -
counted for more than one- third of all net pur -
chases – residents also purchased large quan -
tities of European corporate equities.
Furthermore, resident investors purchased for -
eign debt securities totalling €56 billion in net 
terms, of which €54 billion were bonds. The 
acquisition of bonds from foreign issuers thus 
roughly matched the level of the previous year, 
but the focus changed from euro- denominated 
paper to foreign currency bonds. One motive 
for the changed investor behaviour is likely to 
be the comparatively high bond yields in some 
third countries. However, the appreciation of 
the euro against many other major currencies, 
such as the US dollar, the yen and the pound 
sterling in the course of 2020 as a whole had a 
negative impact on the yields converted into 
euro. Roughly mirroring purchases of foreign 
equities, approximately one- quarter of total in -
vestments in foreign bonds was in US paper. By 
contrast, money market paper did not play a 
major role in German investment abroad, with 
acquisitions amounting to €2 billion. The main 
purchasers of foreign debt instruments were 
enterprises –  which also include investment 
companies and insurance corporations, for ex -
ample – and households.

Last year, foreign securities trading was again 
perceptibly impacted by the United Kingdom’s 
exit from the EU. This primarily concerned gross 
bilateral flows with Germany, while the balance 
remained largely unaffected. In order to ensure 
that financial services that were previously per -
formed in London’s financial centre could con -
tinue to be carried out for the EU after the UK 
left the bloc in January 2020 and after the sub -
sequent transitional period until the end of 
2020, financial corporations based in London 
relocated parts of their securities activities to 
their subsidiaries and branches abroad, for ex -
ample to those in Germany, and German enter -
prises moved similar activities out of their Lon -
don branches. This resulted in a marked rise in 
transaction volumes in the German financial 
account. The annual turnover of foreign 
interest- bearing securities and equities rose 
from €6 trillion in 2018 to €11½ trillion in 2019, 
followed by €17½ trillion in 2020.
Inward portfolio investment in Germany in 
2020 recorded a balance of €144 billion, which 
was a huge jump in demand from the previous 
year (€63½ billion). Non- resident investors ac -
quired domestic bonds in the amount of €79½ 
billion. Of this, €70 billion was attributable to 
structured products (warrants and certificates), 
which have been classified as securities under 
certain conditions since 2007. The high inflows 
of funds in this area are predominantly attribut -
able to intra- group sales of these securities by 
domestic issuing houses to their non- resident 
parent and affiliated companies.14 In return, 
domestic units acquired external assets in the 
form of economically equivalent derivatives or 
fixed- term deposits, which are recorded under 
financial derivatives and other credit transac -
tions respectively. In addition, foreign investors 
purchased additional private bonds in the 
amount of €5 billion, and in comparison to 
2019 shifted funds out of bank bonds and into 
corporate bonds. Net investments in public 
sector bonds were comparatively low at €1 bil -
lion. The purchases by foreign investors stood 
in contrast to cross- border purchases of secur -
ities by the Bundesbank in the context of the Eurosystem’s asset purchase programmes.15

14 Overall, as much as €94½ billion in debt securities was 
attributable to warrants and certificates, as long- dated 
paper was supplemented by corresponding short- dated 
paper in the amount of €24 billion. This business model 
already  played an important role in portfolio flows in Ger -
many’s balance of payments even before the financial crisis 
(see Deutsche Bundesbank (2008)). In the last two years, 
the cross-  border settlement of underwriting business in 
structured products increased again considerably. One of 
the main reasons for the surge in the reporting year was, in 
particular, the restructuring measures carried out by key 
market participants. In addition, alongside the efficient 
technical conditions for securities issuance in Germany, the 
implementation of the new EU Prospectus Regulation in 
Germany in 2019 is likely to have contributed to the pick- 
up in this market segment. For example, with the “Euro -
pean passport”, a single approval of the securities prospec -
tus by the national competent authority is sufficient for the 
security to be listed on various EU exchanges.

the economic situation.Deutsche Bundesbank

on to the Bundesbank. On balance, there was 
comparatively high demand from abroad for 
money market paper (€80 billion), with foreign 
investors adding almost exclusively public sec -
tor bonds to their portfolios. This reflects the 
high issuance by the Federal Government in 
this segment in connection with the corona -
virus pandemic and the government support 
measures. On balance, non- residents only mar -
ginally increased their holdings of private 
money market paper (€½ billion). They also dis -
posed of shares issued by German enterprises, 
while purchases and sales of mutual fund 
shares more or less balanced each other out.
Financial derivatives, which are aggregated to 
form a single item in the balance of payments, 
recorded net capital exports of €99 billion in 
2020. This is a significant increase compared to 
2019 (€24½ billion). This expansion can be ex -
plained for the most part by intra- group coun -
tertrades in the form of OTC options on the 
aforementioned transactions involving certifi -cates and warrants of issuing houses.16 In com -
parison, forward contracts, which had previ -
ously been the dominating position, increased 
by a much smaller amount in 2020. Cross-  
border forward and futures contracts relating 
to electricity and gas, which are also recorded 
under financial derivatives, resulted in net cap -
ital imports totalling €3 billion.
Direct investment
The coronavirus pandemic left a considerable 
mark on foreign direct investment (FDI) the 
world over in 2020. The United Nations Con -
ference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) 
estimates that global FDI flows last year fell by 
42% compared with 2019.17 According to 
UNCTAD’s assessment, the decline affected all 
forms of FDI: mergers and acquisitions (M&As), 
planned relocations of firms (greenfield pro -
jects) and international project finance. Diver -
gent developments in individual countries and 
regions were behind this decline. The de -
veloped countries were hit particularly hard: 
accord ing to UNCTAD data, FDI flows to this 
group of countries were down by 69% on the 
year. One factor was that multinational enter -
prises significantly reduced new equity invest -
ments on balance and, in some cases, even 
repatriated  previously committed loans. At 
around 12% according to UNCTAD data, FDI 
flows to developing countries did not fall as 
precipitously. Here, too, there were great dif -
ferences according to country and region.
Despite the difficult framework conditions, FDI 
flows from and to Germany have remained 
relatively buoyant. However, surveys point to

How are foreign pandemic response measures affecting 
Germany’s cross- border capital fl  ows?*
Since early 2020, the COVID- 19 pandemic 
has been having a major impact on eco-
nomic activity. Across the globe, countries 
temporarily took drastic measures to slow 
the spread of the virus, such as border clos-
ures and national lockdowns. The macro-
economic repercussions of the pandemic 
are far- reaching. The International Monet-
ary Fund estimates that global economic 
growth fell by around 3.5% in 2020.1 The 
World Trade Organization expects a drop in 
world trade of around 10%.2 The impact of 
the pandemic on cross- border capital fl  ows 
is less clear. At the onset of the crisis, some 
countries experienced massive outfl  ows of 
capital as foreign investors withdrew capital 
or domestic market participants transferred 
capital abroad. However, the volume of 
these outfIows was no higher than in earlier  
periods of stress. The fl  ight to safe havens 
such as Germany was also only temporary. 
This was due, not least, to the massive 
monetary policy interventions by most cen-
tral banks. Lane (2020) argues that it was 
primarily the Eurosystem’s pandemic emer-
gency purchase programme (PEPP) that 
substantially supported the fi  nancial mar-
kets from April 2020 onwards. Other cen-
tral banks in advanced economies also re-
sponded vigorously to the outbreak of the 
pandemic. However, in addition to this un-
precedented provision of global liquidity, 
government measures –  which differed 
widely in some cases – are likely to have af-fected cross- border capital fl  ows. This study 
investigates how the policy measures of for-
eign governments in response to the 
coronavirus pandemic affected bilateral 
fi  nan cial fl  ows with Germany.3
The analysis combines information from 
two datasets. Data on Germany’s cross- 
border capital fl  ows are drawn from the 
balance of payments statistics, using 
monthly fi  gures from January 2019 to 
Decem ber 2020. On average, this dataset 
includes around 26,000 reports and around 
4,000 reporting entities per month.
The chart below maps Germany’s capital in-
fl  ows from and outfl  ows to the rest of the 
world and compares the fi  gures for 2019 
and 2020. Capital infl  ows are defi  ned as the

and the purchase of German assets by for-
eign investors, while capital outfl  ows are 
defi  ned as the purchase of foreign assets by 
German investors and the sale of German 
assets by foreign investors. It seems that 
Germany’s gross capital fl  ows (in both 
direc tions) showed a year- on- year increase 
in every month of 2020.4 However, the 
chart also shows that, having been high in 
March, capital fl  ows fell sharply in April and 
May 2020. They then recovered and rose 
again perceptibly from August onwards.5
The balance of payments data are supple-
mented with a second dataset containing information on how Germany’s partner 
countries responded to the pandemic. This 
analysis uses the Oxford COVID- 19 Govern-
ment Response Tracker (OxCGRT).6 This 
database systematically collects publicly 
available information on policy measures 
taken by governments in response to the 
COVID- 19 pandemic, and encompasses a 
total of 19 indicators. These are divided into 
three categories: containment and closure 
policies (eight indicators), health system 
policies (seven indicators) and economic 
support policies (four indicators). In add-
ition, the dataset contains composite indi-
cators that map general developments in 
the three aforementioned categories. These 
have values between 0 and 100.7 The data 
are available at a daily frequency beginning 
in January 2020, for a total of 188 coun-
tries.
The adjacent chart presents boxplots of the 
three composite indicators.8 The indicator 
at the top (government response index) 
combines 15 individual measures into one 
value. The middle indicator (containment 
and health index) aggregates the data from

drawal from the European Union. Banks domiciled in 
the United Kingdom relocated parts of their inter-
national business to EU countries (including Germany). 
This led to a dramatic increase in bilateral turnover be-
tween Germany and the UK in the trading of securities 
from third countries. In addition, from November on-
wards, positive news regarding vaccines may have re-
duced uncertainty and stimulated cross- border capital 
fl  ows.
5 In 2020, Germany’s capital fl  ows showed a distinct 
seasonal pattern, with comparatively high fi  gures re-
corded in the last month of each quarter. This may 
have been related to institutional investors’ fi  nal end- 
of- month transactions. These are taken into account in 
the following estimates through time- specifi  c fi  xed ef-
fects.

the virus and strengthen the health system. 
The third index (economic support index) 
comprises two measures aimed at support-
ing economic activity. The chart shows that, 
as COVID- 19 spread from April 2020 on-
wards, measures were expanded consider-
ably. In addition, the boxplots show a wide 
spread, which indicates a high degree of 
variation among the countries. Another fac-
tor is that the pandemic affected the coun-
tries to varying degrees at different points 
in time. The boxplots of the individual 
measures, which are not depicted here, 
point in the same direction.
The empirical study uses the monthly vari-
ation at country level to identify the effect 
of pandemic containment measures on 
cross- border capital fl  ows. The bilateral 
fi  nan cial relationships of countries with ex-
tensive measures are compared with those 
that reacted less strongly to the pandemic.

comparison, columns four to six show the 
estimation results including the control vari-
ables.
Both the government response index and 
the containment and health index tend to 
have a weak negative infl  uence on Ger-
many’s bilateral capital fl  ows. International 
investors may possibly perceive them as risk 
indicators for the country in question. By 
contrast, it appears that economic support 
measures tend to increase bilateral capital 
fl  ows.10 The results of the baseline regres-
sions and the variation including control 
variables are very similar. It therefore seems 
that the two control variables did not have 
a substantial impact on capital fl  ows. The control variables are therefore omitted from 
the analysis below. This makes it possible to 
include all of Germany’s partner countries 
that are recorded in the German balance of 
payments.
In a second step, the infl  uence of the 
adopted measures on the different categor-
ies of capital fl  ows is investigated: bonds, 
money market paper, equities, investment 
10 Estimates that do not extend to December 2020 
but only include the period up to August 2020 show 
economic support measures to have more strongly sig-
nifi  cant effects on cross- border capital fl  ows. This sug-
gests that such measures tend to have a greater im-
pact when they are fi  rst taken and that their effect on 
the intensity of capital fl  ows weakens over time.The effect of economic support measures on different asset classes

abroad caused by the pandemic.18 To wit, Ger -
man enterprises’ outbound FDI, too, fell dis -
tinctly in 2020 compared with the previous 
year, whereas foreign enterprises’ FDI flows to 
Germany were higher than in 2019. Inflows 
and outflows were, on balance, nearly neck 
and neck in the past year (balance: -€½ billion). 
A year earlier, FDI recorded net capital exports 
of €76 billion.
Direct investment is normally geared more to 
the long term, which means that adjustments 
also tend to be more longer- term in nature. 
Nonetheless, shorter- term operations between 
affiliated enterprises also impact on FDI flows. 
This can be the case, for instance, if an affiliate 
in a country renders certain financial services 
across national borders for affiliates in other 
countries. Some such cross- border relocations 
of business activity could be seen in the past 
few years in connection with the United King -
dom’s exit from the EU. This contributed to higher – in some cases short- term – direct in -
vestment flows from and to Germany.
In 2020, German enterprises invested €96½ 
billion abroad, and thus €39½ billion less than 
a year previously. They once again expanded, in 
particular, their equity investments in foreign 
branches, by €79 billion. Foreign direct invest -
ment via equity capital in the narrower sense 
was more than three times higher than that 
conducted via reinvested earnings, most of 
which, admittedly, is still an estimate. In the 
past year, around 46% of equity capital in -
vested abroad originated from firms in the 
manufacturing sector and around 44½% from Not only long- 
term adjust -
ments but also 
short- term oper -
ations could be 
a factor in direct 
investmentGerman enter -
prises once 
again expanded 
their equity 
investments, in 
particular, …certifi  cates, foreign direct investment, and 
other investment. The analysis is limited to 
the four economic support measures be-
cause they are especially suitable for an 
economic evaluation. The table on p.  36 
illus trates the estimation results. Unlike the 
previous results, several measures show 
highly signifi  cant effects on the individual 
asset classes. Above all, cross- border capital 
fl  ows involving equities, bonds and money 
market paper appear to benefi  t from for-
eign pandemic response measures – in both 
directions. This is not unusual: they are 
liquid  investments with holders that re-
spond particularly quickly to new circum-
stances, which is refl  ected in cross- border 
capital fl  ows. By contrast, investment cer-
tifi  cates, foreign direct investment and 
other investment largely do not respond, or 
respond only weakly, to the measures.11
The aim of this study was to investigate 
whether pandemic response measures taken by foreign governments infl  uence 
Germany’s bilateral capital fl  ows. The re-
sults suggest that most of the measures to 
contain the pandemic or strengthen health 
protection tend to have a slight negative 
impact on Germany’s fi  nancial relation-
ships. By contrast, it appears that economic 
support measures, particularly income sup-
port, tend to support capital fl  ows. This 
holds true, above all, for equities, bonds 
and money market paper.
11 As a robustness check, all estimates were also per-
formed excluding the United Kingdom to take account 
of the possible impact of Brexit on Germany’s capital 
fl  ows. This did not change the results.
18 A special survey of German enterprises operating 
abroad on the impact of the pandemic conducted by the 
Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Indus -
try in the summer of 2020 (DIHK (2020)) provides a de -
tailed picture of this. Given the far- reaching restrictions im -
posed by the pandemic, 83% of the responding enterprises 
expected a decrease in revenue, and 56% of enterprises 
were planning to invest less. The impact on firms of the 
restric tions vary depending on the sector and where the 
enterprises are located abroad.Deutsche Bundesbank

firms which provide financial and insurance ser -
vices.19 In terms of volume, cross- border acqui -
sitions by firms domiciled in Germany played a 
significantly greater role last year than in 
2019.20
By way of intra- group lending, enterprises in 
Germany provided €17½ billion worth of fund -
ing to affiliated enterprises abroad in 2020, 
only slightly less than a year earlier. Financial 
loans accounted for the vast majority of such 
lending. They were divided roughly equally be -
tween affiliated enterprises abroad and Ger -
man subsidiaries of foreign parent enterprises. 
Loans from subsidiaries to their parents are 
referred  to as reverse investments. This expres -
sion illustrates the fact that the loans are 
granted across borders in the opposite direc -
tion to the actual direct investment relation -
ship. On the other hand, redemptions predom -
inated significantly among loans previously 
granted by parents domiciled in Germany to 
their foreign subsidiaries.
In the past year, too, German enterprises in -
vested in many countries and regions. Just over 
two- thirds of FDI flows were directed, on bal -
ance, to other European countries, with €49 
billion alone invested in other euro area coun -
tries. Particularly large amounts were invested 
in the Netherlands and Luxembourg, two coun -
tries where holding companies often set up 
shop. Moreover, within Europe, affiliates in the 
United Kingdom and Sweden were provided 
with comparatively large amounts. The United 
States was the main non- European destination 
of extensive direct investment (€28½ billion).… but also

20 According to the Thomson Reuters database (REFINITIV), 
roughly €57 billion was used to finance takeovers of com -
panies domiciled abroad and previously under foreign 
ownership – where the German stake after the transaction 
is at least 10%. That was significantly more than 2019, for 
which a takeover value of €33½ billion was reported. The 
time at which mergers and acquisitions are captured in the 
balance of payments can, however, differ from that re -
corded by Thomson Reuters, meaning that the reported 
figures are not directly comparable.Deutsche Bundesbank

Foreign firms increasingly provided direct in -
vestment funds to domestic enterprises last 
year. They channelled net inflows of €97 billion 
to them, up by €37 billion from the previous 
year. Foreign parent enterprises provided €66 
billion of these funds through intra- group 
loans, chiefly in the form of financial loans. 
Reverse  investments, whereby foreign subsid -
iaries grant loans to their German parent com -
panies, were a major factor here as well. These 
reverse flows are often the result of capital 
market transactions involving German enter -
prises’ financing subsidiaries in which securities 
are issued abroad and the proceeds are passed 
on to their parent companies in Germany. 
Moreover, foreign owners also boosted the 
equity capital they provided to German 
branches by €31 billion.
The regional structure of FDI in Germany shows 
that firms from many countries around the 
globe make entrepreneurial investments in Ger -
many. In the past year, a particularly large share 
of direct investment funding originated from 
US firms (€30½ billion). In addition, relatively 
large amounts of FDI flowed to Germany from 
Luxembourg, the United Kingdom and Swe -
den.
Other investment
Other investment, comprising financial and 
trade credits (where these do not constitute a 
part of direct investment) as well as bank de -
posits and other assets, resulted in net capital 
exports of €86½ billion in 2020, up from €30½ 
billion in 2019.
This was mainly because net assets via the Bun -
desbank’s accounts increased by €132 billion. 
Gross assets were even up by €243 billion after 
having fallen a year earlier. These mainly reflect 
changes in the Bundesbank’s TARGET2 claims 
on the ECB. The renewed sharp rise was trig -
gered by the increased APP and PEPP asset pur -
chases. A close relationship between the evolu -
tion of the Bundesbank’s TARGET2 claims and asset purchases by Eurosystem central banks 
had already been visible in previous years.21 The 
Bundesbank’s TARGET2 claims on the ECB in -
creased by €241 billion net last year.
The Bundesbank’s liabilities to non- residents 
likewise rose considerably in 2020, by €111 bil -
lion. The Bundesbank’s liabilities arising from 
the allocation of euro banknotes within the 
Euro system sector increased by €37½ billion 
last year. As in previous years, though, (end- of-

were responsible for the lion’s share of the 
increase   in external liabilities: at the end of a 
given year, the deposits of non- euro area resi -
dents at the Bundesbank often temporarily 
record  a significant increase, and 2020 was no 
different.
In other investment transactions, a quite signifi -
cant net inflow of funds amounting to €113 bil -
lion was recorded in 2020 via the accounts of 
the other monetary financial institutions (MFIs). 
This was attributable primarily to higher de -posits by foreign institutions, especially from 
group- affiliated banks. Deposits of non- resident 
enterprises and individuals at German MFIs 
rose, too, albeit to a lesser extent. In lending 
business, domestic credit institutions likewise 
recorded capital imports. Although they 
granted more financial loans to non- resident 
enterprises and individuals, this was not 
enough to offset the decline in their deposits at 
foreign banks.
In other investment, transactions by non- banks 
led to outflows of funds abroad (€67 billion). It 
was particularly net capital exports by enter -
prises and individuals (€55½ billion) which 
made themselves felt here. These parties, in 
particular, augmented their deposits held at 
foreign commercial banks considerably. This 
reflected , in some cases – as was the case for 
finan cial derivatives  – counterpart entries of 
transactions with structured securities issued in 
Germany. Operations by general government, 
too, led on balance to net capital exports 
(€11½ billion). These operations primarily in -
cluded repayments of loans taken out across 
borders.
Reserve assets
In 2020, there were virtually no transaction-  
related changes to the Bundesbank’s reserve 
assets.
However, the international reserve holdings are 
also influenced by balance sheet adjustments 
which, in compliance with internationally 
agreed accounting standards, are not recog -
nised in the balance of payments. The end- of- 
year revaluation of the reserve assets resulted 
in an increase of nearly €20 billion in 2020, due 
particularly to the rise in gold prices. As at the 
reporting reference date of 31 December 2020, 
the value of Germany’s reserve assets stood at 
€219 billion.Other MFIs

A new European prudential framework 
for investment firms
Investment firms have so far been monitored within the European Union (EU) using the same pru -
dential legal framework as for credit institutions. Since this framework is geared to traditional 
banking business, it only partly addresses the particular features characterising investment firms 
in terms of their business model and the riskiness of the investment services they provide. The 
Investment Firms Directive (IFD) and Investment Firms Regulation (IFR) will now place Europe’s 
legal framework for investment firms on a fresh footing that will be more straightforward and fit 
for purpose than the existing regime.
In Germany, this new prudential framework will be implemented not via the usual channel 
– which is to modify the Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz) – but by rolling out an entirely new 
piece of legislation, the Investment Institutions Act (Wertpapierinstitutsgesetz, or IIA) to stand 
alongside the directly applicable IFR. Going forward, investment firms will be assigned to three 
categories of institutions that are subject to different degrees of prudential supervisory intensity 
proportionate to their size and complexity.
The new prudential framework does not create an entirely separate supervisory regime for invest -
ment firms. Indeed, only some of the rules it now includes are completely new. In some instances, 
the relevant provisions of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) have merely been modified, 
while larger investment firms will still be expected to meet requirements that remain very closely 
aligned with the CRR.
Very large, systemically important investment firms with total assets of €30 billion and more will 
in future be defined as credit institutions according to the new regulatory classification, with their 
supervision being based on the regime used for banks. At the same time, these institutions meet 
the definition of a significant institution under the regulations governing the Single Supervisory 
Mechanism (SSM), which is why they will fall under the direct supervision of the European Central 
Bank (ECB).
All things considered, the new legislative framework improves significantly on the existing set- up 
by taking into account the particular characteristics of investment firms’ specific business models 
and risk profiles. It is highly appropriate, then, for the different sectors to each have a separate 
legal basis that can be applied more easily and more comprehensibly by the enterprises con -
cerned. All in all, the Bundesbank considers that the objectives of the revision process have been 
accomplished, which is why the new prudential framework offers a sound functional basis for the 
future supervision of investment firms in the EU.
According to the relevant provisions under EU law, investment firms are required to start applying 
the new rules as from 26 June 2021.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
25 December 2019 saw two new pieces of EU 
legislation enter into force that will create a 
new European prudential framework for invest -
ment firms. This legislative package comprising 
the Investment Firms Directive (IFD)1 and In -
vestment Firms Regulation (IFR)2 will be effect -
ive across the EU from 26 June 2021 following 
an 18- month transition period. While the IFR is 
directly applicable, the IFD needs to be trans -
posed into national law. In Germany, the IFD 
will be implemented by way of a new piece of 
legislation, the Investment Institutions Act 
(Wertpapierinstitutsgesetz , or IIA).
The existing regulatory requirements for the 
ongoing monitoring of investment firms are 
heavily based on those applicable to the bank -
ing sector, notably the Capital Requirements 
Regulation (CRR).3 This new legislative package 
is now geared specifically to the business 
models of investment firms and aims to achieve 
two objectives. Besides providing better cover -
age of activities and risks in this sector, this will 
also help the enterprises concerned apply the 
rules.
The prudential definition of an investment firm 
is any firm engaged in the provision of invest -
ment transactions as a service to customers. 
The nature of said investment transactions de -
termines whether prior authorisation to con -
duct such business is required under European 
law, specifically the Markets in Financial Instru -
ments Directive (MiFID).4
Current regime 
for investment  firms
Under the existing regulatory regime, invest -
ment firms are still supervised based on the 
legal framework for the prudential supervision 
of credit institutions (the Capital Requirements 
Directive, or CRD)5 as well as the CRR. Hence, 
these prudential requirements are transposed 
at the national level in Germany’s Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz) . The Banking Act desig -
nates investment firms requiring authorisation 
under EU law as securities trading banks, secur -
ities trading firms, or financial services institu -
tions, depending on the activities they con -
duct.6
Furthermore, there are financial services in Ger -
many that fall outside the scope of applicability 
of EU law but within the perimeters of supervi -
sion, such as enterprises engaged in factoring 
or financial leasing activities. Altogether, there 
are currently 15 different activities requiring au -
thorisation in the Banking Act for which au -
thorisation as a securities trading bank, secur -
ities trading firm or financial services institution 
is mandatory. To this end, institutions are as -
signed to eight different groups (see classifica -
tion of institutions),7 each subject to prudential 
requirements proportionate to their risk profile. 
Only institutions providing financial services as 
defined in MiFID (investment transactions) will 
be covered by the new prudential framework. 
Activities subject to supervision at the national 
level only will continue to be governed by the 
Banking Act.
Which parts of the existing framework an in -
vestment firm is required to apply depends on 
the nature of the investment transactions it 
conducts. As hitherto, the new provisions are 
geared to risk – that is to say, riskier investment

transactions will attract stricter prudential re -
quirements. For instance, providers that are 
able to obtain ownership or possession of 
 client money or securities will be subject to 
more intense supervision and stricter own 
funds requirements than providers that are not 
authorised to do so.
Why a new regime?
Even back in the days when the CRR was being 
drafted, there was debate about whether in -
vestment firms should have a regulatory regime 
of their own. This culminated in review clauses 
being incorporated into the CRR8 that required 
the European Commission to review whether a 
standalone prudential framework is needed for 
investment firms. Work on this issue was en -
trusted to the European Banking Authority 
(EBA), which judged that a separate prudential 
framework was needed and drafted proposals 
for its design. The objective was to make the 
rules less complex and granular, and to gear 
prudential intensity to a far greater degree to 
firm- level characteristics, such as business 
models and volumes.
The EBA’s preparations formed the ground -
work for the new regulatory framework for in -
vestment firms under European law in the 
shape of the IFD and IFR package.9 These new 
requirements will be applicable with effect 
from 26 June 2021.
What the new framework 
is based on
As is the case in many other fields, investment 
firm supervision is another area where directly 
applicable European legislation in the form of a 
regulation (the IFR in this case) that has imme -
diate effect across all Member States will exist 
side by side with requirements in the form of a 
directive (the IFD) that need to be transposed 
into national law by Member States.Overarching European 
supervisory  framework
The regulatory structure of the IFD and IFR is 
very similar to their counterparts from the field 
of banking supervision. The EU requirements 
set out the responsibilities, rights and duties of 
the competent authorities involved in the pro -
cess of supervising investment firms, and they 
furthermore contain the prudential and organ -
isational standards for enterprises requiring au -
thorisation.
Though the IFD and IFR are themselves already 
comprehensive regulatory texts, some of their 
individual provisions still need to be fleshed out 
in even greater detail by the European Com -
mission (using instruments such as regulatory 
technical standards and implementing tech -
nical standards). Furthermore, the EBA can 
issue guidelines10 on how the legislation should 
be applied in supervisory practice, though na -
tional authorities can choose not to follow 
these guidelines in justified cases.
Transposing European 
provisions  into German law
In a departure from how requirements for in -
vestment firms have been transposed into na -
tional law to date, implementation of the IFD 
will take place not by modifying the Banking 
Act but by creating a dedicated piece of legis -
lation governing the supervision of investment 
firms in Germany: the IIA. In future, enterprises

25 December 2019.
10 Since guidelines, unlike regulatory standards, are non-  
binding, supervisory authorities are expected to either 
comply with them or state their reasons for non-  
compliance. According to this “comply or explain” prin -
ciple, supervisory authorities must inform the EBA within 
two months of publication of the guidelines whether they 
will comply or intend to comply with them. Supervisory au -
thorities that do not intend to comply with guidelines have 
to state their reasons for non- compliance. As a rule, how -
ever, supervisory authorities are required to make every ef -
fort to comply with EBA guidelines and recommendations.Deutsche Bundesbank

and IFR will be called investment institutions 
(Wertpapierinstitute)  in Germany.11 There are 
two reasons for this particular choice of name. 
First, in the German legal system, “firm” (Firma)  
is a term used exclusively in the Commercial 
Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) . Second, the term 
“institution” will provide a degree of continuity 
with the Banking Act term of the same name 
designating investment firms within the mean -
ing of EU legislation.
The IIA is broadly similar to the Banking Act in 
terms of its regulatory classification, which 
means that institutions will not need to find 
their bearings anew if they move out of the 
regulatory scope of the Banking Act into that 
of the IIA. A draft version of this Act prepared 
by the Federal Ministry of Finance was adopted 
by the Federal Cabinet on 16 December 2020 
and is in the process of being passed into law.12 
The idea is that once the Act has passed 
through the Bundestag and Bundesrat, it will 
enter into force in early June 2021, i.e. in good 
time before the IFD and IFR become applicable.
Future categorisation of 
invest ment firms in Germany
The new regime will be implemented into Ger -
man supervisory law by creating three categor -ies of investment institutions in the IIA: large in -
vestment institutions,13 medium- sized invest -
ment institutions,14 and small investment insti -
tutions.15 Each category is subject to a different 
level of prudential requirements which invest -
ment institutions are required to satisfy once 
they have been assigned to that particular cat -
egory. For instance, the methods an investment 
institution is required to use to calculate the 
level of its own funds requirements will depend 
on how it is categorised, as will its remuner -
ation policies,16 organisational requirements17 
and the scope of mandatory reporting18 to 
supervisory authorities. Investment institutions 
are assigned to a category based on their busi -
ness model and volume.
One exception to this rule and thus, strictly 
speaking, a fourth category of investment firms 
within the meaning of the EU legislation con -
cerns systemically important investment firms. 
These are investment firms which, on account 
of the bank- like activities they conduct,19 com -
bined with their very large business volumes, 
will no longer be treated as investment firms 
on the basis of the IIA (IFD) and the IFR but as New national

the term “staff” also includes members of management

17 See Section 38(1) in conjunction with Section 41 and 
Section 43 of the draft IIA. Small investment institutions are 
required to comply with general corporate governance 
principles since they also fall within the scope of Section 41 
sentence 1 numbers 1 to 3 of the draft IIA. This means that 
the application of these provisions to small investment in -
stitutions goes beyond the minimum requirements set 
forth in the IFD.

credit institutions within the meaning of the 
CRR. In effect, then, they will fall entirely within 
the regulatory scope of the Banking Act (CRD) 
and the CRR. This applies to any investment 
firms that engage in dealing on their own ac -
count20 or underwriting of financial instru -
ments and/  or placing of financial instruments 
on a firm commitment basis21 as an investment 
service and whose total assets have a value of 
at least €30 billion.22
Being credit institutions within the meaning of 
the CRR and by virtue of the level of their total 
assets, these institutions will be supervised in 
future not by the supervisory authority of their 
home country but by the ECB under the Single 
Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).23 In light of 
these institutions’ systemic importance, the 
Bundesbank considers this form of supervision 
to be correct and appropriate.
Investment firms running effectively identical 
business models but with smaller business vol -
umes (total assets amounting to less than €30 
billion and more than €15 billion) are defined 
as large investment institutions. These institu -
tions also deal on own account24 and conduct 
underwriting business.25 It makes sense, then, 
for this group of institutions to continue to be 
subject to much of the Banking Act and the 
CRR.26 Any other investment firms not classified 
as CRR credit institutions or large investment 
institutions fall into the categories of medium- 
sized or small investment institutions.27 Classifi -
cation here is based on quantitative thresholds 
set forth in Article 12(1) of the IFR.28 These 
thresholds measure, first, the nature and vol -
ume of the investment services provided29 and, 
second, total assets and gross revenue from in -
vestment services for use as additional indica -
tors.
Germany’s national competent authorities for 
monitoring compliance with the prudential re -
quirements associated with the authorisation 
requirement for any investment institutions 
that fall within the scope of the IIA are the Fed -
eral Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and the Bundesbank.30 These two institutions per -
form this task based on a binding work- sharing 
arrangement.31 BaFin is the competent admin -
istrative authority for supervision of these insti -
tutions, in which capacity it issues any legal 
acts to institutions. These include granting au -

(EU) 575/ 2013, added with effect from 26 June 2021 by 
Article 62 number (3) of Regulation (EU) 2019/ 2033. The 
€30 billion threshold applies to investment firms individually 
and also in collective (consolidated) terms where a group of 
supervised institutions includes multiple investment firms of 
this kind. In addition, the consolidating supervisor can use 
its discretion to classify smaller investment firms as system -
ically important investment firms as well.
23 Having total assets of €30 billion is one of the condi -
tions set out in Article 6(4) subparagraph 2 of Council 
Regulation (EU) No 1024/  2013 of 15 October 2013 (SSM 
Regulation) for classification of an institution as significant. 
Significant institutions within the meaning of this Regula -
tion are supervised by the SSM.

25 See Section 2(2) number 2 of the draft IIA, which cor -
responds to the investment service set out in Annex I Sec -
tion A point (6) of MiFID.
26 See Section 4 of the draft IIA.
27 In addition, Article 5(1) of the IFD allows national super -
visory authorities to exercise discretion, subject to the con -
ditions set forth therein, to apply the regime for large in -
vestment institutions to an institution providing the invest -
ment services stated in Annex I Section A points (3) and (6) 
of MiFID and whose total assets have a total value equal to 
or exceeding €5 billion.
28 The definition of a small and non- interconnected invest -
ment firm in Article 12 of the IFD corresponds to that of a 
small investment institution in Section 2(16) of the draft IIA.
29 The K- factors used in Article 12(1) of the IFR to classify 
an investment institution cover both investment services 
and ancillary services pursuant to Annex I Section B of 
MiFID . Investment firms/ institutions are only allowed to 
provide ancillary services in conjunction with investment 
services. Examples of ancillary services include the safe -
keeping and administration of financial instruments for the 
account of clients (Annex I Section B point (1)) and grant -
ing credits or loans to investors to allow them to carry out 
investment transactions where the investment firm/ institu -
tion granting the credit or loan is involved in said transac -
tions (Annex I Section B point (2)).
30 Where a large investment institution’s total assets ex -
ceed the €30 billion threshold for more than a temporary 
period, supervision of that institution should move from 
the national level to the SSM. It is for this reason that in -
vestment firms need to apply for authorisation under the 
CRD or the respective implementing legislation (see the 
version of Article 8a of the CRD that will be in force as from 
26 June 2021).

thorisation to provide investment services, for 
instance, but they can also involve measures 
against management board members and 
members of the administrative or supervisory 
board of an institution in cases of misconduct. 
Responsibility for monitoring institutions on an 
ongoing basis, meanwhile, lies with the Bun -
desbank’s regional offices. This task notably in -
cludes assessing investment institutions’ capital 
and liquidity situation and the adequacy of 
their risk management procedures by analysing 
submitted reports, inspection and audit reports 
and annual financial statements.
At year- end 2020, 745 securities trading banks 
and financial services institutions providing in -
vestment services were being supervised in 
Germany. Of that number, up to ten institu -
tions will fall within the scope of CRR credit in -
stitutions or large investment institutions,32 
around 70 within the scope of medium- sized 
investment institutions, and around 665 within 
the scope of small investment institutions once 
the new regime comes into effect.
Future own funds 
requirements  for investment 
institutions
Classification as a large, medium- sized or small 
investment institution is also the deciding fac -
tor for the methods to be applied to determine 
own funds requirements. This is intended to 
ensure that the risks posed by an investment 
institution’s business activities are at all times 
proportionate to the own funds33 it holds.34 
The next sections focus on the requirements 
for investment institutions under the IIA.35 The 
requirements under EU law for investment 
firms that will be classified as CRR credit institu -
tions going forward will not be discussed in 
further detail here or in the remainder of this 
article, as these requirements are already 
known and established.Large investment institutions
The provisions that apply to large investment 
institutions’ calculation of own funds require -
ments will remain largely unchanged. While 
these institutions will be governed by the new 
legal framework, it makes reference in many 
regulatory areas – including the determination 
of own funds requirements – to CRD and CRR 
provisions that were already applicable to these 
investment firms.36 This reference to the regu -
latory scope of the CRD and CRR is duplicated 
in the IIA.37 There is, however, one change, af -
fecting the initial capital requirement, which 
will be raised from €730,000 to €750,000.38
Medium- sized investment 
institutions 
Unlike in the case of large investment institu -
tions, own funds requirements for medium-  
sized investment institutions will be determined 
using a new method involving a combination 
of three different metrics. The first metric is an 
institution’s permanent minimum capital re -
quirement,39 which amounts to either €75,000

32 In the case of institutions currently resident in the 
United Kingdom, it is not yet entirely certain to what extent 
they will relocate their business activities to Germany.
33 See Article 9(1) and (2) of the IFR in conjunction with 
Part Two, Title I, Chapters 2, 3 and 4 of the CRR. The IFR’s 
definition of own funds largely matches the definition 
found in the CRR.
34 The primary objectives of own funds requirements for 
investment firms are the preservation of market integrity 
and investor protection. But unlike depositor protection, 
which constitutes one of the main objectives of the pru -
dential supervision of credit institutions, investors need 
only fear losing their investments in exceptional cases in

or €150,000,40 depending on the institution’s 
business model. The fixed overhead require -
ment (FOR) is the second metric to take into 
consideration. This concept could also be 
found in the CRD/ CRR prudential framework 
for determining own funds requirements for in -
vestment firms. The aim of the FOR is to derive 
the scope of an investment firm’s business ac -
tivities from the sum of the fixed overheads in 
its income statement. The starting point for this 
is the firm’s total expenses in the preceding fi -
nancial year. A clearly defined set of expense 
items are deducted from this, such as staff bo -
nuses and other variable remuneration (which 
depend on the investment firm’s net profit in 
the previous financial year), as well as taxes 
paid and non- recurring expenses from non-  
ordinary activities.41 The remainder of the in -
vestment firm’s fixed overheads is then used to 
determine its own funds requirements based 
on the FOR. These are 25% of the remaining 
sum.
While the first two metrics for determining 
own funds requirements are familiar –  albeit 
partially modified – metrics from the CRD/ CRR 
regime, the third, known as the K- factor re -
quirement,42 is an entirely new metric intro -
duced by the IFR. The aim of this new method 
is to determine institution- specific own funds 
requirements based on an investment firm’s ac -tual business model. The investment services 
provided and their scale are taken into account 
here.
Initial work on developing the methodology in -
volved defining three specific risk categories to 
which risks arising from an investment firm’s in -
vestment services can be assigned. The three 
categories represent the risk posed to three dis -
tinct groups: Risk- to- Client (RtC), Risk- to- 
Market (RtM) and Risk- to- Firm (RtF).

which an investment firm’s clients are exposed

amount of €150,000 applies to institutions that, in provid -
ing investment services, are authorised to obtain owner -
ship or possession of client money or securities. These 
amounts, too, will be higher than they are under the cur -

amounts stipulated under the CRD are €50,000 and 
€125,000, respectively).

2015/ 488 as regards own funds requirements for firms 
based on fixed overheads of 4 September 2014 based on 
Article 97(4) of the CRR already prescribes a certain number 
of items for deduction. Article 13(4) of the IFR and the draft

appropriate items, e.g. losses from the institution dealing

Details of specifi  c K- factors and how they are calculated
This box looks at three K- factors, explaining 
in greater detail the investment services 
they cover and how they are calculated.
K- AUM (assets under management), a Risk- 
to- Client K- factor, comprises the value of 
assets that an investment fi  rm manages for 
its clients under both portfolio manage-
ment1 and investment advice of an ongoing 
nature2 concerning specifi  c assets. This in-
cludes assets and portfolios, the manage-
ment of which the investment fi  rm has 
delegated to another investment fi  rm. It 
does not, however, include assets and port-
folios that have been delegated from an-
other investment fi  rm to the investment 
fi  rm which is itself required to calculate 
K-AUM.3 AUM is measured as the rolling 
average of the values of the previous 15 
months, excluding the three most recent 
monthly values. This smoothing of the re-
sults over time is intended to soften the 
impact  of short- term market volatility on 
invest ment fi  rms’ own funds requirements.
K- COH (client orders handled), a Risk- to- 
Client K- factor, comprises the value of 
orders that an investment fi  rm handles for 
clients, through the reception and transmis-
sion of client orders and through the execu-
tion of orders on behalf of clients. This 
includes  the investment services of invest-
ment broking,4 contract broking5 and place-
ment business.6 COH is calculated as the 
rolling average of the value of the total 
daily client orders handled over the previous 
six months, excluding the three most recent 
months. COH is the arithmetic mean of 
the daily values from the remaining three 
months. Different methods are used to cal-
culate the total daily values depending on 
whether the client orders relate to cash 
trades or derivatives.7K- NPR (net position risk), a Risk- to- Market 
K- factor, represents the risk to an invest-
ment fi  rm stemming from changing market 
prices of assets which it holds on behalf of 
clients in its own portfolio (trading book) on 
account of its investment services. The 
methods used to calculate net position risk 
for the different types of assets – also 
referred  to as fi  nancial instruments8 in the 
Investment Institutions Act (Wertpapier-
institutsgesetz, or IIA) – are based on the 
rules set out in the Capital Requirements 
Regulation (CRR) for calculating such risk.9
1 See Section 2(2) number 9 of the draft IIA.
2 See Section 2(2) number 4 of the draft IIA.
3 This depends on which institution has the actual 
contractual arrangement with the client to provide 
asset management or investment advice. The assets 
are counted towards that institution.
4 See Section 2(2) number 3 of the draft IIA.
5 See Section 2(2) number 5 of the draft IIA.
6 See Section 2(2) number 8 of the draft IIA.
7 A distinction between cash trades and derivatives 
is  also made when calculating the requirement for 
K-COH, and the two different coeffi   cients shown in 
Table 1 in Article 15(2) of the Investment Firms Regula-
tion are used to calculate the sub- item.
8 See Section 2(5) of the draft IIA.

vices. The RtM43 category encompasses risks to 
other market participants (e.g. other invest -
ment firms or credit institutions) that could ma -
terialise due to the investment firm’s invest -
ment services or ancillary services. The RtF cat -
egory comprises risks of balance sheet losses to 
which an investment firm itself is exposed in 
connection with its investment business.
The three risk categories are broken down into 
individual areas with specific K- factors that 
each capture and quantify a sub- category of 
risk. Investment firms that are required to cal -
culate K- factor requirements need only do so 
for those K- factors that relate to the activities 
they actually perform, however. There is thus a 
firm link between individual investment services 
or ancillary services and the K- factors in each 
risk category.
Once an investment firm has calculated the in -
dividual K- factors that are relevant for its busi -
ness model, the next step is to determine the 
overall K- factor requirement, which is the sum 
of all the K- factors.44 To do this, the values that 
the investment firm has calculated for the re -
spective K- factors are multiplied by coefficients 
for each K- factor, as specified in the IFR.45 The 
weighted K- factors are then added together to 
produce a grand total.
The results of all three of the calculation 
methods presented in this section are used to 
determine the own funds requirements of an 
investment firm that will be classified as a 
medium- sized investment institution in Ger -
many going forward. The own funds require -
ment for this category of investment institution 
is then equal to the highest of its permanent 
minimum capital requirement, FOR or K- factor 
requirement.46
Small investment institutions
The approach for small investment institutions 
remains in line with the CRD/ CRR provisions 
previously applicable to this type of investment firm. The own funds requirement of a small in -
vestment institution is the higher of its perman -
ent minimum capital requirement or FOR.
This simplified calculation also accounts for the 
fact that the institutions in this category tend 
to be smaller institutions that are generally less 
risky.
Although the K- factor requirement for this 
group of institutions plays no role in determin -
ing own funds requirements, it is still of crucial 
importance. The IFR thresholds that will serve 
as a basis for classifying an investment firm as 
medium- sized or small47 are based on precisely 
these K- factors and need to be calculated as 
stipulated in the relevant IFR provisions.
Future liquidity requirements 
for investment institutions
Besides own funds requirements, the liquidity 
requirements for these institutions are another 
core regulatory component. A prudentially de -
fined minimum liquidity requirement is in -
tended to ensure that institutions can meet 
their payment obligations at all times and thus 
guarantee their survival. The approach adopted 
here is not a going- concern approach, in which 
an institution has sufficient liquidity available at 
all times to continue operating, but rather a 
gone- concern approach. This is defined as an 
institution no longer having sufficient liquidity 
available to continue business operations, but 
still having sufficient liquid funds for the orderly 
winding- down of the firm once business oper -
ations have ceased.Risk quantifica -

43 The term “Risk- to- Market” should not be confused with 
the term “market risk” from the field of banking supervi -
sion. In the context of the IFR, the risks quantified are those 
to which market participants are exposed in connection 
with the investment institution’s investment services. By 
contrast, the market risk quantified in a prudential CRR 
context is the risk that could arise for a credit institution it -
self due to its trading activities.

Prudential consolidation of investment institutions
As is the case for credit institutions, the 
supervision of investment institutions is not 
restricted to the single- entity level. In line 
with the provisions of the Investment Firms 
Regulation (IFR),1 investment fi  rms that are 
parent undertakings, subsidiaries or affi   li-
ated entities within a group structure are 
also supervised on a consolidated basis.2 
The aim is to measure and assess, as a 
whole, the risks emanating from all individ-
ual investment fi  rms within such a group. 
This is intended to ensure that suffi   cient 
own funds and liquidity to cover existing 
risks are always available at the group level, 
too. The IFR provisions for pooling individ-
ual group entities to take a consolidated 
view of the group as a whole are based on 
the corresponding provisions of the Capital 
Requirements Regulation (CRR).
The provisions governing consolidated 
supervision state that requirements relating 
to own funds, concentration risk, liquidity, 
disclosure and reporting also need to be 
satisfi  ed by an investment fi  rm group as a 
whole. In order to ensure compliance with 
these requirements, parent undertakings3 
and their subsidiaries are obliged to set 
up  a proper organisational structure and 
appropriate internal control mechanisms 
within the group. The methods specifi  ed for 
determining own funds and liquidity re-
quirements at the consolidated level are 
based on the methods specifi  ed in the IFR 
for application at the individual investment 
fi  rm level.4
The IFR5 also provides an alternative simpli-
fi  ed calculation method for the consoli-
dated determination of own funds require-
ments at the group level – the group capital 
test. The national competent authority may 
allow the application of this calculation method if the structure of the investment 
fi  rm group is deemed suffi   ciently simple 
and provided there are no signifi  cant risks 
to its clients or the market stemming from 
the investment fi  rm group as a whole. The 
own funds requirements of the investment 
fi  rm group are considered to be met on the 
basis of the group capital test if the parent 
investment fi  rm has own funds that corres-
pond to at least the sum of the book values 
of all of its holdings in, and contingent 
liabil ities in favour of, investment fi  rms 
belong ing to the group as well as other 
group undertakings, such as fi  nancial insti-
tutions.6
1 See Article 7 of the IFR. Detailed information will fol-
low in a delegated regulation that is based on Article 
7(5) of the IFR and is currently being drawn up by the 
European Banking Authority.
2 Investment fi  rms belonging to a group are super-
vised as if they were a single investment fi  rm. An in-
vestment fi  rm belonging to a group must therefore ful-
fi  l the prudential requirements at the single- entity 
level, whilst at the same time the parent undertaking 
within the investment fi  rm group must ensure compli-
ance with the group- level requirements.
3 Pursuant to Section 2(33) to (35) of the draft Invest-
ment Institutions Act (Wertpapierinstitutsgesetz), the 
parent undertaking of an investment fi  rm group can 
be a Union parent investment fi  rm, Union parent 
invest ment holding company or Union parent mixed 
fi  nan cial holding company.
4 In this context, it should be noted that an investment 
fi  rm group to which a large investment institution be-
longs is subject to CRR consolidation requirements.

The CRD/ CRR regime also already contains 
liquidity  requirements for investment firms pro -
viding the following MiFID services: dealing on 
own account, providing the underwriting of 
finan cial instruments and/ or placing of financial 
instruments on a firm commitment basis. How -
ever, the CRR contains an exemption option for 
such investment firms, allowing national com -
petent authorities to exempt them from apply -
ing these liquidity requirements. Use has been 
made of this option in Germany. These invest -
ment firms have continued to apply the na -
tional liquidity provisions pre- dating the intro -
duction of the CRR, i.e. the Liquidity Regulation 
(Liquiditätsverordnung) .
The new prudential framework now establishes 
liquidity rules for all types of investment institu -
tions, irrespective of the type of investment 
business they perform. In future, large invest -
ment institutions will be required to comply 
with CRR liquidity provisions. Medium- sized 
and small investment institutions will be subject 
to identical provisions based on the IFR.48 An 
institution’s FOR- based own funds requirement 
will serve as a foundation in this context. Going 
forward, every institution will be required to 
hold an amount of liquid assets equivalent to 
one- third of their FOR- based own funds re -
quirement. The intention behind this provision 
reflects the above- mentioned gone- concern 
approach. While the FOR is roughly equal to an 
institution’s necessary “core overheads” for 
one quarter of a year,49 the institution must 
hold an amount of liquid assets equivalent to at 
least one- third of the FOR. The calculation per -
formed here is thus to determine the amount 
of liquidity required by an institution to con -
tinue operating for exactly one month. This 
month is considered the amount of time neces -
sary for the orderly winding-  down of business 
operations.
In order to ensure that an institution’s liquid 
assets can be used for their intended purpose, 
the IFR provides clear rules on the types of 
assets that are eligible for use as liquid assets to 
meet liquidity requirements. These include, for example, overnight deposits with credit institu -
tions, equity and debt securities as well as in -
vestment fund shares/ units.50 Small investment 
institutions also have the option of counting up 
to one- third of their trade receivables and fees 
or commissions receivable falling due within 30 
days as liquid assets.51 In the Bundesbank’s 
view, the liquidity requirements for medium-  
sized and small investment institutions repre -
sent an acceptable compromise between ap -
propriate consideration of risk and ease of ap -
plication.
New uniform reporting 
requirements 
Competent authorities need a sufficiently 
meaningful set of data at their disposal in order 
to assess investment firms’ risk situation. They 
also need to be able to gauge compliance with 
the requirements put in place. Up to now, there 
have been a variety of different reporting re -
quirements at the national level to accompany 
individual prudential requirements.52 With the 
entry into force of the IFD and the IFR, there 
will, going forward, be a standardised Euro -
pean reporting framework for all investment 
firms – much like there has been for credit insti -
tutions since 2014.53 This reporting framework 
defines the prudential areas for which reports 
have to be submitted, specifying the format Up to now,

fixed overheads in a given year.
50 Article 43(1) of the IFR defines liquid assets as well as 
the eligibility criteria and thresholds for these. It also refers 
to Articles 11 to 13 and 15 of Commission Delegated Regu -
lation (EU) 2015/ 61.
51 See Article 43(3) of the IFR.
52 An initial step towards standardisation was taken with 
the introduction of the CRR back in 2014. From that point 
onwards, all investment firms falling under the direct regu -
latory scope of the CRR (under existing law, financial ser -
vices institutions in groups I, II and IIIc) were required to 
submit their reports on the basis of uniform CRR require -

Disclosure requirements
Disclosure requirements are important in order 
to produce transparency about specific eco -
nomically relevant information on an enter -
prise. Transparent information allows markets 
to better assess the risk situation for enterprises 
and, by responding to it, potentially exert a dis -
ciplining influence. Investment firms must con -
sequently publish specific information as deter -
mined by supervisors at predefined times. In -
vestment firms have the freedom to choose in 
what manner to make the disclosure, on the 
firm’s official website, say, or through notes to 
the annual financial statements. Publication 
must take place on the same date as they pub -
lish their annual financial statements.
What information needs to be disclosed again 
depends on which category the investment in -
stitution falls into.56 Large investment institu -
tions remain subject to the disclosure require -
ments set out in the CRR.57 For medium-  sized 
and small investment institutions, the IFR58 ex-
plicitly stipulates whether disclosure is required 
and what subject areas must be covered. While 
medium- sized investment institutions are sub -
ject to general disclosure requirements, these 
apply to small investment institutions only if 
they have own funds that qualify as Additional 
Tier 1 instruments,59,60 such as silent participat -
ing interests.
The EBA has specified what information exactly 
the disclosure should contain in terms of own 
funds and own funds requirements.61
A novelty is that investment firms will, in future, 
also have to disclose details of their investment 
policy,62 which will also be specified by the 
EBA.63
Graded remuneration rules
Going forward, the rules governing remuner -
ation at investment firms will also involve 
graded requirements depending on which of the above- mentioned categories a firm belongs 
to. What are referred to as “systemic invest -
ment firms” as well as investment firms that 
will be classified as large investment institutions 
in Germany in future will continue to be ex -
pected to meet the CRD’s requirements in 
terms of remuneration. In Germany, these in -
vestment firms will therefore continue to be 
governed by the relevant regulations of the 
Banking Act and of the Remuneration Regula -
tion for Institutions (Institutsvergütungsverord -
nung) . If they are, moreover, classified as a sig -
nificant institution pursuant to the Banking 
Act,64 they must also meet the special require -
ments of the Remuneration Regulation for In -
stitutions.
For the other investment firm categories, by 
contrast, the IFD provides varying degrees of 
relief. The IFD’s specific rules on remuneration 
apply only to investment firms that will, in fu -
ture, be classed as medium- sized investment 
institutions in Germany. None of the require -
ments in terms of remuneration systems will 
apply to investment firms that will be classified 
as small investment institutions in Germany 
going forward.
Remuneration requirements 
under the IFD
Based on the CRD approach, the IFD rules 
apply, first and foremost, to staff at investment 
firms “whose professional activities have a ma -

EBA standards and guidelines on remuneration regulation
The Investment Firms Directive (IFD) gives 
the European Banking Authority (EBA),1 in 
cooperation with the European Securities 
and Markets Authority (ESMA), a mandate 
to develop supplementary standards and 
guidelines concerning investment fi  rms’ re-
muneration systems. The EBA therefore 
published a draft regulatory standard in 
January 2021, defi  ning criteria for identify-
ing risk takers in investment fi  rms.2 The 
EBA’s draft is essentially based on a corres-
ponding regulatory standard on the Capital 
Requirements Directive (CRD), however it 
also takes into consideration the business 
models of the various investment fi  rms. Pro-
portionality is taken into account through 
specifi  c thresholds.3 In addition, the EBA 
has drafted a regulatory standard on the 
confi  guration of instruments and possible 
alternative arrangements.4 At least 50% of 
a risk taker’s variable remuneration must be 
paid out in these instruments or arrange-
ments, provided:
– the investment fi  rm exceeds certain 
thresholds;5 and
– annual variable remuneration exceeds 
€50,000 or represents more than one- 
third of total annual remuneration.
The entry into force of the two above- 
mentioned regulatory standards still needs 
to be adopted by the European Commis-
sion as a Delegated Regulation and pub-
lished in the Offi   cial Journal of the Euro-
pean Union.
Later this year, EBA guidelines on sound 
remu neration policies for investment fi  rms 
are also expected.61 For more information on the EBA and its regulatory 
products, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2011), pp. 86 ff.
2 See EBA Draft Regulatory Technical Standards on cri-
teria to identify categories of staff whose professional 
activities have a material impact on an investment 
fi  rm’s risk profi  le or assets it manages under Directive 
(EU) 2019/2034 (IFD) of the European Parliament and 
of the Council on the prudential supervision of invest-
ment fi  rms, available at https:/ / www. eba. europa. eu/ 
regulation- and- policy/ remuneration/ regulatory- 
technical- standards- criteria- identify- material- risk- 
takers- under- investment- firms
3 For example, a criterion is envisaged that would only 
apply to investment fi  rms with total assets of at least 
€100 million. Another criterion presupposes a min-
imum of 1,000 employees.
4 See EBA Final Draft Regulatory Technical Standards 
on classes of instruments that adequately refl  ect the 
credit quality of the investment fi  rm as a going con-
cern and possible alternative arrangements that are 
appropriate to be used for the purposes of variable 
remu neration, available at https:/ / www. eba. europa. 
eu/ regulation- and- policy/ remuneration/ regulatory- 
technical- standards- pay- out- instruments- variable- 
remuneration- under- investment- firms. This not only 
refers to “fi  nancial instruments” in the narrower sense; 
certain contractual arrangements can also be used as 
“alternative arrangements”, provided they meet the 
require ments of the regulatory standard.
5 See Article 32(4) letter (a) in conjunction with (5) of 
the IFD.

investment firm or of the assets that it man -
ages.”65 In the context of German supervision, 
these are usually referred to as risk takers. For 
the other staff, the only requirement that must 
be met is that contained in the IFD of (gender 
neutral) “remuneration policies and practices 
that are consistent with and promote sound 
and effective risk management.”66
For all risk takers at investment firms that will 
be classified as medium- sized investment insti -
tutions going forward, the bonus cap con -
tained in the CRD67 will be replaced by the re -
quirement of an “appropriate ratio” between 
the variable and the fixed components of re -
muneration, giving firms greater leeway. When 
determining this ratio, investment firms must 
consider their business activities and the associ -
ated risks as well as the impact that the staff in 
question have on the investment firm’s risk pro -
file.
In terms of the other demands on remuner -
ation systems, the new regulatory framework is 
largely based on the requirements for credit in -
stitutions set out in the CRD and only under -
takes individual fine- tuning adjustments, some 
of which make the requirements more strin -
gent. For example, in the IFD, the thresholds 
for the proportionate application of the re -
quirements in terms of what is known as ex 
post risk adjustment68 differ from those in the 
CRD in order to take into account investment 
firms’ special business models. Going forward, 
this could mean more investment firms having 
to meet these requirements than would have 
been the case pursuant to the CRD rules or 
their transposition into national law.
German implementation of the 
remuneration requirements set 
out in the IFD
Following the IFD approach, the government 
draft of the IIA stipulates that the remuneration 
rules should apply exclusively to medium- sized 
investment institutions. For medium- sized in -vestment institutions, the IIA will include only 
general requirements,69 while the more de -
tailed regulations on remuneration are to be 
set out in a separate act.70
Conclusion
The new IFD/ IFR prudential framework for in -
vestment firms will involve large- scale changes 
for financial services institutions that already 
have an authorisation based on the current 
legal framework for investment firms (MiFID 
with the references to the CRD and CRR). The 
scale of the amended requirements and their 
actual impact on an institution vary very con -
siderably depending on the new investment in -
stitution category to which it is classified going 
forward.
Medium- sized investment institutions will be 
required to make the most adjustments. This 
category of institution will be confronted with 
very sweeping changes to its current supervis -
ory requirements in the future. For example, 
this category of institution must apply a new 
method for calculating own funds require -
ments, the K- factor requirement. There will also 
be changes, some of them significant, in other 
areas, such as liquidity requirements as well as 
disclosure and reporting requirements.
The impact on large investment institutions will 
be relatively limited, meanwhile, as they will 
continue to be subject to the requirements of 
65 See Article 30 of the IFD.
66 See Article 26(1) of the IFD.
67 Bonus cap refers to the limit on variable remuneration 
in relation to fixed remuneration. According to Article 94(1) 
letter (g) of the CRD, this ratio shall not exceed 100%. With 
shareholder approval, the ratio shall not exceed 200%.
68 Ex post risk adjustment refers to the retention of vari -
able remuneration, ex post contraction (through malus 
and/ or clawback arrangements) and payment in the form 
of instruments. As they are onerous in administrative terms, 
these regulations do not apply to all medium- sized invest -
ment institutions, but only to those that exceed the thresh -
olds set out in Article 32(4) letter (a) in conjunction with (5) 
of the IFD.
69 See Section 41 sentence 1 number 4 and Section 46(1) 
of the draft IIA.

the CRR, as before. The situation is similar for 
small investment institutions, which will fall 
fully within the scope of the IFR going forward. 
However, this category of institution will face 
very little change, especially in terms of calcu -
lating own funds requirements – a core area of 
the supervision of institutions  – as the risk 
measurement procedures used are variations, 
modified only in certain areas, on their prede -
cessors under the CRR regime.71 Nonetheless, 
these institutions, too, will have to deal with 
changes in reporting and liquidity require -
ments.
When assessing the new prudential frame -
work, a key question is whether the new re -
gime achieves the original objectives that were 
established back in 2015: creating a framework 
that is simpler and more appropriate than the 
CRD/ CRR regulations.
The new framework has been significantly sim -
plified, especially in that there is a much smaller 
number of categories of institutions, resulting 
in a sharp reduction in the number of different 
supervisory requirements that apply in parallel. 
Greater clarity was, moreover, created as to 
what requirements are actually relevant for 
what institutions.
The new prudential framework has also been 
improved noticeably. For instance, it creates re -
quirements that are much better suited to the 
special features of investment firms’ business 
models than the previous CRD/ CRR legal frame -
work. This is particularly evident in the calcula -tion of own funds requirements. The K- factors 
method creates a new procedure for calculat -
ing own funds requirements based on an in -
vestment institution’s actual business model. At 
the same time, numerous minor improvements 
were put in place in the other procedures used 
to measure own funds so that they now better 
reflect the particularities of investment services. 
The new methods for calculating minimum li -
quidity for medium- sized and small investment 
institutions are now also more appropriate and 
a better fit than they used to be.
The definitions of own funds and the methods 
used to calculate market price risk using the K- 
factor K- NPR remain the same, for the most 
part, as the rules applicable to credit institu -
tions. Especially in terms of determining market 
price risk, established procedures were used 
that deliver a valid result regardless of the 
supervised entity. In addition, level playing field 
considerations were also a factor, as the ob -
jective was for credit institutions and invest -
ment firms to remain subject to the same rules 
if they carry out the same business.
From the Bundesbank’s perspective, the revi -
sion process has, overall, achieved its object -
ives. This new prudential framework creates a 
sound basis for the future supervision of invest -
ment firms in the EU.

associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.

portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI
participations.  7 The German contributions to the Eurosystem's monetary aggregates

the German contribution, the difference between the volume of euro banknotes

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the
currency concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's
price competitiveness is consistent with the procedure used by the ECB to compute the
effective exchange rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in
competitiveness. The weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services.
For more detailed information on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of
the Deutsche Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 ECB
calculations are based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral
exchange rates of the euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following countries: Australia,
Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan,
Norway, Poland, Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United
Kingdom and the United States. Where current price and wage indices were not avai-lable, estimates were used.  2 ECB calculations. Includes countries belonging to the
