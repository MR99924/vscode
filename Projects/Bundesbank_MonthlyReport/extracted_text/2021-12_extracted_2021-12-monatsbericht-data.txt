Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Economic output in Germany could decline 
somewhat in the final quarter of 2021. The es -
calation of the pandemic, and the resulting 
changes in behaviour and containment meas -
ures, are likely to once again disrupt activity 
considerably in some services sectors. That 
said, the drops in sales are expected to be 
smaller than in the fourth quarter of 2020 as 
less stringent measures have been applied 
overall so far, and with only a smaller fraction 
of the quarter being affected. Supply bottle -
necks for intermediate products in the manu -
facturing sector are additional inhibiting fac -
tors. Industrial output rose steeply in October, 
with motor vehicle production, which has been 
hit noticeably by the supply shortages, taking 
off again in particular. In November, however, 
the share of industrial enterprises reporting 
that their production was being hampered by 
these shortages was only slightly down on the 
record high in September.1 The construction 
sector is likely to boost growth. Construction 
output was up markedly in October. Moreover, 
according to surveys by the ifo Institute, enter -
prises in the main construction sector were dis -
tinctly more upbeat about their business situ -
ation in the fourth quarter than they had been 
in the third quarter. By contrast, the assessment 
of the business situation in manufacturing, 
trade and services deteriorated.2
Industry
Industrial output rose steeply in October 2021 
after adjustment for seasonal variations,3 in-
creasing by 3¼% on the month after generally 
declining since the start of the year. Industrial 
output was somewhat higher than the average 
of the third quarter (+¾%) on the back of cap -
ital goods output, which was up substantially on the third quarter. Production of motor ve -
hicles and motor vehicle parts, in particular, in -
creased strongly following a considerable de -
cline in the third quarter. By contrast, inter -
mediate goods production decreased markedly, 
and the manufacture of consumer goods fell 
somewhat as well. It is difficult at present to 
gauge whether easing supply bottlenecks con -
tributed to the rise in industrial output. Accord -
ing to ifo Institute surveys, the share of indus -
trial enterprises reporting that their production 
was being hampered by a shortage of materials 
went down somewhat in October,4 but was al -
ready back up again in November. In the auto -
motive sector, where the supply bottlenecks 
are causing particularly severe problems, it re -
mained roughly at the same level as in October. 
At the same time, data from the German Asso -
ciation of the Automotive Industry indicated 
another steep rise in the number of passenger 
cars manufactured in November.
Seasonally adjusted industrial orders were 
down sharply in October on the month (-7%). 
This left demand for German industrial prod -
ucts 8¾% lower than in the third quarter. A 
lack of large orders was a key contributing fac -
tor to the substantial decline. However, even 
after adjustment for large orders, demand still 
slumped by a considerable 3½% compared 
with the previous quarter. Broken down by re -
gion, the decline was broadly spread, with a 
particularly sharp fall in orders from non- euro 
area countries. In sectoral terms, orders of cap -
ital goods dropped substantially, particularly in 
other transport equipment and machinery and 
equipment. Producers of intermediate goods 
likewise reported a sharp decline in orders.

other hand, registered unchanged demand, 
though producers of pharmaceuticals noted a 
marked increase. Despite the noticeable down -
turn, incoming orders are still at a high level, in 
particular in comparison with production. They 
reached their highest level so far in July, when 
they outstripped their pre- crisis level from the 
fourth quarter of 2019 by 19¾%. Unlike indus -
trial output, which was still lagging noticeably 
behind its level prior to the crisis, orders con -
tinued to surpass their pre- crisis level in Octo -
ber, even if the gap had now narrowed to just 
3½%.
Nominal industrial sales, like industrial output, 
rose steeply in October 2021, with a seasonally 
adjusted increase of 4½% on the previous 
month. They were up significantly on the third 
quarter (+2¾%). Sales to non- euro area coun -
tries grew sharply, sales in the domestic market 
were markedly higher, and revenue generated 
with euro area countries was up somewhat. 
Broken down by sector, intermediate goods 
and capital goods generated a strong increase 
in turnover, with sales of motor vehicles, which 
had dropped sharply in the third quarter, also 
showing a steep rise. Sales of consumer goods 
were down slightly, partly due to a substantial 
decline in sales of pharmaceutical products. In 
October 2021, seasonally adjusted nominal 
goods exports rose sharply on the month (+4%) 
and also compared with the average of the 
third quarter (+3½%). They were up somewhat 
on the third quarter in real terms (+1%), partly 
due to a marked rise in exports to non- euro 
area countries, while deliveries to euro area 
countries stagnated. Nominal imports of goods 
increased substantially in October, both on the 
month and compared with the previous quar -
ter (+5% and +6%). After price adjustment, 
however, they were only up somewhat on the 
third quarter (+¾%).

vious month (+1¼%) and the average of the 
third quarter (+1¾%). The rise offset the 
marked decline in the third quarter. The quarter- 
on- quarter rise in output in the finishing trades 
was similar to that recorded in the main con -
struction sector. Civil engineering saw a par -
ticularly steep increase. Construction output 
benefited from an easing of materials short -
ages. According to ifo Institute surveys, in Oc -
tober the share of enterprises from the main 
construction sector reporting that their produc -
tion was being hampered by materials short -
ages was significantly below the average of the 
third quarter. Labour shortages continued to 
grow considerably, however. Demand for con -
struction work remains high in spite of the 
massive rise in prices. Orders received by the 
main construction sector rose strongly in the 
third quarter. The reach of the order books, as 
measured by the ifo Institute, even climbed to 
a new high in November. Equipment utilisation 
edged up somewhat compared with the third 
quarter, leaving it well above its long- term 
average.
Labour market
The recent resurgence in infections has not yet 
had an impact on the labour market. As in re -
cent months, the labour market nonetheless 
recovered only moderately owing to the per -
sistent supply bottlenecks. The seasonally ad -
justed number of persons in work went up by 
34,000 persons in October 2021, following a 
similar increase in the previous month. Jobs 
subject to social security contributions showed 
particularly gratifying growth, with the num -
bers in September even outpacing the increase 
in total employment. New staff were recruited 
mainly in business- related services, health and 
social services and in the hotel and restaurant 
sector. No major recovery has been discernible 
of late in manufacturing, which also saw short- 
time working rise again somewhat. Altogether, 
the initial estimate by the Federal Employment 
Agency indicates that the number of short- time 
workers fell nonetheless in September, albeit by just a comparatively small number to 
751,000 persons. On the other hand, a large 
proportion of enterprises are continuing to re -
port labour shortages. The willingness of enter -
prises to recruit new staff is still high, and the 
number of vacancies grew further in Novem -
ber. However, the tightened containment 
measures are likely to hamper employment 
growth at the end of the year and push short- 
time working higher again.
Registered unemployment was down by 
34,000 persons in November after adjustment 
for seasonal variations. This is roughly in line 
with the declines recorded in the previous two 
months. The unemployment rate fell by 0.1 per -
centage point to 5.3%. Unemployment mainly 
declined in recent months for unemployed per -
sons covered by the statutory insurance 
scheme, which is influenced by cyclical factors, 
where it is now already slightly below the level 
of the first quarter of 2020, when numbers 
were not yet affected by the pandemic. Some 
people laid off during the pandemic saw their 
entitlement to unemployment benefits expire, 
which drove up unemployment covered by the 
basic welfare allowance. Labour market policy 
measures, too, are providing less relief than 
they did before the pandemic, and this is like -
wise pushing up registered unemployment 
among persons receiving the basic welfare al -
lowance. The unemployment barometer of the 
Institute for Employment Research (IAB) con -
tinued to fall in November and is only just in 
positive territory. Unemployment will therefore 
probably register only a small decline over the 
coming months.
Prices
Crude oil prices hovered for some time around 
the US$80 mark in November 2021 but then 
fell markedly at the end of the month. The de -
cline was chiefly due to the emergence of the 
Omicron variant of COVID-  19, which put a 
damper on demand expectations. On an aver -
age for the month, prices were slightly below Construction

those of October, but still more than 85% up 
on the year. Prices recovered again slightly in 
the first half of December. As this report went 
to press, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil 
stood at US$74. Crude oil futures were still 
trading at discounts, but these were less sub -
stantial than they had been in previous months. 
The discount on crude oil futures was US$1½ 
for deliveries six months ahead and US$4 for 
deliveries 12 months ahead.
The uptick in import prices gained additional 
traction in October. Prices of energy products 
were up by one- fifth compared with the previ -
ous month. But even with energy stripped out, 
inflationary pressure grew. At the industrial 
producer level, for which data are already avail -
able for November, prices continued to rise 
even if energy prices are disregarded. Including 
energy, they recently outstripped the prior- year 
level by roughly 20% at both stages; excluding 
energy, they were up by approximately 10%.
At 0.6%, the seasonally adjusted month-  on- 
month rise in consumer prices as measured by 
the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices 
(HICP) turned out to be somewhat more sub -
stantial still in November than it had been in 
the previous month. Energy prices continued to 
climb distinctly, mainly on the back of refined 
petroleum products. But tariffs for gas and 
electricity were raised somewhat as well. Food 
prices in general went up, too, even though al -
cohol and tobacco, which count as food in the 
HICP , became cheaper. Marked inflationary 
pressures persisted for non- energy industrial 
goods. Prices of services rose somewhat more 
strongly still than in October.
Annual headline HICP inflation increased sub -
stantially, climbing from 4.6% to 6.0%, while 
the core rate excluding energy and food rose 
from 2.8% to 4.1%. The inflationary base effect 
from the temporary VAT cut in the second half 
of 2020 (+1¼  percentage points)5 was now 
being amplified somewhat by a statistical effect 
(of just over +¼ percentage point compared 
with -¼  percentage point in October). This one- off effect originates largely from the fairly 
extensive update (carried out in response to the 
coronavirus pandemic) to the HICP weight ap -
plied to package holidays for 2021 in order to 
bring that weight into line with the previous 
year’s consumption habits.6 The national con -
sumer price index (CPI), meanwhile, showed a 
smaller increase, from 4.5% to 5.2%, for two 
reasons. First, the statistical one- off effect did 
not come into play here as CPI weights are not 
updated annually. Second, and even more im -
portantly, the HICP as it currently stands does 
not take owner- occupied housing into ac -
count, unlike the CPI. With rent equivalents 
being applied in the national CPI to capture 
owner- occupied housing, the comparatively 
moderate growth in rents has a larger influence 
on the measurement of inflation in arithmetical 
terms.7 In the current month, the statistical 
one- off effect will no longer affect the HICP 
rate, which means the latter is likely to decline 
slightly. The inflationary VAT effect will then 
likewise expire in January. Significantly above-  
average inflation rates of more than 4% are 
generally expected to persist in the next few 
months, however.8 One contributing factor 
here is the steep rise in market prices for nat -
ural gas, which is likely to impact noticeably on 
the prices paid by consumers at the beginning 
of 2022.Increase in

7 The CPI for Germany captures owner- occupied housing 
by applying the rent equivalents approach with a weight of 
around 10%. One key takeaway from the strategy review 
of monetary policy completed this year is the Eurosystem’s 
wish for owner- occupied housing to also be included in the 
HICP in future, using the net acquisition approach. See also 
European Central Bank (2021).

Public finances9
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
The statutory health insurance (SHI) scheme 
(comprising the health insurance institutions 
and the health fund) recorded a significant def -
icit of €3 billion in the third quarter of 2021.10 
The deficit was thus €2 billion higher than it 
had been a year earlier. This deterioration af -
fected the health fund. By contrast, the health 
insurance institutions saw a clear improvement 
in their finances.
The health fund posted a deficit of just over 
€1½ billion, compared with a surplus of €2 bil -
lion a year earlier. This deterioration is related 
to particular features of the central govern -
ment grants. First, the special central govern -
ment funds of €3½ billion received by the 
health fund last year were not repeated in 
2021. Second, the fund’s finances were nega -
tively impacted by its quarterly special pay -
ments of just over €1 billion to the health insur -
ance institutions, which had been prefinanced 
by central government payments of €5 billion 
at the beginning of the year. Without these 
two special factors, the health fund would 
have recorded an improvement of €1 billion on 
the year. By contrast, the pandemic- related re -
funds of €4½ billion from central government, 
which the health fund passed on to the health 
insurance institutions, had almost no impact on 
the health fund’s balance.11 These were just 
over €1 billion higher than in 2020. Contribu -
tion receipts grew dynamically by almost 4½%. 
However, around 2 percentage points of this 
increase was attributable to the rise of 0.3 per -
centage point in average supplementary contri -
bution rates to 1.3% at the beginning of the 
year. After adjustment for this, contribution re -
ceipts for employees went up by 3½%. Ad -
justed contributions payable on pensions stag -
nated as a result of the largely absent pension 
adjustment at mid- year. Expenditure by the

9 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain an in- depth description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter. 
For detailed data on budgetary developments and public 
debt, see the statistical section of this report.
10 In 2021, reserves totalling €8 billion will be redistributed 
among the health insurance institutions via the health fund 
(€2 billion per quarter). The associated payment flows be -
tween the health insurance institutions and the health fund 
do not influence the financial situation of the SHI scheme 
as a whole and its two constituent parts. The revenue and 
expenditure growth figures in this report are therefore ad -
justed for this.
11 The measures mainly comprised funds for tests (€2½ 
billion) and vaccinations (€2 billion, primarily the cost share 
accruing to vaccination centres).Deutsche Bundesbank

demic increased by 4½%, and thus somewhat 
more sharply than total contribution receipts.
The health insurance institutions recorded a 
deficit of almost €1½ billion, which was just 
over €1½ billion smaller than the deficit re -
corded a year earlier. Expenditure only in -
creased by just under 2%. Last year’s high fig -
ure was probably due in part to a catch- up 
period for treatments that had previously been 
postponed. Following strong growth a year 
earlier, spending on medical treatments fell by 
8% in the current reporting quarter. Spending 
on hospital treatments, a major expenditure 
item, fell by 1%. By contrast, expenditure on 
pharmaceuticals, in particular, saw very robust 
growth (+11%). This was partly due to the fact 
that VAT had been cut temporarily a year earl -
ier. At the end of the quarter, the health insur -
ance institutions still had reserves of €14 billion 
(corresponding to just under 0.6 of their aver -
age monthly expenditure).
The SHI scheme overall will probably post a sig -
nificant deficit for 2021 as a whole. However, it 
is likely to be markedly lower than in 2020 (€6 
billion). After the first three quarters of 2021, 
the health insurance institutions were €3 billion 
in deficit. Although expenditure growth could 
accelerate in the final quarter, spending is likely 
to remain significantly lower than the figures 
projected by the group of SHI estimators. For 
2021 as a whole, a deficit of around €4 billion 
therefore appears to be on the cards, which is 
much lower than assumed by the Federal Min -
istry of Health in autumn 2020 (€8 billion).12 
Based on the updated estimate, the health 
fund could record a small surplus (figure pro -
jected by the group of SHI estimators in au -
tumn 2021: €½ billion).
In autumn 2021, the group of SHI estimators 
predicted that the health fund would record a 
deficit of €2 billion for 2022. The health fund’s 
income from contributions and central govern -
ment grants is passed on to the health insur -
ance institutions (minus the fund’s administra -
tive costs, which are low). Moreover, transfers will be made from the health fund’s liquidity re -
serves to the health insurance institutions. They 
will receive €½ billion to compensate for part 
of the losses caused by the reduction of SHI 
scheme contributions on occupational pen -
sions since 2020. In addition, the health insur -
ance institutions will receive €1½ billion be -
cause of a special rule. These are the funds ex -
ceeding the minimum reserve level of the 
health fund based on the result of the group of 
SHI estimators at the end of 2021. The planned 
withdrawals from the reserves in 2022 were 
factored out in advance.
According to the group of SHI estimators, the 
health insurance institutions’ expenditure is set 
to rise by 4½% in 2022. On the revenue side, 
the health insurance institutions will receive 
special transfers amounting to 1  percentage 
point of the contribution rate: first, transfers 
from the health fund’s liquidity reserves and, 
second, a special grant of €14 billion from cen -
tral government (passed on by the fund). The 
institutions’ additional funds will thus rise by 
€10½ billion on the year. The special grant was 
ultimately set in such a way that, based on the 
estimate by the group of SHI estimators from 
autumn 2021 and the current average supple -
mentary contribution rates, it results in a bal -
anced budget for the health insurance institu -
tions. However, the expenditure base in the 
base year 2021 is likely to be much lower than 
the group of SHI estimators expected. As a re -

12 In autumn 2020, the group of SHI estimators was un -
able to mutually agree on an expenditure estimate. The 
health insurance institutions’ projection for their expend -
iture was €1½ billion higher than the estimate by the Fed -
eral Ministry of Health and the Federal Office for Social Se -
curity. On average, the supplementary contribution rates 
were raised to around the level of the arithmetical supple -
mentary contribution rate set by the Federal Ministry of 
Health. Deviations from the estimated deficit are thus not 
attributable to discrepancies between the actual and im -
puted supplementary contribution rate.Deutsche Bundesbank

As things stand, the additional funds for the 
health insurance institutions are to be discon -
tinued in 2023. However, the new Federal Gov -
ernment is planning various measures to in -
crease the institutions’ revenue. The details of 
these measures are not yet known. In general, 
the SHI scheme’s expenditure (regardless of 
pandemic- related factors) has been tending to 
expand much more rapidly than its revenue 
base for some time now. Without a fundamen -
tal slowing of expenditure dynamics, ever 
larger supplementary contribution rates and/ or 
ever higher tax grants are likely to remain ne -
cessary in the future.
Public long- term care 
 insurance scheme
In the third quarter of 2021, the core budget of 
the public long- term care insurance scheme 
was almost €1 billion in deficit.13 Without the 
coronavirus- related special payments to long-  
term care institutions and for coronavirus tests, 
it would have been slightly in surplus. This con -
stitutes a deterioration of just under €2 billion 
compared with the same quarter of the previ -
ous year. In net terms, this is due to the fact 
that the one- off special central government 
grant of that size last year was absent in 2021.
Revenue fell by 9½%. This was due to the ab -
sence of the special grant from central govern -
ment. After adjustment for this factor, revenue 
increased by 4%. Contribution receipts grew by 
3%. Higher employee contributions (+ just over 
4%) were partly offset by a decline in contribu -
tions payable on unemployment benefits. As 
statutory and private health insurance schemes 
are contributing just over €100 million to the 
pandemic- related special payments, other rev -
enue rose steeply.
Expenditure increased by 4%. Coronavirus-  
related special payments to long- term care fa -
cilities and for tests14 fell slightly on the year. 
Excluding these payments, the long- term care 
insurance scheme’s expenditure grew robustly, by almost 6%. With benefit rates unchanged, 
cash benefits increased by 8%. Spending on Discontinued

receipts of 0.1 percentage point of the contribution rate. 
Assets accumulated in this way are to be depleted again in 
the 2030s to dampen the expected contribution rate rise. 
Up to the end of the third quarter, the fund received cumu -
lated transfers of €9½ billion.
14 Overall, the special payments came to €1 billion. The 
long- term care insurance scheme reimburses non-  
residential and (partially) residential long- term care facilities 
for coronavirus testing costs. Furthermore, these facilities 
received financial compensation for additional expenditure 
relating to the pandemic. They were also compensated for 
revenue shortfalls caused by the non- utilisation of long-  
term care services on account of the coronavirus. If there 
had been no pandemic, however, spending on benefits 
would have been higher.Deutsche Bundesbank

non- cash benefits, a very large expenditure 
item, rose by 5%. Expenditure on residential 
nursing care grew by 2½% following a signifi -
cant decline a year earlier (-3½%).
For 2021 as a whole, a significant deficit is now 
on the cards, following a surplus of €1½ billion 
in 2020. The long- term care insurance scheme 
posted a deficit of €2½ billion for the first three 
quarters of 2021. This is likely to decline some -
what by the end of the year. On the expend -
iture side, the coronavirus- related special pay -
ments to long- term care facilities and for tests 
are likely to be somewhat higher year- on- year. 
The underlying trend of other expenditure will 
probably also remain fairly strong. Nonetheless, 
the special grant of €1 billion from central gov -
ernment in the fourth quarter to safeguard 
liquidity is an alleviating factor. With the ex -
pected deficit, the reserves would still be sig -
nificantly above the lower limit of half of one 
month’s expenditure (just over €2 billion) at the end of the year. At the end of 2020, the re -
serves amounted to just over €8 billion.
As things stand, a significant deficit is likely in 
2022, too. The additional burdens from the lat -
est long- term care reform,15 in particular, are 
only partly covered by a new regular central 
government grant of €1 billion and a higher 
contribution rate for childless persons (+0.1 per -
centage point). Without a change to the con -
tribution rate, the freely available reserves 
would be used up over the course of 2023. 
Given the expanded benefits and prospective 
demographic developments, successive signifi -
cant rises in contribution rates are thus on the 
cards from 2023 onwards.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €134.9 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in October 2021 was down sig -
nificantly on the previous month’s figure 
(€157.0 billion). After deducting redemptions, 
which were higher than in the previous month, 
and taking account of changes in issuers’ hold -
ings of their own debt securities, net issuance 
of domestic debt securities came to €2.7 bil -
lion. The outstanding volume of foreign debt 
securities in Germany declined by €4.5 billion 
during the reporting month, which meant that 
the outstanding volume of debt instruments in 
the German market decreased by €1.7 billion 
overall.
Domestic credit institutions increased their cap -
ital market debt by €7.4 billion in October 
(compared with €11.6 billion in September). 
The largest rise was in the outstanding volume 
of debt securities issued by specialised credit in -
stitutions (€3.3 billion). In addition, mortgage 
Pfandbriefe and other bank debt securities 
were issued in the amount of €2.6 billion and 
€2.1 billion net, respectively.Significant def -

During the reporting month, the public sector 
issued debt securities worth €2.8 billion net 
(following net redemptions of €6.0 billion in 
September). Ultimately, this was solely attribut -
able to central government, which expanded 
its capital market debt by €4.4 billion. Above 
all, it issued ten- year Federal bonds (Bunds: 
€6.5 billion), but also two- year Federal Treasury 
notes (Schätze: €4.8 billion) and Treasury dis -
count paper (Bubills: €3.5 billion). This con -
trasted with net redemptions of five- year Fed -
eral notes (Bobls) totalling €13.1 billion. State 
and local governments redeemed their own 
bonds to the tune of €1.5 billion net.
Domestic enterprises reduced their capital mar -
ket debt by €7.5 billion in October, following 
net issuance of €8.2 billion in the previous 
month. On balance, the redemptions were al -
most exclusively attributable to other financial 
intermediaries, which focused on instruments 
with a maturity of more than one year.
The Bundesbank was the main buyer on bal -
ance, adding a net €20.8 billion worth of 
bonds – primarily acquired under the Eurosys -
tem’s asset purchase programmes – to its port -
folio, the vast majority of which were domestic 
bonds issued by the public sector. Domestic 
non- banks expanded their bond portfolios by 
€5.1 billion net, with interest largely focused on 
foreign securities overall. By contrast, domestic 
credit institutions and non- resident investors 
reduced their bond holdings by €17.9 billion 
net and €9.7 billion net, respectively.
Equity market
In October, domestic enterprises issued €5.5 
billion worth of new shares in the German 
stock market, compared with €4.7 billion in the 
previous month. The volume of foreign equities 
in the German market rose by €5.8 billion. Do -
mestic non-  banks were almost the sole net 
buyers of shares (€14.9 billion). Domestic credit 
institutions bolstered their equity portfolios by 
€1.4 billion net, while non- resident investors reduced their equity exposure in Germany by 
€5.0 billion.
Mutual funds
Domestic mutual funds recorded net inflows of 
€20.2 billion in October (compared with €5.1 
billion in September). On balance, specialised 
funds reserved for institutional investors were 
by far the main beneficiaries (€15.8 billion). 
Among the fund providers, the main sellers of 
new shares were mixed securities- based funds 
(€5.6 billion), followed to a lesser extent by 
bond funds (€2.9 billion), equity funds (€2.3 
billion) and open- end real estate funds (€1.7 
billion). The outstanding volume of foreign mu -
tual fund shares distributed in Germany in -
creased by €10.4 billion during the month 
under review. In October, mutual fund shares 
were purchased almost exclusively by domestic 
non- banks (€29.4 billion). Domestic credit insti -
tutions purchased mutual fund shares worth 
€1.8 billion net. By contrast, foreign investors 
offloaded German mutual fund shares for €0.5 
billion net.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €15.4 billion in October 2021, down €4.6 
billion on the previous month’s level. There was 
a decrease in both the surplus in the goods ac -
count and in invisible current transactions, 
which comprise services as well as primary and 
secondary income.
In October, the surplus in the goods account 
fell by €3.1 billion on the month to €13.5 billion 
because imports of goods recorded a sharper 
increase than exports.
The surplus in invisible current transactions de -
clined by €1.6 billion to €1.9 billion in October.

the secondary income deficit expanded by €0.7 
billion to €5.6 billion, to which lower general 
government revenue from current taxes on in -
come and wealth contributed in particular. The 
deficit in the services account remained virtu -
ally unchanged at €2.4 billion. However, trans -
port services, amongst other things, increased 
on both sides of the balance sheet, while net 
expenditure on travel declined.
In October 2021, concerns about rising infla -
tion rates and a tightening of monetary policy 
in the major economies continued to influence 
the international financial markets. Germany’s 
cross- border portfolio investment recorded net 
capital exports of €27.5 billion (after €34.9 bil -
lion in September). Domestic investors added, 
on balance, €12.2 billion worth of securities is -
sued by non- residents to their portfolios, pur -
chasing mutual fund shares (€10.4 billion), 
shares (€6.3 billion) and money market paper 
(€0.8 billion), but offloading bonds (€5.3 bil -
lion). Foreign investors disposed of German 
securities to the tune of €15.3 billion net, 
mainly selling money market paper (€9.6 bil -
lion) and shares (€5.0 billion) but also, to a 
lesser extent, mutual fund shares (€0.5 billion) 
and bonds (€0.1 billion). In October, the bal -
ance of financial derivatives recorded net out -
flows (€2.3 billion).
By contrast, direct investment generated net 
capital imports of €6.3 billion in October (Sep -
tember: net capital exports of €4.6 billion). For -
eign enterprises injected their affiliates in Ger -
many with direct investment funds worth €11.1 
billion, of which just over half consisted of add -
itional equity capital (€6.3 billion). Furthermore, 
non- resident firms issued €4.8 billion in new 
intra- group loans. Overall, domestic enterprises 
increased their foreign direct investment by 
€4.8 billion. They boosted their equity capital in 
non- resident enterprises by €6.1 billion, pre -
dominantly in the form of reinvested earnings.

group loans decreased.Decline in sur -

Outlook for the German economy for 2022 
to 2024
The German economy will see strong growth over the projection horizon. Initially, however, it will 
experience another setback in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022. Tightened 
protective measures related to the pandemic will be the key factor. Furthermore, supply bottle -
necks for intermediate input products are still ongoing. From the second quarter of 2022, how -
ever, the economy will pick up significant momentum again. If – as assumed – the pandemic-  
related restrictions are mostly lifted at that time, private consumption will increase considerably. 
In this context, a role will also be played by the fact that there will likely be additional spending 
from the involuntary savings that have been built up during the course of the pandemic. More -
over, it is assumed that the supply bottlenecks will be resolved by the end of 2022. Above all, 
exports will receive a strong boost for a time due to backlog and catch- up effects. Growth in real 
gross domestic product (GDP) will normalise towards the end of the projection horizon.
Following growth of 2½% this year, this scenario will see calendar- adjusted GDP continue to rise 
sharply over the next two years, with growth of just over 4% in 2022 and just over 3% in 2023. 
In 2024, GDP growth will abate to around 1%. Aggregate capacity utilisation will be at an above 
average level in both of the final two years of the projection horizon.
This year, the rate of inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) will 
rise sharply to around 3¼%. This is attributable not only to one- off effects, such as the expired tem -
porary reduction in value added tax or the introduction of carbon emissions allowances. In addition, 
inflationary pressures were driven to a greater extent by the sharp rise in energy prices on the inter -
national markets, amongst other things. Furthermore, cost increases due to delivery and transport 
bottlenecks were passed through to consumers, and, in addition, profit margins were widened in the 
face of higher demand. These factors, as well as the most recent depreciation of the euro, will cause 
the rate of inflation to rise slightly higher still to just over 3½% on average next year, even though the 
one-off effects will largely fade away. Only once these additional inflationary factors have also expired 
in 2023 will the inflation rate see a considerable decrease. At around 2¼%, however, it will remain at 
a relatively high level in 2023 and 2024, too. The key reasons for this are sharply rising wages and the 
good general economic situation, but also the costs of transitioning to a climate- neutral economy.
In this projection, the government deficit and debt ratios will fall rapidly. This is attributable to the 
strong economic recovery and the expiration of crisis assistance measures. The planned fiscal projects 
of the new German Federal Government are not yet included in this projection, however. They are 
likely to make the new government’s fiscal policy markedly more expansionary than estimated here.
Compared with the June 2021 projection, significantly lower economic growth is expected for 
2021 and 2022, and significantly higher growth is expected for 2023. The upswing has thus been 
slightly postponed. The rate of inflation has risen consistently primarily due to unexpectedly 
severe supply bottlenecks as well as wages and energy prices rising more sharply than antici -
pated. Taking consideration of the new Federal Government’s planned projects as outlined in the 
coalition agreement, the risks to economic growth seem largely balanced as things stand today. 
For inflation, however, the risks are tilted to the upside.Deutsche Bundesbank

Economic outlook1
The German economy saw a strong recovery in 
the second and third quarters of 2021. The de -
cisive factor was the easing of coronavirus pan -
demic containment measures as of May 2021. 
This mainly benefited high- contact services sec -
tors, such as accommodation and food service 
activities as well as parts of the bricks- and- 
mortar retail sector. Due to the fact that oppor -
tunities for consumption were available once 
again, there was a considerable decrease in the 
household saving ratio, which had previously 
been exceptionally high as a result of the pan -
demic. The recovery would have been even 
more pronounced if, in particular, industry had 
not been hampered by supply bottlenecks for 
intermediate input products and sharp rises in 
commodity prices. Despite greater demand, 
value added fell to a considerable degree. This 
also dampened enterprises’ exports and invest -
ment in machinery and equipment. Overall, 
real GDP rose by 3¾% in seasonally adjusted 
terms2 during the second and third quarters of 
2021 combined. This was markedly lower than 
had been expected in the June 2021 projec -
tion.3 In the third quarter of 2021, real GDP still 
fell short of its pre- crisis level from the fourth 
quarter of 2019 by just over 1%.In the fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter 
of 2022, the German economy is likely to suffer 
a renewed setback. As things stand today, GDP 
may fall slightly. This is chiefly attributable to 
the fact that coronavirus containment meas -
ures have been tightened once again as a result 
of the fourth wave of the pandemic. This is 
having a negative impact on private consump -
tion, in particular. This projection assumes that 
these containment measures will not be largely 
rolled back until the second quarter of 2022.4 
In addition to this, industry is still unlikely to 
shift back into forward gear in the fourth quar -
ter of 2021 or first quarter of 2022. While de -
mand for industrial products remains high, the 
range of orders on hand is currently at a record 
level. Nevertheless, the supply bottlenecks are 
likely to continue for some time. This projection 
assumes that these bottlenecks will begin to 
ease gradually during the course of the first 
quarter of 2022.
From the second quarter of 2022, the economy 
will pick up significant momentum again. The 
upswing will be driven by private consumption 
as well as exports and corporate investment. In 
this context, it is assumed that the supply 
bottlenecks will have been fully resolved by the 
end of next year. Industrial output will receive a

could also be much more unfavourable, such as due to a 
new variant of the virus leading to further economic restric -
tions (see the comments on risk assessment on pp. 36 ff.).

able momentum again towards the end of the 
projection horizon. Next year, private consump -
tion will see strong growth, not only due to the 
likelihood of the pandemic containment meas -
ures being largely rolled back. It will also be 
fuelled further by additional savings that were 
accumulated during the pandemic being spent 
partially for consumption purposes. In 2024, 
this effect will no longer apply. Private con -
sumption will therefore even decline slightly.5
For the German economy as a whole, this thus 
indicates a strong upswing – with just a tem -
porary interruption – which will lose momen -
tum only as from 2024. Following a rise of 
2½% this year, calendar- adjusted real GDP may 
see even stronger growth in 2022 and 2023, at 
just over 4% and slightly more than 3% re -
spectively. In 2024, economic growth will then 
diminish considerably to around 1%. Here, 
looking at the annual averages obscures both 
the dip in the fourth quarter of 2021 and first 
quarter of 2022 as well as the fact that eco -
nomic growth will have already lost consider -
able momentum during the course of 2023. 
Compared with the projection from June, the 
German economy will recover more slowly. The 
main reasons for this are the unexpectedly se -
vere supply bottlenecks and the impact of the 
pandemic during the fourth quarter of 2021 
and first quarter of 2022, which is greater than 
anticipated due to the more contagious Delta 
variant of the coronavirus. It is estimated that 
the upswing will also be somewhat weaker 
overall, as the higher rates of inflation will re -
duce households’ purchasing power. In 2023, 
GDP will therefore not quite achieve the level 
projected in June.
As a result of the strong upswing, aggregate 
capacity will be utilised to an above average 
degree again from as early as the second half 
of next year. In the following two years, it will 
then even be significantly overutilised. This as -
sumes that potential output will only be mod -
erately impaired by the pandemic. At the pro -Recovery lagged

jection horizon, it may be around 1% lower 
than would have been expected had the pan -
demic not occurred (see the box on pp. 30 ff.). 
This year, the growth rate of potential output is 
estimated at 1.0%. The potential rate will rise 
to 1.2% in both 2022 and 2023 before declin -
ing marginally in the final year of the projection 
horizon as a result of demographic factors.
In the second and third quarters of 2021, the 
unexpectedly persistent supply bottlenecks and 
capacity constraints for key intermediate input 
products impaired not only industrial produc -
tion, but also exports and commercial invest -
ment. The supply difficulties are initially likely to 
continue for some time. Specifically, the avail -
able indicators largely do not suggest that the 
situation will ease any time soon.6 According to 
a special survey by the ifo Institute, industrial 
enterprises expect supply bottlenecks to con -
tinue to weigh on their business until around 
mid- 2022.7
As the supply bottlenecks are resolved over the 
course of next year, industry will be able to 
close the gap between actual output and the 
theoretical output that would have been pos -
sible had the bottlenecks not occurred. This will 
give exports a strong boost. Subsequently, at 
least part of the built- up orders on hand will 
also be fulfilled. The pace of export growth will 
wane again towards the end of the projection 
horizon. The backlog and catch- up effects will 
then peter out, and the sales markets of Ger -
man exporters will also see more moderate 
growth (see the box on pp.  22 ff.). Further -
more, German enterprises will lose a certain

tion due to materials shortages intensified again somewhat 
in November.

Underlying conditions for macroeconomic projections
This projection is based on assumptions 
made by Eurosystem experts about the 
global economy, exchange rates, commod-
ity prices and interest rates. They are based 
on information available as at 25 November 
2021. The assumptions regarding economic 
activity in the euro area are derived from 
projections made by the national central 
banks of the euro area countries.1 These 
projections incorporate the fi  scal policy 
measures that have been either adopted or 
adequately specifi  ed and are deemed likely 
to be implemented. The projects set out in 
the incoming Federal Government’s coali-
tion agreement do not yet meet these cri-
teria. They are therefore not included (for 
more information, see pp. 38 ff.).
With regard to the coronavirus pandemic, it 
is assumed that the containment measures 
in place in the euro area will be eased and 
thereafter largely rolled back following the 
fi  nal quarter of 2021 and the fi  rst quarter of 
2022. Furthermore, the supply bottlenecks 
for intermediate input products that are 
putting pressure on industry and world 
trade are expected to be resolved only grad-
ually.
Global economy remains on road to 
 recovery, high global price pressures 
let up slightly
The momentum of global economic growth 
in the second and third quarters of 2021 
was slightly weaker than was expected in 
the June outlook. The main reason for this 
was the resurgence of the pandemic in a 
number of countries. In addition, shortages 
of key intermediate input products were 
more acute than anticipated six months 
ago. The supply bottlenecks in industry and 
surging energy commodity prices caused producer prices worldwide to rise sharply. 
This was refl  ected in high consumer price 
infl  ation rates, amongst other things. As-
suming that supply bottlenecks are resolved 
over time and the pandemic is gradually 
brought under control, the global economy 
should remain on the road to recovery over 
the projection horizon. Price pressures are 
expected to let up again over this period.
The US economy is being supported to a 
lesser extent by expansionary fi  scal meas-
ures than had been assumed in the June 
outlook.2 In addition, the sharp rise in infl  a-
tion is pushing down real incomes, while 
supply- side limits to production are curbing 
growth. Aggregate economic activity in 
China is being adversely affected by factors 
such as the government’s zero- COVID pol-
icy and a slumping residential real estate 
market.
The global economy (excluding the euro 
area) looks set to expand by 4½% next year 
following growth of 6% this year. Rates of 
4% and 3¾% are assumed for 2023 and 
2024, respectively. At 11%, the pick- up in 
international trade (excluding the euro area) 
will be signifi  cantly stronger in 2021; at 4% 
in 2022, it will then lag slightly behind the 
rise in global economic activity. This expan-
sion is expected to edge ahead of growth in 
gross domestic product (GDP) again in the 
years thereafter (4½% in 2023 and 4% in 
2024).

of the euro area countries were completed on 1 De-
cember 2021.

Recovery in euro area continues – 
coronavirus- related setback in the 
fourth quarter of 2021 and the fi  rst  
quarter of 2022
Economic activity in the euro area by and 
large recovered in the second and third 
quarters of 2021 amid a signifi  cant decline in 
infection rates, as expected in the June out-
look. The services sector, in particular, ex-
perienced a considerable revival in response 
to the easing of containment measures. By 
contrast, persistent supply bottlenecks for 
some intermediate input products limited 
manufacturing sector output. However, this 
affected economic growth in other euro 
area countries to a lesser extent than it did 
growth in Germany. This was on account of 
the automotive industry, which was hit espe-
cially hard by the bottlenecks, being less sig-
nifi  cant to those countries on average. With 
supply problems and containment measures 
being more severe than anticipated, growth 
in the fourth quarter of 2021 and fi  rst quar-
ter of 2022 is set to be weaker than indi-cated by the June outlook. Economic activity 
in the euro area is expected to continue its 
recovery towards the tail end of the projec-
tion period. Supply bottlenecks will gradually 
dissipate, global demand will expand, and 
pandemic- related restrictions will be over-
come. For the euro area (excluding Ger-
many), economic growth is put at 6.2% for 
2021. Given the subdued expectations for 
the fourth quarter of 2021 and the fi  rst quar-
ter of 2022, the growth rate envisaged for 
the coming year has been revised slightly 
downwards compared with the June out-
look (4.2%). Growth is projected to be at a 
rate of 2.8% in 2023 and 1.9% in 2024.
On average for 2021, German exporters’ sales 
markets will see slower growth than world 
trade. This is chiefl  y attributable to the slump 
in UK imports in the fi  rst quarter. However, 
due especially to the anticipated dynamic re-
bound in demand for imports among trading 
partners within the euro area, it stands to rea-
son that the sales markets will expand at a 
greater rate than world trade in 2022 and 
2023. Their growth rate will then be slightly 
less than that of world trade in 2024.
Technical assumptions of the projection
Due to high demand coupled with short sup-
ply, oil prices in recent months rose far above 
the level that had been assumed in the June 
outlook. With storage facilities less full than 
usual and reduced delivery quantities from 
Russia, natural gas prices also reached record 
highs. However, the assumptions derived from 
forward quotations indicate that fossil fuel 
prices will fall over the projection horizon. The 
US dollar- denominated prices of other com-
modities dropped slightly more sharply from 
their peak in May than had been assumed in 
the June outlook. Following a slight increase 
next year compared with the annual average 
for 2021, they are expected to gradually de-
crease up to the end of the projection horizon.Major assumptions of the projection

The Eurosystem continued its net asset pur-
chases under the asset purchase programme 
and the pandemic emergency purchase pro-
gramme (PEPP) in the third and fourth quar-
ters. However, the ECB Governing Council 
decided in September 2021 to moderately 
taper the volume of monthly net asset pur-
chases under the PEPP compared with the 
previous two quarters. The new monetary 
policy strategy adopted by the Governing 
Council in July 2021 includes an adjusted, 
now symmetric 2% infl  ation target over the 
medium term.3 Against this background, the 
Governing Council’s forward guidance was 
also revised, under which policy rates will 
now remain at their present or lower levels 
until the Governing Council sees infl  ation 
reaching 2% well ahead of the end of its pro-
jection period and durably for the rest of the 
projection horizon. On the money market, 
interest rates fell slightly in recent months 
due to continued ample liquidity, the results 
of the monetary policy strategy review and 
concerns regarding the spread of the Delta 
variant of the coronavirus. In view of the 
higher perceived level of infl  ation risk, 
EURIBOR futures are on a steeper upward 
trajectory over the projection horizon than 
had been assumed in the June outlook. Yields 
on ten- year Bunds were down compared 
with June because of supply bottlenecks for 
intermediate input products, together with 
fears that the economic impact of the pan-
demic will be felt for longer, heightening un-
certainty about the business cycle going for-
ward. While the yield trajectory derived from 
forward quotations is slightly upward, it is 
below what was assumed in the June out-
look. Bank lending rates are likewise ex-
pected to rise gradually. All in all, however, fi  -
nancing conditions will remain favourable for 
enterprises and consumers.
Since the fi  nalisation of the June outlook, 
expectations of faster than anticipated 
monetary policy tightening in the United States have caused the euro to depreciate 
against the dollar. In the period underlying 
the exchange rate assumptions, the euro 
stood at US$1.13 and was thus 6½% below 
the fi  gure assumed in the June outlook. As 
measured against the currencies of 42 im-
portant trading partners, the euro depreci-
ated by 3¼%.
Fiscal policy (excluding projects planned 
by the incoming Federal Government): 
expiring coronavirus response measures 
and rising social contribution rates
Substantial temporary fi  scal support meas-
ures in response to the coronavirus crisis 
have been putting government fi  nances 
under pressure this year, with their cost 
equating to around 3% of GDP .4 For 2022, 
this cost is already estimated to be consid-
erably lower: while the measures will still be 
of some relevance in the fi  rst quarter (pri-
marily coronavirus- related business aid and 
3 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2021d).
4 Coronavirus response measures are relatively nar-
rowly defi  ned here (for more information, see Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2021a), p. 21). At 2¾%, their fi  nancial 
impact was somewhat smaller in 2020: while the tax 
measures will be less signifi  cant in 2021, there will 
have been a sharp increase in transfers to enterprises 
and spending on COVID- 19 tests and vaccinations.Oil price

with partner countries in the euro area, Ger -
man exporters are becoming less competitive 
as a result of comparatively strong growth in 
prices and labour costs.
Commercial investment will exhibit the same 
development pattern as exports during the 
projection horizon. Once the supply- side prob -
lems start to wane, it will see strong growth 
again. It will also be supported by a number of 
factors: a continuingly high level of aggregate 
demand, rising capacity utilisation, an invest -
ment backlog caused by supply bottlenecks, 
and persistently favourable financial conditions. 
Similar to exports, the pace of growth is likely 
to slacken only towards the end of the projec -
tion horizon.
The time path of private consumption will re -
main heavily influenced by the pandemic and 
the containment measures. The previous waves 
of infection, the measures taken to contain 
them, and the more cautious consumer behav -iour all resulted in a sharp drop in private con -
sumption and, conversely, led to involuntary 
saving among households.8 Due to the recent 
renewed flare- up of the pandemic, contain -
ment measures have been tightened once 
again. Furthermore, consumers are likely to 
avoid certain opportunities for consumption 
due to fear of infection. For this reason, private 
consumption will prospectively suffer another 
pandemic- related setback in the fourth quarter 
of 2021 and first quarter of 2022. However, 
this damper will be significantly smaller in mag -
nitude than in previous waves of the pandemic. 
This is because it is assumed that it will be pos -
sible to implement containment measures in a 
more targeted manner. For more information 
on the uncertainties surrounding this – for ex -
ample, with regard to the new Omicron variant 
of the coronavirus – see the comments on risk 
assessment on pp. 36 ff.Commercial

them will then expire from the second quar-
ter onwards. The response measures will 
play almost no role at all in later years. Gen-
erally speaking, government- guaranteed 
loans and capital injections only increase 
general government debt (not the defi  cit). It 
is assumed that debt of this nature will for 
the most part have been brought back 
down by the end of 2023.
By contrast, other fi  scal policy measures (not 
related to the coronavirus crisis) will cause 
the defi  cit to be higher in net terms in 2022 
than in 2021. Profi  t- related taxes and wage 
tax will be curbed, in particular, by fi  rms’ ac-
celerated write- offs of capital equipment 
and further adjustments to the income tax 
scale. In addition, infl  ows from the Euro-
pean Union’s Next Generation EU (NGEU) 
programme will decrease perceptibly.5 How-
ever, a small amount of additional revenue will be generated by higher tobacco taxes. 
As from 2023, measures not related to the 
coronavirus crisis will then reduce the defi  cit 
markedly. This is largely on account of the 
fact that the contribution rates of the social 
security funds will rise sharply. As things cur-
rently stand, the additional central govern-
ment grants previously paid out will cease 
to be issued starting in 2023. The contribu-
tion rate is projected to rise by a total of 
2¼ percentage points up to 2024. This pri-
marily concerns the contribution rates for 
the health insurance and pension insurance 
schemes, and to a lesser extent the long- 
term care insurance scheme. Under the 
legal status quo, the contribution rate for 
the unemployment insurance scheme will 
rise by 0.2 percentage point in 2023.
5 In Germany, NGEU is primarily used to fi  nance exist-
ing programmes, thus reducing the defi  cit in the Ger-
man government budget in this respect.

As from the second quarter of 2022, private 
consumption will see strong growth. While the 
high rates of inflation will lead to a certain loss 
of purchasing power, the key factor is never -
theless the assumption that the pandemic situ -
ation will then ease considerably and the con -
tainment measures will be largely rolled back. 
Furthermore, some of the involuntary savings 
that have been built up during the pandemic 
will be spent for additional consumption. For a 
period of time, consumers will thus spend more 
of their disposable income than they did before 
the pandemic.9 Consequently, the saving ratio 
will temporarily dip below its pre- crisis level. In 
future, however, it will almost return to that 
level, as it is assumed that households will not 
change their saving behaviour over the long 
term.10 This means that a continually diminish -
ing percentage of disposable income will be 
consumed until the saving ratio normalises. 
Starting from a high level, consumption ex -
penditure will thus decline slightly until the end 
of the projection horizon. Once this normalisa -
tion process has been completed, private con -
sumption should again grow more strongly in 
line with disposable income.
As was the case for commercial investment, 
housing investment fell short of the expect -
ations set out in the June projection in the 
second and third quarters of 2021, and even 
declined slightly overall. Supply issues for key 
intermediate input products made an impact 
on this type of investment, too. Demand never -
theless remained robust, with high levels of 
new orders and issued construction permits. 
For this reason, housing investment should rise 
again once the supply bottlenecks have been 
resolved. In light of the recent sharp rises in … with tempor -

costs in the construction sector, however, the 
pace of growth will likely be somewhat slower 
than previously anticipated. The underlying 
conditions will remain favourable against the 
backdrop of the recovery on the labour market 
and the comparatively low interest rates. In 
addition, some of the savings built up involun -
tarily during the pandemic will be used to in -
vest in real estate.11 At the end of the projec -
tion horizon, however, this effect will reverse in 
a similar way to private consumption. Further -
more, the number of new households being 
formed will rise at a slower rate (in net terms) 
due to demographic factors. Growth in hous -
ing investment will then be considerably more 
subdued.
Government investment will have decreased 
substantially in 2021; against a backdrop of 
steeply increasing prices, nominal investment 
expenditure has almost stagnated after strong 
gains in previous years. Crisis- related hesitancy 
at the local government level coupled with 
supply and implementation bottlenecks may 
have played a role in this development. In due 
course, however, public finances are set to 
largely recover from the crisis. Supply con -
straints are likely to ease somewhat, too, and 
price pressures will let up as from 2023. Over -
all, in view of relatively strong nominal growth, 
government investment is expected to increase 
from 2022 onwards, including after price ad -
justment.
Government consumption has expanded sig -
nificantly once more in 2021 on account of the 
coronavirus pandemic. Additional expenditure 
on vaccines and tests is one of the drivers here. 
By 2023, however, coronavirus- related add -
itional spending in the area of healthcare will 
largely have ceased. Towards the end of the 
projection horizon, government consumption 
will again see the same dynamic growth as Steeply increas -

prior to the pandemic, chiefly on the back of 
expenditure for health and long- term care.
Over the projection horizon, imports will rise 
sharply in line with total demand. In the final 
quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, 
global delivery bottlenecks will continue to 
dampen goods imports. Furthermore, the ex -
acerbated pandemic situation is likely to weigh 
on imports of services due to the associated re -
duction in international travel. Over the course 
of the coming year, exports and corporate in -
vestment will regain significant momentum. 
Imports will make up a large share of the inter -
mediate goods required for this, meaning that 
they too will see strong growth. In addition, 
household demand will generate a strong 
stimulus, especially in 2022 and 2023. House -
holds are likely to spend some of the savings 
they have involuntarily accumulated during the 
pandemic on travelling abroad to a greater ex -
tent. This will boost imports of services. At the 
end of the projection horizon, import growth 
will ease up due, above all, to weakening do -
mestic demand.
At just over 6½% of nominal GDP , Germany’s 
current account surplus in 2021 could fall 
somewhat short of its 2020 level. The trade 
surplus will decline somewhat more consider -
ably. This reflects, first and foremost, the signifi -
cantly worse terms of trade resulting from in -
creased prices of crude oil and other imported 
raw materials. One year ago, this trend was re -
versed. In 2022, the trade surplus and current 
account surplus will sink somewhat further, 
chiefly on account of the ongoing deterioration 
in the terms of trade. In 2023, the current ac -
count surplus could linger at 6¼%.
Labour market
The labour market saw a strong recovery in the 
second and third quarters of 2021, bolstered by 
the extensive lifting of containment measures. 
Short- time work declined substantially. As a re -
sult, the average hours worked per worker rose significantly once more. Employment also con -
tinued to recover. This was mirrored by a sig -
nificant decline in registered unemployment, 
though it has not yet returned to its pre- crisis 
level. Aside from this, the persistent supply 
bottlenecks also made their presence known in 
the labour market in the form of an increased 
number of registrations for short- time work in 
particularly affected sectors of the economy, 
for example. In spite of this, labour shortages 
were on the rise again.
In the final quarter of 2021 and the first quar -
ter of 2022, the labour market recovery will be 
temporarily interrupted. In the short term, the 
number of persons in short- time work could 
actually increase and the number of hours 
worked per worker could decrease. That said, 
fluctuations here should be considerably down 
on the first quarter of the current year, when 
well over three million people were in short-  
time work due to the substantial restrictions on 
economic life. The rise in employment will 
probably come to a near halt in the final quar -
ter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, with 
unemployment declining no further for the 
time being.
Generally, however, it is assumed that the la -
bour market will make a sound recovery. Next 
spring, it will pick up speed again as the econ -
omy regains momentum. Employment will 
then rise comparatively strongly – particularly 
for jobs subject to social security contributions, 
which already exceeded their pre- crisis level in 
the third quarter of 2021. By contrast, there will 
only be a brief interruption in the trend decline 
in both exclusively low- paid part- time employ -
ment and self- employment. As next year comes 
to an end, employment will, on the whole, be 
as high as it was prior to the pandemic. Ac -
cordingly, unemployment will decline over the 
further course of 2022, returning to its low pre- 
crisis level by the end of the year. The hours 
worked per worker will go back up. From mid- 
2023 onwards, the positive trend in employ -
ment will peter out gradually, making person -Imports rise

nel shortages resulting from demographic ef -
fects ever more noticeable.
The labour supply will expand markedly in 
2022. It has fallen over the past two years on 
account of the pandemic: immigration to Ger -
many decreased and some employed persons 
(temporarily) left the labour market, whilst 
others remained in education longer or ended 
their working lives somewhat earlier than 
planned. However, labour force participation 
will probably increase again swiftly, as condi -
tions on the labour market have not funda -
mentally deteriorated.12 Immigration is also 
likely to be somewhat higher once more.13 The 
overall number of employed persons in Ger -
many will rise up to mid- 2023. However, it will 
not quite return to its level of the start of 2020 
due to demographic shifts.
In the medium term, it can be assumed that 
the labour supply will contract. Unfavourable 
demographic trends will outweigh the positive 
influence of immigration and the rise in age-  
specific labour force participation. Labour mar -
ket tightness, already substantial, will thus be 
further exacerbated. Unemployment could 
even fall slightly below its low pre- crisis level. 
However, this presupposes a good fit between 
qualifications held and the requirements of the 
jobs on offer. The hours worked per worker 
could also rise further towards the end of the 
projection horizon, counteracting the trend 
seen in the past. This will primarily be the result 
of high cyclical demand for labour, an im -
proved work- life balance and the reduction in 
exclusively low- paid part- time employment.

negotiated during the second half of the year. 
Next year, wage agreements are likely to be 
greater on account of the economic recovery, 
the marked decline in unemployment and the 
high inflation rate. However, this development 
will only be reflected in overall negotiated 
wages from the second half of the year on -
wards. In the first half of 2022, only a few of 
the larger sectors (such as the chemicals indus -
try) will be negotiating new collective wage 
agreements; thus, the influence of the old, low 
agreements will still be predominant. In the 
subsequent two years, negotiated wages will 
then rise considerably more strongly – chiefly 
on the strength of increasing labour market 
tightness. Further factors here will be a strong 
upturn and above- average aggregate capacity 
utilisation. Inflation rates, which are currently 
very high and will probably remain relatively 
high going forward, will also play a certain role. 
However, it is assumed that this will only have 
a minimal effect over the next few years. Over -
all, against this backdrop, similarly high growth 
rates will be reached in 2023 and 2024 as those 
seen during the peak of economic activity prior 
to the crisis.14
Actual earnings are recovering significantly this 
year. Instrumental factors here are declining 
short- time work and hours worked, the latter of 
which are primarily increasing on account of the 
former. This trend is set to continue into next 
year. Coupled with a greater number of bonus 
payments and paid overtime, this will lead to a 
rise of almost 4% – the highest annual average 
growth rate seen in a long time.15 In the me -
dium term, growth will recede slightly as the ex -
ceptional boost from increased hours worked 
abates. The influence of favourable economic 
conditions and the perceptibly growing labour 
supply shortages will not fully compensate for 
this. However, as a general trend, wages and 
salaries will rise in 2023 and 2024 at accelerated 
rates, and the wage increase towards the end 
of the projection horizon will also far exceed the 
average. Rising social security contributions on 
the part of employers will generate still higher 
compensation per employee.Unit labour costs will rise only slightly this year 
and the next after the pandemic- induced sharp 
increase in 2020, because labour productivity 
per employed person is making a strong recov -
ery. In 2023, the recovery of productivity will 
largely be complete. The relatively steeply in -
creasing wages will then increasingly feed 
through to unit labour costs, which could po -
tentially rise by around 3% in 2024.

costs will afford scope for a strong recovery of Negotiated

Pandemic- induced damage to German potential output 
moderate so far
The coronavirus pandemic and the meas-
ures taken to contain it have been putting a 
strain on economic activity in Germany 
since the second quarter of 2020. The ex-
tent to which, as things stand now, this has 
brought about lasting damage to German 
potential output can be measured using the 
approach that also underlies the Bundes-
bank’s estimate of potential output.1 A pro-
duction function containing the following 
factors of production –  capital input and 
number of hours worked – as well as total 
factor productivity (TFP) forms the frame-
work.2 In analytical terms, the damage to 
potential output caused by the pandemic 
can be determined by its effects on the in-
dividual components. The starting point is a 
comparison of potential output from the 
current projection for Germany with the re-
sults from the last pre- pandemic estimate, 
conducted in December 2019.3 In this con-
text, the differences are to be adjusted for 
changes that do not stem from the pan-
demic.4
The pandemic dampens the potential num-
ber of hours worked mainly as a result of its 
unfavourable impact on the group of per-
sons of working age and on labour force 
participation. The number of persons of 
working age was primarily depressed by 
lower net immigration in 2020 and in the 
fi  rst half of 2021.5 Even though certain 
catch- up effects are expected in 2022, im-
migration over the projection horizon will 
be lower than previously expected owing to 
the pandemic. Labour force participation 
sank especially due to “discouraged worker” 
effects among segments of the population 
that are less strongly attached to the labour 
market, which are not unusual in econom-
ically diffi   cult phases. This applies, for in-
stance, to persons not entitled to un-employment benefi  ts, entry- level workers 
or immigrants. The underlying conditions 
suggest, however, that these groups will re-
join the labour market after the pandemic is 
overcome. Labour force participation will 
already normalise during the projection 
horizon.
Pandemic- related changes in trend hours 
worked and structural unemployment are 
of little signifi  cance for the potential num-
ber of hours worked. On the one hand, 
hours worked per worker were raised in 
arithmetical terms by the fact that the num-
ber of persons working exclusively in low- 
paid part- time jobs with their shorter work-
ing day fell relatively sharply. On the other 
hand, both the number of, as well as hours 
worked by, self- employed persons and per-
sons with second jobs – groups each with 
very high numbers of hours worked – de-
creased substantially. Even if these changes 
1 For more on the methodology behind estimating po-
tential output, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2007, 2017).
2 Enterprises’ pandemic- related preventative health-
care or location- specifi  c hygiene measures can be in-
terpreted as additional factors of production. The asso-
ciated costs might have diminished the effi   ciency of 
the production process in arithmetical terms. The as-
sumption here is that these health- related operational 
expenses will subside in the medium term and there-
fore not cause damage to potential output.
3 For the December 2019 projection, see Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2019a).
4 For instance, the projections of capital input and 
trend TFP already diverge prior to 2020, partly because 
the historical data in the national accounts have since 
been revised. For the potential labour supply, the con-
tributions of the labour force participation of older 
persons, which are estimated to be higher from to-
day’s perspective, are deducted. They correlate with 
the development prior to the pandemic, which was 
better than was estimated in December 2019.
5 The potential number of hours worked might also 
have been dampened by the pandemic- induced higher 
mortality of persons of working age. According to a 
special study conducted by the Federal Statistical Of-
fi  ce, mortality in the relevant age group did not show 
any notable growth compared with the reference 
period prior to the pandemic, however.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

persist to some degree, they result in over-
all limited structural losses of hours worked.6 
Moreover, the higher long- term unemploy-
ment in 2021 and 2022 is likely to contrib-
ute to unemployment becoming en-
trenched to a certain degree. Given the 
drop in the labour supply due to demo-
graphic change, it stands to reason that the 
resulting somewhat higher structural un-
employment will recede in the medium 
term. Overall, the dampening effect of the 
coronavirus pandemic on the potential 
number of hours worked was mainly per-
ceptible in the acute phase of the pan-
demic. By contrast, in the imminent period 
of recovery, certain catch- up effects are to 
be expected, resulting in a net reduction in 
the potential labour supply of ¼% in 2024 
compared with a scenario without a pan-
demic.
Capital input, too, declines on account of 
the pandemic. Investment in machinery and 
equipment (including information and com-
munications technology goods) as well as 
software and databases fell in 2020 and ex-
penditure on research and development 
showed hardly any increase. However, over-
all, investment in machinery and equipment 
only fell around half as sharply as it did dur-
ing the fi  nancial and economic crisis in 
2009. Additional expenditure during the 
pandemic on digital infrastructure for the 
deployment of remote working or digital 
distribution channels was a factor in this.7 
In addition, the intensity of use of the cap-
ital stock is likely to have diminished. This 
tends to lengthen the useful life, reduces 
the depreciation rate and supports poten-
tial output.8 However, part of the existing 
capital stock might have become obsolete 
owing to shifts in the production structure 
– on account of changed consumer prefer-
ences, amongst other factors  – which 
would have a dampening effect on poten-
tial output. However, available national ac-counts data do not suggest any noticeable 
discrepancies, at least for 2020, in the de-
preciation rates according to categories of 
capital goods. Even so, owing to enter-
prises’ reduced investment activity, capital 
input is likely to contract by 1¾% on bal-
ance by the end of the projection horizon 
on account of the pandemic.
Identifying the pandemic- related changes in 
trend TFP development is subject to greater 
uncertainty than in potential labour or cap-
ital input. Productivity effects might arise 
during the pandemic due, inter alia, to 
long- term shifts in resources or market 
shares of sectors or enterprises with differ-
ing productivity levels. Evaluations on the 
basis of the Bundesbank Online Panel Firms 
(BOP- F) point to temporary productivity- 
supporting shifts, as the reduction in em-
ployment in sectors with below average 
productivity turned out to be particularly 
sharp. In addition, evaluations of sectoral 
data on insolvencies suggest that the 
productivity- damaging effect of the delay 
to corporate insolvencies in the past year  
owing to government assistance measures 
was limited.9 However, the reduced number 
of market entries is likely to have had a 
dampening effect on productivity by par-
tially eliminating the effi   ciency-enhancing 
or competition- enhancing contribution of 
successful start- ups.10 Moreover, because 
global supply chains have been disrupted 
6 Actual hours worked fell very sharply during the pan-
demic, but this was almost exclusively due to cyclical 
effects such as the deployment of short- time work 
schemes, the absence of overtime or declining bal-
ances on working time accounts.
7 As long as parts of the capital stock are only dupli-
cated here, this does not necessarily increase the effi   -
ciency of the production process.
8 Capital input feeds into the Bundesbank’s estimation 
of potential output. This involves weighting asset types 
by their share in the total user costs of the tangible 
fi  xed assets used in the production process. See 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2012).

aggregate profit margins.16 The backdrop of 
high domestic and foreign demand coupled 
with simultaneous supply bottlenecks will not 
only help to pass on rising cost pressures to 
consumers, but also to further increase profit -
ability. In 2024, profit margins could be some -what compressed once again. Alongside the 
sharp increase in unit labour costs, the loss of 
momentum of aggregate demand resulting 
from the progressive normalisation of private 
consumption and exports will be a contributing 
factor. Domestic inflation as measured by the 
GDP deflator is set to be consistently strong in 
view of the movement of unit labour costs and 
profit margins in opposite directions. From a 
starting point of almost 3% in 2021 and 2022, 
it is likely to see a minimal decline to around 
2½% in subsequent years.
Inflation as measured by the HICP rose excep -
tionally strongly in the second and third quar -
ters of 2021, increasing from 2% in March to 
6% in November. A very clear rise had already 
been expected in the June projection, as the

than previously 
anticipated, …by the pandemic, there is a shortage of

duction processes to less tailored input 
products or interrupting them more fre-
quently reduces effi   ciency. In total, this 
amounts to a loss in the level of trend TFP of ¼% towards the end of the projection 
horizon on account of the coronavirus pan-
demic.
In summary, the damage to the potential 
output of the German economy caused by 
the pandemic, as things stand today, is 
likely to be moderate. In 2024, it will make 
up around 1% of potential output.11 In the 
medium to long term, there is little to sug-
gest that potential growth rates will be per-
manently reduced due to the coronavirus 
pandemic.Contribution of the coronavirus crisis to

turnover tax rate is expanding the year- on- year 
rate of the HICP .17 However, inflation in No -
vember, which was already high, once again 
overshot its expected level, by 1¾ percentage 
points.18 Prices of non- energy industrial goods, 
in particular, rose very strongly. This was due in 
large part to persistent supply bottlenecks and 
significantly increased transport costs, which 
were reflected in import and producer prices. 
Service providers also increased their prices 
more substantially than expected. High price 
increases were primarily seen in the sectors hit 
hardest by business closures. At 4.1%, the core 
rate excluding energy and food was up on the 
June projection by just over one percentage 
point. From the fourth quarter onwards, en -
ergy prices also rose surprisingly sharply, due 
above all to the steep increase in crude oil 
prices.
Overall, HICP inflation is likely to reach 3.2% in 
the current year. Just under one percentage 
point of this will be attributable to the reversal 
of the reduced turnover tax rate and the intro -
duction of carbon pricing in the areas of heat -
ing and transport.19 The core rate will rise to 
2.2%. Just under ½ percentage point of this 
will be attributable to tax changes.
The inflation rate will rise further in the coming 
year, to 3.6%. The aforementioned one- off ef -
fects will elapse, and the crude oil price will as -
sumedly decline gradually. Nevertheless, energy 
prices are likely to see even slightly stronger 
growth. Consumer rates for gas are expected 
to be raised by just under one- fifth on average, 
as the market price for natural gas on the spot 
market more than quadrupled this year. Fur -
thermore, renters’ expenses will only be ad -
justed to the higher crude oil price with a cer -… and will thus

18 Furthermore, in November, a one- off statistical effect 
increased the inflation rate by just over ¼  percentage 
point. It resulted primarily from the fact that, due to the 
annual adjustment of the HICP weights to the consump -
tion structure of the previous year, the share of package 
holidays was considerably lower than in 2020 on account 
of travel restrictions. The weights for 2020 are based on 
the period prior to the start of the pandemic. The one- off 
effect greatly increased the inflation rate at the start of 
2021, dampened it substantially at mid- year and boosted it 
again at the end of the year. On an annual average, its im -
pact was neutral. For more information, see Deutsche Bun -
desbank (2021h). This one- off statistical effect was already 
taken into account in the June projection. It does not occur 
in the national Consumer Price Index (CPI). Also on account 
of this fact, the inflation rate in November 2021 was mark -
edly lower according to this definition.

tain time lag. Lastly, consumer prices for electri -
city will increase in spite of the substantial relief 
afforded by the renewable energy (EEG) levy. 
Food prices, too, will presumably rise some -
what more sharply than in 2021; steep in -
creases in agricultural producer prices over the 
course of the current year will make themselves felt here. Additionally, there are further cost-  
driving factors to consider, such as substantial 
wage growth in retail trade, the supply bottle -
necks and the transition to greener and more 
animal- friendly production methods.
On an average for 2022, the core rate could be 
just as high as in the current year. As it is as -
sumed that supply bottlenecks will only ease 
towards year- end, the prices of industrial prod -
ucts excluding energy are initially likely to con -
tinue rising markedly. The depreciation of the 
euro and the increase in actual earnings will 
also have a price- driving effect. The latter will 
also be an instrumental factor in price increases 
in services, which will exceed those seen in 
2021. Another factor here is that enterprises 
will probably continue their efforts to recoup 
previous pandemic- related profit losses via 
higher prices. The core rate is only likely to fall 
below 2% again at the end of 2022.
In 2023, core inflation could potentially slip a lit -
tle further initially before then picking up again 
in 2024. This dip in 2023 chiefly stems from the 
fact that the remaining supply bottlenecks are 
likely to have been resolved. The rate of price 
increase will therefore fall considerably, espe -
cially for industrial goods. Furthermore, mark-  
ups to compensate for previous impairments 
caused by the pandemic will no longer be a sig -
nificant factor at this point in time. In the last 
year of the projection horizon, the sharp rise in 
labour costs will be increasingly felt. Moreover, 
there will be a time lag before the high aggre -
gate capacity utilisation is reflected in prices. 
Additional factors are also likely to drive up 
prices. Transitioning the economy to become 
climate-neutral –  a goal to which more and 
more firms are committing themselves – will en -
tail costs that will probably be passed on to 
consumers. When setting prices, firms are also 
likely to assume that the trend inflation rate will 
be somewhat higher going forward. In addition 
to structural shifts due to demographic trends 
and climate change, the Eurosystem’s new 
monetary policy strategy also has a certain role … but core rate

to play here.20 This new strategy stipulates that 
inflation expectations should be anchored at a 
somewhat higher level over the medium term.21 
According to the Consensus Economics fore -
cast, long- term inflation expectations for Ger -
many have already risen notably and currently 
amount to around 2% – precisely the new tar -
get figure set for the euro area. Core inflation 
could pick up to 2.1% again in 2024.
Headline inflation is set to drop considerably to 
2.2% in 2023 and then linger at this level 
–  which is still high from a longer- term per -
spective  – in 2024. 2023 will see not only a 
temporary, perceptible dip in core inflation, but 
also a sharp deceleration in energy price in -
creases. Carbon prices will rise by the same 
amount as in 2022 and the share of rental 
costs will be adjusted to reflect higher prices 
for natural gas.22 However, the price of crude 
oil is not expected to go up sharply, as it has in 
the past, but instead to fall. Although energy 
price inflation will continue to slow in 2024, 
dampening headline inflation, core inflation 
will increase. Food prices will also carry on ex -
panding at an above average pace. As in 2023, 
the anticipated slight decline in agricultural 
producer prices will roughly offset the rises in 
retailers’ wage costs.
Public finances
The general government deficit ratio is ex -
pected to fall slightly in 2021, potentially 
amounting to around 4% (2020: 4.3% of GDP). 
The pressure on the budget from temporary 
coronavirus response measures is still some -
what higher than in 2020, totalling around 3% 
of GDP , and the cyclical impact on government 
finances is set to remain virtually unchanged. 
However, tax revenue is rising very steeply. 
Profit- related taxes and VAT are growing at a 
much faster rate than their nominal macroeco -
nomic reference variables.23
It was not possible to include the projects 
planned by the incoming Federal Government in this projection (see the box on pp. 22 ff.). 
With this in mind, the deficit ratio is set to fall 
considerably to 1¼% next year. The burdens 
stemming from the coronavirus response meas -
ures will largely have been unwound. In add -
ition, the robust economic upswing will pro -
vide substantial relief for the general govern -
ment budget. However, the very sharp growth 
in tax revenue recorded in 2021 is not likely to 
be as dynamic going forward. The deficit ratio 
is set to keep falling in 2022 and 2023. Govern -
ment finances will be buoyed by further corona -
virus response measures coming to an end and 
the continued economic recovery. A hefty rise 
in contribution rates, especially for the statu -
tory health insurance and statutory pension in -
surance schemes, is also on the cards. This will 
give social contributions a major boost.
Towards the end of the projection horizon, fa -
vourable economic conditions should mean 
that the general government budget is more or 
less balanced. In structural terms, it will be run -
ning a slight deficit.24 This constitutes a year-  
on- year structural deterioration of the general 
government budget as, even before incorpor -
ating measures to be implemented by the in -
coming Federal Government, expenditure is ex -
pected to rise dynamically – especially social 
spending, but also spending on education and 
infrastructure. As a result, by the end of the 
projection horizon, the structural ratio of pri -
mary expenditure (excluding interest expend -
iture) may well have risen to a new post-  Headline infla -
tion in 2023-24

than before, but

20 See European Central Bank (2021a).
21 This is suggested by the ECB’s survey of professional 
forecasters published after the strategy review. The survey 
reveals that a majority of respondents revised their longer- 
term inflation expectations for the euro area as a whole 
somewhat upwards in response to the new monetary pol -
icy strategy. See European Central Bank (2021b).
22 The incoming Federal Government’s plans to abolish 
the renewable energy (EEG) levy in 2023 have not yet been 
included in the projections.
23 For more detailed information on the development of 
tax revenue, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2021i), pp. 65-67.
24 Cyclical factors and temporary one- off effects have 
been stripped out of the structural variables. In the period 
under review, the deducted temporary effects are broadly 
identical with coronavirus response measures. Towards the 
end of the projection horizon, they will be virtually negli -
gible.Deutsche Bundesbank

reunification peak. In comparison with 2021, 
the structural expenditure ratio will see very lit -
tle change over the medium term: since part of 
2021’s high tax revenue is deemed temporary, 
tax revenue generated in the ensuing period 
will grow at a slower pace than GDP for a cer -
tain time. However, additional revenue from 
the steep rise in contribution rates for the social 
security funds will make up for at least some of 
this.
The debt ratio is to rise to around 70% this year 
(2020: 68.7%), but is likely to fall again in the 
years that follow. Factoring out any new meas -
ures to be implemented by the incoming Fed -
eral Government, the debt ratio may be back 
to nearly 60% as early as in 2023. There are 
three factors driving the decline in the debt 
ratio. First, nominal GDP growth in the denom -
inator is expanding relatively sharply. This will 
push down the ratio even though the govern -
ment budget will still initially record deficits. 
Second, the coronavirus- related one- off effects 
that do not affect the deficit but did previously 
drive up debt (especially assistance loans, 
equity injections and higher cash reserves) will 
be scaled back. Third, the portfolios of state-  
owned bad banks are likely to diminish further.Risk assessment
The macroeconomic projections outlined here 
are subject to all manner of uncertainties, in 
particular surrounding the further course of the 
pandemic as well as its direct and indirect fall -
out, additional fiscal and economic policy 
measures to be implemented by the incoming 
Federal Government, and difficulties gauging 
the impact of the current rather dynamic price 
environment on future rises in wages and con -
sumer price inflation. All in all, these risks to 
economic growth appear to be more or less 
balanced from today’s perspective (tilted to the 
downside in the short term, and more to the 
upside in the medium term). As far as the out -
look for the inflation rate is concerned, the risks 
are skewed to the upside.
In the short term, there are already significant 
risks stemming from the future trajectory of the 
pandemic and its direct macroeconomic conse -
quences. Given current infection rates, the 
economy may face a heavier blow than as -
sumed in the projections. Even larger setbacks 
may persist beyond the short term, too, espe -
cially if virus variants which prove much more 
resistant to the vaccines available spread rap -
idly. The impact of the most recent variant 
– Omicron – is also unclear; virtually nothing 
was known about its properties on 1 Decem -
ber 2021 when the projections were finalised. 
The projections therefore assume that it will 
not require any extensive additional contain -
ment measures that could impede economic 
activity. However, if more extensive, longer-  
lasting protective measures do prove necessary 
as a result of new virus variants, these may 
constrain domestic private consumption, and a 
weaker global economy would weigh on Ger -
man exports and investment. Moreover, taken 
in isolation, additional disruptions to global 
value chains and logistics as a result of the pan -
demic could intensify supply bottlenecks. All in 
all, if this unfavourable scenario were to ma -
terialise, the economy could suffer a greater 
setback. Protective and hygiene measures, cap -

supply chains would exert inflationary pressure. 
The dampening effect of weaker demand on 
prices may initially prevail, especially if prices 
for crude oil or other energy commodities 
come in well under the high level anticipated in 
the projections.25
Uncertainties arise not only as a direct result of 
the pandemic, but also indirectly as repercus -
sions thereof. For instance, households may 
use savings accumulated – mostly involuntar -
ily – during the pandemic for additional con -
sumption expenditure to a greater or lesser ex -
tent than assumed here. This would have a cor -
responding knock- on effect on economic activ -
ity and inflation (for more information, see 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2021b)). But the catch- 
up and backlog effects of households’ 
pandemic- related pent- up demand are not the 
only factors that are relevant for the projection 
here: export and corporate investment con -
straints caused by supply bottlenecks also play 
a major role. It is possible that supply chains 
will ease earlier and quicker than expected. 
Economic activity would then pick up faster 
and, taken in isolation, alleviate the upward 
price pressures. That said, there is also a risk 
that bottlenecks will become even more se -
vere. This would constrain the recovery more 
tightly and for longer as well as step up price 
pressures. An environment where demand has 
become more strongly pent- up and a greater 
amount of the cost pressure accumulated due 
to bottlenecks is passed on to final consumers 
than previously poses an additional upside risk 
to inflation.

investment is predicated in key measure on de -

Projects planned by the new Federal Government: potential 
impact on projections for the economy and public fi  nances
Germany’s new Federal Government has 
agreed on the key projects contained in the 
coalition deal.1 However, the measures 
have not yet been specifi  ed in enough de-
tail to have been included in the projec-
tions. In particular, information about their 
exact structure and potential fi  nancial im-
pact is often lacking.
Public fi  nances and fi  scal policy 
 measures
On balance, the projects outlined in the co-
alition agreement will result in additional 
government spending and (to a lesser ex-
tent) lower government revenue. However, 
it is not clear precisely what fi  nancial impact 
they will have or when they will be imple-
mented. The same is true of the intended 
funding measures. It has been broadly an-
nounced that these will include, for in-
stance, thoroughly reviewing central gov-
ernment spending, cutting environmentally 
harmful subsidies, increasing administrative 
effi   ciency and cracking down on tax eva-
sion. Besides this, the plans appear to in-
volve a sizeable volume of additional bor-
rowing. However, it is not clear to what ex-
tent this would be compatible with the 
debt brake.2 All in all, the government’s 
plans are expected to result in higher gen-
eral government defi  cit and debt levels than 
those presented in this projection. It is not 
yet possible to predict the scale or the time-
frame of the necessary adjustments, how-
ever.
A large part of the expected measures with 
an impact on public fi  nances relate to social 
spending, education, digital transformation, 
decarbonisation of the economy and trans-
port infrastructure. These projects will have 
an impact on macroeconomic develop-ments through various channels. For one 
thing, direct government demand is likely 
to expand. Government consumption will 
rise in comparison to the baseline if more 
staff are hired or if healthcare spending is 
increased, for example. Besides this, add-
itional government investment is planned – 
in transport and education infrastructure, 
for instance.3 For another thing, some 
measures may generate signifi  cant indirect 
demand effects. They are intended to en-
courage additional private sector invest-
ment in digitalisation and climate action, 
for instance. Measures to this end include 
speeding up tax write- offs and granting 
loans at favourable rates. Unspecifi  ed 
changes to unemployment benefi  t II are 
also planned, which could also lead to more 
extensive social transfers. The planned abol-
ishment of the renewable energy (EEG) levy 
with effect from 2023 will lead to higher 
net income for enterprises and households. 
Moreover, the government has signalled 
that it may provide fi  nancial relief to house-
holds in order to compensate for the price 
increases stemming from climate policy. 
Looking at social security funds, higher cen-
tral government transfers are intended to 
curb the prospective rise in contribution 
rates. In addition, the ceilings for mini-job 
and midi- job earnings will potentially be 
raised, and further tax relief measures have 
been announced (e.g. the constitutionally 
necessary change regarding the change-
over to the deferred taxation of pensions).

dependent Advisory Board to the Stability Council 
(2021), pp. 26 ff.
3 In this context, many of the areas mentioned in the 
agreement (such as education and administration) are 
almost entirely the responsibility of state or local gov-
ernments. Central government measures will therefore 
require cooperation with them, as well as potential 
amendments to the Basic Law.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
December 2021  
38

The measures intended to be implemented 
through public sector enterprises (primarily 
Deutsche Bahn and KfW) may also stimu-
late economic activity. Depending on how 
they are structured, these enterprises or in-
dividual transactions would be classifi  ed to 
the government sector and would infl  uence 
general government defi  cit and debt levels 
(such as the KfW loan programmes com-
missioned and extensively secured by cen-
tral government during the coronavirus cri-
sis).
The extent to which funding measures that 
involve, for instance, cutting expenditure 
elsewhere will dampen expansionary stimuli 
is not yet clear (see above).
Higher minimum wage and other 
 regulatory changes
According to the coalition agreement, the 
statutory general minimum wage will be 
raised to €12 an hour. No date has been set 
for this. This increase would be in addition 
to the hike to €10.45 already agreed upon 
with effect from 1 July 2022. In comparison 
to when the minimum wage was intro-
duced in 2015, the group of people who 
are directly affected and the share of the 
aggregate wage bill will probably be some-
what larger as a result of the announced 
raise. By contrast, the average percentage 
increase in the gross hourly wages of the 
directly affected employees is likely to be 
signifi  cantly lower.4 On balance, the planned 
increase in the minimum wage will probably 
not directly raise the wage bill quite as 
strongly as when it was introduced in 2015.5 
Moreover, as before, spillover effects to em-
ployees in higher wage brackets are ex-
pected. All in all, the increase is likely to per-
ceptibly boost upward wage pressure.
The coalition is aiming to introduce meas-
ures to bring in more skilled workers from third countries. This includes work migra-
tion measures for people who meet certain 
criteria (points system), extending the EU 
Blue Card at the national level to include 
non- academic professions and removing 
the expiry date of end- 2023 for the West-
ern Balkans arrangement. The projection al-
ready assumes that there will be a rising 
proportion of migration from third coun-
tries owing to the pull effects of growing la-
bour shortages in Germany and the simul-
taneous decline in immigration from other 
EU countries. As a result, this is not ex-
pected to have any meaningful additional 
impact on the supply of labour within the 
projection horizon.6
Faster approval procedures or regulatory 
changes to areas such as climate policy 
could also have an impact on the supply 
side. However, such effects are even harder 
to gauge and likewise depend on the spe-
cifi  c ways in which measures are structured 
and implemented.
Impact on the real economy and 
prices compared to the baseline 
of the projection
All in all, the coalition deal is set to signifi  -
cantly stimulate demand, especially from 
2023. Real GDP could thus then grow at a 
perceptibly stronger rate. However, from 
2023, aggregate capacity utilisation is al-
ready extremely high in the baseline of the 
projection.
4 Although higher wages could curb employment, this 
would have feedback effects on wages, reducing 
wage growth somewhat. However, there will also be 
signifi  cantly more labour market bottlenecks in the 
lower wage brackets over the years to come. This will 
tend to mitigate the impact on employment.
5 At the time, estimates put the size of the stimulus for 
the aggregate wage bill at ½%. See Deutsche Bundes-
bank (2014, 2015a).
6 The measures outlined in the agreement still also 
need to be fl  eshed out and it will take time to inte-
grate the additional migrants into the labour market 
once the plans have been implemented.Deutsche Bundesbank

least in the underlying trend.26 However, if for -
eign demand were to experience a setback, the 
orders placed to date could be cancelled and 
new orders may be put on hold. This would 
weaken exports, be a significant drag on the 
economic recovery and lower the rates of infla -
tion – also because the price of commodities 
would likely then fall. And it is not just the pan -
demic that is a threat to the global economy: 
dangers of a setback of this nature stem from 
other sources, too. For instance, if other cur -
rency areas tighten monetary policy in order to 
contain inflation trends, this may produce unin -
tended side effects, such as plunging inter -
national financial markets into turmoil as a re -
sult. Crises in emerging markets –  such as a 
sharp downturn on the Chinese real estate 
market – may also weigh on global recovery.27
The incoming Federal Government’s fiscal and 
economic policy is another potential source of 
domestic risk. Although the measures have not 
yet been specified in enough detail to have been included in the projections, demand looks 
set to be given a considerable stimulus, espe -
cially as of 2023 (see the box on pp.  38 ff.). 
Plans to step up climate protection could trig -
ger sizeable additional private investment. The 
envisaged significant raising of the statutory 
minimum wage may have a knock- on effect on 
wage growth and, subsequently, inflation,28 
even if – taken in isolation – abolishing the re -
newable energy (EEG) levy will lower the rate 
of inflation in 2023. The overall package of 
measures is thus likely to amplify both the eco -
nomic upturn and inflation.Measures from 
coalition agree -
ment strengthen 
outlook for eco -
nomic upturn 
and point over -
all to higher 
inflation ratesFor one thing, wage costs would go up as a 
result of the planned sharp rise in the min-
imum wage. For another, social security 
contributions should be raised less strongly 
than projected – however, the impact of 
this will probably be far less signifi  cant. In 
conjunction with an already- tight labour 
market, there is therefore considerable up-
side risk to wages compared with the base-
line.
Both the demand stimulus stemming from 
high capacity utilisation and the higher 
wage costs will tend to drive prices up. In a 
very back- of- the- envelope calculation, 
higher wages could push prices up by ap-
proximately one- third.7 However, the abol-
ishment of the renewable energy (EEG) levy 
in 2023 will have a countervailing effect. It 
will make electricity rates distinctly lower 
for consumers – although it is uncertain as 
to whether the scrapping of the levy will be passed through in full to households. What 
is more, however: if lower electricity costs 
in the corporate sector resulting from the 
abolishment of the renewable energy (EEG) 
levy lead to lower retail prices, this will also 
dampen consumer prices. However, the 
scale of this effect will be diffi   cult to gauge. 
Compared to the baseline, the elimination 
of the levy would curb the infl  ation rate 
only slightly in 2023 as a signifi  cant lower-
ing of the charge has already been factored 
in here owing to the current legal situation 
(as well as in 2024). In 2024, it would even 
nudge the infl  ation rate up slightly. Overall, 
the risk for the infl  ation rate towards the 
end of the projection horizon is distinctly 
tilted to the upside owing to the measures 
announced in the coalition agreement.
7 See also Deutsche Bundesbank (2019c).
26 In this case, contrary to the futures prices assumed 
here, the upturn in demand could push the price of crude 
oil up further or, at least, prevent it from falling. Note, 
however, that the price of crude oil has fallen perceptibly 
since the assumptions were made and is set to be some -
what lower over the medium term. If it remains at this 
level, this would have a slight dampening effect on the rate 
of inflation in 2022.

Given the current environment, the outlook for 
inflation is particularly uncertain.29 The current 
exceptionally high inflation rates themselves 
are a source of upside risk. Second- round ef -
fects via higher wage rises have not yet played 
a major role and have been factored into these 
projections to only a limited extent. However, 
there has already been a perceptible increase in 
longer- term inflation expectations in Germany. 
The longer the high inflation rates persist, the 
more likely that these will be given greater con -
sideration in wage agreements. This would also 
have an impact on firms’ price setting and could keep inflation rates at a persistently 
higher level.Outlook for 
inflation particu -

cerned, the extent to which historical relationships still

German enterprises’ profitability 
and financing  in 2020
The impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the associated containment measures on enter -
prises in Germany varied from one economic sector to the next. The current body of data sug -
gests that the decline in enterprises’ revenues caused by the shock was less than half as severe, 
on average, than the one experienced during the financial and economic crisis in 2009, with 
some sectors faring noticeably better than others. While export- driven sectors like carmakers and 
mechanical engineering, and economic sectors hit hard by travel constraints and physical or 
social distancing requirements, such as aviation and accommodation and food service activities, 
registered far heavier drops in revenues, construction and some parts of the retail trade saw 
strong growth in their sales figures.
Corporate profits declined by almost 4% before taxes, but measured relative to the reduced rev -
enue figures, the annual result remained almost unchanged. However, these preliminary numbers 
probably make the situation appear more favourable than it actually is, if the lessons learned 
from the recession in 2009 are anything to go by. Support during the reporting period came from 
an increase in other earnings, which might be related in part to various COVID-  19 assistance 
measures. On the cost side, the deep recession in the global economy meant that the cost of 
materials eased significantly. As regards personnel expenses, profitability was depressed by enter -
prises’ efforts to retain their workforces despite low capacity utilisation and also by additions to 
pension provisions in response to changes in interest rates.
The coronavirus shock presented a stiff challenge for enterprises in 2020 in terms of preserving 
their liquidity. Pandemic containment measures or behavioural adjustments meant that business 
operations or production in some just- in- time sectors were cut back considerably or ground to a 
halt altogether. To boost liquidity, fiscal policymakers rolled out extensive financial assistance 
packages such as lending programmes through promotional banks or direct company subsidies 
for fixed costs in months in which revenues were down. Enterprises themselves took comprehen -
sive action as well to preserve their liquidity. All these measures drove enterprises’ liquidity levels 
significantly higher, but also pushed up their long- term debt. On balance, enterprises did a rela -
tively good job of absorbing the shock from the coronavirus pandemic. Furthermore, corporate 
insolvency numbers fell back significantly in 2020. The temporary suspension of the obligation to 
file for insolvency, which was tied to certain conditions, will also have been a factor in this.
Non- financial enterprises are likely to have seen their activity increase moderately in 2021 against 
the backdrop of the German economy’s ongoing but intermittent recovery from the pandemic- 
induced crisis. Pressure on enterprises’ liquidity position will probably recede across most sectors 
of the economy. However, cost headwinds, particularly as a result of the sharp uptick in prices of 
key raw materials and intermediate products, could take their toll on corporate profitability.Deutsche Bundesbank

Underlying trends
The coronavirus pandemic and the action taken 
to contain it plunged the German economy 
into a deep recession in 2020. Backlog and 
catch- up effects came into play after the 
second quarter, but real gross domestic prod -
uct (GDP) nonetheless contracted by 4.9% on 
the year. Capacity utilisation in the German 
economy fell significantly below aggregate 
levels of production capacity, which emerged 
from the downturn largely unscathed from to -
day’s perspective. Headwinds came from the 
global setting, too, given that COVID-  19 had 
tipped the world economy into recession. 
Worldwide demand for German exports dimin -
ished sharply, and global supply chains were 
disrupted in some cases. In the domestic econ -
omy, the containment measures caused con -
sumers to hold back on spending, not always 
voluntarily, while investment in machinery and 
equipment contracted significantly, which is a 
common phenomenon during a recession. Housing construction investment, on the other 
hand, proved robust, while the comprehensive 
fiscal assistance measures introduced to shore 
up the healthcare system, enterprises or house -
holds also had a stabilising effect. There was a 
significant decline in corporate insolvency num -
bers in spite of the coronavirus shock, and this 
was arguably due in part to the temporary sus -
pension in 2020 of the obligation to file for in -
solvency, which was tied to certain conditions 
(see also the box on pp. 47 ff.).
The picture gained so far – that enterprises suf -
fered receding revenues and profits  – is re -
flected in the corporate annual financial state -
ments we currently have on file. The relative 
declines in the annual result (before taxes) and 
in revenues were almost identical in size (-3.8% 
and -3.3%, respectively), leaving the pre- tax 
profit margin almost unchanged at 4.1%. How -
ever, uncertainty surrounding this ratio is par -
ticularly high as things stand at the moment. 
The lessons learned from 2009 would suggest 
that the current body of data tends, if any -
thing, to make the situation appear more fa -
vourable than it actually is (see also the box on 
pp. 51ff.).1 All the same, the deep recession in 
the world economy eased the cost of materials 
by significantly reducing the prices of inter -
mediate goods and industrial raw materials. 
The fluctuations in reported personnel ex -
penses, on the other hand, were comparatively 
moderate as the huge decline in workloads 
was offset, for the most part, by firms making 
extensive use of short-  time working arrange -
ments and running down working time ac -
counts, rather than terminating employment 
contracts.2 Expenses were driven up again in 
2020, just like in the previous years, by the Severe down -

that payments of short- time working benefits be ac -

working benefits are often accounted for as other operat -

Corporate insolvencies in Germany during the coronavirus 
crisis
Despite the massive shock triggered by the 
coronavirus pandemic and what were, at 
times, very stringent containment meas-
ures, the number of corporate insolvencies 
dropped substantially in 2020. This was 
partially down to improvements to enter-
prises’ liquidity and equity base in the pre-
ceding years.1 These were associated with 
a trend decrease in the number of insolven-
cies and contributed to the increased resili-
ence of the German corporate sector dur-
ing the pandemic. Additionally, various 
government support measures were intro-
duced to stabilise enterprises’ fi  nancing 
situation. As a consequence, the insolvency 
fi  gures since the onset of the coronavirus 
crisis also refl  ect the contribution of gov-
ernment fi  nancial support measures, which 
eased the pressure on enterprises to fi  le for 
insolvency.
Temporary changes to the legal framework 
also had an impact on developments in the 
number of insolvencies last year.2 These 
changes meant that, between 1 March and 
30 September 2020, enterprises struggling 
as a result of the coronavirus pandemic were not obligated to fi  le for insolvency in 
the case of insolvency or overindebted-
ness.3 The suspension of the obligation to 
fi  le for insolvency for enterprises that were 
overindebted but nevertheless solvent was 
extended until 31 December 2020.4 To help 
mitigate the negative effects arising from 
delays in the disbursement of government 
funds, the fi  ling obligation was suspended 
from 1 January 2021 to 30 April 2021 for 
enterprises that applied for government 
fi  nancial assistance between 1 November 
2020 and 28 February 2021.5 After the ob-
ligation to fi  le for insolvency was sus-
pended in March 2020, the number of in-
solvencies dropped sharply. Taking the 
average of August  2020 to November 
2020, around 1,060 insolvency fi  lings were 
registered, 31% fewer than in the same 
period of the previous year. Looking at 
2020 as a whole, too, offi   cial statistics 
show an exceptionally sharp reduction in 
corporate insolvency fi  gures, with just over 
15,800 insolvency fi  lings, a drop of nearly 
16% in comparison with 2019. It is also 
possible that the coronavirus pandemic has 
led to an increase in the number of enter-
1 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2019).
2 Normally, insolvency proceedings are initiated in 
cases of insolvency (Section 17 of the Insolvency Code 
(Insolvenzordnung)), imminent insolvency (Section 18 
of the Insolvency Code) or overindebtedness (Section 
19 of the Insolvency Code) on the debtor’s part. The 
aim of the proceedings is the collective satisfaction of 
creditors by liquidating the debtor’s assets in an or-
derly manner or by allowing the enterprise to be 
maintained using an insolvency plan (Section 1 of the 
Insolvency Code).

prises going out of business due to a lack 
of economic prospects, even if they have 
not yet reached the point of overindebted-
ness or insolvency. According to offi   cial 
statistics, however, there was also a sharp 
decrease of 14% in the number of business 
closures in 2020.6 Looking at the average 
for the year to date, the number of insolv-
ency fi  lings has remained low.
Given the comprehensive government 
fi  nancial support measures and the tem-
porary suspension of the obligation to fi  le 
for insolvency, there was a risk that neces-
sary market cleansing processes or the pro-
ductive allocation of resources would be 
impeded. Comparing 2020 with 2019, the 
number of insolvency fi  lings dropped par-
ticularly sharply despite a large decline in 
revenue in some services sectors. Some of 
these industries normally account for a 
considerable share of insolvencies in Ger-
many, numerically speaking.7 The risk that impending insolvencies are being sup-
pressed may be particularly high in these 
cases. While the production sector also 
saw individual cases of lower insolvency 
fi  gures despite lower revenue, the reduc-
tion in insolvencies there was nevertheless 
relatively moderate. Above and beyond 
that, the drop in insolvencies in the con-
struction sector – which is normally a major 
contributor to yearly insolvency statistics – 
is particularly notable. Favourable construc-
tion activity may partly explain this, how-
ever.
Despite the sharp decline in the number of 
corporate insolvency proceedings in the 
past year, the associated expected claims 
rose considerably. This indicates that some 
large enterprises fi  led for insolvency. This is 
consistent with the sector report, which 
states that the number of insolvency pro-
ceedings increased among large enter-
prises, while micro- enterprises in particular 
saw a substantial reduction in proceed-
ings.8 Micro- enterprises, which usually 
make up a large portion of corporate in-
solvencies, are generally exposed to larger 
fi  nancing risks.9 The sharp decline in the in-
solvency fi  gures for this category of enter-
prises in 2020 therefore suggests that gov-
ernment assistance measures had the most 
effect there.10Insolvency proceedings in Germany*

6 Taking the average of the 2011-19 period, the num-
ber of total closures of head offi   ces of enterprises 
with greater economic signifi  cance fell by only around 
2%.
7 Food and beverage service activities, for instance, 
accounted for just over 15% of all insolvency fi  lings in 
2019.
8 See Creditreform (2020).
9 For example, studies focusing on the United States 
show that smaller enterprises often have greater 
problems with external fi  nancing. See Meisenzahl 
(2016) and Chodorow- Reich et al. (forthcoming).
10 A study by Dörr et al. (2021) concludes that gov-
ernment assistance measures prevented insolvencies 
of micro- enterprises in particular. This was, moreover, 
especially true of micro- enterprises whose credit rat-
ings were already relatively poor before the crisis, sug-
gesting windfall gains.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
December 2021  
48

In particular, some insolvencies may have 
been delayed in several services sectors 
which were hard hit by the pandemic. 
However, these sectors account for a small 
share of aggregate gross value added. The 
overall impact of windfall effects should 
therefore be moderate. Even so, the gov-
ernment’s infl  uence on insolvency proceed-
ings – which tends to promote ineffi   cien-
cies – whether through direct equity invest-

need to adjust pension provisions in line with 
interest rates. On the earnings side, enterprises 
saw their other operating income climb steeply, 
which might have been related in part to the 
government financial assistance measures. 
However, the impact of the coronavirus crisis 
on non- financial enterprises varied greatly 
across sectors, and this was also reflected in 
corporate profitability levels in various eco -
nomic sectors. Travel constraints and social and 
physical distancing requirements took a heavy 
toll on the gross profit margin in the transpor -
tation and storage sector – particularly in avi -
ation – and to a lesser extent in business ser -
vices as well. Owing to the contraction of for -eign demand, some parts of the manufacturing 
sector, such as carmakers and mechanical en -
gineering, saw their profitability levels decline, 
while the chemicals and pharmaceuticals, con -
struction, and information and communication 
sectors improved their bottom line.3
Liquidity and stability ratios
The coronavirus shock presented major chal -
lenges for enterprises in 2020 in terms of safe -
guarding their liquidity. Pandemic containment 
measures or behavioural adjustments by the 
general public led to business operations or 
production in some just- in- time sectors being 
cut back considerably or grinding to a halt al -
together. To bridge liquidity shortfalls, fiscal 
policymakers rolled out extensive financial as -
sistance packages such as lending programmes 
through promotional banks or direct company 
subsidies for fixed costs in months in which rev -
enues were down. Enterprises themselves took 
comprehensive action as well to preserve their 
liquidity, running down their inventories and 
postponing investment projects in an effort to 
boost their liquid assets. As regards debt 
finance, enterprises made substantial shifts 
along the maturity spectrum as a way of redu -
cing their reliance on current liquidity inflows. 
These efforts saw firms scale back their current, 
short- term liabilities – apart from those to affili -
ated enterprises  – and significantly increase 
their long- term liabilities – in particular to affili -
ated enterprises or through the issuance of 
bonds.4 Cash holdings increased by just under 
one- quarter, while securities classified as cur -
rent assets grew by roughly one- third. On bal -
ance, enterprises saw their liquidity increase 
considerably in the reporting period.Broad measures

On the revisions to gross profi  t margin in the corporate 
fi  nancial statement statistics
The results of the corporate fi  nancial state-
ment statistics are extrapolated on the basis 
of annual fi  nancial statements contained in 
the Bundesbank’s Financial Statements 
Data Pool.1 When the statistics are fi  rst pub-
lished in the December of the year follow-
ing the balance sheet date, fi  nancial state-
ments are available for only about 1% of 
the companies in the business register.2 
These fi  nancial statements cover just over 
one- third of the revenue of all German 
companies. In the following year the statis-
tics are based on roughly 2% of fi  nancial 
statements, covering just over half of all 
revenue. The fi  nal fi  gures after a further 
year are based on the data of around 3% of 
all companies, accounting for just under 
two- thirds of the total revenue of the non- 
fi  nancial corporate sector.3 As the dataset is 
gradually completed, revisions are usually 
made to the extrapolated results, and these are also refl  ected, on balance, in the result 
for the gross profi  t margin.
A comparison of the values for the fi  rst and 
second estimates of the gross profi  t margin, 
as well as the results of the fi  nal extrapola-
tion, shows that the general tendency of 
profi  tability can normally be determined at 
an early stage based on a very small num-
ber of fi  nancial statements. However, the 
result of the fi  rst estimate, in particular, is 
frequently higher than the fi  nal fi  gure. A 
decomposition by company size shows that 
this is attributable to the comparatively 
good income situation of small and 
medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) with an-
nual revenues of less than €50 million, 
whose fi  nancial statements are usually al-
ready available for the fi  rst estimate.4 This 
effect is particularly striking in the years 
2009 and 2010, i.e. during and immediately 
following the fi  nancial and economic crisis.
With this in mind, it cannot be ruled out 
that the current data overstate the profi  t 
margin in the current reporting year, too. 1 The data sources include anonymised data provided 
by credit institutions and credit insurers, data from the 
Bundesbank’s credit assessments, as well as data sup-
plied by commercial data providers encompassing 
fi  nancial statements that are available as a result of dis-
closure obligations pursuant to Section 325 of the Ger-
man Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch).
2 Of the roughly 3.6 million legal entities contained in 
the business register of the Federal Statistical Offi   ce, 
for the most part, only the large corporations are re-
quired to disclose a complete set of annual accounts 
with detailed information from their balance sheets 
and profi  t and loss accounts.
3 In light of the long period between the balance 
sheet date and the availability of the fi  nancial state-
ments for statistical analysis, the fi  gures for the fi  rst 
two years after the end of the reporting period are cal-
culated on the basis of “cylindered samples”. For more 
information on the methodology, see Deutsche Bundes-
bank (2021, 2011, 2005).
4 By contrast, no such sample effect is observable for 
large fi  rms with revenues of €50 million or more. For 
these companies, more than one- third of all fi  nancial 
statements, representing more than half the revenue 
of these companies, is available after less than one 
year. Of the smaller enterprises, less than 1% of the 
fi  nancial statements are usually available at this point 
in time, representing just 10% of the revenue of this 
category.Annual result before taxes

Based on the annual fi  nancial statements 
available to date, the gross profi  t margin for 
SMEs rose from 6.3% to 7.3% in 2020, 
while the fi  gure for large fi  rms declined 
from 3.1% to 2.5%. However, a factor that 
is likely to be playing a role at present – as 
in 2009 – is that the profi  t margins in the 
fi  nancial statements of SMEs that are al-
ready on fi  le exceed the profi  t margins of 
those submitted at a later date by a particu-
larly large degree.5 A breakdown by date of 
receipt of the 2020 fi  nancial statements 
that are already available indicates that this 
is the case.6 This is probably in large part 
because the impact of the coronavirus pan-demic and the containment measures on 
the various business segments – even busi-
ness segments within the same sector – has 
differed extremely in some cases. For ex-
ample, fi  rms in the hotel and restaurant 
sector that established take- away or deliv-
ery services and that have already submit-
ted their fi  nancial statements tended to 
benefi  t from closures in the rest of the sec-
tor. By contrast, hotels or restaurants that 
depended on overnight stays or eat- in cus-
tomers, and for which virtually no fi  nancial 
statements are thus far available in the stat-
istics, generated scarcely any revenue. It 
seems that SMEs that accepted government 
assistance in 2020 have made use of the 
longer deadlines allowed for submitting 
their fi  nancial statements and income tax 
returns. It is therefore likely that profi  t mar-
gins will tend to be exceptionally low in the 
data deliveries expected between now and 
the fi  nal version of the 2020 corporate 
fi  nancial statement statistics.
A comparison with the corporate earnings 
for 2020 reported in the national accounts 
and with revenue from corporate taxes also 
indicates that these items in the corporate 
fi  nancial statement statistics will need revis-Corporate earnings and taxes

5 For SMEs, the fi  rst estimate of the gross profi  t mar-
gin for 2009, carried out in December 2010, was 
1.6 percentage points higher than the fi  nal value cal-
culated two years later. By contrast, the fi  rst estimate 
for large fi  rms differed by less than 0.2  percentage 
point from the fi  nal result. Changes in the classifi  cation 
of economic sectors, the reporting sample and the 
procedure mean that the provisional and fi  nal fi  gures 
for the 2009 and 2020 reporting years are not directly 
comparable. However, the impact of these changes is 
not suffi   cient to explain the large discrepancy between 
the two values for small enterprises.
6 A comparison of the data in July 2021 and Decem-
ber 2021 shows that the increase in the aggregate an-
nual result for small enterprises with revenues of less 
than €2 million compared with the 2019 result was 
76% greater in the July sample than in the larger De-
cember sample. This applies in a similar fashion for en-
terprises in the next higher revenue categories up to 
€50 million, as well. For enterprises with revenues be-
tween €2 million and €10 million, the increase was 
79% greater, and for those with revenues between 
€10 million and €50 million, it was 54% greater.Deutsche Bundesbank

Though the impact of the coronavirus crisis var -
ied very widely across sectors, these measures 
did improve all the major economic sectors’ 
standard liquidity indicators, which show vari -
ous measures of short- term assets relative to 
short- term liabilities. The stability ratios – met -
rics that focus primarily on enterprises’ solv -
ency  – reveal that while the equity ratio re -
mained broadly unchanged, the long- term 
debt ratio climbed significantly as a result of 
enterprises’ liquidity- preserving measures. As 
expected, the liquidity and stability ratios ex -
hibited particularly strong fluctuations in sec -
tors that were hit hard by the crisis. All in all, 
enterprises managed to absorb the immediate 
impact of the coronavirus shock relatively well. 
Even so, enterprises’ long- term debt ratio is 
now well above its pre- crisis level.
An assessment of the corporate income state -
ments and balance sheets we have on file re -
veals that the financial assistance measures by 
government and instruments like short- time working had a tangible effect in many areas. 
The promotional banks’ extensive lending pro -
grammes, which in some cases saw govern -
ment assume the entire credit risk, contributed 
to the increase in long- term liabilities to credit 
institutions. These might furthermore also be 
reflected in part in the sharp rise in long- term 
liabilities  to affiliated enterprises in those cases 
where loans were taken out via dedicated fund -
ing subsidiaries within corporate groups. Grants 
for operating costs, such as bridging aid, 
showed up in other operating income. The tem -
porary arrangement to fully reimburse social 
security contributions for short- time workers 
and, occasionally, the short- time working bene -
fits lowered personnel expenses. Furthermore, 
tax relief measures such as the deferral of tax 
payments may have been a factor in the in -
crease in other liabilities. All in all, these findings 
support the assessment that government assis -
tance measures in Germany to mitigate the im -
pact of the coronavirus shock played a role in 
preserving liquidity in the business sector.… boosted

entrepreneurial income of non- fi  nancial 
corporations declined by 16% on the year 
in 2020, and the revenues of central, state 
and local governments from corporation 
and trade tax fell by 20%. The corporate 
fi  nancial statement statistics show move-
ments in the same direction for both of 
these metrics for large fi  rms, too, on aggre-
gate. Meanwhile, on aggregate, the fi  nan-
cial statements of SMEs on fi  le show a per-
ceptible increase in annual results and tax 
expenses compared to the 2019 fi  nancial 
year.7 Overall, according to these fi  gures, 
non- fi  nancial corporations saw a slump in 
neither their profi  ts nor their tax payments. 
Based on these considerations, downward 
revisions are to be expected for both of 
these items in the corporate fi  nancial state-
ment statistics. This is likely to have a damp-
ening effect on the gross profi  t margin for non- fi  nancial corporations in 2020 as cur-
rently reported.

come extrapolated from the available fi  nancial state-

year are 10% higher on the year.Deutsche Bundesbank

Sales and income
The slump in economic activity caused by the 
pandemic resulted in significant drops in rev -
enue for non- financial enterprises. Volume ef -
fects were a greater factor than price effects in 
this regard, as sales prices for goods and ser -
vices fell considerably less strongly than sales. 
As enterprises scaled back their inventories, 
production even declined slightly more than 
sales in value terms. Interest income also went 
down after a strong rise in the preceding year. 
Other operating income increased more 
strongly than in 2019, partly owing to the rise 
in the transportation and storage sector, which 
may be attributable in part to the uptake of cri -
sis assistance measures in the aviation sector.
Sales decreased across most sectors in 2020 
owing to the temporary travel constraints, so -
cial and physical distancing requirements, 
workplace or business closures, or the disrup -
tions in the supply chains. The decline in sales 
was particularly sharp in the transportation and 
storage sector and in the export- driven sectors 
of manufacturing such as the metalworking in -
dustry, mechanical engineering and car manu -
facturing. Car manufacturers had to contend 
with the significant decline in the global de -
mand for cars, especially in Europe and the 
United States. Energy companies also reported 
considerable revenue losses on account of 
lower energy demand and price effects. By 
contrast, the wholesale and retail trade (exclud -
ing automobiles) saw sales rise, especially on -
line. However, sales were down in other areas 
of the wholesale and retail trade (excluding 
automobiles), such as in bricks- and- mortar 
clothing and footwear stores. The construction 
sector recorded further increases in revenue, as 
work on construction sites continued despite 
bottlenecks in building materials.
As with revenue, non- financial enterprises’ an -
nual result before taxes also declined. At 4%, 
this decrease was somewhat sharper than the 
drop in sales figures. In the year under review, 
total expenses fell at a similar rate to total in -Sales down

Profi  tability and fi  nancial position of German listed groups 
in 2020 and an outlook for 2021
In the aftermath of the coronavirus pan-
demic and the measures taken to contain it, 
the revenue and income of German listed 
non- fi  nancial groups took a severe hit in 
2020. Revenue dropped by 8.8% as the 
pandemic caused demand to fall and also 
resulted in the closure of manufacturing 
sites and trading/ retail outlets.1 Meanwhile, 
a perceptible recovery started in the second 
half of 2020. Internationally operating 
groups benefi  ted from the fact that, espe-
cially in China, economic performance had 
already returned to pre- crisis levels by the 
end of 2020. Nonetheless, the severe sales 
losses from the fi  rst half of the year were 
not fully recouped. Moreover, exchange 
rate effects relating to the consolidation of 
foreign subsidiaries’ annual accounts 
weighed on revenues.2
Operating expenses did not fall in the same 
measure as revenue because of increasing 
depreciation and amortisation of tangible 
and intangible fi  xed assets on account of 
deteriorating demand expectations. In add-
ition, there was an extraordinary charge 
arising from multi- billion- euro criminal pro-
ceedings in the chemicals sector.3
Overall earnings before interest, taxes, de-
preciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell by 7.7%. After deducting depreciation and 
amortisation (EBIT), it even plummeted by 
40.9% compared with the previous year. 
The profi  t margin consequently once again 
dropped sharply.4 It fell by 2.1  percentage 
points last year and, at 3.2%, hit a consider-
ably lower value than in the aftermath of the 
fi  nancial and economic crisis of 2008-09. 
This was mainly due to unfavourable devel-
opments in yields in the manufacturing sec-
tor. The slump in the aviation industry was

tive impact on the euro countervalues when convert-
ing revenue from foreign currency to euro.

the primary reason for the decrease in the 
profi  t margin in the services sector. However, 
this was offset to some degree by higher 
EBIT in the telecommunications, software 
and logistics sector; as a result, the services 
sector’s profi  t margin was average. As re-
gards the dispersion of profi  t margins, the 
spread between Quartile 1 and Quartile 3 
grew considerably on the year. The distribu-
tion shifted to the left in 2020, with Quartile 
1 falling below its previous all- time low in 
2009. The median and Quartile 3, on the 
other hand, exceeded their 2009 fi  gures. A 
total of 27% of groups reported a negative 
profi  t margin in the past year. The weighted arithmetic mean profi  t margin dropped 
below the median. This meant that the 
higher- revenue corporate groups suffered a 
sharper drop in earnings than smaller groups.
On the assets side, fi  xed and fi  nancial assets 
remained practically unchanged on the 
year. Intangible assets were up by 3.6% 
from the previous year. This growth resulted 
from signifi  cant corporate takeovers which 
exceeded amortisation. Production stop-
pages and a drop in business as a result of 
the crisis led to a reduction in inventories 
and trade receivables. What is striking is the 
strong 42.8% increase in cash and cash 
equivalents, which is likely to be a refl  ec-
tion, in part, of government stabilising 
measures and the drawdown of credit lines 
to preserve liquidity during the pandemic. In 
addition, car manufacturers’ sales fi  nancing 
fell on account of the pandemic; this led to 
net repayments of outstanding debt, which 
increased cash resources. The increase in 
cash led to groups having the highest ratio 
of liquidity to short- term liabilities since 
statistics began to be kept in 2007.
On the fi  nancing side, debt rose while equity 
fell off slightly. On balance, the aggregate 
equity ratio fell by 0.8 percentage point to 
28.5%, with the manufacturing sector and 
the services sector both posting falling 
equity ratios. The decline in services was 
stronger, driven by the aviation industry.
The signifi  cant increase in both short and 
long- term fi  nancial debt set the tone for the 
debt position. As cash infl  ows from operat-
ing activities dropped off, groups secured 
their liquidity by scaling up bond issuance 
and taking on more bank liabilities.5 Look-Liquidity, equity and funding of German

ing at intra- year developments in cash fl  ows 
from fi  nancing activities shows that the 
build- up of short- term fi  nancial debt to 
make up for reduced internal fi  nancing abil-
ity was focused on the fi  rst half of 2020, 
whereas external funds began to be scaled 
back in the second half of the year.6 The 
continued decline in the reference interest 
rate applied for accounting purposes caused 
pension obligations to grow in 2020 by 
around 7%, or €21 billion.7
Estimates based on the fi  nancial statements 
of the largest groups in the reporting sam-
ple for the fi  rst three quarters of the current 
year indicate that revenues have risen 
sharply compared with the depressed level 
of the same period a year earlier despite un-
favourable currency effects. According to 
group reports, this was attributable to vol-
ume as well as price effects. Driven by the 
logistics sector and despite the continued 
pandemic woes of the aviation industry, 
revenue in the services sector is set to ex-
ceed that of the fi  rst three quarters of the 
pre- crisis year of 2019. In the third quarter 
of 2021, groups in the manufacturing sec-
tor suffered more from shortages of inter-
mediate goods and, in some cases, a resur-
gence of pandemic- related charges. On the 
whole, however, the revenue of groups in 
the manufacturing sector could potentially 
return to pre- crisis levels in this period.

before tax as a percentage of revenue) of 
listed non- fi  nancial groups and single en-
tities shows that groups’ profi  tability took a 
much greater hit from the pandemic in the 
previous year, even if the initial estimate of 
the extrapolated results for the entire cor-
porate sector for 2020 is fraught with con-
siderable uncertainty. Nonetheless, group 
profi  tability has already bounced back 
strongly. Data for the fi  rst nine months of 
2021 indicate a strong rebound in pre- tax profi  ts among a large portion of the groups 
in the sample: this applies to enterprises in 
both manufacturing and services. However, 
the tailing- off of the economic recovery in 
the fi  nal quarter of 2021 will be a factor in 
the annual result. Whereas the single- entity 
fi  nancial statements primarily refl  ect the 
German part of the value chain, the con-
solidated fi  nancial statement statistics illus-
trate the global intra- group value added 
created by numerous large multinationals 
domiciled in Germany. Consequently, the 
financial information provided by the 
groups serves as a particularly revealing re-
fl  ection of global economic developments 
and the domestic conditions prevailing in 
the countries where each subsidiary is lo-
cated.8
6 When looking at this metric, it needs to be noted 
that, in many cases, dividends were not paid until the 
second half of the year in 2020 owing to delayed 
shareholders’ meetings, which promoted the emer-
gence of these extremes.
7 Extrapolated based on the 34 largest groups.
8 Furthermore, the metrics derived from the fi  nancial 
statements are shaped materially by differences be-
tween the accounting standards applied (German 
GAAP for the corporate fi  nancial statement statistics, 
IFRS for consolidated fi  nancial statement statistics).Annual result before taxes on income

come. In line with the reduction in production, 
enterprises cut back the procurement of inter -
mediate goods and services, which had also 
become significantly cheaper compared with 
the previous year. Personnel expenses and 
other expenses were down as well. In addition 
to a slight decrease in employment, working 
hours were also scaled back, partly caused by 
the use of short- time work schemes. Extraor -
dinary expenses, meanwhile, saw steep growth 
in some cases. Overall, the textile industry, car -
makers and the transportation and storage sec -
tor had to accept a negative annual result. By 
contrast, the construction, retail trade and in -formation and communication sectors saw 
their profits go up.
Sources and uses of funds
Enterprises’ sources and uses of funds did not 
experience an exceptionally sharp decline, des -
pite the severe recession. Regarding the sources 
of funds, this was driven by stable internal 
financing, with lower capital increases from re -
tained profits being offset by higher depreci -
ation and transfers to provisions. External finan -
cing decreased on balance, despite the strong 
year- on- year growth in long- term liabilities. Despite 
 recession, no

This was due to the reduction in short- term 
liabilities . On the expenditure side, the acquisi -
tion of tangible fixed assets was much lower 
than in the previous year due to destocking, 
which had largely been driven by the decline in 
finished goods inventories and work in pro -
gress, and due to the lower increase in fixed 
assets, which barely exceeded the necessary in -
vestment in replacements. The acquisition of 
financial assets grew substantially, however, 
given the desire to preserve liquidity.Balance sheet developments
The total assets of non- financial enterprises ex -
panded once again in 2020. However, at 
around 2½%, this increase was weaker than in 
previous years. The share of financial assets (in -
cluding cash) in total assets grew again after a 
break in 2019. The main reason for this was, in 
particular, the much larger cash item due to the 
desire to stay liquid. Enterprises looked to 
boost liquidity in other areas on the assets side, 
too. On balance, there was a shift from long-  
term to short- term receivables. For example, 
holdings of short-  term securities rose, espe -

dustries, in the wholesale and retail trade (ex -
cluding automobiles) and in transportation and 
storage. Receivables from affiliated companies 
expanded, especially in the short- term seg -
ment. (Short- term) trade receivables declined 
more strongly than revenue, as a result of 
which enterprises obtained additional liquid 
funds. By contrast, the acquisition of long- term 
equity investments, which tends to be charac -
terised by a long planning horizon, continued 
unabated. Car manufacturers, in particular, ex -
panded their other long- term equity invest -
ments markedly, as did the electrical engineer -
ing and mechanical engineering industries and the wholesale and retail trade (excluding auto -
mobiles).
On the whole, non- financial assets decreased 
slightly in 2020, while tangible fixed assets re -
mained stable. Overall, and partly for liquidity 
reasons, inventories declined across the major -
ity of sectors for the first time since the finan -
cial and economic crisis of 2008-09, and most 
strongly in the electrical engineering industry. 
By contrast, intangible fixed assets saw sub -

caused by the acquisition of additional mobile 
phone licences. Thus, there does not appear to 
have been robust investment in digital goods 
such as software and databases, which this 
item includes.
In line with the overall positive result, the equity 
ratio of non-financial enterprises in 2020 did 
not decline from its high level. The individual 
sectors evolved differently, however. Sharper 
declines in equity occurred in the areas of trans -
portation and storage and in the electrical en -
gineering industry, although in the case of the 
latter this was partly due to a one- off effect at 
one large enterprise. By contrast, the energy 
sector in particular, especially the operators of 
power grids, saw distinct rises in equity, and car 
manufacturers and the wholesale and retail 
trade expanded their equity as well.
Furthermore, to preserve liquidity, short- term 
liabilities  were converted into long- term liabil -
ities on balance. As a consequence, there was 
a strong rise in long- term liabilities to affiliated 
companies. Short- term bank loans were re -
deemed on balance, and there was a signifi -
cant increase in long- term bank loans. A similar 
picture emerges with regard to bond holdings. 
Trade payables, however, declined, as is typical 
in recessionary periods. One reason behind this 
is the reduction in business activity, whilst an -
other reason is that creditors tend to call in 
their claims faster in such periods in order to 
secure their own liquidity. Payments received 
on account of orders likewise fell steeply. Provi -
sions also continued to rise sharply on account 
of the additional provisions for pensions re -
quired by the continuing fall in the discount 
rate. Virtually all sectors formed higher provi -
sions for taxes than they had previously. All in 
all, growth in liabilities and provisions in the re -
porting year remained lower than in 2019.
Trends for 2021 
Against the backdrop of the German econo -
my’s ongoing but intermittent recovery from the pandemic- induced crisis in the second 
quarter of 2020, non- financial enterprises are 
likely to have seen their business activity in -
crease again in 2021. However, not all sectors 
will have benefited equally from the backlog 
and catch- up effects in exports, investment 
and private consumption. For example, indus -
trial enterprises probably expanded their sales 
figures considerably given the strong demand 
from abroad and greater commercial invest -
ment in Germany. The robust housing invest -
ment seen so far will likely lead to sound an -
nual results in construction once again, while 
the persistent global supply bottlenecks are ex -
pected to have an inhibiting effect, especially in Equity ratio

car manufacturing. Ongoing containment 
measures or the reintroduction of new meas -
ures are also likely to continue dampening sales 
in certain service sectors such as accommoda -
tion and food service activities. Cost rises in key 
commodities and intermediate goods could 
take an additional toll on corporate profitabil -ity. Furthermore, the need to adjust pension 
provisions in line with interest rates or the in -
crease in labour costs will probably also have a 
dampening effect. As enterprises’ business ac -
tivity returns to normal, pressure on liquidity is 
likely to recede across most sectors in 2021.

* Monetary financial institutions (MFIs) comprise banks (including building and loan
associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.
3 Excluding holdings of MFIs; for the German contribution, excluding German MFIs'
portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI
participations.  7 The German contributions to the Eurosystem's monetary aggregates
should on no account be interpreted as national monetary aggregates and are
therefore not comparable with the erstwhile German money stocks M1, M2 or M3.
8 Including DEM banknotes still in circulation (see also footnote 4 on p. 10●). 9 For
the German contribution, the difference between the volume of euro banknotes

Eurosystem and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  1 Figures are daily averages
for the reserve maintenance period ending in the month indicated. Following the
changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the
Eurosystem's asset purchase programmes.  4 From August 2009 includes liquidity

2002 euro banknotes and other banknotes which have been issued by the national cen-
tral banks of the Eurosystem and which are still in circulation. In accordance with the
accounting procedure chosen by the Eurosystem for the issue of euro banknotes, a
share of 8% of the total value of the euro banknotes in circulation is

under “Other factors”. The remaining 92% of the value of the euro banknotes in
circulation is allocated, likewise on a monthly basis, to the NCBs, with each NCB
showing in its balance sheet the share of the euro banknotes issued corresponding to
its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-
system and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  7 Equal to the difference bet-
ween the sum of liquidity-pro viding factors and the sum of liquidity-absorbing factors.

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

Sources: The calculations for the insurance sectors are based on supervisory data
according to Solvency I and II and for pension funds on IORP supervisory data and own
data collections as of 2020 Q1. Until 2019 Q4 these are compiled using Solvency I
supervisory data, supplemented by voluntary reports and own calculations.  1 Including
deposits retained on ceded business as well as registered bonds, borrowers' note loans
and registered Pfandbriefe.  2 Including claims of pension funds on pension managers
and entitlements to non-pension benefits.  3 Technical reserves "life" taking account oftransitional measures. Health insurance is also included in the "non-life insurance"
sector.  4 Own funds correspond to the sum of "Net worth" and "Shares and other
equity".  5 Not including the reinsurance business conducted by primary insurers, which
is included there.  6 Valuation at book values. The term "pension funds" refers to the
institutional sector "pension funds" of the European System of Accounts. Pension funds
thus comprise company pension schemes and occupational pension schemes for the
self-employed. Social security funds are not included.  7 Change in data sources.

labour force.  6 Excluding government-assisted forms of employment and seasonal jobs,
including jobs located abroad.  7 From January 2017 persons receiving additional
income assistance (unemployment benefit and unemployment benefit II at the same
time) shall be assigned to the legal category of the Third Book of the Social SecurityCode (SGB III).  8 Statistical break due to late recording of unemployed persons in the
legal category of the Second Book of the Social Security Code (SGB II).  9 Unadjusted
figures estimated by the Federal Employment Agency. In 2019 and 2020, the estimated
values for Germany deviated from the final data by a maximum of 0.1% for employees
subject to social contributions, by a maximum of 0.9% for persons solely in jobs
exempt from social contributions, and by a maximum of 55.3% for cyclically induced
short-time work.  10 From May 2021, calculated on the basis of new labour force fig-
ures. 11 Initial preliminary estimate by the Federal Statistical Office.

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the
currency concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's
price competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective
exchange rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitive-
ness. The weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more
detailed information on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the
Deutsche Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1  The
calculations are based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral
exchange rates of the euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following countries: Australia,
Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan,
Norway, Poland, Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United
Kingdom and the United States. Where current price and wage indices were not avai-lable, estimates were used.  2 ECB calculations. Includes countries belonging to the
group EER-19 and additionally Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Iceland, India,
