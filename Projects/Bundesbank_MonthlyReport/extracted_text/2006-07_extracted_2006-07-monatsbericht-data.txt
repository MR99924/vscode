IndustryThe perceptible upward trend in industrial
business activity continued throughout theperiod under review. Seasonally and working-day adjusted output in May, the latest monthfor which statistics have been published, in-creased by 1
1/C252% on the month. Taken to-
gether, April and May outperformed the firstquarter by 1% on average. Although thepace of industrial output was somewhat lessrapid recently than in the second half of2005, it was higher than in the first quarter,when output rose by
1/C252%.
There has also been a noticeable rise in de-
mand for industrial goods in the past fewmonths. Having cleared its strike-related re-porting backlog, the Federal Statistical Officehas now published the first robust datafor February and the following months. Ascan now be seen, new orders in the firstquarter of 2006 increased by a seasonallyand working-day-adjusted 1
1/C252% on the final
quarter of 2005. The average increase in Apriland May was similarly high. While exportorders remained strong, the intake of domes-tic orders was also tending to pick up. Over-all, new orders were up 12
1/C254% on the year,
compared with 101/C252% in the first quarter.
The seasonally adjusted value of exports of
goods in May fell by 11/C252% on the month.
However, nominal imports of goods droppedeven more sharply by 2
3/C254%. This resulted in a
further increase in the trade surplus. The realtrade surplus grew even more steeply whenIndustrial

6the price increases, especially in imports, are
taken into consideration.
ConstructionAfter adjustment for seasonal and working-
day variations, construction output grewonce again in May. This indicates a continuingreturn to normal production after the severeweather-related decline during winter. Takentogether, April and May outperformed theweak first quarter by 12%. Growth was upby no less than 4
3/C254% on the final quarter of
2005. In May the year-on-year increase wentup to 7
1/C252%. In April there was a strong in-
crease in new orders, too, particularly inhousing construction. Likewise, public sectorcustomers placed a significantly larger num-ber of orders than in the previous quarter.The trend towards stabilisation in the con-struction industry thus remained on course.
Economy as a wholeThe available data indicate that the cyclical
upturn in the German economy continued inthe second quarter. Growth in real gross do-mestic product (GDP), after adjustment forseasonal and working-day variations, is likelyto have shown a noticeable improvement onthe first quarter, when output grew by 0.4%.The positive overall result was driven by in-dustry and particularly construction wherebusiness was substantially better than in thewinter months, when cold weather had de-pressed activity. Along with construction in-vestment, expenditure on machinery andplant is also likely to have risen, thus makinginvestment the main driver of growth in theEconomic conditions in Germany*

7second quarter. In addition, the external sec-
tor can also be assumed to have made a posi-tive contribution to growth. Although real ex-ports of goods largely remained at the firstquarter’s high level, imports of goods prob-ably decreased slightly in real terms. Spendingby foreign visitors in connection with thefootball World Cup, which is recorded as ex-ports of services in the national accounts,may have also provided an additional tempor-ary stimulating effect. Following the positivefirst few months of the year, private con-sumption is likely to have continued improv-ing at a moderate pace. A slight decline inclassical retail purchases was offset by agreater number of car purchases and im-proved demand for services.
Labour marketThere were signs of a gradual improvement in
the labour market in May. According to initialestimates by the Federal Statistical Office, theseasonally adjusted number of persons inwork rose to 38.8 million. This was 36,000more than in April and 49,000 more than inthe previous year. The Federal EmploymentAgency’s estimate of the number of employ-ees subject to social security contributions,which was revised upwards for the first fewmonths of the year, was 42,000 higher inApril than in March, according to initial calcu-lations. This means that, for the first time inover four years, there was no year-on-yeardecline. The number of part-time low-incomeworkers (mini jobs) also increased by 250,000in April. Government-assisted forms of em-ployment also rose in June, especially casualwork for social security recipients (“one-eurojobs”) and persons assisted by labour market
reintegration grants.
According to Federal Employment Agency
figures, there was a further decrease in regis-tered unemployment in June. After adjust-ment for seasonal variations, 4.54 million per-sons were officially registered as unemployed.This was 49,000 fewer than in May and380,000 fewer than in the same month lastyear. The unemployment rate fell from11.0% in May to 10.9%.
PricesPrices in the international energy markets re-
mained at a very high level in June. AtUS$70, the average June spot quotation for abarrel of Brent North Sea oil was only aboutUS$1 below the latest record high in May.The price rose yet again at the end of Juneand in early July; at the time this report wentto press (6 July) the spot price was just overUS$73
1/C252. Mid-term (6-month) futures con-
tracts were quoted at US$1/C252above the
spot rate, and long-term futures contracts(18 months) were quoted at US$
1/C254below the
spot rate. This shows that the market is stillexpecting prices to remain high in the longterm, too.
At the consumer level, seasonally adjusted
prices rose by 0.3% in June compared withMay. Energy, in particular, became more ex-pensive. The prices of seasonal food productsalso rose more sharply than is usual at thistime of year. The prices of some services arelikely to have been affected by the footballWorld Cup. There were obvious increases forEmploymentInternational

age holidays, on the other hand, were re-duced somewhat. The prices of industrialgoods declined slightly. Developments inhousing rents remained moderate. Year-on-year consumer price inflation (CPI) increasedby a total of 0.1 percentage point to 2.0%.The HICP inflation rate also stood at 2.0%.
Public finances

Local government finances
According to recently published cash data for
the first quarter of 2006, the generally posi-tive trend in local government finances con-tinued: the deficit declined year on year from33
1/C252billion to just over 321/C252billion. This was
due primarily to the sharp increase in revenue(+8%), which was largely a result of the con-tinuing very steep rise (+19%) in net receiptsfrom local business tax. The proceeds fromasset sales and repayments of granted creditswere also much larger again compared withtheir particularly low level at the beginning ofthe previous year. With regard to the fundsreceived from other levels of government, re-ductions in the current grants dependent onstate governments’ tax receipts (-3%) and in-vestment grants (-4%) from state govern-ments were offset by larger payments fromcentral government and state governments inconnection with the Hartz IV reform.
Local government expenditure increased year
on year, rising by almost 4
1/C252%. The main
contributory factor here was the continuedsharp rise in expenditure on social benefits(+9%), which was due primarily to the in-
crease in accommodation costs for recipientsof unemployment benefit II (housing benefits,29.1% of which are covered by central gov-ernment). In contrast to what had happenedin earlier quarters, expenditure on personnelwas again down on the year (-1
1/C252%) after ris-
ing temporarily in some states, mainly as aresult of the shifting of some responsibilitiesto the municipalities. By contrast, fixed assetformation again increased (+1
1/C252%), especially
in Baden-W/C252rttemberg and Bavaria, whereasin eastern Germany it continued to decline(-9%).
The financial situation of the individual local
authorities varies considerably. For example,the growth in revenue from local business taxis spread unevenly across the individual muni-cipalities depending on the number of taxableenterprises located there and their profits,with the result that in many cases the finan-cial situation remains very tense. Trends inindebtedness also point in this direction.Although debt incurred through regularbudgetary borrowing declined quarter onquarter by almost 3
1/C252billion to just under
3881/C252billion, there was a further sharp rise of
just under 321/C252billion to almost 3261/C252billion
in the case of cash advances, which are actu-ally intended to be used only as a means ofbridging short-term liquidity shortages. Start-ing from a relatively moderate level, the localauthorities in Schleswig-Holstein more than

9doubled their debt through this form of
borrowing, thereby incurring an increase thatis far above average. However, by far thehighest share of cash advances in localauthority debt was recorded in Saarland(over 55%). In Saxony, Thuringia, Bavaria andBaden-W/C252rttemberg, by contrast, the corres-ponding ratio was below 5%.
Even if the outturn of the first quarter can
provide only a limited indication of develop-ments during the year as a whole, a furtherdecline in municipal deficits does seem pos-sible in 2006. In addition to the expected sig-nificant rise in tax revenue, proceeds fromselling off some of the municipal housingagencies will probably also play a part in this.While the effect on municipal budgets of thefurther rise emerging in expenditure on ac-commodation costs for the recipients of un-employment benefit II will still be noticeablycushioned this year by the central govern-ment share in housing benefit payments, theplanned reduction in central government’sparticipation laid down in the draft 2007 fed-eral budget means that next year local gov-ernment will have to face a further financialburden of approximately 32 billion.
Securities markets
Bond marketIssuing activity in the German bond market
picked up in May 2006. Domestic borrowersissued bonds to the gross value of 393.1 bil-
lion compared with 384.9 billion in the previ-
ous month. After taking account of redemp-tions and changes in issuers’ holdings of their
own bonds and notes, net sales amounted to334.0 billion after the volume of domestic
bonds outstanding had remained unchangedon balance in April. Net sales of foreignbonds likewise increased and amounted to314.8 billion, bringing the total amount of
funds raised in May to 348.9 billion.
General government was the main issuer
among domestic borrowers, adding 313.9
billion to its bonded debt. Central govern-ment accounted for 310.5 billion of this
amount. In the long-term maturity segment,it issued ten-year and thirty-year bonds in theamount of 38.6 billion and 30.4 billion re-
spectively. In the short-term maturity seg-ment, it issued two-year Federal Treasurynotes (Sch/C228tze) worth 30.7 billion and Federal€b n

ume of mortgage Pfandbriefe and publicPfandbriefe went up by 34.3 billion and
30.8 billion respectively. Other bank debt se-
curities were redeemed for a net 30.3 billion.
Corporate bonds and commercial paper were
issued for a total of 38.0 billion in May, thehighest level of net sales recorded in the past
two years. Sales of corporate bonds with ma-turities of more than one year reached34.9 billion (April: 32.9 billion); the volume of
shorter-term commercial paper outstandingrose by 33.1 billion after having fallen by
30.4 billion in the preceding month.
Debt securities were purchased by domestic
non-banks ( 323.0 billion) and credit institu-
tions ( 321.3 billion). Domestic credit institu-
tions increased their holdings of German gov-ernment debt securities by 313.9 billion and
purchased foreign bonds to the amount of37.4 billion. Foreign investors added German
bonds worth 34.6 billion to their portfolios.
Equity marketIssuing activity in the German equity market
largely came to a halt in May. The marketvalue of the issues reached 30.2 billion com-
pared with 31.4 billion in April. Domestic
sales of foreign equities reached 30.8 billion.
Foreign investors bought German sharesworth a total of 35.2 billion, while domestic
investors reduced their holdings of domesticand foreign shares by 34.1 billion.
Mutual fund sharesIn May, specialised funds reserved for institu-
tional investors accounted for most of the in-flow of resources to domestic investmentfunds; share certificates worth 34.2 billion
net were sold. The inflows and outflowsrecorded by investment funds open to thegeneral public were roughly in balance; all inall,30.3 billion was raised. In net terms,Sales and purchases

both share-based funds and open-end realestate funds recorded outflows of funds tothe value of 30.5 billion. German investors
sold foreign mutual fund shares in theamount of 31.7 billion on balance.
Resident credit institutions invested 31.9 bil-
lion in domestic funds. Domestic non-banksinvested 32.4 billion in domestic mutual fund
shares but redeemed 31.9 billion worth of
their foreign certificates on balance. In May2006, foreign investors changed their hold-ings of German investment fund certificatesonly slightly; they invested 30.3 billion in do-
mestic mutual fund shares.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account ran a surplus – in
unadjusted terms – of 34.3 billion in May,
compared with one of 37.0 billion a month
earlier. The increase in the trade surplus wasmore than offset by the greater deficit on in-visibles, which comprise services, income andcurrent transfers.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the foreign trade sur-plus stood at 312.9 billion in May, up 31.7 bil-
lion on the month. After adjustment for sea-sonal and working-day variations, the surplusrose by 3
1/C252billion to just under 313 billion. At

12markedly more sharply than that of nominal
exports of goods (-11/C252%). In the period from
April to May, seasonally adjusted exportswere nevertheless
3/C254% above the level of the
first quarter. The1/C254% average increase in the
value of imports in the same period can be at-tributed to price effects alone.
The deficit on invisible current transactions
went up by 34.3 billion on the month to 37.1
billion in May. The main reason for this wasthat, in the case of the cross-border incomeaccount, expenditure rose faster than rev-enue, giving a deficit of 34.4 billion in the in-
come account in May, compared with a sur-plus of 30.5 billion in April. At the same time,
the deficit on services rose by 30.5 billion to
31.6 billion. By contrast, the deficit on current
transfers halved to 31.1 billion.
Direct investment resulted in net capital im-
ports amounting to 39.2 billion in May (com-
pared with outflows of 39.7 billion in April).
These can be put down essentially to the op-erations of German enterprises ( 36.4 billion).
This mainly involved German parent com-panies borrowing (predominantly short-term)funds from their affiliates located abroad(312.2 billion), while providing them with
equity capital at the same time ( 36.0 billion).
Foreign enterprises transferred 32.8 billion
net to their German affiliates, essentially inthe form of short-term loans.
German cross-border portfolio investment re-
sulted in slight net capital imports in May(31.4 billion), compared with comparativelylarge outflows of funds in April ( 321.8 billion
net). This can be attributed mainly to the in-vestment of non-residents, who purchasedGerman securities for 310.0 billion, after
selling German paper – notably shares – for318.0 billion in the previous month. In doing
so, non-residents again acquired equities(35.2 billion) and debt securities ( 34.6 billion).
In the case of interest-bearing securities, theirpreference was for longer-term paper issuedby private borrowers. German investorsadded foreign securities worth 38.6 billion
net to their portfolios. Whereas they in-creased their holdings of debt securities(314.8 billion) – particularly bonds – they sold
foreign shares ( 34.5 billion) and mutual fund
shares ( 31.7 billion).
Other investment, which comprises loans and
trade credits as well as bank deposits andother assets, resulted in outflows of funds of326.1 billion net in the month under review.
General government transferred 310.3 billion
abroad, building up, among other things,their balances with foreign banks. Enterprisesand individuals exported funds amounting to32.3 billion net. The Bundesbank recorded an
increase in its net external assets (excludingreserve assets) of 318.9 billion, essentially in
connection with the large-value payment sys-tem TARGET. By contrast, domestic credit in-stitutions acquired funds from abroad ( 35.3
billion net).
The Bundesbank’s reserve assets rose – at
transaction values – by 31.1 billion in May.Invisibles

13Recent developments
in German banks’
lending to domestic
enterprises and
householdsThe amount of German banks’ unse-
curitised lending to the domestic non-bank sector has shown barely any in-crease over the past few years. This isespecially true of loans to enterprisesand self-employed persons, althoughemployees’ consumer credit and hous-ing loans have increased only slightlyas well. Ultimately, this development isa reflection of economic growth overthe past few years, which has not onlybeen weak but also heavily reliant onexports, and of the structural adjust-ment in the construction sector, a pro-cess that was set in train as long ago asthe mid-1990s.
However, there are identifiable signs
that lending has recently started topick up again slightly in Germany. Thisis probably due mainly to the demandfor loans having increased somewhatand, to a lesser extent, to banks havingmarginally eased their credit stand-ards. The present report provides a de-tailed account of these recent trends.However, it also shows that the rise inthe demand for bank loans is still quitelimited. One key reason for this is thatGerman enterprises are in a favourableposition with regard to their liquidityand profitability, which allows them touse their own resources for much oftheir funding.

14German banks’ lending to the domestic
private sector
In Germany, bank loans are of major import-
ance for the economy as a whole since theyhave traditionally been by far the most signifi-cant source of external financing for domesticenterprises and households.
1Bank loans ac-
count for around 40% of German non-financial corporations’ debt; households are,in any case, indebted almost exclusively todomestic banks. Since 1991-92, however,growth in outstanding bank loans declinedfrom an average of 10% to around 7% in thesecond half of the 1990s. Along with the pro-gressive withdrawal of tax incentives relatedto the reconstruction of eastern Germanyand the end of the construction boom in thisarea, there was a fall not only in the demandfor mortgage loans but also in the financingrequirement for business investments, whichhad initially been at a high level. The technol-ogy boom up to the end of the 1990s didsharply inflate the borrowing requirement ofsome sectors, however. The resulting deteri-oration in the balance sheet ratios, combinedwith the economic slowdown, forced enter-prises to undertake radical consolidationmeasures in the years that followed, whichalso led to a marked decline in general invest-ment activities. Together with the persistentproblems of structural adjustment in the con-struction sector and households’ poorer em-ployment and income prospects, this notice-ably depressed the demand for bank loansfurther.
The above-mentioned trends in the economy
as a whole have been reflected to varying de-grees in the credit demand of the individual
sectors. While the economic upswing at theend of the 1980s and, in particular, the sub-sequent “reunification boom” led to a rapidrise in the demand for business loans andconsumer credit, it was only after some timethat housing loans picked up momentum,achieving their highest growth rates in themiddle of 1994. Various tax incentives wereintroduced in the late 1980s and early 1990sto stimulate the construction of rented hous-ing as well as the acquisition or modernisa-tion of owner-occupied residential property.After these incentives were cut back, therewas a marked slowdown in the growth ofhousing loans in the second half of the1990s.
2Like the general private sector de-
mand for borrowed funds, housing loans didgrow somewhat more rapidly for a time in1999, but then the trend slowdown set inonce again. Bank loans for commercial resi-dential construction, in particular, lost a greatdeal of momentum during this period.
All in all, in fact, there has been a marked de-
cline – in some cases in absolute terms – inloans to enterprises and self-employed per-sons in Germany during the past four years.All economic sectors have played a part in

and financing in 2005, Monthly Report, June 2006,
pp 15-33.
2The progressive withdrawal of tax incentives was often
also associated with clear anticipatory effects on borrow-
ing at the end of each year. Such an impact was appar-
ent, for example, in the case of the changeover from a
primarily income-tax-related promotion of residential
property to a grant to homebuyers (also dependent on
the number of children), which came into effect at the
beginning of 1996. The limiting of the grant to homebuy-
ers in the case of extensions scheduled for 1997 likewise
resulted in a temporary marked increase in housing loans
in the final quarter of 1996.Weakening of

15this development. Besides the construction
sector, which, as mentioned earlier, was in aprocess of contraction from the mid-1990sup to last year and which has been steadilyreducing its outstanding loans from domesticbanks since 2001, manufacturing, too, hasbeen running down its indebtedness to do-mestic credit institutions on a considerablescale in the past five years. Moreover, thewholesale and retail trade and the (statistical-ly quite broadly defined) services sector (in-cluding the self-employed professions) have,on balance, been paying back loans fromGerman banks over recent years. This hasalso been due to the lower financing require-ments of housing enterprises and other realestate firms, which had benefited from thespecial boom in housing construction in themid-1990s.The weak growth of loans over the past four
years is also apparent from the banks’ per-spective and has left its mark in the balancesheets of nearly all the major categories ofbanks. Commercial banks’ loans to the pri-vate sector in Germany in March 2006 wereonly 5% up on their end-2001 level, for ex-ample. By contrast, from 1998 to 2001 theyrose by just under 17
1/C252%. Nevertheless, it has
been mainly growth in the big banks’ lendingthat has been weak during the past fouryears; at the end of the period under review,it was almost 10
1/C252% down on its level at the
end of 2001. By contrast, the other commer-cial banks (regional banks and branches offoreign banks) stepped up their lending todomestic enterprises and households by24%, therefore more or less as sharply as inthe period from 1998 to 2001.Year-on-year change

16In the case of the Landesbanks and savings
banks, the increase during the past four yearswas likewise slight at 3
1/C252% and almost 41/C252%
respectively, while the credit cooperatives ex-panded their lending to domestic enterprisesand households by as much as 7%. Thismeans that, compared with the period from1998 to 2001, these three categories ofbanks also experienced a marked slowdownin the pace of growth of their loans to do-mestic private debtors. This is especially trueof the Landesbanks, which had increasedtheir lending by almost one-half between1998 and 2001. The slowdown was lessmarked in the case of the credit cooperatives,however. Between 1998 and 2001, they hadexpanded their loans to domestic enterprisesand households at only a comparatively mod-erate annual average rate of 3%, however.Mainly short-term loans have been paid back
in the past few years and, given the lowercapital market rates, have been replaced insome cases by medium and long-term loans.In this way, borrowers have improved thequality of their financing structure and se-cured lower interest rates for longer periods.This development has been especially pro-nounced in the savings banks and credit co-operatives sector.
In the past few years, loan growth in Ger-
many has been very slight not only from a his-torical perspective but also when comparedwith other euro-area countries. In the pastthree years, loans to the private sector in theeuro area have increased at an average year-on-year rate of just over 8%.

in particular, in housing loans (151/C252%) – a de-
velopment to which the sharp increase inproperty prices in some euro-area countries isalso likely to have contributed. In many othereuro-area countries, however, loans to enter-prises also expanded at a rapid pace. If Ger-many is excluded, they have grown at anaverage rate of 9

Determinants of loan development
in Germany
The described situation as it has developed
over the past few years has been perceived asa major concern by various commentatorsand, given German banks’ unfavourable prof-itability, as a reflection of a particularly re-strictive loan supply stance on the part of the
banks. However, a more in-depth analysis in-cluding not only an econometric assessmentbut also the incorporation of other relevantindicators reveals that loan developments as awhole in Germany since 1970 and, in particu-lar, the weakening of loan expansion in 2001may be explained largely in demand-sideterms.
In the empirical estimation approach, which is
based on annualised rates of change, the ex-planatory variables used are the growth rateof real gross domestic product (GDP) as ageneral activity variable, the investment ratioas a rough measure of enterprises’ need forexternal finance, and the spread betweencorporate and government bonds to captureLending to enterprises and households in Germany by category of banks

18the external finance premium as a risk pre-
mium.
An obvious method of assessing current loan
development is a comparison with the valuesforecast on the basis of the estimation equa-tion. The chart above compares the annual-ised actual quarter-on-quarter rate of changein real loans with the projection resultingfrom the model.
3The estimated empirical re-lationship appears to exist over a relatively
long period. The times of upswings anddownswings in lending are captured well bythe model. This applies, for example, to theoil price shocks in the 1970s and the periodof relatively high growth rates at the end ofthe 1980s. The downswing in loans startingin early 2001 is also indicated correctly by themodel, however.
Compared with the values explained from
within the model, loan growth over the pastfew years does appear to have been weakbut not exceptionally low. Thus, the actualrate of loan growth in most quarters since2001 has been below the projected growthrate of real loans, ie below the developmentexplained by the aforementioned fundamen-tals. Nevertheless, the scale of this deviationis comparable to that of earlier deviations,such as in the period of sharply declining loangrowth in 1974-75.
An analysis of the individual determinants of
the low level of growth in the benchmarkprojection shows that the all-time low invest-ment ratio, in which both enterprises’ fixedinvestment and households’ residential in-vestment are combined, was a major cause ofthe weak loan development in the past fewyears. In addition, the external finance pre-mium was also rather high in 2003-04. How-ever, even after the spread had shown amarked decline again, loan development re-Annualised quarter-on-quarter change

19Estimation of loan equations in Germany
The following variables are taken into account
as determinants of real private loan develop-ment (K): real gross domestic product (BIP) as a
general activity variable, the investment ratio(I/BIP) as an approximation of the need for ex-
ternal financing, and the interest rate spread be-tween corporate and government bonds (S)as a
measure of the development of the risk pre-mium. Using lagged values for the loan variablesallows for any potential adjustment delays.

+a3St+a4(L)/C1lnK t–1+"t (1)
The estimation draws on seasonally adjusted
quarterly data. The dependent variable is first-differenced, providing a closer approximation ofcurrent loan development. Hence, the rate ofloan growth, /C1lnK
t,was calculated as the quar-
terly difference at the end of the quarter in thelogarithmic real loan stocks and then annualised.A GDP deflator is used to deflate the variable.Real GDP growth compared with the previousquarter, /C1lnBIP
t,ie the difference between the
logarithmic GDP in two consecutive quarters,was also annualised. The investment ratio,(I/BIP)
t,is defined as the ratio of nominal invest-
ment to nominal GDP .1The interest rate spread,
St,denotes the difference between the yields for
corporate and government bonds respectively.This can be used to gauge the level of the exter-nal finance premium which, in turn, reflects theseverity of the problems associated with an infor-mation asymmetry between the borrower andthe lending bank. The underlying assumptionhere is that a higher external finance premium isaccompanied by an increase in the bank’s per-ceived loan risk, thus implying higher lendingcosts for the borrower and restraining banks’lending. It appears that, by taking investmentsinto account, the impact of the actual interestrate level on loan development has, indirectly, al-ready been factored in. At all events, estimationsof the model which include real capital marketinterest rates as an additional explanatory vari-able have not indicated that the interest ratelevel has a significant additional impact.In an OLS estimation of aggregated loans to the
private sector for the period 1970 Q1 to 2006Q1, all explanatory variables have the expectedsign and, with the exception of the annualisedrate of change in real lending (which is laggedby a quarter), all are statistically significant. Ac-cording to these figures, real credit growth inGermany is positively dependent on real GDPgrowth and the investment ratio and negativelydependent on the spread.
In the sectoral estimation for corporate loans,
GDP growth, the ratio of investment in machin-ery and equipment, (IA/BIP)
t, and the spread
are significant. The development in loans forhouse purchase is determined by the ratio of in-vestment in construction, (IB/BIP)
t, but also by
GDP growth and the spread.
The explanatory power of all the estimation
equations is comparatively high. In addition, thedesignated test statistics have not detected anymisspecification in the model. Even so, there is acertain degree of uncertainty in the empirical re-sults, which is reflected in fairly wide confidenceintervals.

20mained weak owing to the low investment
ratio.
This empirical approach can be applied not
only to overall lending but also largely to theloans to the most important private sectorborrowers, ie loans to enterprises, which ac-count for 40% of all loans to the domesticprivate non-bank sector, and to housingloans, which account for 50% of all loans. Todo this, however, the aggregate investmentratio has to be replaced by a variable that ismore appropriate to the loan aggregate inquestion, ie the ratio of investment in ma-chinery and equipment in the case of loans toenterprises and the ratio of investment inpremises in the case of housing loans.
The weak growth in loans over the past few
years can be even better explained by the re-sults of such sectorally disaggregated estima-tions than in the context of the aggregatedmodel which combines the entire corporatesector (including residential construction) andhouseholds. This applies particularly to hous-ing loans, revealing the key relevance of his-torically low construction investment to thedemand for construction finance. Much thesame also applies to loans to enterprises andthe multi-year weakness of investment. Over-all, the sectoral analysis of loans to enter-prises and housing loans, which cover asmuch as 90% of all loans, suggests that thegrowth in real loans predicted by the aggre-gated model for the first quarter of 2006(roughly 2
1/C254%) is, if anything, to be rated as
rather high.Possible causes of sluggish loan business
in the past few years
Unfortunately, the estimated loan equations
do not allow a precise separation of loan sup-ply and loan demand factors. The reason forthis is that the explanatory variables used can-not be unambiguously classified either as de-terminants solely of demand for borrowedfunds or solely of the banks’ supply of loans.Viewed less strictly, however, the GDP growthrate and the investment ratio are more likelyto capture the loan demand side, while thespread tends to be assignable to the loan sup-ply side. The fact that the estimations tracethe sluggish loan business especially to thelow investment ratio(s) therefore tends topoint more towards weak loan demand andless towards restrictions on the supply ofloans.
This judgement is largely supported by add-
itional reference to a number of other indica-tors. For example, the majority of bankscovered by the Bank Lending Survey for 2003and 2004 reported a declining demand forbank loans, especially loans to enterprises. Inthis context, enterprises’ comparatively minorneed for external finance was regarded main-ly as a consequence of their weak investmentactivity. Furthermore, favourable profitabilityin the past few years has contributed to non-financial corporations being able to cover thevast majority of their financing needs from in-ternal resources. This was also reflected, forinstance, in their moderate recourse to thecapital market. In the past four years, theyhave raised around 331 billion in the capital
market on an annual average. In the periodAnalysis of loan

21from 1998 to 2001, the figure was more than
three times as high per year.
Furthermore, sizeable funds from abroad
have flowed into enterprises and householdsin the past few years. The net external assetposition of the German banking system, inwhich the transactions of the domestic pri-vate sector with non-residents are recordedstatistically, has shown mostly large inflows offunds in the past few years. At its peak, thecumulative increase in net external assetsover 12 months amounted to 3168 billion.
4
Overall, the inflows of funds, taken by them-
selves, are likely to have not only promotedthe liquidity holding of the private sector butalso dampened borrowing domestically.
Finally, it should be pointed out that the weak
loan development of the past few years hasnot been due to a sharp increase in securitisa-tions or sales of loans. Both generally lead toa decline in the statistically recorded level ofdomestic banks’ loans to domestic enterprisesand households. However, the scale of suchtransactions has been too small to have madea crucial impact on credit developments inGermany over the past few years.
5For ex-
ample, bank loans managed on the basis ofissued asset-backed securities (ABS) – andonly such loans continue to be recorded inthe statistics after they have been securitised– account for no more than roughly
1/C252per-
centage point of all German banks’ loans todomestic enterprises and households. This isespecially the case as bank loans managedthrough ABS securitisations rose sharply in1998-99, showed subdued growth in the fol-lowing years and have been declining almostcontinuously since the second quarter of
2003. In any case, in the vast majority ofcases it has been automotive banks that havebeen making use of ABS as a securitisationoption in recent years. Overall, therefore, de-velopments in the past few years cannot beused to determine a clear trend towards loansecuritisation. The creation of Germany’s ownsecuritisation infrastructure by the 13 banksparticipating in the True Sale Initiative in 2004means that the underlying conditions for%

22such transactions in Germany are now dis-
tinctly more favourable, however.
German banks’ sales of loans in the past few
years have also been too insignificant interms of their quantity. If at all, sales of entireportfolios of loans were an important factor.Such portfolios include not only sound loansbut also, above all, non-performing loans.However, as part of the nominal volume ofthese non-performing loans had already beenwritten off as specific loss provisions – forwhich the underlying figures on Germanbanks’ lending used here have been adjusted– this effect is likely to have been relativelylimited. It may be assumed that the statistical-ly relevant overall level of such sales of prob-lem loans in the past two and a half years hasbeen well below 310 billion, thus covering
less than
1/C252% of the loans to domestic enter-
prises and households.
Nevertheless, indications from the Bank Lend-
ing Survey that German banks’ lending policyhas become somewhat stricter show thatloan supply effects cannot be entirely ruledout. From the time the survey was introducedin January 2003, the responding institutionson balance reported a continuing supply-sidetightening of their credit standards for cor-porate loans, which did not end until mid-2004. This trend was apparent across all sizecategories and maturities. The main reasonscited for this continuous tightening were theongoing deterioration in the general econom-ic outlook, the changed risk assessment ofsector and firm-specific factors, and the de-creasing value of the collateral.
6When the
survey started, there was also a continuoustightening of the credit standards for loans to
households. Although this largely came to anend in the third quarter of 2003 in the case ofconsumer credit, it persisted until the secondquarter of 2004 in the case of housing loans– in much the same way as with loans to en-terprises. For retail customers, too, the report-ing banks cited a worsening of the generaleconomic outlook as the main reason for thesupply-side tightening. As becomes clearfrom the surveyed institutions’ margin policy,it was mainly more risky exposures that wereaffected. This may have been the result ofbanks’ more risk-sensitive pricing, since thebanks had had to cope with considerablewrite-downs from their loan portfolios.
7
Despite these indications of loan supply ef-fects, the indictors tend to suggest by andlarge that the sluggish lending of the pastfew years has been determined mainly by thedemand side. Although the empirical evi-dence does not rule out German banks exer-cising a certain cyclical restraint in their lend-ing, there has not been an exceptional restric-tion of lending to enterprises and householdsin the past few years.
6Corporate insolvencies affecting, in particular, young
enterprises, rose sharply, especially in 2001-03, although
the number of corporate failures fell again afterwards.

23Outlook for loan developments
in Germany
The most recent figures on lending in Ger-
many now point to a slight acceleration inthe expansion of private credit. At the end ofthe period under review, the year-on-yearrate of unsecuritised lending to the domesticprivate sector was 1.9%. In the past fewquarters, it has been mainly lending to enter-prises and self-employed persons that hasgathered pace. Housing loans were also pick-ing up at the end of the period under review.The decline in consumer loans to employedpersons has now come to a standstill.
When interpreting loan development, how-
ever, it should be borne in mind that, current-ly, the most important factor in the increasein loans to the domestic private sector is lend-ing to non-monetary financial intermediaries(excluding insurance enterprises). This is dueto short-term loans in connection with repotransactions (including securities repurchaseagreements) between German banks and alarge German securities trading house which,as the provider of an electronic trading plat-form, acts as the central counterparty in repotransactions between participants (usuallybanks). Since the start of 2005, such (reverse)repo transactions have been more in evi-dence. This has led not only to an increase inshort-term loans to non-monetary financialintermediaries but also to an increase in thenumber of repo transactions with such cus-tomers.
8Excluding such transactions, which
ultimately do not involve any flow of funds tothe private non-bank sector, the growth rateof loans to the private sector in Germany is
3/C254percentage point lower, ie 1.2% in March2006 rather than 1.9%. The (reverse) repotransactions are, furthermore, also respon-sible for the pronounced fluctuations in lend-ing in the second half of 2005 and the firstquarter of 2006.

8As the electronic trading platform is used not only by
German banks but also by foreign institutions and the
German Finance Agency, the increase in short-term loans
to non-monetary financial institutions associated with (re-
verse) repo transactions and the increase in the short-
term repo deposits of such customers are not necessarily
equally large.
9Following a sharp rise in the associated short-term
loans to non-monetary financial intermediaries in the
third quarter of 2005, they were reduced markedly to-
wards the end of 2005, probably for balance sheet rea-
sons. They then increased again sharply in the first quar-
ter of 2006. This is also shown in the sharp fluctuations
of the seasonally adjusted annualised quarter-on-quarter
rates in the chart on page 18.Slight

24(reverse) repo transactions – point to no more
than a slight acceleration in lending in Ger-many. By contrast, the figures of the MFIinterest rate statistics on German banks’ newlending business, which do not contain anyloans to financial enterprises, show a muchsharper increase. For example, total newloans by German banks as shown in the MFIinterest rate statistics have been noticeablyup on the year since as long ago as March2005. Such monthly year-on-year compari-sons are, by nature, very volatile, however(see the adjacent chart). Looking at the cu-mulative volumes of new business over12 months, therefore, shows that of late theywere almost 16
1/C252% up on the same period in
the previous year.
However, these figures systematically over-
state the actual flow of funds to the privatesector (see the box on pages 26-27), especial-ly as short-term loans are by far the mostprevalent in new business. It is precisely inthis segment that the relationship betweennew business and changes in stocks is crucial-ly affected by the average interest rate fix-ation. Even a comparatively minor shorteningof this period perceptibly increases the aver-age transaction velocity of the loans and,thus, the reported new business without thisimplying a matching increase in the stock ofloans. Added to this is the fact that banks’new business gives an inflated impression ofthe underlying net financing volume – espe-cially in periods of longer-term debt consoli-dation when enterprises and households typ-ically reduce their short-term debt and re-place it with long-term loans, as has been thecase in the past few years.€b n

25Despite the problems of interpretation, the
data on new lending business can providecertain clues to the factors underlying the de-velopment of loans, however. They essentiallyconfirm the impression gained from the bal-ance sheet statistics: in the case of loans toenterprises, both short-term loans (up to oneyear) and long-term loans (more than fiveyears) have increased much more sharply dur-ing the past 12 months than in the 12-monthperiod from June 2004 to May 2005. The re-corded increase in the comparatively favour-able short-term fixed-rate loans to enterprisesought also to be seen as closely connectedwith the reduction in their overdrafts (whichare not captured in the new business volumesof the interest rate statistics), whereas thelong-term loans – during a turnaround ininterest rates – are likely to have also benefit-ed from further debt restructurings fromshorter-term loans.
Up to now, new lending business with house-
holds has been driven mainly by housingloans, especially by those with a long interestfixation period. Their current slowdown sug-gests, however, that the sharp increase in vol-umes of new business since the third quarterof 2005 is likely to have also been influencedby the changes in assistance to homebuyers,the interest rate turnaround and the an-nounced increase in value added tax. In thepast 12 months, newly issued consumerloans have been only slightly higher than inthe 12-month period up to and includingMay 2005.
Irrespective of this, the recent results of the
Bank Lending Survey also point to a marginalsupply-side easing, especially in the case of
loans to enterprises. According to the sur-veyed banks, the credit standards have beeneased slightly across all maturities and sizecategories and the margins for average loanshave been lowered again somewhat. In con-trast to this, however, the margins for morerisky exposures are still increasing slightly.Overall, however, the risk to banks that is as-sociated with granting loans to enterprisesappears to have declined of late. At least, thenumber of cumulative corporate insolvenciesover 12 months and the associated exposureamounts have been falling for well over oneand a half years.
At the same time, the institutions participat-
ing in the survey have reported a slight up-turn in loan demand since the third quarter of2005. In the case of loans to enterprises, thiswas initially attributed mainly to mergers,takeovers and corporate restructuring. In themeantime, debt restructuring and increasedfinancing needs owing to greater fixed invest-ment, larger inventories and more operatingmaterials have contributed to a slight increasein demand. By contrast, the relaxed liquidityconditions and the sustained improvement inprofitability owing, in particular, to exportscontinue, by themselves, to have a dampen-ing impact on the demand for corporateloans.
The banks rate households’ demand for loans
as somewhat more restrained than that ofenterprises. In the case of housing loans, thebanks report that it was only at the end of2005 that a marked rise in demand occurredowing to anticipatory effects linked to the im-

In addition to the average interest rates of the
individual loan categories, the correspondingbusiness volumes of the banks (MFIs) for bothoutstanding amounts and new business arerecorded and/or extrapolated for the Germancontribution to the euro-area MFI interestrate statistics. These volume data serve pri-marily to calculate the euro-area interestrates, which are determined as a volume-weighted average of the corresponding na-tional rates.
1
This means that another indicator for assess-ing credit developments in Germany is avail-able, the information content of which islooked at in more detail below. For this pur-pose, the new business volumes taken fromthe interest rate statistics are compared withchanges in loans taken from the monthly bal-ance sheet statistics. The latter are the out-come of new lending and repayments. It is notpossible to differentiate between new lendingand repayments in this context. By contrast,the data from the interest rate statistics relatesolely to new business.
Furthermore, discrepancies between the inter-
est rate statistics and the balance sheet statis-tics in the reporting of credit developments inGermany can result from the different report-
ing schemes of the two sets of statistics.
– For example, German banks report their
entire lending business with domestic non-banks to the balance sheet statistics,whereas the interest rate statistics solelycomprise loans to non-financial corpor-ations and households domiciled in theeuro area. In particular, therefore, they donot capture credit relationships betweenbanks and insurance corporations or otherfinancial intermediaries.
2
– Moreover, the monthly balance sheet statis-
tics include foreign-currency loans grantedby German banks to domestic non-banks,whereas the interest rate statistics are limit-ed to euro loans.
Lending by German banks is therefore cap-
tured more broadly in the balance sheet statis-tics than in the interest rate statistics.
Unlike the balance sheet statistics, the interest
rate statistics are not census but sample statis-tics.
3Consequently, the uncertainty customar-
ily associated with estimated values has to betaken into consideration when interpreting

rate statistics in general, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2004), The newMFI interest rate statistics – methodology for collecting the Germandata, Monthly Report, January, pp 45-59. — 2In addition to this,
there are minor differences in the sectoral definition. Thus in theinterest rate statistics, non-profit institutions are assigned to thehousehold sector, whereas in the balance sheet statistics they are re-corded as a separate sector. — 3The group of banks reporting com-prises some 200 institutions, which were selected as a representative

Finally, the largest institutions of each stratum were selected. —4This type of debt restructuring is likely to have been carried out on
a larger scale in the low interest rate environment which has pre-vailed in recent years, especially in the corporate sector. Short-term

27the volumes of new business extrapolated for
Germany using the Horvitz-Thompson estima-tor.
In addition, the underlying purpose of the
interest rate statistics, namely to provide anassessment of the contractually agreed bankterms applicable at the reporting date, resultsin a number of other effects.
– First, new lending is defined in the MFI
interest rate statistics in such a way that theentire credit volume is recorded at the timethe contract is concluded, whereas only thefunds actually drawn down by borrowersare recorded in the balance sheet statistics.Therefore, the new lending business num-bers shown in the interest rate statisticsmay have a certain leading indicator prop-erty.
– Second, this focus of the interest rate statis-
tics also embraces (non-automatic) loan ex-tensions after the period of rate fixationhas expired, in which new terms are agreedbut which does not entail a flow of fundsto non-banks. A sharp increase in new lend-ing recorded may thus be caused by the ex-piry of the period of rate fixation of exist-ing loan contracts and the agreement of
new terms for the amounts still outstand-ing, without the banks actually disbursingadditional funds. For example, debt re-structuring from, say, short-term into long-er-term maturities when an interest raterise is expected is classified as new lendingand likewise contributes to the systematicoverestimation of the flow of funds to theprivate sector resulting from the new lend-ing business volumes in the interest ratestatistics.
4
Finally, it should be noted that, for methodo-logical reasons, bank overdrafts to non-finan-cial corporations and households cannot beincluded in the analysis of business volumes.
5
The fact that bank overdrafts have been mas-sively reduced for some time now curbs creditgrowth, although this is not reflected in thefigures for new lending business.
All in all, therefore, using new lending busi-
ness from the interest rate statistics as an indi-cator of the flow of funds to the private non-bank sector in the context of monetary policyanalysis appears problematic.
loans to non-financial corporations, at least, have been reduced at an
annual rate of 6% over the past four years, whereas the correspond-ing longer-term loans increased by around
1/C252% per annum in the
same period. — 5Unlike the other credit categories, these are not re-
ported as the sum of the relevant new business transactions but, forreasons of practicality and similarly to the way data on outstandingamounts are reported to the interest rate statistics, they are collectedat the end of the month. Hence their change reflects the difference
resulting from new lending and repayments and therefore cannot bemeaningfully aggregated with the other categories of new lendingbusiness. For the methodology used in the MFI interest rate statistics,see Deutsche Bundesbank (2004), The new MFI interest rate statistics –methodology for collecting the German data, Monthly Report, Janu-ary, pp 45-59.

28pending discontinuation of the grant to
homebuyers. Most banks are unable to iden-tify any change in the demand for credit inthe case of consumer loans either. Overall,there are roughly just as many banks report-ing slightly rising demand as there are onesreporting a slight fall.
Summary
The sluggish growth in lending in Germany
over the past few years can generally be ex-plained quite well in terms of developmentsin the German economy as a whole. Besidessluggish economic performance, enterprises’low propensity to invest and weak demandfor housing construction have contributed tothe domestic private sector’s low demand forloans. Moreover, households have been re-strained in their consumption, which has also
dampened their demand for loans.
Even so, the banks, too, have been tightening
their lending conditions somewhat in the pastfew years, although this process has nowcome to a standstill. The conditions were re-laxed again slightly at the end of the periodunder review. Lending to domestic enter-prises and households has accelerated some-what, with the rise in loans in the past fewquarters increasingly being sustained byshort-term transactions between banks andnon-monetary financial institutions (reverserepo transactions) that did not directly involveany flow of funds to the private sector. Ac-cordingly, the increase in loans to non-financial corporations and households wassomewhat smaller than that in loans to thedomestic private non-bank sector as a whole.

29State government
finances in GermanyEven though circumstances vary greatly
from one Federal state to the next, theoverall situation of state government fi-nances is still extremely precarious. Al-though the deficits have fallen again re-cently after reaching record highs in2003, many states are overshooting theconstitutional borrowing limits by a con-siderable amount or are observing themonly formally by means of asset disposalsor the misapplication of central govern-ment funds earmarked for infrastruc-tural reconstructio n in eastern Germany.
Three states believe that they will not beable to solve their financial problems bythemselves in the medium term, either,a n dh a v ef i l e da na c t i o nf o ra i df r o mthe other government budgets. The cur-rent budgetary rules have not managedto prevent the critical status of manybudgets. The binding nature of the ra-ther generous borrowing ceilings ap-pears limited given the – in some casesseverely imbalanced – financial situationof state government. Moreover, stategovernment now faces major chal-lenges, not least because of the foresee-able strains caused b y rising expenditure
on pensions or the reduction of Federalgrants to the east German states. It istherefore imperative that the incentivesand institutional framework for soundpublic finances be improved perceptibly.Stricter budgetary rules, an effectivebudgetary surveilla nce procedure and
greater individual r esponsibility – also
with regard to taxation – could contrib-ute towards such an improvement.

30Overall trend in state government
finances
All in all, the situation of state government fi-
nances remains extremely precarious despitethe fact that the deficits have declined recent-ly. The trend since 2000 mirrors the under-lying pattern in general government financesin Germany.
1After the state government def-
icits had declined significantly to just over 38
billion or 31/C252% of expenditure at the end of
the 1990s,2partly owing to the favourable
cyclical development and an unusually highincrease in profit-related taxes, they increasedvery sharply after 2000 (see table on page 33concerning the developments describedbelow). In 2001, the previous record high of1996 was surpassed slightly, with the deficitedging up to 324
1/C252billion. By 2003, there
had been a further increase to 3301/C252billion
or just over 111/C252% of expenditure. While the
deficits declined to 324 billion in 2004, hardly
any further progress was achieved last year.Thus, state government debt has grown byroughly 40% in the past five years, reaching3482 billion at year-end 2005. The debt ratio
to the annual volume of expenditure, whichwas 140% in 2000, rose to 185%.
The sharp rise in the deficits, which persisted
into 2003, was accompanied by a weak rev-enue trend. Total revenue in 2005 was downby34 billion or just over 1
1/C252% on the level in
2000. This was largely due to the develop-ment in tax receipts. Having reached an ex-ceptionally high level in 2000, in the periodfrom 2001 to 2003 they fell by a total of 314
billion or 8% and rose only slightly in the fol-lowing period. In addition to the comprehen-sive income tax cuts – which were also
approved by state government in the Bundes-rat –, the weak overall economic growth ofthe previous years (including the muted de-velopment in gross wages and salaries) andsharp fluctuations in profit-related taxes tooktheir toll.
A slight counterweight was provided by rev-
enue from business activities which, followingmuted development in the preceding years,shot up by 32
1/C252billion last year due to exten-
sive subsidy repayments by Landesbanks.However, this was a one-off effect that has, inany case, been more or less offset by addition-al expenditure on recapitalisation. Further-more, state government budgets have beenincreasingly financed by asset disposals. Pro-ceeds from loan repayments and sales of par-ticipating interests and tangible assets rosefrom 33 billion in 2000 to 35 billion at the lat-
est count. There was little change in transfersfrom other levels of government. The slightincrease to 343
1/C252billion is largely due to the
rise in funds received from the EU. By con-trast, transfers from central governmentdropped slightly in the period as a whole to335
1/C252billion at the end of 2005. Declining
supplementary Federal grants were offset, inparticular, by growing receipts in connectionwith the Hartz IV labour market reform; how-ever, this revenue has to be forwarded to local

32government. On balance, the development in
transfers placed a strain on state government.
Since 2000, spending by state government
has grown by a total of 31/C252%, around 1 per-
centage point of which is due to the one-offburden from the recapitalisation of the Land-esbanks in 2005. While current expenditureincreased by 6%, investment expenditure (in-cluding investment grants to local govern-ment, but excluding the recapitalisation ofthe Landesbanks) declined significantly by al-most 15%. When analysing the rise in ex-penditure, it should be borne in mind thatcertain factors which curbed the revenuetrend concurrently contributed to the re-strained growth in expenditure. For example,moderate wage developments across theboard were also reflected in public sector payand civil servant pension increases. Transfers
to local government, which are linked to taxreceipts, likewise fell in consequence of thedecline in tax revenue. The analysis of stategovernment’s budget ratios is complicated bythe fact that the spin-off of entities and activ-ities from the core budgets significantly af-fects the development of expenditure andrevenue as a whole and, above all, in specificcategories (see box on page 33).
Personnel expenditure constitutes the largest
expenditure item in the state governmentbudgets. At 397 billion last year, it accounted
for 37
1/C252% of total expenditure and was
21/C252% above the level in 2000 (see the chart
on this page). The rise in spending on civil ser-vants’ (non-contributory) pensions andhealthcare subsidies, at 21
1/C252%, was much
greater. The main reason for this was thesharp rise in the number of pension recipi-ents, which went up by one-sixth. By con-trast, expenditure on current employees hasbeen sharply restrained in the past few years.The government’s financial statistics evenshow a decline of just over 2% in expenditurein 2005 vis-/C224-vis 2000. Although cuts in holi-day and Christmas bonuses for civil servants(Beamte) and new employees with non-civil
servant status (Tarifbesch/C228ftigte), as well as a
reduction in the overall number of employeesthrough staff cuts, have provided some costrelief, the absolute decline in expenditure isprimarily the result of outsourcing entitiessuch as universities and enterprises from stategovernment budgets.
State government transfers to other levels of
government are another major cost item. InYear-on-year change

33Outsourcing of service entities from the core budgets
The strict provisions contained in both budgetary and
civil service legislation are often criticised as excessivelyrestricting flexibility and efficiency in the provision of pub-lic services. Since a complete withdrawal of governmentfrom many operational areas is rejected and may seemonly partly feasible in the short term given existing struc-tures, the outsourcing of service entities from the corebudgets is suggested as a way of improving cost-effective-ness.
A case in point is the management of buildings and real es-
tate. If these are made available to public authorities byoutsourced entities for a fee, the total costs could be lowerthan when the provision of services is managed internally.A key consideration in this context seems to be that invoi-cing for services provided carries an incentive to criticallyassess the extent to which the services are really neededand to leave units no longer needed to other demanders.In the case of higher education, on the other hand, moreweight is placed on autonomy in the use of funds. Univer-sities that are completely incorporated into the state gov-ernment accounts are given extensive instructions as tohow they are to apply the funds. By contrast, if universitiesare outsourced and financed by means of a global budgetprovided by the state government, they can enjoy moreautonomy in their management.
Outsourcing also makes it easier for state government to
comply with expenditure ceilings if the outsourced entitiesgenerate own revenue that is then no longer channelledthrough the state government budget. Instead of the over-all expenditure of these institutions, only a corresponding-ly smaller need for grants is disclosed in the budget. Hence,outsourcing may be used to show the expenditure trend ina more favourable light. But an even more problematicfeature in this context is authorising outsourced entities toborrow. In this case, the core budgets provide only a limit-ed picture of the true financial situation of state govern-ment. This option has indeed been exercised on some occa-sions in the past. For example, the Budget Acts of North-Rhine Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate allow con-struction and real estate enterprises as well as a road con-struction enterprise to finance expenditure by incurringdebt. The Budget Act of Baden-W/C252rttemberg authorisesan outsourced entity to pre-fund road construction ex-penditure of the state government by borrowing up to apre-defined limit. Bremen maintains a general debt ser-vicing fund for the pre-funding of state government ex-penditure with an annual borrowing authorisation. As isthe case in Hamburg, Bremen also has an off-budget spe-cial fund that is allowed to finance harbour constructionwork by loans. By contrast, outsourced universities haveevidently been authorised to take out loans only in veryisolated cases to date, and subject to the condition thatdebt servicing must be assured.Outsourcing deficits to subsidiary budgets is not a substi-
tute for fiscal consolidation and must therefore be viewedvery critically, not least against the background of thebudget principles of clarity and completeness. Borrowingof outsourced entities carries the risk that the constitution-al borrowing limits may ultimately prove completely inef-fective if these entities incur losses which are in the endbeing assumed by government in addition to the regularnew borrowing or are debt-financed by additional capitalinjections booked as investments.
Against the backdrop of stagnating revenue and the con-
straints imposed by civil service legislation and collective la-bour agreements in the public sector, it is imperative thatstate government curbs its personnel expenditure, whichcurrently accounts on average for almost 40% of its overallexpenditure. However, whenever a state government out-sources certain services, it retains ultimate responsibilityfor their financing and, moreover, the labour and payregulations governing public sector employees continue toapply initially, so that the possibilities for rapidly loweringcosts are placed within narrow bounds. Personnel expend-iture and other operating expenditure as well as invest-ment is then just reclassified in the state governmentbudgets as grants to enterprises.
Outsourcing considerably complicates a comparison of
budget data over time as well as among the state govern-ments. For the financial years 2001 to 2004, the FederalMinistry of Finance indicates outsourcing of personnel ex-penditure of over 52
1/C252billion in the overviews of the final
state government budgets outturns. In 2005 alone, thisoutsourcing effect (partly in connection with transferringcertain tasks to local government) could have amounted toover 51 billion. Adjusted for this, average annual personnel
expenditure growth (including expenditure on pensions)from 2001 to 2005 was not
1/C252%, but rather almost 11/C252%. In
2006, state governments are apparently making evengreater use of outsourcing. The effects on the recordedamount of other operating expenditure, however, are notclear-cut because rents or service charges are sometimespaid to the outsourced entities, which could outweigh therespective direct curbing impact of the outsourcing. Fixedcapital expenditure recorded in the core budgets islowered by outsourcing. In the year when construction ser-vices in Rhineland-Palatinate were outsourced, an especial-ly strong impact was noted on the fixed capital expend-iture of that state government with a decrease by almostthree-fifths. Aggregating the figures of all state govern-ments, outsourcing probably contributed to about one-fifth of the decrease in construction investment. However,to the extent that investment grants are subsequently paidto the outsourced entity, the constitutional borrowinglimits in the budget are not tightened. Fixed capital ex-penditure is then simply replaced by grants.

342005, they accounted for 3591/C252billion or al-
most 23% of expenditure. This amounts to arise of just over 33 billion on the level in
2000. Local government received 354 billion
of this, which was 32 billion more than in
2000. However, this rise was due entirely tothe Hartz IV reform. In addition to forwardingFederal funds, state government agreed thatthe savings which it made on housing allow-ances as a result of this reform would bepassed on to local government in the form ofhigher transfers. Thus, last year a total of ap-proximately 35 billion should have been
transferred to local government in connec-tion with this. Excluding this Hartz IV effect,transfers to local government have fallen con-siderably.
As far as its interest expenditure is concerned,
state government benefited from the favour-able financing conditions in the capital mar-kets. If interest expenditure is measuredagainst the debt level at the end of the previ-ous year, the average rate of interest paid in2005, at just over 4
1/C252%, was roughly 1 per-
centage point or almost one-fifth down onthe level in 2000. However, this was accom-panied by a notable increase in the volume ofdebt. Overall, state government’s interestcosts have grown by nearly 10% since 2000to321 billion or 8% of total expenditure.
Current transfers to households and enter-prises rose even more sharply by 14%. It istrue that, owing to decreased expenditure onhousing allowance in consequence of theHartz IV reform, payments to householdswere 31 billion less in 2005 than in 2000.
However, transfers to enterprises increasedby just over 40% during this period to almost321 billion, not least as a result of spin-offs.
More than half of this increase is likely to bedue simply to the fact that personnel expend-iture was replaced by grants to the out-sourced universities and institutions.
State government’s investment in non-
financial assets declined continuously. In2005, at 6
1/C252billion, it was down by 32 billion
on the level in 2000. In addition to the cutsmade to limit the deficits, this also reflects thespin-off of construction and real estate enter-prises, whose investments are no longer cap-tured in the state government budgets. Therewas also a significant reduction totalling 33
1/C252
billion in investment grants to enterprises and
in loans. By contrast, there were sharp fluctu-ations in the acquisition of participating inter-ests.
3After adjustment for special effects, the
level has remained practically unchanged.Thus, on balance, there was a notable declinein investments.

36the fiscal balances recorded in the cash statis-
tics shows that Saxony recorded a surplus lastyear and that Bavaria’s deficit remained verylimited. In North Rhine-Westphalia, Saxony-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein and, above all, inSaarland, the per capita deficit was well
above average. In the city-states Berlin andespecially Bremen, the situation was evenmore precarious. While the divergences ininterest expenditure arising from the differentdebt levels explain a large part of the discrep-ancies, they were not the only factor. A some-what different picture is presented if the def-icits are adjusted for acquisitions and sales ofassets (including loans) and the repayment ofLandesbank subsidies in some states in orderto factor out possible effects that may ob-scure the structural budgetary position (seetable on page 35 and chart on page 37).After adjustment, the fiscal balance is poorer,in particular, in Hamburg, Hesse andRhineland-Palatinate, while certain improve-ments can be seen, above all, in Berlin,North-Rhine/Westphalia and eastern Ger-many.
Past fiscal policy is reflected in the debt levels
of the individual states. Major divergencescan be seen here, too. The spread rangedfrom 33,200 per capita in Bavaria to almost
319,000 in Bremen. While the liabilities of
Bavaria, Saxony and Baden-W/C252rttembergwere considerably more than one-third belowthe state government average, indebtednessin all three city-states was more than two-thirds above the average. Among the non-city states, Saarland and Saxony-Anhalt ex-ceeded this average by as much as one-third.Recent years have witnessed a further in-
crease in the spread of debt levels.
A comparison of (per capita) total revenue
and expenditure across state government isfar from straightforward. For example, pay-ments made under the revenue-sharingscheme do not represent “real” expenditure-effective items in the state concerned. Thus,in this comparison, these payments havebeen subtracted from the revenue and ex-penditure figures shown in the cash statistics.In addition, state and local government haveto varying degrees spun off entities which arepartly financed by fees from their corebudgets. As well as a possible impact on thetotal revenue and expenditure recorded in thebudgets, this may lead to significant changesin the individual expenditure categories,which makes a comparison difficult. In orderto neutralise as far as possible the effect ontotal revenue and expenditure, the remainingreceipts from fees are shown net, ie deductedfrom the total revenue and expenditure ofthe individual states.
5Asset acquisitions (in-
cluding loans granted), which may mask thestructural burden of expenditure, have alsobeen factored out of total expenditure. Simi-larly, comparable proceeds from asset dis-posals have been factored out of revenue.
On the revenue side it becomes clear that the
state government revenue-sharing schemesignificantly reduces differences with regardto tax revenue, whereas substantial differ-ences in the states’ capacity to raise taxesfrom regional activities remain. After includ-

38ing receipts from the revenue-sharing scheme
and from supplementary Federal grants, thecity-states and the east German states record-ed tax-related revenue significantly above theaverage in 2005. This is due mainly to thehigher population weighting of the city-statesin the revenue-sharing scheme and to thespecial supplementary Federal grants (seetable on this page). This also translated intoabove-average levels of total revenue.
On the expenditure side, considerably higher
per capita figures were recorded for current
expenditure (excluding payments under therevenue-sharing scheme and after deductionof receipts from fees) especially in the city-states and – with the exception of Saxony –the east German states (see table on page 35and chart on page 39). In the city-states, per-sonnel expenditure was more than one-sixth
above average, and the other expenditureitems exceeded the average by an even great-er degree. While the west German states re-corded high outlays for civil servant pensions,above-average expenditure on current staffwas incurred in eastern Germany. Despitelower pay levels, their expenditure was 8%higher on average than in the west Germannon-city states. Higher expenditure was alsoincurred in respect of transfers to other publicauthorities – including transfers for specialand supplementary pension benefits for cer-tain categories of retired employees in theformer German Democratic Republic – andgrants to enterprises, in particular. Moreover,there was a substantial spread within the indi-vidual state groups.

40current expenditure in Saxony was roughly
one-eighth less than in Mecklenburg-WesternPomerania and Saxony-Anhalt (all easternstates). In North-Rhine/Westphalia and Hesseit was more than 15% higher than in Bavariaand Rhineland-Palatinate (all western states).Investment in non-financial assets, most ofwhich is undertaken by local government butis considerably dependent on transfers fromstate government, was clearly higher in theeast German states, especially in Saxony.Among the west German states, investmentin non-financial assets was highest in Bavaria.Berlin spent by far the least on non-financialassets – at barely more than one-third of thenationwide average.
Compliance with the constitutional
borrowing limits
There is a widespread consensus concerning
the need for strict legal limits on governmentborrowing, especially given the current polit-ical incentives for excessive use of this instru-ment by government and the negative conse-quences thereof. In Germany, both the Fed-eral constitution (Article 115 of the Basic Law–Grundgesetz ) and those of the individual
states follow the golden rule that credit maybe taken out essentially only to finance in-vestments. The underlying aim of this rule isto ensure that the generation which profitsfrom government spending must also take re-sponsibility for financing it. However, thisgolden rule overlooks, among other things,the fact that future generations are not onlyburdened by explicit borrowings but also byimplicit liabilities such as pension entitle-ments, for example. Moreover, the underlying
concept – that borrowing must be linked tothe formation of assets – is not legally imple-mented in a consistent manner. For example,when determining the borrowing limit, pro-ceeds from asset disposals and loan repay-ments are not deducted from investmentseven though they constitute disinvestments.Decreases in the value of assets as a result ofdepreciation are not deducted either. Thismakes it possible to increase the debt leveleven with stagnating or falling assets.
6Fur-
thermore, certain investment expendituresuch as investment grants, do not constitutegrowth in the state’s assets. Moreover, it alsoappears to be a problem that the constitu-tional borrowing limits are construed as bind-ing only for budget planning but not forbudget implementation.
Article 115 (1) second sentence of the Basic
Law, which specifies the borrowing limits forcentral government, does not apply directlyto state government budgets. However, thestate government constitutions contain provi-sions which largely match the content of cur-rent Federal law. While there are sometimesdeviations in the definition of exceptional cir-cumstances justifying increased borrowing,Article 109 (2) of the Basic Law lays down aminimum norm by binding the budgets tothe requirements of overall economic equilib-rium.
6The courts of auditors also highlight these issues. See,
for example, the findings of the conference of the presi-
dents of the courts of auditors of central and state gov-
ernment of 7-9 May 2001. See also Deutsche Bundes-
bank, Deficit-limiting budgetary rules and a national

41State governments vary in terms of the strict-
ness with which they enforce the relevantconstitutional provisions for limiting new bor-rowing. When determining the upper limitsfor new borrowing, usually only the invest-ments financed by the state government’sown funds are considered. These are general-ly defined as the expenditure recorded in theclassification table under the main categories7 (construction investment) and 8 (other ex-penditure on investment and investment-promoting measures) less funds collectedunder group 33 (investment grants receivedfrom other public authorities) and group 34(contributions and other investment subsid-ies). However, there is no statutory obligationto deduct these items. Thus, the state of Ber-lin, for example, did not deduct investmentrevenue when calculating its borrowing limit.Similarly, practices in some states, such asusing current Federal grants for regional rail-ways to a significant degree for investmentpurposes and, thus, raising the borrowingceiling by means of pre-financed expenditure,also led to an improper expansion of the bor-rowing limits.
7By contrast, in Hesse a stricter
interpretation of investment expenditure isapplied than in the rest of the country. In thisstate, extensive investment grants paid withinthe framework of the tax-revenue-sharing ar-rangement with local government may notbe used to justify borrowing.
In recent years the borrowing limits defined
on the basis of the classification table havebeen exceeded by many states, in some casessignificantly (see, for example, the table onpage 42 regarding the budget estimates for2005 and 2006). The 2005 budgets of Berlin,Bremen, Hesse, Lower Saxony, North-Rhine/
Westphalia, Saarland and Schleswig-Holsteinforesaw an overshooting of the state-specificupper limits. Although Hesse managed to ob-serve the borrowing limit in the course of im-plementing its budget, this was largely owingto extensive one-off proceeds from the saleof real estate. Similarly, Rhineland-Palatinateand the payer states within the revenue-sharing scheme, Baden-W/C252rttemberg andHamburg, had recourse to sizeable asset dis-posals to observe their borrowing ceilings.While the east German states stayed withintheir constitutional borrowing limits, this wasfacilitated to a great degree by funds fromcentral government to overcome the conse-quences of German partition (see box onpages 48 and 49). If one-off proceeds andspecial supplementary Federal grants to theeast German states are factored out, onlyBavaria remained clearly within the constitu-tional upper limits for new borrowing lastyear. This confirms the exceptionally precar-ious nature of the budgetary situation since2002.
In recent years, there have been a number of
court cases examining whether certainbudget acts breach the constitution. Thecourt rulings have, however, ultimately hadvery little impact on budgetary policy. For ex-ample, in 2003 the budgetary acts of North-Rhine/Westphalia for 2001 and 2002 weresubsequently found to have breached theconstitution because they foresaw the liquid-ation of loan-financed reserves in order to ob-

43serve the borrowing limits. Transactions of a
very similar nature were also foreseen inHamburg, Hesse, Lower Saxony andSchleswig-Holstein in 2001. The practicalconsequences of the ruling were limited asthe reserves had been largely exhausted bythat time. The State Constitutional Court ofMecklenburg-Western Pomerania found thatthe budgetary acts for 2003 to 2005breached the constitution. However, this wasmainly due to formal errors. While the struc-tural underfunding was criticised, this was ul-timately not a decisive factor. In its judgmentdelivered in December 2005 on the 2002supplementary budget, the ConstitutionalCourt of Hesse found that the high borrow-ing authorisation did not constitute a breachof the constitution. Accordingly, in certain cir-cumstances, under a supplementary budgetan unexpected shortfall may be pluggedusing borrowed funds. However, Hesse alsoexceeded the borrowing limit in the followingyears. Proceedings before the Federal Consti-tutional Court concerning the Schleswig-Holstein 2003 supplementary budget weredismissed because the plaintiffs withdrewtheir case after the election of a new govern-ment in 2005.
In the case of Berlin, the 2002 and 2003
budgetary acts were judged to be in breachof the constitution. The State ConstitutionalCourt found that there was insufficient evi-dence to support the claim that an overshoot-ing of the upper borrowing limit was neces-sary in order to avert a disruption to the over-all economic equilibrium. However, the courtgranted the state the option of claiming itfaced serious budgetary hardship and thencontinuing to overshoot the borrowing limit
once all potential cuts had been made. Berlinhas exercised this option for its subsequentbudgets even though doubts have beenraised as to whether it is justified in doing so(see box on page 44). Besides Berlin, Bremenand Saarland – whose aid for amortisation oftheir excessive debts (which had amountedaltogether to roughly 315 billion up to the
end of 2004) expired after 11 years – filed ac-tions with the Federal Constitutional Courtfor further special supplementary Federalgrants on the grounds of ongoing drasticunderfunding of their budgets. Such applica-tions should be examined very critically giventhe very strained budgetary situation of cen-tral government and most of the other stategovernments and in view of the extremelyworrying incentive effect on future fiscal dis-cipline at state government level.
Lower Saxony, North-Rhine/Westphalia and
Schleswig-Holstein, whose medium-term fi-nancial plans foresee an overshooting of theborrowing limits for several more years, donot invoke the argument of acute budgetaryhardship. Instead, the introductory state-ments to their draft budgets declare that ob-servance of the borrowing limits pursuant tostate constitutional law is “objectively impos-sible”, at least in the short term, given otherobligations of similar priority. For all that, theextent of the budget relief measures (for ex-ample, cuts in bonus payments to state em-ployees) varies significantly from one state tothe next.

44Berlin’s action for a declaratory judgment confirming the existence
of extreme budgetary hardship
Three years ago, the state of Berlin commenced pro-
ceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court (Bun-
desverfassungsgericht) for a declaratory judgment con-
firming the existence of extreme budgetary hardshipsince 2002 and claiming the award of substantial sup-plementary Federal grants for the purposes of budgetconsolidation as the state sees itself unable to rectifythe budgetary crisis – which it believes to have arisenthrough no fault of its own – by itself. The hearing washeld before the Federal Constitutional Court in Karls-ruhe at the end of April 2006. A judgment is expectedbefore the end of the year.
The states of Bremen and Saarland submitted similar
applications at the end of the 1980s. In 1992, the Fed-eral Constitutional Court allowed these petitions andput the Federal Government under an obligation toprovide extensive financial assistance.
1This assistance
expired in 2004. In delivering its judgment, the Courtat the time compared the budgetary positions of thetwo states with the average position of all the states.The net borrowing requirement to expenditure ratio
2
and the ratio of interest to tax revenue3played a par-
ticularly important role in this comparison. Based onthe observation that the former was twice as high inthese two states and the latter was significantly higherthan the benchmark figure, extreme budgetary hard-ship was assumed to exist and an obligation on thepart of all other members of the German federation toprovide financial assistance was declared. In return, thetwo states had to prove to the Financial PlanningCouncil (Finanzplanungsrat) that they were endeav-
ouring to keep the increase in their current expend-iture
1/C252percentage point below the Council-agreed
ceiling for such increases in all states. Furthermore, theFederal legislator was instructed – after examining thepossibilities highlighted by the Federal ConstitutionalCourt – to set in place arrangements which both coun-teract the emergence of budgetary hardship and caneliminate an emergency situation if one should occur.The legislator has failed to fulfil this mandate in the14 years following delivery of the judgment, however.The Federal Constitutional Court’s renewed dealingswith this set of issues could now intensify the pressureto create clear rules to prevent budgetary crises.There is a key difference between the situation at that
time and the current situation: whereas only the statesof Saarland and Bremen were encountering continu-ous difficulties with the constitutional borrowing limitsat the end of the 1980s, today most of the states andeven the Federal Government are facing such seriousstructural financing problems. Nevertheless, there arestill marked differences in the size of the budget def-icits which, in the petitioners’ view, could establish anobligation to assist Berlin (but probably also Bremenand Saarland). However, if virtually all levels of govern-ment are in such a difficult situation and are to be bur-dened further owing to the obligation to provide fi-nancial assistance, particularly good reasons for doingso must be given.
4Against this background, too, it is
essential that the states in question have themselvesmade all possible efforts to avert and alleviate extremebudgetary hardship.
It is disputed whether this has occurred in Berlin’s case.
The roots of Berlin’s financial crisis lie in the restructur-ing of its budget financing following German reunifica-tion. The substantial Federal aid granted to the previ-ously isolated state was phased out after four years inthe expectation that the reunified capital city wouldgrow rapidly and was replaced only partially by pay-ments from the state government revenue-sharingscheme. Both economic and demographic develop-ments remained exceedingly weak, however. Themuch-needed budgetary adjustment was not initiatedin time and was not sufficiently extensive. As a result,the state’s debt level was five times higher at the end of2005 than it had been in 1991 and its budgetary leewaycontinued to dwindle. Although the current state gov-ernment points out that it has noticeably reduced inter-est-adjusted expenditure per capita in comparison with
the 1995 level not least through civil service cuts andtermination of housing construction assistance, this pri-mary expenditure is still structurally higher (more than5%) than that of the economically strong state of Ham-burg. In general, it seems questionable whether themaintenance of an above-average supply of public ser-vices can be reconciled with a claim for financial assist-ance from all other members of the German federationin an extreme emergency. On the revenue side, too, itshould be examined whether all potential capacitiesare being resolutely utilised to the full.

45filed by the former Bundestag opposition par-
ties concerning the 2004 Federal Budget Actis particularly important. This could result in atightening of the budgetary rules that wouldin future prevent any serious structural under-funding of budgets as is evident in somecases at present. The 1989 decision, which isoften referred to in judgments by state consti-tutional courts, was only a small step in thisdirection. The decision called for more exten-sive justification for overshooting the borrow-ing limits; however, this has so far proved tobe a largely ineffective hurdle.
Outlook:
marked need for fiscal consolidation
State government’s financial plans envisage a
significant reduction in deficits in the comingyears. The recently agreed tax increases pro-vide a better foundation for these plans. Ac-cording to the most recent tax estimate, stategovernment’s tax revenue will go up by 3
1/C254%
on average in each of the next four years as aresult. Pursuant to the agreements reached inthe Financial Planning Council, the averageannual growth in expenditure is to be restrict-ed to 1% in this period, resulting in notableconsolidation. The medium-term expendituregrowth of central, state and local govern-ment must remain around 2 percentagepoints below revenue growth, not least inorder to fulfil the minimum criterion of theEuropean Stability and Growth Pact, ie annualstructural deficit reduction of at least
1/C252%o f
GDP . However, this will require considerableeffort on the part of state government assome expenditure categories (interest ex-penditure, civil servant pensions) will increase
automatically by far more than 1% per yearunless additional fiscal consolidation meas-ures are taken. Even if state government as awhole manages to reduce the deficit asplanned, some of the states are likely to failstructurally to meet the stipulated borrowingceilings right up to the end of the current fi-nancial planning period. The Budget Prin-ciples Act lays down the objective of a budgetwith no new net borrowing. So far, only Bav-aria, whose budget regulations make this arequirement as of 2006, has managed toachieve this. Saxony is, however, already closeto achieving this objective. As far as the otherstates are concerned, it remains to be seenwhether the target paths, which extend intothe next decade, really can be kept to.
The expected sharp growth in expenditure on
civil servant pensions will prove a major finan-cial burden for state government. In additionto a further rise in the life expectancy of re-tirees, another major factor is the foreseeableincrease in the number of pension recipientsowing to a recruitment boom that extendedwell into the 1970s. Central government’smost recent civil servant pension report from2005 identifies sharp growth in related ex-penditure – from 316
1/C252billion in 2003 to
3471/C252billion in 2030.8While the second civil
servant pension report from 2001 predicted adecline in the number of pension recipientsafter 2030, the number is now expected tocontinue rising until 2040 when it will stabil-ise at almost twice the current level.Important

46The civil servant pension reserves at central
and state government level, which have beenfunded by lower pay and pension increasessince 1999 and were designed to provide re-lief during a fifteen-year peak in the pensionburden starting around 2018, will not achievethe desired objective. Further action is there-fore needed. Consequently, some states haveset up additional reserves. In Rhineland-Palatinate, an additional contribution –equivalent to up to 30% of current staff re-muneration – has been set aside for new civilservants since October 1996. This is aimed atfully financing the related future budget bur-dens so that the real total costs of the civilservants currently employed by the state aremade transparent. As a result, the costs ofstaffing decisions can be calculated with lessdistortion. According to the third civil servantpension report, Bremen, Hamburg, Hesse,North-Rhine/Westphalia and Saxony havealso set up additional pension reserves al-though only some of these are aimed at fullcost coverage. While these approaches are tobe welcomed, it should be pointed out thatreserves of this kind will bring about relief forfuture budgets only if they are not offset byincreased net borrowing. Otherwise, implicitdebt will merely be converted into explicitdebt and long-term sustainability will not im-prove. Some relief for future budgets wouldbe achieved if the cost-curbing measuresadopted for the public pension scheme wereto be applied equally to the civil servant pen-sion scheme. One particular such measure isthe increase in the official retirement age.
As they still have fewer than average civil ser-
vants, the east German states will see theirpension expenditure burden remain smaller,
even though the relative rise in expenditurewill be sharper because of their lower startingbase. The phasing-out by 2019 of the supple-mentary Federal grants under Solidarity Pact IIwill have a far greater impact on the east Ger-man states’ budgets. Given that largeamounts of these funds are currently used bymost east German states to cover current ex-penditure, considerable savings will be neces-sary to compensate for the decline withoutdramatically pushing up their deficits (see boxon pages 48 and 49).
Closing remarks
All in all, state government’s financial situ-
ation remains highly problematic. However,considerable differences can be seen be-tween the individual states despite a signifi-cant redistribution of revenue owing to thesplit allocation of turnover tax receipts andthe various levels of the revenue-sharingscheme, as well as numerous common na-tionwide requirements on the expenditureside.
Existing national budget rules have proved
ineffective. The practically uninterruptedgrowth in debt could not be prevented, themajority of the states are structurally failingto observe the constitutional borrowing limitsby a significant degree without incurring anynotable consequences in the short term, andno less than three states have filed actions forthe receipt of financial assistance from theother public authorities on the grounds ofsupposedly facing acute budgetary hardship.

47The first stage of the reform of Germany’s
federal structure, which has since beenadopted by parliament, focuses on a clearerdemarcation of responsibilities between cen-tral and state government, with the lattergaining additional room for manoeuvre onthe expenditure side, in particular, thanks tothe transfer of legislative authority for statecivil servants’ pay. At the same time, theirrights vested in the Bundesrat to influencenational legislation have been reduced. More-over, the range of cofinancing projects hasbeen narrowed and a regulation has beenagreed compelling state government to makea 35% contribution towards European finesthat might be levied in the event of an on-going excessive deficit. However, this legisla-tion does not constitute a “real” national sta-bility pact, which would significantly increasethe pressure for sound budgetary manage-ment.
The announced second stage of the reform
of the federal structure presents the oppor-tunity to make the constitutional borrowinglimits more effective, to extend internalbudgetary surveillance within the federal sys-tem and to further increase both the respon-sibility and the radius of action of the individ-ual levels of government, in particular, by re-structuring the fiscal constitution. Tighteningthe borrowing rules would appear eminentlyappropriate. This includes adjusting the verybroad definition of investment as the upperborrowing limit. Deducting asset depreciationand asset disposals from investment whencalculating the upper borrowing limit – whichthe courts of auditors are also calling for –would be an important step. Furthermore, amore rigorous pursuit of the basic objective
of a structurally close-to-balance budget,which is already anchored in the Budget Prin-ciples Act and in the European Stability andGrowth Pact, should be aimed for.
The national budgetary surveillance proced-
ure could also be strengthened. This wouldrequire greater transparency regarding finan-cial developments and planning in the individ-ual states. Along the lines of the Europeanbudgetary surveillance procedure, one possi-bility might be to produce regular harmonisedstability programmes for the individual statesand for central government and to appoint acompetent body to assess the situation andoutlook of public finances, both overall andat the individual government levels, usingvarious standardised indicators, and to obtainrecommendations for appropriate adjust-ments. In principle, the Financial PlanningCouncil (FPC) could assume an important rolehere. At present, within the forum of the FPCa discussion is generally held between centraland state government on a half-yearly basisconcerning the development of public fi-nances. Recommendations for budget plan-ning are also made. However, in the pastthese have been of very limited significance,particularly in terms of their binding effect onthe various levels of government.
9Moreover,
in the event of a serious misalignment follow-ing the overshooting of a critical limit, itmight also make sense to restrict the budget-ary autonomy of the government concerned– if the federal principle, involving the right to

48Deutsche BundesbankDevelopments in the east German states
Although the east German states ( L/C228nder ) ex-
cluding Berlin have only exceeded their constitu-
tional ceilings for net borrowing sporadically in
recent years, overall they still face major struc-
tural budgetary problems. The performance of
the region’s economy remains far below that of
western Germany. Consequently, revenues per
capita from taxes on income in the state govern-
ment budgets in eastern Germany are only just
over one-quarter of those in the west German
non-city states ( Fl/C228chenl/C228nder ), ie excluding the
city-states Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg. While
the state government revenue-sharing scheme,
including the advance equalisation in turnover
tax distribution, brings about considerable con-
vergence at state government level on the rev-
enue side, it was designed far less to even out
the below-average tax-generating power of
local government.
By contrast, the east German state governments’
current per capita expenditure exceeds the com-
parable figure for western Germany by one-
eighth, even after factoring out the (far higher)
transfers to local government. In addition to
larger current grants to households and enter-
prises, another contributory factor are the staff-
ing levels which are still higher. Progressive har-
monisation with pay levels in the west German
public sector means this will have an even
greater impact in future unless countermeasures
are taken. Moreover, pension payments will in-
crease considerably in the long term, which will
be offset only partly by a fall in special and sup-plementary pension payments to certain former
officials of the now defunct German Democratic
Republic (GDR). Furthermore, interest payments
per inhabitant in the east German non-city
states were nearly one-fifth higher than those in
the west German non-city states even though
the east German states started on an almost
debt-free basis in 1990. This trend is exacerbated
by the fact that total population figures in the
east German states are on the decline, while in
western Germany they are still growing, albeit
slightly. This puts additional pressure on the east
German states to adapt, given the associated
weakening of their regional tax-raising base and
the fact that their revenue-sharing entitlement
is determined according to the number of in-
habitants.
Yet, the impending adjustments to financial aid
measures beyond the general revenue-sharing
arrangement are more serious still. For one
thing, EU assistance for eastern Germany will be
reduced as, post-enlargement, its economy will
no longer be as weak compared with the new
EU average. Far more significant is the agree-
ment contained in Solidarity Pact II (which has
been in effect since 2005) to gradually reduce
the special supplementary Federal grants which
the east German states receive pursuant to sec-
tion 11 (3) of the Revenue-sharing Act ( Finanz-
ausgleichsgesetz ) to ease the burdens resulting
from the former partitioning of Germany, such
as the costly need to improve the infrastructure
in order to catch up with western Germany and
1In a comparison of east German states with the financially weak
west German states as well as of Berlin with Bremen and Hamburg(excluding their ports), the German Institute for Economic Research(DIW) identified an infrastructure deficit of just over 580 billion. See
D Vesper, Zum infrastrukturellen Nachholbedarf in Ostdeutschland,DIW-Wochenbericht, 20/01. It should be borne in mind, however, thatthis figure is subject to considerable valuation problems and that theimplied requirement of equal infrastructure capital per capita is con-tentious. For example, it does not appear necessary to achieve a com-
parable stock of capital in schools if, owing to the low birth rate ineastern Germany, the number of pupils is far lower. Concerning thetraffic infrastructure, reachability indicators were analysed, too.While these were far less favourable for the east German states, thedeficits are considerably mitigated when the geographical locationand population density are also taken into account.

49compensate for their local governments’ below-
average tax-revenue capacity. The funds, which
currently amount to just over 5101/C252billion an-
nually, will be cut perceptibly from the end of
the decade and cease altogether by the end of
2019. By that time, the east German states will
have received just over 5100 billion in supple-
mentary Federal grants and the infrastructural
deficits, which were calculated at the turn of the
current decade using projected values for real
capital stock per inhabitant, ought to have been
eliminated once and for all.1In addition, the
east German states were granted a second bas-
ket of additional funds worth just over 550 bil-
lion which is also likely to be paid on a gradually
declining scale, thus ratcheting up the pressure
on them to adapt.
Generally, the east German states receive the
special supplementary Federal grants in the
form of current transfers which, technically, they
are free to use as they see fit. However, since
2002, when the 531/C252billion of investment grants
awarded under the Investment Promotion Act
(Investitionsf/C246rderungsgesetz ) were converted
into current transfers, the east German states
(including Berlin) have had to submit statements
of accounts specifying how the money was used.
Besides spending it to help narrow the infra-
structure gap, which is confirmed by the fact
that (except in Berlin) their per capita invest-
ment expenditure outstrips that in comparable
west German states, the east German states
must also provide evidence that they have not fi-nanced the catching-up process via increased
borrowing.
In recent years, however, only Saxony has been
able to provide such evidence2(which also cov-
ers the local authorities with their relatively
high investment expenditure and more limited
borrowing capacity). In the other states, higher
investment was accompanied by additional bor-
rowing. This implies that – in breach of the
agreements – a far greater proportion of Soli-
darity Pact funding was used for financing cur-
rent expenditure than was necessary to achieve
the envisaged appropriate levelling-up of the
local governments’ below-par tax-revenue cap-
acity. According to provisional calculations
based on data from cash statistics, just under
two-fifths of the money granted to the east Ger-
man states (excluding Berlin) in 2005 was used
for purposes other than those intended.3This at-
tests to the marked structural under-financing
that characterises most of the eastern states’
budgets. They, like many of their counterparts in
western Germany, would be incapable of keep-
ing below the constitutional ceiling for new bor-
rowing without central government assistance.
Even factoring in the additional revenue ex-
pected to accrue from recently approved tax in-
creases, most east German states will probably
not manage in 2007 either to submit a report
showing that all central government transfers
were used as agreed. This underscores the mag-
nitude of the consolidation challenge which

The planned reform of the fiscal constitution
could also strengthen the tax autonomy ofthe individual states. The transfer of legisla-tive authority for real estate transfer taxagreed under the first stage of the reform isan initial small step in this direction. Aftergranting more extensive scope for expend-iture management, one particular option
would be to allow individual income tax sur-charges. If providing additional services forcitizens involves charging higher tax rates,there is a greater incentive to search for eco-nomic solutions and to examine more closelythe benefits and costs of revenue and ex-penditure. This might at least weaken thepresent fiscal illusion created by shifting bur-dens to other public authorities under therevenue-sharing scheme or by passing on def-icits to future tax payers.

51Derivatives and their
feedback effects on
the spot marketsDerivatives are the fastest-growing,
most dynamic segment of the modernfinancial markets. They complementspot market instruments and createnew opportunities for the transfer ofrisk among market participants. De-rivatives trading is contributing in-creasingly to price discovery on finan-cial markets.
On the other hand, derivative instru-
ments can also give rise to additionalrisks, such as counterparty risk andrisks to financial market stability. Thepresent report focuses on the latter,with regard to the potential feedbackeffects of derivatives markets on theunderlying spot markets. One exampleof such feedback is if derivatives arereplicated or hedged by buying andselling the underlying asset on the spotmarket. This can amplify price fluctu-ations through pro-cyclical purchasesand sales of the underlying asset onthe spot market.
Robust market structures are a primary
method of avoiding destabilising ef-fects. Moreover, regulatory measuressuch as price ranges or trading haltscan help to defuse crisis situations.
Derivatives include financial products such as
options, forward rate agreements, futures,certificates and swaps. The market value ofsuch derivative instruments can be derivedfrom the movement of the value of the

52underlying asset (eg bonds, stocks, commod-
ities) on which they are based.
Derivatives are traded either in a standardised
form (eg exchange-traded futures) or directlybetween the contractual parties, ie “over thecounter” (OTC). The most important ex-changes for organised derivatives tradingworldwide are the German-Swiss futures andoptions exchange EUREX, the UK’s Inter-national Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE),and the US financial and commodities ex-changes Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) andChicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).
Potential incentives for derivatives trading in-
clude deriving disproportionate benefit fromthe price movement of the underlying assetfor just a relatively small capital input orprofiting from falling prices. On the otherhand, derivatives are also used to hedgeagainst fluctuations in the price of the under-lying asset.
Trade in derivatives has increased sharply in
the past two decades. It was initially focusedon equities and commodities markets; thestrategies tested in those markets were sub-sequently also applied to interest rate risk andexchange rates. Credit derivatives, withwhich credit risk can be decoupled from theunderlying credit transaction and traded sep-arately or created from scratch, are a relative-ly new segment.
According to figures from the Bank for Inter-
national Settlements (BIS), the nominal valueof all OTC derivatives contracts outstandingworldwide (excluding credit derivatives) hasroughly tripled between 2000 and 2005,
from US$95 trillion to US$285 trillion. In it-self, the nominal contract volume is not verymeaningful, as the risk incurred by marketplayers is measured in terms of their net pos-itions, which make up a small percentage ofthe aggregate contract volume. However, thetrend in the total outstanding contract vol-ume provides an impression of the rapid dy-namics of the market for derivatives. Brokendown by individual instruments, around 71%of outstanding derivatives are swaps, 16%are options and 13% are forward and futurescontracts.
A swap is a contractual agreement to ex-
change, or swap, assets or payment obliga-tions. Foreign exchange swaps, therefore, arethe simultaneous spot sale and forward pur-chase of foreign currency or the simultaneousspot purchase and forward sale of foreign cur-rency. The most important category of swapsis the interest rate swap, which is the ex-change of fixed and variable-rate interest pay-ments based on a (notional) principal. Thisway, for instance, differences in financing con-ditions can be used to exploit cost advantages.
By buying an option, the buyer acquires the
right to buy or sell a certain amount of anasset (the underlying asset) on a future dateat an agreed price. An option is conditional inthat the buyer acquires the right, but not theobligation, to exercise the option later.
By contrast, futures are “unconditional”
transactions in that the delivery of a preciselydetermined underlying asset is agreed at aspecific future date and a price already set

53upon the conclusion of the contract. Unlike
forward rate agreements, all features of a fu-tures contract are standardised for exchangetrading. This paves the way for transparenttrading, low trading costs and simplified mar-ket access.
Futures markets enable the transfer of risk
between different market partners which isborn, for instance, of the need to hedgeagainst the spot price risks. By taking a fu-tures position, the buyer freezes the price atwhich he can buy the underlying asset lateron and the writer freezes the price at whichhe will deliver the underlying asset. However,futures contracts are generally not fulfilled viaphysical delivery of the underlying asset; in-stead, the difference between the agreed fu-tures price and the market value of theunderlying asset is settled in cash. The profitsand losses resulting from the futures positionare settled through a clearing intermediarydaily. To cover payment obligations, the clear-ing point requires collateral payments (marginrequirements). If the fulfilment of a deriva-tives contract is not linked to the delivery ofthe underlying asset, the trade volume can beexpanded virtually ad infinitum .
Financial derivatives in perfect and
complete markets
The perfect markets concept, which is a fun-
damental element of finance theory, may beused as a point of departure for analysing thelink between derivatives and the underlyingspot values. In perfect markets, all marketplayers act rationally and share the same in-formation, ie new information is factored into
the prices of financial instruments immediate-ly (also known as information efficiency).Moreover, financial instruments can betraded without transaction costs. On balance,there is no arbitrage: future payment flowsare factored into each instrument equally – ir-respective of whether they are traded at dif-ferent exchanges or of differences in thepackaging of claims and obligations. In a per-fect market, this should thus make it impos-sible to obtain a risk-free profit by simultan-eously buying a financial asset “low” and sell-ing it “high”; price movements on the deriva-tives and spot markets for their underlyingassets should be simultaneous. Moreover, in aperfect market, all the desired possible pay-ment flows can be replicated from a combin-ation of the traded instruments.

54In this reference framework, derivates mar-
kets have no impact on spot markets. Instead,the value of a derivative can be “derived” ex-plicitly from the value of the underlying asset.In the real world, however, financial marketfrictions – such as transaction costs, trade re-strictions, fragmented markets and illiquidity– mean that derivatives markets could wellhave feedback effects on spot markets. Theconditions under which this could happen,and the potential consequences, will be illus-trated below.
Derivatives trading given market frictions
In order to implement their strategies, invest-
ors can generally use both the spot and de-rivatives markets. Their choice of market usu-ally depends on a number of factors. If trans-action costs and financing restrictions exist,market players may have an incentive totrade in options instead of the underlyingasset in order to capitalise on leverage andrelatively low transaction costs.
1
It is often easier to implement more complexstrategies in derivatives markets, in which li-quidity is ample, market access is simple andinstruments are quickly tradable. If, for in-stance, a highly diversified portfolio of stocksis to be shifted to bonds, this can be accom-plished by selling stocks and buying bonds. Itmay be easier, however, to sell a future on astock index which replicates the stocks in theportfolio. The stock risk is reduced by selling afuture since gains on stocks are offset bylosses from the sale of the future and losseson stocks by gains from the futures position.If the index future exactly replicates the
stocks held in the portfolio, the stock positionis said to be completely hedged. The joint fu-tures and equity position is thus risk-free, andtherefore equivalent to a bond of similar ma-turity.
Market players, therefore, can trade the fu-
ture in one single transaction instead of deal-ing several individual stocks. This saves trans-action costs and focuses liquidity on the fu-ture. Stock indices are weighted averages ofthe prices of various stocks that are nottraded at the exact same time. The index fu-ture, however, could be interpreted as an ap-proximation of the notional value of the stockindex if all the stocks contained in the indexwere traded simultaneously.
How derivatives markets affect price
discovery
Against this background, the question now is
the extent to which derivatives markets affectprice discovery on the spot markets. Empiricalevidence on stock markets indicates that theprices of stock index futures often lead theunderlying stock indices. The lead is frequent-ly five minutes or more.

55(DAX), that the DAX index futures price leads
the DAX index by 15 to 20 minutes.3One ex-
planation is that new information enters intothe stock index only through the trading ofindividual stocks. However, owing to transac-tion costs, it is not possible for all stock pricesto adjust immediately and simultaneously tonew market information. This means that, inthe derivatives market, even though the lawof one price is generally valid, information ofrelevance to the market could be factored inmore quickly – at least whenever the arbi-trage bands defined by the differences intransactions and opportunity costs are notviolated.
In an independent study on the co-movement
of the DAX and the DAX future, an approachto determine the share of information fromthe DAX and the DAX future in price discov-ery was chosen instead of the “lead-lag ap-proach”, in which the chronological order ofprice formation is estimated and measured inunits of time. The prices of both instrumentsat five-minute intervals from 20 April to26 June 2006 were used for this study. Forthe approximately 4,680 observations, a vec-tor error correction model which replicatesboth the long-run price equilibrium betweenthe DAX and the DAX future and the short-run dynamics of the prices when they deviatefrom this equilibrium was estimated. Thismodel can be used to estimate to what ex-tent the DAX price follows a change in theDAX futures price or vice versa. The coeffi-cient of the estimation model can be used toderive the Granger and Gonzalo (GG) meas-ure, which quantifies the share of informationfrom the DAX and the DAX futures in pricediscovery.
4The GG measure indicates that
the DAX futures index leads the DAX index.
There is also empirical evidence that deriva-
tives markets prices lead those of bond mar-kets. The highly liquid Bund future, for in-stance, makes a much greater contribution tothe price formation process than the under-lying German government bonds.
5Moreover,
in many markets credit derivatives prices havebegun to lead those of bond markets.
6Credit
derivatives can be used to hedge againstcredit risks or to exploit changes in creditrisks. They enable credit risks to be traded in-dividually at low transaction costs and with-out any major restrictions. Many market play-ers therefore take recourse to the liquid seg-ments of the credit derivatives market to im-plement their strategies quickly.
The results, admittedly, are not consistent
with the above-postulated law of one pricefor derivatives and spot markets: more pre-cisely, the spot markets for financial claimsare no less forward-looking than their deriva-tives markets. Even if derivatives markets areassumed to have a certain lead, given thelong time lag before real supply responds, the

Do derivatives influence the stability of
the spot markets?
Other approaches in the finance literature
examine the effects of the introduction of fu-tures and options on the volatility of spotmarket prices.
Among other things, the question of the po-
tential impact of derivatives on spot marketvolatility is relevant with regard to financialstability. To be sure, volatility is not negativefor financial markets per se . In fact, funda-
mentally justified volatility reflects the pro-cessing of information in the financial mar-kets and, thus, is a precondition for efficientprice discovery. However, from an investor’spoint of view, volatility is an approximation ofthe prevailing uncertainty in the market and –at least in falling markets – is perceived asgenerating stress. This is all the more so as di-versification of assets often affords little or noprotection against strong and market-wideprice changes. In extreme cases, this may re-sult in liquidity and solvency problems and ul-timately in a disruption of various functions inthe financial system – examples being pay-ment settlement, risk valuation and risk trans-fer, as well as liquidity allocation.
Analyses of the volatility effects of derivatives
markets are often linked to the question ofhow much spot market volatility is affectedby speculative trading.
7Friedman (1953)
noted that market players willing to take riskswould, in the long run, ultimately contribute
to smoothing prices. Market players withfalse expectations who increase price volatilityby selling “low” and buying “high”, by con-trast, would eventually be doomed to failureand disappear from the market.
8However,
Friedman’s argument, which seems intuitivelyreasonable, was refuted by the emergence ofsuccessful trend-following strategies.
9
In many of the models discussed in the fi-nance literature, derivatives markets can havea stabilising effect on the relevant spot mar-kets. Peck (1976) shows that futures can sta-bilise commodities prices if production andstorage decisions are made based on the fu-tures price.
10Rising prices in the forward-
looking futures markets could then providean incentive to increase production and stor-age and thus contribute to preventing supplybottlenecks in the future. This will tend tosmooth price movements. Depending on theparameter values, the results produced by theindividual models, however, can generally beequally stabilising or destabilising.
What the empirical evidence does indicate,
though, is that, if derivatives are introduced,spot market volatility either falls or at least

How hedging strategies influence deriva-tives markets’ impact on spot markets
The discussion about the link between deriva-
tives markets and spot markets has thus farcentred on the distribution and processing ofinformation by market players. There hasbeen no discussion of information-free trad-ing, ie transactions not induced by new infor-mation or market expectations, such as theimpact that occurs when option writers in-sure themselves against losses from theiropen options positions by spot-buying andspot-selling the underlying asset, or if optionsare replicated by spot-market transactions.
12
The approach used to replicate options is de-rived from the results obtained by Black andScholes, who demonstrated that standard calland put options can be priced through repli-cation by a portfolio composed of the under-lying asset and a loan or an investment at therisk-free rate of interest.
13However, this port-
folio must continuously be adapted to currentmarket conditions. The “delta” of the optioncan be used to determine the quantity of theunderlying asset to be called or put, which iswhy one also speaks of dynamic hedging ordelta hedging.
14
The traditional derivation of option valuesusing the Black-Scholes formula rests on theassumption of efficient markets, which postu-lates that the replication of options has no ef-fect on the price of the underlying asset. Thetrade in the underlying asset induced by dy-
namic hedging, however, can certainly affectspot-market prices, especially owing to liquid-ity constraints.
Spot markets are not always liquid enough to
permit dynamic hedging; therefore, recourseis normally taken to other derivative instru-ments, specifically futures. Another advan-tage of futures is that they can replicate in-dices and make it easy to obtain insuranceagainst a broad range of market risks. Thestandardised nature of derivatives marketcontracts promotes liquidity. The term stand-ardisation indicates that a group of marketparticipants with varying motives for transac-tions uses a relatively narrow set of instru-ments; as a result, liquidity is not nearly asfragmented as in the spot markets. High li-quidity also reduces the market’s price sensi-tivity when settling large transaction volumesand, in turn, reduces the severity of price fluc-tuation.
If many market players are pursuing dynamic
(pro-cyclical) hedging strategies, this can havea destabilising effect on the markets for hedg-ing instruments. A dynamic hedging strategyrequires constant buying and selling of the

facturing synthetic puts through spot-market transac-
tions to insure their portfolios if a suitable number of ac-

58Deutsche BundesbankThe option delta and delta hedging
The option delta denotes the sensitivity of the option‘s 
theoretical value to a one unit change in the price of the underlying asset, where all other variables are 
constant. Whereas call option deltas are positive, put 
option deltas are negative. Call option: where the spot price of the underly-
ing asset is far below the strike price (deep-out-of-the-money call), the delta is 0, ie stock price 
movements have no impact on the value of the 
option since the option will not be exercised and 
will expire worthless. Where the spot price is far 
above the strike price (deep-in-the-money call), the delta is 1, ie the change in the option‘s value 
corresponds to the (absolute) change in the stock 
price. Where the spot price is close to the strike price (at-the-money call), the delta will rise with 
the spot price. The delta increases more rapidly 
as the expiration date approaches.
Put option: where the spot price of the underly-
ing asset is far below the strike price (deep-in-
the-money put), the delta is -1, ie the put option‘s 
value falls (increases) by the same amount as the increase (fall) in market prices. Where the spot 
price is far above the strike price (deep-out-of-
the-money put), the delta is 0, ie stock market movements have no impact on the value of the 
option since the option will not be exercised and 
will expire worthless. Where the spot price is 
close to the strike price (at-the-money put), the 
delta will rise with the spot price.
For example: if the delta of a call option on a 
stock is 0.8, this means that a slight change in the stock price will cause the price of the call option 
to change by 80% of that amount. In other 
words, the delta indicates the number of stocks 
required in a portfolio to replicate the option or 
to hedge against changes in its value. Since an option‘s delta ﬂ  uctuates constantly during its 
term, continual adjustments have to be made 
to the replicated portfolio by buying and selling stocks. This is known as delta hedging.Strike price = 100

pondingly high trade volume in the marketsfor hedge instruments. The underlying assetmust be bought in times of “rising markets”and sold in times of “falling markets”.
Strategies to hedge against falling stock
prices were already blamed for amplifying thefalling price trend in the case of the 1987stock market crash.
15The Brady Commission
appointed to investigate the cause of thecrash emphasised that a wave of institutionalsales induced by portfolio insurance strategiesaccelerated the decline.
16The Commission
stated that the illusion persisted among mar-ket participants that there was sufficient li-quidity in the stock markets to absorb thehedging sales without major price volatility.
This view held by market players was consist-
ent with many traditional models founded onthe belief that the trading volume induced byhedging strategies was too small to cause no-ticeable disruptions to the spot markets. Fol-lowing the 1987 stock market crash, how-ever, more and more models seeking to ex-plain the phenomenon of hedging-inducedstock price slides were developed. WhereasBrennan and Schwartz (1989), using a modelwith a (consumption) utility-maximising in-vestor, forecast only a slight impact of port-folio insurance strategies on capital marketprices and volatility,
17Gennotte and Leland
(1990) show that, for example, informationasymmetry between market players can leadto relatively illiquid markets.
18In their model,
some market players align their investmentbehaviour to financial market price move-ments instead of to the fundamentals. Theytake falling prices as a signal to sell irrespect-
ive of whether the price movement was trig-gered by fundamentally justified changes inexpectations, liquidity shortfalls or hedgingstrategies. Gennotte and Leland refer to themarket crash of October 1987, in which, ac-cording to them, nearly 15% of the turnoverin stocks and stock index futures were in-duced by portfolio insurance strategies, andthen show that an unobserved supply shock,in conjunction with dynamic hedging, cancause stock prices to fall relatively sharply. Ac-cording to Gennotte and Leland, when themarket crashed in 1929 the unobservedhedging plans consisted exclusively of stop-loss strategies, whereas in 1987 portfolio in-surance (through dynamic hedging) becamean additional, and major, contributing factorto the price slide.
The large volumes of orders that were flood-
ing the market in October 1987 were also areflection of traders’ willingness to trade inlarge positions, which was fostered by lowtransaction costs. In addition, index futures,which had just been introduced in 1982,made it easy to carry out dynamic hedgingstrategies. The market makers were not suffi-ciently capitalised to provide adequate liquid-ity and manage the increased volume oforders.
15On 19 October 1987 – called “Black Monday” – stock
prices around the world went into a free fall. That day,
the US Dow Jones stock index fell by 22.6%.

60These experiences showed the need for
measures to strengthen market structures sothat, in the future, sudden disruptions in thestock markets could be prevented. Againstthis background, ideas such as the merger ofclearing houses, price ranges to curb extremevolatility and “circuit breakers” to head offthe threat of market disruptions, as well aschanges in margin requirements, have allbeen discussed.
19Margins denote collateral requested by clear-ing houses or by brokers on behalf of tradingparties entering into a futures contract. Thecash payment serves as collateral for thetraders’ obligations from the futures contract.Following the initial margin payment uponconcluding the contract, additional marginpayments (margin calls) may become neces-sary if the investor’s position is losing moneyon the transaction. The futures markets canbe used to illustrate the impact of margin re-quirements.
20The amount of the margin re-
quirements for the futures contracts has animpact on market liquidity. Small margin pay-ments mean less of a need for capital in orderto enter into and maintain a futures positionand thus enhance liquidity.
In times of high volatility, however, there is
the danger that the margin payments madewill not suffice to offset the volatility and thatinvestors could be forced either to make add-itional payments or to close out their futurespositions. In that case, large volumes oforders from one side of the market (buyers orwriters) would flood the market. Low marginrequirements, which would promote liquidityin times of low volatility, would have the op-posite effect – to dry out the market througha bias of either call or put orders – in times ofhigh volatility.
Where futures positions are completely
hedged, by contrast, margin requirements arecompletely superfluous. If, for instance, an in-Amounts outstanding at the end of the year

This couldslow down the market’s momentum and giveinvestors more time to assess their situationand pay outstanding margin requirements.However, there is then the possibility not onlyof limiting the consequences of panic reac-tions among market participants but also thatfundamentally justified price movements willbe stifled – at least for the time being. In add-ition, upon approaching a price limit, investorscould close out their positions so that, in theevent of a price limit or a trading halt, they donot run the risk of ending up with an illiquidposition. Such behaviour would then cause in-vestors to reach the price limit more quickly. Inthe end effect, however, the measures de-scribed above are necessary to prevent dy-namic overvaluation in the financial markets.
Feedback effects of dynamic hedging in
the case of interest rate derivatives
Dynamic hedging strategies are demonstrably
significant for other markets in much thesame way that they are for the equity mar-kets. The market for interest rate options,which accounts for 70% of financial options
traded worldwide, is the largest segment ofthe market.
Although interest rate options can refer dir-
ectly to interest rates, this term also coversoptions on bonds and on bond futures. Hedg-ing strategies are particularly relevant when-ever options dealers act as net writers. Theiropen positions expose dealers to interest rateEnd-of-half-year levels

62risk, which can be hedged through a variety
of interest rate instruments such as first-classbonds or bond futures.
In order to hedge open options positions
using bonds and futures, these markets needto be sufficiently liquid. To insure interest rateoptions completely, it is necessary to havehedging instruments with the same maturityas that of the options to be insured. For theUS dollar interest rate options market,Kambhu (1997) investigated how hedgingtransactions potentially induced by optionsdealers could lead to feedback effects on themarkets for hedging instruments. For theUSA, the empirical study showed that themarkets for hedging instruments were, at thetime, generally sufficiently liquid to absorbthe demand for hedging created by changesin interest rates.
21However, the demand for
hedging median maturities already, in somecases, outpaced the usual volume of turnoverin the markets in hedging products.
The balance between sales and purchases of
options by options dealers fluctuated onlymarginally in recent years. At first glance, thiswould seem to indicate virtually no growth indemand for hedging products. However, inthe summer of 2003, for instance, market li-quidity problems occurred owing to demandfor hedging instruments following a sharprise in yields. This experience led to an in-crease in the use of other instruments, suchas interest rate swaps, in order to carry outdynamic hedging strategies.
In addition, the total volume of outstanding
euro and US dollar-denominated options hasgrown much faster than the volumes of fu-
tures and bonds. This means that feedbackeffects on spot markets could be caused notonly by options dealers’ demand for hedgingproducts but also other market players’ in-creased demand for interest rate derivatives –for both speculative and hedging purposes.
Conclusion
The interplay between the derivatives and
spot markets will remain a topic of scholarlydebate. Derivatives markets’ fast growth hasintensified their influence on price discoveryand risk allocation in the financial markets.Now that price risks can be traded easily andat low cost, new information is processedmore quickly. Derivatives trading can there-fore send signals to other markets. Signalscan have a stabilising effect if, for instance,the future expectations of derivatives marketplayers influence the production and storagedecisions of commodity market players.
On the other hand, during turnarounds in
market expectations and major price fluctu-ations, dynamic hedging strategies can alsowreak havoc on illiquid spot markets. The ex-tent to which derivatives create risk for theentire financial system is closely tied to thequestion of how these instruments are used inspecific market circumstances. The potentialfeedback effects on, and systemic risks to,spot markets created by the use of derivativesraise the question of how to supervise and

fining the legal framework, creating a robustmarket structure, making information systemstransparent and instituting trading halts andprice ranges are at the heart of the debate onwhat constitutes suitable measures.It is not enough, however, to focus regulation
on exchange-traded derivatives, which areeasier to supervise, as this might create incen-tives to shift trading activity to the OTC sec-tor, which is more sensitive with regard tohedging and to counterparty risk.
