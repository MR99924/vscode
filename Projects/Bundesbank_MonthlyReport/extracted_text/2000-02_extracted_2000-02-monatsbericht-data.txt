6The international
and EuropeanenvironmentDevelopments in the global economy
The global environment continued to improve
in the later stages of the past year. At thesame time the global economic outlookbrightened up distinctly; at present it is beingassessed more favourably than it has been fora long time. This is all the more remarkableconsidering that one year ago there were stillwidespread fears of recession and worriesabout deflation. For this year the IMF expectsglobal economic growth to accelerate per-ceptibly, by one-half percentage point, to3
12%, slightly exceeding the annual average
growth for the 1990s (just over 3%). Thatwould also lend fresh stimulus to world trade,which would probably have a favourable im-pact on, in particular, trade flows betweenthe industrial countries and the emergingmarket economies and countries in transition.
It was primarily the continued economic
boom in the United States and the rapid re-covery in the East Asian emerging economieswhich contributed to reviving the globaleconomy. In addition, the fact that the forcesof growth have been increasingly gaining theupper hand in the euro area, thanks to robustdomestic demand and to a rise in exportsover the course of 1999, has also been play-ing a role. Those factors have had a positiveeffect on most of the central and east Euro-pean countries in transition. In Latin America,too, a renewed upswing occurred in thesecond half of 1999 – and thus faster thanhad generally been expected in the spring.

7even greater than predicted in the IMF’s au-
tumn forecast. At the same time, though,there are a number of risks. First on the list isthe very high equity price level in the OECDcountries. In the United States, in particular, adrastic drop in equity prices would have aconsiderably negative impact on overall eco-nomic developments since private domesticdemand is heavily dependent on assets. Inaddition, a continued deterioration of the UScurrent account could, with a sliding US dol-lar, drive prices up. A further risk lies in thecontinued vulnerability of the Japanese econ-omy. Outside the OECD countries, the up-swing in some countries is still fragile. In theEast Asian emerging economies, in particular,the visible improvement in the economic situ-ation should not blind observers to the struc-tural problems that continue to plague thebanking and corporate sectors. Despite thoserisks, which must continue to be monitored,the likelihood of a continuation and even anacceleration of the upward trend in the globaleconomy outweighs the risks.
As the year 1999 progressed, the assessment
of the global price outlook changed percep-tibly. A key factor was the drastic rise in oilprices, which, starting from their nadir at theend of 1998, rose by a factor of slightly morethan 1
12in dollar terms and more than 2 in
euro terms up to February 2000. This causedprice pressure at the consumer level to in-crease worldwide. For the industrial coun-tries, the IMF and the OECD have predictedthat inflation will rise this year by one-halfpercentage point to just under 2%. Bycontrast, the commodity-exporting countrieshave witnessed an improvement in the terms
of trade.
Most East Asian emerging economies are
back on the path of expansion. This especiallyapplies to South Korea, where the economygrew by 10% in 1999, after having shrunkby 6% the year before. For 2000 the Bank ofKorea expects real GDP to grow by 7% andprices to rise by 3%. Singapore and Taiwanalso recorded strong economic growth in1999, at around 5
12% in each country; they
benefited especially from the worldwideboom in the electronic products sector. At thebottom of the table in East Asia is Indonesia,where overall economic output in the pastyear is likely to have surpassed the low levelof 1998 only slightly.Annual percentage changesConsumer prices in selected

8The financial market turbulence that rocked
Latin America at the beginning of 1999, ori-ginating in Brazil, had at times a very detri-mental impact on overall economic output inthe major countries, with the exception ofMexico, which was shielded by the boomingUS economy. This applies especially to Argen-tina, whose currency is pegged to the US dol-lar; following the sharp devaluation of theBrazilian real, Argentina therefore had tocope with considerable losses in bilateraltrade with its neighbour. Real GDP in Argen-tina sank in 1999, unlike in Brazil itself, by anestimated 3% to 4%. Thanks to the relative-ly rapid ebbing of the financial market crisisand owing to the increase in commodityprices, the general outlook for Latin Americahas again brightened considerably.
The rise in commodity prices also made a key
contribution to the Russian economy’s sur-prisingly rapid recovery from the impact ofthe financial crisis in the summer of 1998.The sharp devaluation of the rouble at thetime led to a considerable substitution of im-ports by domestic products, particularly in thefood industry. As a consequence, overall out-put went back up perceptibly in 1999. How-ever, there has been little change up to nowin the country’s structural problems, whichare also responsible for the continuous de-cline in investment recorded since 1991.Those problems include the persistent capitalflight, widespread corruption, the overall pol-itical situation and the inadequate legalframework.
In the United States, after nearly nine years of
an uninterrupted economic boom, there areno signs that growth will slow down any time
soon. According to initial estimates, real GDPgrew in the past quarter by a seasonally ad-justed 1
12% from the summer quarter’s level
and surpassed the previous year’s level bywell over 4%. Over the entire year it grew by4%. Since its cyclical trough at the beginningof 1991, overall economic output has risen byslightly more than one-third, correspondingto an annual growth rate of 3
12%. In au-
tumn 1999 the strongest growth push wasprovided once again by households’ con-sumption, which, after adjustment for sea-sonal and price variations, was almost 1
12%
higher than in the previous quarter. The ex-ceptionally dynamic consumer demand is ex-pected to have continued following the turnof 1999–2000. The consumer confidenceindex and retail turnover continued their as-cent in January. In addition, the considerablestockbuilding contributed to GDP growth inthe fourth quarter of 1999, a trend probablymotivated by the computer problems whichmany were afraid would occur during theroll-over from 1999 to 2000. By contrast, in-vestment by the industrial sector increasedonly marginally over the year, and housingconstruction declined once again. In theautumn the real foreign balance slid furtherinto deficit by roughly the same amount as inthe previous quarter.
In light of the very brisk domestic demand,
the high utilisation of manufacturing capacityand the price stimuli emanating from inter-national commodity markets, inflationaryfears are growing in the United States despitethe absence at present of clear indicators of abroadly based increase in inflationary pres-Latin America

9sures. Consumer price inflation did accelerate
over the past year by one percentage point to2.7% in January 2000, yet that was largelyattributable to the rise in energy prices; ex-cluding energy and food products, the infla-tion rate was 1.9% of late; in other words, itwas even one-half percentage point lowerthan twelve months earlier.
In the past year the Japanese economy grew
by an estimated
12%, which was admittedly
not nearly enough to make up for the declinein output in 1998 (– 2
12%). The rather
strong growth in the first half of the year wassustained by public investment and privatehousing construction, which was boosted fora while by tax incentives. In the summer, realexports shot up, with the braking effect ofthe yen’s appreciation being more than com-pensated particularly by the surge in importdemand in the neighbouring countries. Bycontrast, a self-sustaining upswing in domes-tic consumer demand is not yet clearly dis-cernible, as was also confirmed by the Bankof Japan. In the second half of the year over-all economic output may have tended to slowdown once again. The high burdens on enter-prises and employees associated with theeconomic restructuring process continue tohamper a sustainable revival of the domesticeconomy. Owing to a decline in households’disposable income, the increase in privateconsumption over all of 1999 was only pos-sible at the expense of savings, although thesaving ratio has still remained relatively highas of late. According to recent surveys, indus-trial investment has not passed the troughdespite enterprises’ improved profit situation.In addition, fiscal policy is more and morebeing stretched to the limit in its efforts to
prop up overall demand. According to OECDestimates, the deficit ratio, at around 8% ofGDP , and the (gross) debt ratio, at 114%, willboth reach a new high this year.
Macroeconomic trends in the euro area
Economic growth in the euro area picked up
distinctly after mid-1999. In the third quarterseasonally adjusted real GDP growth was upby just under 1% from its level in the three-month period from April to June, and thustwice as strong as in the two preceding quar-ters. The year-on-year increase amounted tojust over 2%. The accelerated pace is attrib-utable, for one thing, to domestic demandbeing more lively than in the spring, which isalso true of the individual components, i. e.private and government consumption as wellas fixed capital formation. For another, ex-ports grew by a seasonally adjusted rate of3% from the previous quarter; this growthnotably outpaced that of imports (just under2%), resulting in the contribution to growthby euro area foreign trade rising to just underone-half percentage point.
For the final quarter of 1999, for which no
euro area GDP data is available yet, other in-dicators point to a continuation of the favour-able cyclical trend. In the October–Novemberperiod seasonally adjusted industrial produc-tion rose by nearly 1% from its level in thesummer quarter and surpassed the corres-ponding figure for the previous year by2
12%. This went hand in hand with a clear
rise in capacity utilisation in the manufactur-Japan Stronger

10ing sector; in January of this year, according
to surveys, it distinctly exceeded its long-timeaverage for the first time since the end of1998. According to the most recent Commis-sion survey, industrial confidence in monetaryunion has continued to rise of late. For 1999as a whole, real GDP is likely to have grownby just over 2%.
In the wake of the buoyant economic recov-
ery in the second half of 1999, growth differ-entials between the individual euro areacountries have shrunk. One reason is that theformer economic laggards Germany and Italy,whose exports were particularly hard hit bythe international crises, were able to step upthe pace of their economic growth notice-ably. However, a considerable growth dividestill exists between those two countries and agroup of countries with very dynamic econ-
omies encompassing Ireland, Finland, Spain,Portugal and the Netherlands.
According to revised Eurostat data, the situ-
ation in the euro area labour markets steadilyimproved in the past few months. In Decem-ber the standardised unemployment rate, ata seasonally adjusted 9.6%, was 0.9 percent-age point below its comparable level for theprevious year. On average, 10% of the labourforce was reported to be looking for work in1999, whereas this figure had been nearly11% a year before. A trend towards an im-provement can be observed in the majoreconomies of Germany, France and Italy, too.In some smaller countries which at timeswere at the forefront of labour market devel-Capacity utilisation in the euro area’s manufacturing sector*

11opments, the decline in unemployment was
not as pronounced as it had been in the past.
Consumer prices increased at an accelerated
pace in the autumn months. The year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index ofConsumer Prices (HICP) widened to 1.7% inDecember, having stood at 0.8% a year ago.Influenced by rising crude oil prices and thepersistent weakness of the euro, petroleumand other fuels, in particular, became moreexpensive. Excluding energy, food products,beverages and tobacco, prices (at 1.1%) roseat a distinctly slower pace, although even inthis relatively narrow definition a certain ac-celeration in consumer price inflation can berecognised. As an average for 1999, broadlyand narrowly defined inflation rates wereboth 1.1%. The price increase became no-ticeably more pronounced in those countriesthat had previously had a below-average rateof inflation. In other countries it even weak-ened or at least accelerated relatively slowly,with the reduction of indirect taxes in thesouthern European member states playing arole. In December 1999 Ireland recorded thehighest rate of inflation, at 3.9%; the great-est price stability was demonstrated by Ger-many and France, each with an inflation rateof 1.4%.
Current account and exchange rate
developments in the euro area
Along with the progressing recovery of the
world economy from the effects of the crisesin east Asia, the situation of the euro area ex-port industry also continued to improve in theautumn months of the past year. In October-
November 1999 deliveries of goods to non-euro-area countries again surpassed their pre-vious year’s mark by 10
12%; in the first half
of the year, by contrast, they had been justover 3
12% lower compared with the previous
year. Along with the rebound in domestic de-mand, this has simultaneously led to a distinctrise in imports. In terms of their value, importsfrom non-euro-area countries were even14
12% higher in October–November than a
year before, whereas the value of imports inthe first half of 1999 was still 1
12% below
the comparable 1998 level. However, the in-crease is largely attributable to higher importprices, too; particularly import prices forcrude petroleum jumped sharply over thecourse of the year, but other imported goodsalso became more expensive in terms of do-mestic currency due to the euro’s slide. Onbalance, despite the sharp real rise in exports,the euro area countries’ trade surplus, at318
12billion in October–November, was
somewhat lower than in the correspondingperiod of the previous year (just under ECU21 billion).
In the area of “invisible” current account
transactions, i.e. transactions in services withother countries plus labour income, invest-ment income and current transfers, duringthe period under review a deficit of 312
12
billion was generated, which was at the same
level as in the previous year. Thus, in themonths of October and November 1999 thecurrent account in the euro area showed asurplus of 36 billion, compared with ECU 8
billion a year before.Consumer

12As of late, the euro has once again encoun-
tered depreciation pressure. Following aphase of stabilisation, with periods ofstrengthening near the end of last year and atthe beginning of the new year, the euro hit anew all-time low in the past few weeks. As aweighted average against 13 industrialisedcountries and emerging economies, it wasquoted in mid-February at almost 13
12%weaker than when it was introduced at the
beginning of 1999.
The spotlight was naturally on the rate of the
euro to the US dollar. After grazing the psy-chological barrier of US$ 1 to 31 this past au-
tumn, the euro’s rate against the dollar re-mained in a narrow corridor just above thatmark until and into January. However, re-peated tendencies towards a more distinctstrengthening of the euro lost steam timeand again whenever favourable data on theUS economy surprised market participantsand thus reaffirmed confidence in the per-formance of the US economy. Against thatbackground, the market tended to attachminor importance to the high American cur-rent account deficit; the impressive success inconsolidating American government spend-ing apparently represented a stabilising coun-terweight. In spite of the fact that on this sideof the Atlantic, too, the outlook for growthhas in the meantime improved distinctly, theUS dollar’s latest quotation against the eurowas just under US$ 0.99, an appreciation ofalmost 16% from its level at the beginning of1999.
The Japanese yen, too, remained relatively
strong against the euro in the last months of1999, even though the structural upheavalshampering Japan’s prospects for furthergrowth continue to exist in important areasand the economic outlook for the euro areanow tends to be more favourable.

13the euro area. Only temporarily did the yen
weaken somewhat, accompanied by re-newed interventions by the Japanese centralbank. As of late, the exchange rate was ¥ 109to the euro, just under 18
12% lower than at
the beginning of 1999 when the euro wasintroduced.
In the past few months the pound sterling
likewise continued to firm against the euro.This reflects, among other things, the stronger-than-expected growth of the British economyand the increased interest rate differential. Es-pecially over the course of January, the poundsterling rose sharply against the euro and wasquoted as of late at around 13
12% higher
than at the beginning of 1999. At its peak,the pound sterling – measured in terms of theD-Mark – hit the DM 3.25 mark at the begin-ning of February, its highest level since theend of the eighties.
As opposed to the rate of the euro against
the two major world currencies, the dollarand the yen, as well as the pound sterling,the rate of the euro to the EU currencieslinked to the euro by the Exchange RateMechanism (ERM II), the Danish krone andthe Greek drachma, remained virtually un-changed. Although the Greek drachma’s cen-tral rate was raised by 3.5% on January 15,2000, thus aligning it more closely to the pre-vailing market rate and shortening the gap tojust over 2%, the drachma’s current quota-tions were hardly affected by this move.Monetary policy and financial markets in
the euro area
After interest rates were raised on Novem-
ber 4, 1999, the ECB Governing Council ini-tially left central bank rates unchanged. Witheffect from February 9, the Governing Coun-cil then raised the interest rate on main refi-nancing operations, which continued to beconducted as fixed-rate tenders, from 3.0%to 3.25%, and, with effect from February 4,it raised the interest rates on the marginallending facility and the deposit facility from4.0% to 4.25% and from 2.0% to 2.25%,respectively. The increase was necessary be-cause the risks to price stability had risenmore sharply than expected as of late. Theaccelerated economic upswing in the euroarea, higher oil prices, and the jump in importprices, as well as the continued abundance ofliquidity, all played a role. The interest rate in-crease is designed to prevent external pricetrends from spilling over to price and costdevelopments in the euro area, to safeguardprice stability over the medium term, andthus to make a contribution to lastinglystrong economic growth.
The steady-as-she-goes policy at the turn of
the year helped counteract uncertainty onthe financial markets relating to the year2000 problem. In fact, it turned out thatthose risks were being assessed as beinglower and lower. The premiums for uncollat-eralised liquidity maturing beyond the mil-lennium date change went back down inthe last few weeks prior to the roll-over. OnDecember 31 the overnight interest rate wasbelow the marginal lending rate; immediately

14thereafter, money market rates returned to
normal.
On the whole, though, fixed-term deposit
rates have gone up distinctly since the au-tumn. In addition, the yield curve on themoney market has been pointing steeply up-wards. This has mainly been a reflection ofthe fact that market participants were largelyexpecting the latest interest rate increase bythe Eurosystem.
Against the background of initially stable cen-
tral bank rates and ongoing money marketmanagement which continued to be gearedtowards limiting the daily fluctuations of thecredit institutions’ central bank balancesaround the reserve requirement resultingmainly from the persistently high volatility ofgovernment deposits with the Eurosystem,the overnight interest rate (EONIA) remainedgenerally close to the main refinancing rate inthe past few months. Only at the end ofJanuary did the overnight interest rate dis-tinctly outpace the main tender rate, in ex-pectation of the interest rate move by theECB Governing Council.
Since the ECB Governing Council had already
indicated in mid-September that it would notconduct a main refinancing operation in thefirst week of January, the liquidity surplus cre-ated at the beginning of the year by highreturn flows of banknotes, liquidity-providingeffects of public sector spending and in-creased recourse to the marginal lending fa-cility during the turn of the year was absorb-ed by the collection of fixed-term deposits ina one-week variable-rate quick tender.

15ever, since the tender result did not reach the
absorption volume envisaged and announcedby the ECB, the liquidity supply of the bank-ing system could only be restored to normalby sharply cutting the following, first refinan-cing operation of this year. Furthermore, theallotment profile of the first weeks in Januarywas largely responsible for the extraordinarilytight liquidity situation at the beginning ofthe latest reserve maintenance period.
The longer-term refinancing operations
which reached maturity in the fourth quarterwere stepped up from 315 billion each to
325 billion to facilitate the transition to the
year 2000. For the main refinancing oper-ations starting at the end of January, the ECBGoverning Council decided to reduce the al-lotment volume to 320 billion each. On the
whole, the Eurosystem’s regular open markettransactions increased by 319.3 billion to
3213.5 billion between November and Janu-
ary. This was mainly to offset the absorptionof liquidity by the market amounting to, onbalance, 312.8 billion, and financed the rise
in the minimum reserve requirement by 34.3
billion (see adjacent table).
The credit institutions took recourse to the
standing facilities primarily at the end of themaintenance periods (particularly to the de-posit facility in December) but also at the turnof the year (chiefly the marginal lending facil-ity), with the vast majority of recourse beingaccounted for in each case by German banks.

at the end of September. The three-monthmoving average of year-on-year growth rateswas 6.1% between October and December,compared with 5.9% between July and Sep-tember. It thus remains some 1
12% percent-
age points above the reference value of4
12% set by the ECB Governing Council for
1999. When interpreting these figures,though, one must bear in mind that atpresent this year-on-year comparison reflectscurrent trends only to a limited extent owingto base effects, specifically the weak mone-tary growth in December 1998. If one ex-cludes these base effects by using shorter-term seasonally adjusted rates of change, themonetary aggregate M3, at an annual rate of5%, rose more slowly over the second half of1999, despite a slight acceleration in the thirdquarter, than in the first half of the year(8%). Moreover, the assessment of monetarygrowth continues to be hampered by statis-tical uncertainties. In addition, monetary de-velopments in the individual euro area coun-tries still vary, although a certain convergencehas been achieved over the course of the pastfew months. The German contribution to themonetary aggregate M3 grew in the lastquarter of 1999 largely in line with the overallmonetary aggregate (see page 17f.).
The individual components of the monetary
aggregate saw rather different developmentsin the fourth quarter of 1999. The marketableinstruments contained in M3, especiallymoney market fund certificates and moneymarket paper, grew distinctly more sharply.Currency in circulation also grew perceptibly;however, this rise occurred mainly in Decem-ber and is, to that extent, probably a reflec-
tion of uncertainty involving the year 2000problem. By contrast, the pace of growth inovernight deposits slowed down in the fourthquarter of 1999; at the end of December1999 they exceeded last year’s level by10.3%, following 14.9% in September. Thesluggish growth of sight deposits in thefourth quarter is likely to be linked not only tooutflows in cash holding but also to the risein short-term interest rates, which has pro-moted shifts to fixed-term forms of invest-ment. On the whole, the monetary aggregateM1, which includes not only currency in circu-lation but also overnight deposits, remainednearly unchanged in the quarter under re-view, after adjustment for seasonal variations.In the second half of 1999 M1 rose at a sea-sonally adjusted annual rate of 4%, com-pared with just over 16
12% in the first half of
the year. The other shorter-term depositscontained in M3 grew moderately betweenOctober and December.
Among the balance-sheet counterparts, lend-
ing to the private sector continued to expandstrongly in the fourth quarter of 1999. At theend of December 1999 it was 10
12% higher
than the year before. Specifically, during theperiod under review securitised lending byMFIs to the private sector expanded distinctlymore strongly, whereas loans grew lessstrongly than in the previous quarter. Thesomewhat reduced growth of the latter inthe fourth quarter of 1999 of 7%, measuredas a seasonally adjusted annual rate – follow-ing 8
12% for the months between July and
September – is attributable, on balance, ex-clusively to the weak growth in December.Monetary

17Lending by MFIs to the public sector picked
up again in the fourth quarter of 1999 afterhaving been reduced in each of the two pre-ceding quarters. During the period under re-view monetary capital formation acceleratedperceptibly and thus had more of a brakingeffect on monetary growth than in the pre-ceding quarters. That also applies to paymenttransactions by resident non-MFIs with coun-terparties outside the euro area, where a con-siderable outflow of funds was recorded inthe fourth quarter of 1999.
In the fourth quarter, the German contribu-
tion to the euro area M3 grew largely in linewith the overall aggregate, after having in-creased much more strongly particularly inthe first half of the year. The noticeable weak-ening of German monetary growth waslargely attributable to the perceptible declinein money holdings in December owing tolarge-scale reductions in overnight deposits(see page 25). At the end of December theGerman contribution to M3 was 8.7% higherthan a year before. This rate is likely to con-tinue to overstate the actual liquidity situationin Germany. One reason is that the sale ofmoney market paper issued by German MFIsin the fourth quarter of 1999, particularly inNovember, continued its rise. According tobalance of payments statistics, once againthe vast majority of this paper was purchasedby investors residing outside the euro area.

The capital market rates in the euro area havecontinued to rise, on balance, since the au-tumn of 1999. In mid-February 2000 ten-yeargovernment bonds of the euro area countriesbore an average yield of 5
34%, or aroundone-half percentage point more than at the
end of September 1999. Compared with thepreceding months, though, the rise in capitalmarket interest rates has tailed off. This slow-down is largely attributable to the fact that,shortly before the interest rate increase by theEurosystem in early November, yields initiallywent down by nearly one-half percentagepoint to 5%. With the interest rate move be-coming more and more evident as Octoberwent on, uncertainty began to fade from thecapital market; in November the implied vola-tility of the Bund future, which shows theprice fluctuations expected by market partici-Annual percentage changes, monthly

ture, hit its lowest level since early summer.
Subsequently, long-term interest rates went
back up. It was especially the American bondmarket, where rising inflation fears pushedup yields, that emitted a relatively strong im-petus towards increasing interest rates. In theeuro area these stimuli were able to takehold, particularly in light of the acceleratedgrowth which was emerging more and moreclearly but also given increasing uncertaintyregarding price movements. From mid-November 1999 to the end of January 2000the average yield in the euro area rose bythree-quarters of a percentage point to5
34%. However, euro area yields did not
quite keep pace with their counterparts in theUnited States, which caused the spread be-tween US and euro area ten-year bond yields
to widen to nearly 1
14percentage points by
the end of January.
In connection with the raising of refinancing
rates by the Eurosystem at the beginning ofFebruary by one-quarter percentage point,capital market rates initially went down onceagain. Subsequently yields rose slightly, set-tling in at around 5
34% in mid-February. The
euro area capital markets’ response to theEurosystem’s interest rate decisions in Novem-ber and February indicates that inflation ex-pectations on the capital markets have beensuccessfully held in check. At the same time itunderscores the fact that market players re-gard these interest rate moves as suitablemeasures to forestall increasing price risks.
In the euro area share prices rose sharply as
the end of the year approached. In the fourthquarter of 1999 European shares – measuredin terms of the Dow Jones Euro STOXX – roseby more than 30%. The trend was originallydictated for the most part by the prices set onWall Street. As the year progressed, though,European stock markets increasingly brokeaway from international trends. The prospectof a strong revival of growth in the euro area,as well as a more optimistic assessment of thewill to implement economic policy reform inimportant euro area countries, contributed toEuropean equity price increases distinctly out-pacing those on the US stock markets. Thatenabled European equity markets to largelymake up for the relatively sluggish price de-velopments compared with those of theUnited States in the first few months of1999.

20Financial markets
in GermanyCapital-market and bank interest rates
During the winter, German capital-market
rates moved in close step with yields in theother EMU countries, with ten-year Federalbonds all yielding almost one-quarter of apercentage point below the EMU average.Between the end of September and the be-ginning of January, the yield on ten-year Fed-eral bonds outstanding rose by one-half of apercentage point to just over 5
12%. It was
still standing at that level when this Reportwent to press in mid-February. In the interim,however, the long-term capital-market rateincreased to 5
23%, although it temporarily
dropped back to below 512% in connection
with the interest rate hike by the Eurosystemearly in February. The interest rates of Federalsecurities with shorter residual maturities,which are more affected by changes inmoney-market conditions, have gone up ra-ther more steeply than the rates of long-dated securities in recent months. The spreadof interest rates on Federal securities hastherefore narrowed during the period underreview. In mid-February the interest-rate ad-vantage of ten-year Federal bonds over one-year paper discernible in the market came to1
12percentage points, compared with more
than 134percentage points at the end of Sep-
tember.
The interest-rate gap between ten-year debt
securities issued by domestic banks and com-parable Federal bonds narrowed slightly afterthe turn of the year. At an average of almost40 basis points, however, it is still somewhatwider than in the first half of 1999. The re-duction is mainly ascribable to the movementFurther rise in

21of the rather less liquid other bank debt se-
curities; in the ten-year segment, theirinterest-rate advantage over ten-year Federalbonds has latterly been roughly in line withthe average of all bank debt securities,whereas it had amounted to over 50 basispoints at times in November and December.
In keeping with interest-rate movements in
the bond market, long-term bank interestrates, too, have climbed perceptibly in recentmonths. This January, mortgage loans withinterest rates locked in for ten years cost anaverage of roughly 6
23%, against 613%i n
September 1999. The effective rates for long-term fixed-rate loans to enterprises actuallyrose somewhat faster – viz. by almost one-half of a percentage point. In January, theyaveraged just over 6
34% (for loans of be-
tween DM 200,000 and less than DM 1 mil-lion) and 6
23% (for loans of DM 1 million to
less than DM 10 million). In short-term bank-ing business as well, interest rates were no-ticeably higher than in September last year,although deposit rates have tended to go upfaster than the rates for short-term loans. Forinstance, the interest rate paid on time de-posits with three-month maturities (depositsof DM 100,000 to less than DM 1 million) inJanuary, at just over 2
34%, was one-half of a
percentage point higher than in September.By contrast, the interest rates charged forcurrent account credit (e.g. for loans ofDM 200,000 to less than DM 1 million) andfor personal credit lines granted to privatecustomers were raised less, namely by onlyone-quarter of a percentage point, or justunder.The above-mentioned fairly steep increase in
yields at the short end of the bond marketmainly reflects market players’ expectationsof rising central bank rates. The associatedflattening-out of the yield curve is no indica-tion of the pursuit of a restrictive monetarypolicy by the Eurosystem. Instead, the dis-tinctly improved real earnings prospects arenow being mirrored in the interest rates atthe short end of the market, too, after onlylong-term capital-market rates had initially re-sponded to the expected economic upswing.Hence the present flattening-out is consistentwith the normal “breathing” of the termstructure of interest rates during the businesscycle. Moreover, short-term real interest rateshave remained comparatively low, even afterthe twofold tightening of monetary policy bythe Eurosystem. But the real and nominalDaily values

Equity prices
There was a tempestuous upswing in the
German equity market from the autumn on-wards. As measured by the broad CDAX priceindex, quotations rose by 28% between theend of September and the end of the year.Whereas prices moved in step with the majorforeign equity markets in October and No-
vember, in the following months price move-ments detached themselves more and morefrom trends in the USA, where quotationsstagnated under conditions of relatively highvolatility. Towards the end of the year, theGerman market recorded substantially higherprice gains than other European markets. Be-sides the improved growth prospects, thisboom owed a great deal to the tax-reformplans announced towards the end of theyear. The prices of bank and insurance com-pany shares went up particularly fast; suchprices benefited from the option included inthe reform package of selling capital interestswithout becoming liable to tax. However, thehighest price gains during the period underreview were registered by shares from thetechnology and telecommunications sectors,which are mostly listed in the New Market,and which rose by around 60% each in thefinal quarter. At the beginning of the year2000, the German equity market moved intochoppier waters. Although prices once againreached record levels, the gains focused onan ever-smaller number of shares. There werealso sharp drops in prices on several occa-sions. When this Report went to press in mid-February, the CDAX share-price index wasjust under 11% higher than at the end of1999.

23by domestic borrowers amounted to 3130
billion (market value) in the final quarter of1999, compared with 3141 billion between
July and September. Net sales after deductionof redemptions and after taking due accountof changes in issuers’ holdings of their ownbonds, at 327 billion, were actually less than
one-half as large as those in the previousquarter ( 358
12billion). This decline appears
to have been due primarily to the spate of re-demptions customary towards the end of ayear, and less to any restraint in issuing aheadof the millennium change, since net saleswere distinctly higher than in the final quarterof 1998 ( 323 billion). Foreign bonds were
sold to the value of 310
12billion; the vast
majority of them were denominated in euro,or in other currency units issued by EMUmember states.
The main cause of the decline in the amount
raised in the bond market was the compara-tively low net sales of bank debt securities,which, at 317 billion in the last quarter of the
year, were only about one-third as high as inthe preceding quarter ( 345
12billion). At the
same time, there was a conspicuous shorten-ing of maturities; whereas the outstandingamount of sub-one-year bank debt securitiesrose by 322
12billion, medium- and long-
term paper was redeemed on balance. Thatpresumably owes much to investors’ strongpreference for liquid funds ahead of the mil-lennium change. The public sector raised 39
billion (net) through the bond market in thefourth quarter, compared with 312
12billion
in the third. The Federal Government in-creased its bonded debt by 313 billion, pri-
marily issuing ten-year bonds ( 38 billion) andfive-year special Federal bonds ( 36 billion).
The net sales of Federal securities were ac-companied by redemptions of paper issuedby the Treuhand Agency and the former Fed-eral Post Office (just over 32 billion each).
Bonds of industrial enterprises worth 31 bil-
lion (net) were sold.
In the fourth quarter of 1999, domestic en-
terprises placed new shares to the value of36
12billion, compared with 38 billion in the
preceding quarter. Towards the end of theyear, too, the trend towards “going public”was unabated. Between October and Decem-ber, 39 German enterprises were listed forthe first time on domestic stock markets.Sales of foreign equities ran at an exception-ally high level; between October and Decem-ber they were bought by German residents toDaily values, log. scale

Investment activity in the securities
markets
On the buyers’ side of the bond market, for-
eign investors were in the forefront again inthe final quarter of 1999. They bought do-mestic debt securities to the value of 330 bil-
lion, compared with 338 billion in the previ-
ous three months. About 80% of the secur-ities placed abroad were bank debt securities,the vast majority being short-dated paper.Domestic non-banks’ demand for bondsdropped sharply in the fourth quarter ( 36
12
billion, compared with 31812billion between
July and September). Roughly two-thirds ofthis sum was accounted for by domesticbonds and one-third by foreign debt secur-ities. In the closing months of 1999, credit in-stitutions on balance bought next to nothingin the bond market. Their bond portfoliosrose by no more than 31 billion. That rise
was associated with a switch from domesticbonds (– 37 billion) to foreign debt securities
(+37
12billion).
On the buyers’ side of the German equity
market, too, foreign investors were to thefore in the fourth quarter of 1999; they in-vested 337
12billion in German shares. Most
of those transactions – as in the case of pur-chases of foreign shares by residents – wereattributable to cross-border corporate mer-gers. The equity portfolios of domestic non-banks went up by 314 billion. Credit institu-
tions increased their holdings of equities by311 billion, after they had failed to buy any
new shares on balance in the previous quar-ter.
The inflow of resources to domestic invest-
ment funds between October and December1999, at 327
12billion, was distinctly larger
than in the preceding three months ( 317 bil-
lion). However, only the specialised funds setup for institutional investors benefited fromthat rise; the amount accruing to them, at322
12billion, was almost three times as
large as in the previous quarter ( 3712billion).

Deposit and lending business of
monetary financial institutions (MFIs)with domestic customers
In the deposit business of domestic MFIs, the
seasonally adjusted overnight deposits of do-mestic investors were run down in the fourthquarter of 1999, after having grown stronglyduring the first three quarters of 1999. Thedecline was mostly concentrated in Decem-ber, when enterprises repatriated far fewerfunds from the Euromarket than they had inprevious years, and households greatly en-larged their currency holdings in order tocope with difficulties expected in connectionwith the millennium change. In addition, thegreat buoyancy of Christmas trading nodoubt also contributed to the sharp contrac-tion of households’ overnight deposits.
Moreover, during the fourth quarter some
overnight deposits were apparently switchedto shorter-term time deposits, which evident-ly became more attractive on interest-rategrounds. Deposits with agreed maturities of
up to two years increased by 319.8 billion,
after having gone up only marginally in theprevious quarter and having actually been re-duced markedly in the second quarter. Duringthe fourth quarter of 1999, the interest ratespaid on three-month time deposits rose byone-half of a percentage point in connectionwith the end of the year and with the inter-est-rate increase by the ECB Governing Coun-cil on November 4. Deposits with an agreedmaturity of over two years went up by 310.5
billion between October and December,whereas they had declined by 35.6 billion in
the comparable period of the preceding year.Unlike the situation in the previous quarter,when the rise by 37.5 billion had been entire-
ly due to the demand of domestic insuranceenterprises for such longer-term deposits,Movement of the lending and deposits

26employees were now likewise accumulating
long-term time deposits again.
Deposits at agreed notice of up to three
months rose by 34.8 billion in the fourth
quarter, and thus significantly more slowlythan usual at that time of year. That presum-ably owes something not only to the slightlysmaller amount of interest credited to savingsaccounts than in previous years, but above allto the distinctly slackening interest in higher-yielding special savings facilities, which in re-cent years have been almost solely respon-sible for the growth of deposits at agreed no-tice of up to three months. The reduction inlonger-term savings deposits (those at agreednotice of over three months), which has beenvisible for years, persisted in the fourth quar-ter of 1999 after seasonal adjustment.MFIs’ lending to domestic enterprises and in-
dividuals in the period under review wassomewhat weaker than in the two precedingquarters. While lending to the domestic pri-vate sector had increased at a seasonally ad-justed annual rate of about 6
12% at that
time, in the fourth quarter of 1999 the paceof growth slowed to 5
12%. It was primarily
the expansion of loans to the domestic pri-vate sector that slackened further; seasonallyadjusted and expressed as an annual rate,such growth amounted to 4
12% between
October and December. After seasonal ad-justment, medium and long-term loans wereless in demand than before, especially amongself-employed persons. Short-term loans todomestic enterprises and individuals, whichhad been run down relatively strongly in thethird quarter, continued to decrease slightly.However, the decline was confined to De-cember. In the fourth quarter of 1999, do-mestic MFIs again strongly increased (by313.8 billion) their portfolios of securities
issued by domestic enterprises, albeit ratherless than in the third quarter. Where MFIsbought those securities in the secondary mar-ket, the purchases did not involve any flow offunds to private issuers.
Domestic general government debt to do-
mestic MFIs increased by 34.7 billion in the
fourth quarter of 1999, compared with a de-crease by 33.3 billion one year earlier. These
contrary trends were substantially due on bal-ance to portfolio transactions by the MFIs,which ran down their holdings of domesticgovernment bonds distinctly less in the lastquarter of 1999 (by 31.5 billion) than in pre-
ceding years. By contrast, loans to generalSeasonally adjusted

28Economic conditions
in GermanyUnderlying trends
In autumn 1999, the German economy con-
tinued along the path of growth on to whichit had moved during the summer months.The Bundesbank’s initial estimates indicate a
34% rise in real gross domestic product in the
fourth quarter in seasonally and working-day-adjusted terms. This was roughly as much asin the preceding three-month period andsignifies a year-on-year rise in overall outputof 2
12%, compared with 112% in the previ-
ous quarter. In the second half of 1999 as awhole, GDP was thus around 2% higherthan in the corresponding period of 1998.The pace of the economic upswing – meas-ured as a seasonally and working-day-adjusted annual rate – amounted to approxi-mately 3% in autumn.
There has been a marked increase in the de-
gree of overall capacity utilisation recently,and the labour market situation brightenedperceptibly at the turn of the year. The under-lying conditions for the current year are thusalso favourable. The leading indicators thatare available point to the economic expansioncontinuing, which is reflected not least by theimproved business confidence of enterprisesand consumers. Current domestic pricetrends continue to be influenced by the up-ward thrust of external prices and, togetherwith other factors, this will lead to a “pricebulge” in the first few months of this year.Even so, the basic underlying price climatehas remained largely unaffected. As far as it ispossible to determine, the rise in prices forimported intermediate goods has not led tostrong cost pressure so far. The 2000 payOverall output

29round, which has now started, should con-
tribute to wage-rate policy not jeopardisingthe favourable economic prospects.
As before, industry was generating strong
stimuli to the upswing up to the end of theperiod under review. Surveys show a markedimprovement in enterprises’ sentiment. Therewas a noticeable improvement in the businessclimate ascertained by the ifo institute, and itwas increasingly obvious that favourableopinions were outnumbering the judgementsthat remained guarded. The outlook for ex-ports, which was judged to be favourable,continued to be the main factor underpin-ning this improvement. This outlook is mainlya reflection of the upturn in international eco-nomic activity and world trade, which islargely due to the quite rapid improvement inthe Asian emerging markets and the continu-ing strength of the US economy. In addition,the German economy itself has successfullyendeavoured to meet the requirements ofcompetition by means of rationalisation andmodernisation. Stable underlying conditionsare provided by relatively low inflation ratesand capital market conditions that remaincomparatively favourable. Price competitive-ness is being additionally supported by thecontinued strength of the US dollar againstthe euro.
Domestic trends are also likely to have posi-
tively influenced industrial sentiment and tohave contributed substantially to a growingmajority of enterprises now describing thecurrent situation as good. Not only did cyclic-al expansionary trends become more pro-nounced, economic policymakers set a posi-tive tone in several respects, too. This includes
the Federal Government’s commitment topursuing a clear course of consolidation. Fur-thermore, the Government has promisedgreater tax relief than was previously envis-aged.
The improvement in industry also spread to
the business prospects for commercial serviceproviders. According to the surveys of theZentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsfor-schung (Centre for European Economic Re-
search), computer specialists and firms ofmanagement consultants, in particular, gavefavourable assessments. Moreover, the cyclic-al upturn benefited the forwarding industry.More consumer-oriented industries, by con-trast, remained circumspect. This may be dueto the fact that, according to surveys of theconsumer research institution, Gesellschaft
für Konsumforschung, households were cau-
tious in assessing the climate for consumptionup to the beginning of the current year. Al-though general expectations of cyclical trendshave become more optimistic, there has notyet been a fundamental improvement in per-sonal income prospects from the point ofview of households. The fact that turnover inthe retail trade in the autumn months of1999 was a seasonally adjusted 1% higherthan in the third quarter is consistent withthere nevertheless having been a rise in thepropensity to purchase.
According to the surveys of the ifo institute,
the past few months have not produced anyfurther reduction in the construction sector’spredominantly negative assessment of thecurrent situation. This is indicative of the fact

30that efforts to overcome the largely structural
difficulties of adjustment came to a halt inthe second half of 1999. As is revealed by thequite favourable business expectations inwestern Germany up to the present, westGerman construction firms are, however,comparatively upbeat about future develop-ments in this respect. In eastern Germany, bycontrast, even the outlook is assessed pessim-istically.Orders
The volume of orders in the manufacturing
sector, which has been on the rise since au-tumn 1998, increased again appreciably inthe fourth quarter of last year. In seasonallyand price-adjusted terms, orders were justover 2
12% up on the preceding quarter, and
rose by slightly more than one-tenth on theyear. This was, however, also due to specialfactors. Firstly, there was an increase in thenumber of reporting firms and, secondly, sev-eral larger-than-average new orders wereplaced in the period under review.
Both factors affected domestic business and
contributed to the level of incoming orders inthe last quarter of 1999 being a seasonallyadjusted 3
12% higher than in the preceding
three-month period. Year-on-year growth ac-celerated to almost 8%, compared with nomore than
14% in summer. The order intake
was particularly buoyant in the capital goodssector. After undergoing a fall of almost 3%in the third quarter of 1999 against the cor-responding period of 1998, orders at the endof the period under review were slightly morethan one-tenth up on the year. The manufac-turers of intermediate goods likewise report-ed an increase in new orders; their annualgrowth rate went up from 3
34% in summer
to 834% in the period under review. The
clear upward trend in incoming orders con-tinued in both the chemical industry and themetal-working industry. By contrast, therewas scarcely any seasonally adjusted rise inorders placed with manufacturers of durableand non-durable goods in autumn 1999 com-pared with the corresponding period ofSeasonally adjusted, quarterly, log. scale

311998; as had already been the case for more
than one year, they again remained (by about1
34%) below their level of 12 months previ-
ously. The main reason for this was a declinein orders for motor vehicles.
In the fourth quarter of 1999, foreign de-
mand for industrial products exceeded itssummer level by around 1
14% in seasonally
adjusted terms. This is all the more note-worthy since export demand had alreadybeen very buoyant during the precedingmonths. This is mirrored by a year-on-yeargrowth rate of no less than 16% for the lastquarter of 1999; in the fourth quarter of1998, by contrast, the annual rate of changewas still negative (– 3
14%). Even though all
major industrial sectors achieved double-digityear-on-year growth rates, the intermediategoods sector was well to the forefront withan increase of around 20%, while the manu-facturers of durable and non-durable goodsremained quite clearly below the average.
In the reporting on incoming orders in the
manufacturing sector, reference was made –as had also frequently been the case earlier –to individual, particularly large-scale orders.Knowing this makes it easier to assess theorders placed with firms in terms of their im-portance to current economic developments.Large orders normally require longer organ-isational lead and production-related process-ing times, which result in a relaxation of theusually quite close time relationship betweenan order being received and production.Large orders therefore overstate the cyclicaltrend at the end of the series, although they,too, have a positive impact on economicgrowth and employment, of course. A good
example of this is the economic sector“manufacture of other transport equip-ment”. In this sector, for example, the statis-tics combine the building and repairing ofships and boats, the manufacture of aircraftand spacecraft as well as the manufacture ofrailway and tramway locomotives and rollingstock. Each individual order placed in one ofthese subsectors usually has a comparativelylarge volume and pushes up the quantity ofnew orders. Production, by contrast, re-sponds to this only progressively and withoutany strong fluctuations – as is apparent fromthe chart on this page.

32orders in the construction sector on an aver-
age of October and November (more recentstatistical data are unavailable at present)were down by 5
12% on the preceding quar-
ter. Since the figures for the previous quarterhad already been lower than those for thespring, there was an overall decline in de-mand of almost one-tenth since the secondquarter. The level was 6
14% down on the
year at the end of the period under review.The level of new orders decreased particularly
sharply in eastern Germany, where the overalldecline since the second quarter of the yeartotalled almost one-fourth in seasonally ad-justed terms; in October/November, the rateof change from the previous year came toaround – 18%. In western Germany, by con-trast, the slowdown has so far been muchmore limited. In seasonally adjusted terms,the spring figure was undershot by 4%, andthe annual rate of change was just under–2% .
Industrial construction still managed more or
less to hold its own in the autumn. In this sec-tor, the overall level of new orders in Ger-many was no lower than in the summer. Al-though the public sector, taken by itself, cutback its orders sharply (– 6
12% in seasonally
adjusted terms), the decline in the housingsector was much sharper, at somewhat morethan 12%.
Taking construction permits as a yardstick,
construction of rented housing and owner-occupied dwellings was drastically curtailed.On an average of October and November, thenumber of dwellings in buildings with threeor more units, for which a permit was grant-ed, was slightly more than one-fifth down onthe year. Permits for 27,500 dwellings hadbeen requested in October and November1998, whereas only 21,800 dwellings wereapplied for in the same period of 1999.Among the reasons for this decline are a highlevel of housing provision in western Ger-many, which limits the rise in rental pay-ments, and a large number of vacant dwell-ings in parts of eastern Germany, which, inSeasonally adjusted, quarterly, log. scale

33some regions, amount to up to one-sixth of
the housing stock. In addition, given the (inany case) depressed profit expectations andthe increased interest rate level, investmentdecisions in this sector may be influenced bythe fact that a revision of the tenancy law isplanned, which is intended to restrict thescope for rent increases.
The number of construction permits for
single-family houses (buildings with 1 or2 dwellings), by contrast, showed a furtherincrease in the autumn, although this did notoffset the decline in apartment house con-struction. At all events, this segment’s sharein housing construction rose latterly to 64%,compared with just under 57% one year earl-ier. The submission of applications for build-ing permits may have been boosted duringthe last few months of 1999 by the fact thatincome limits for tax concessions for the ac-quisition of residential property were loweredat the beginning of this year.
Output and labour market
Industrial production is likely to have been
stepped up further in view of the broad flowof orders. However, there is no statistical evi-dence to support this at present. Instead, theofficial data currently available for the manu-facturing sector suggest a seasonally adjusteddecline in output of about
12% in the fourth
quarter compared with the summer. How-ever, it should be noted in this context thatthe monthly figures, which are collected froma selection of reporting firms, give an exces-sively unfavourable picture of the overall per-formance when compared with the quarterly
figures, which cover all the firms required toreport. In the third quarter, the corrective fac-tor amounted to + 2%. It is still uncertain atpresent to what extent the figures for theperiod from October to December will haveto be adjusted.
An increase in output during the fourth quar-
ter is suggested, for one thing, by the factthat – according to the ifo surveys – utilisationof production capacity in industry increasedconsiderably during the autumn months. Inseasonally adjusted terms, capacity utilisationin December was around
34percentage point
higher than at the end of the summer and1 percentage point up on the year. For an-other, price-adjusted turnover in the manu-facturing sector in the last quarter of 1999Seasonally adjusted, quarterly

34was 1% higher than in the preceding three-

Precise information on developments in out-
put in the construction sector is likewise un-available at present. In this sector – unlike thethree-month period from October to Decem-ber – the statistical data for the precedingperiod have not yet been adjusted to the re-sults of the overall survey. During the pastfew years, incorporating them has regularlyled to an upward revision. Therefore, it maybe assumed that the seasonally adjusted in-crease in output that is currently shown willnot be maintained in the fourth quarter. Theyear-on-year rate of change, which is alreadyfinal, shows that the basic trend in output inthe last three months of 1999 was scarcelyhigher than one year before.On the labour market, there have recently
been growing signs of a change for the bet-ter. Firstly, overall employment in the Germaneconomy rose again slightly according to theFederal Statistical Office and, secondly, theunemployment rate around the turn of1999–2000 was distinctly lower than in thesummer of 1999. According to the officialstatistics, the number of persons in workamounted to a seasonally adjusted 36.08 mil-lion in November. Although this was 0.2%less than in the same period of 1998, it wassomewhat more than in September, whenthe decline in employment, which had per-sisted since the spring of 1999, came to anend. Information from industry suggests thatthere was no further net fall in that sector.The construction industry, by contrast, is likelyto have continued to shed jobs.
According to the data of the Federal Labour
Office, the number of persons out of workwent down to a seasonally adjusted 3.96 mil-lion in January. This was around 165,000fewer than at the end of September; theyear-on-year figure again showed a declineof 160,000, after the difference had dwin-dled to just under 10,000 in October.
The unemployment rate at the end of January
came to a seasonally adjusted 10.1%, com-pared with 10.5% at the beginning of au-tumn 1999. Whereas the share of un-employed persons in western Germany, at8.3%, was perceptibly lower, it was morethan twice as high in eastern Germany. In thenew Länder, 17.5% of the labour force wereregistered as unemployed at the end of theperiod under review, compared with 17.2%

this increase is the curtailment of labour mar-ket policy measures. In January, no more than390,000 persons in eastern Germany weretaking part in vocational training courses andjob-creation measures, which still account fora major part of labour-market promotion; thiswas 150,000 fewer than 12 months earlier.
Prices and wages
The upsurge in prices accelerated again
slightly at the beginning of 2000. The year-on-year rate of change in consumer prices,which is often used as a measure of inflation,reached 1.6% in January; at the end of1999, the year-on-year rate had been 1.2%,and in mid-year it had been 0.5%. However,the rise in the annual rate of inflation owedsomething to a number of special factors,which means that those figures do not reflectthe underlying tendency of general price de-velopments. Firstly, energy taxes on petroland electricity were raised at the beginning ofthe year. Arithmetically, this signifies a con-sumer price increase of 0.2%. Secondly,baseline effects made themselves felt. Theseresulted from the substantial lowering of tele-phone charges and the reduction in contribu-tion payments to prescription medicines,which had been recorded at the beginning of1999 and are now no longer reflected in ayear-on-year comparison. Excluding petroland electricity as well as telephone chargesand contribution payments, the year-on-yearrate amounted to 1.0% in January, comparedwith 0.9% in December 1999.The prices for mineral oil products (before
tax) remained largely stable around the turnof 1999–2000. Before that, however, theyhad increased perceptibly in the wake of thesharp rise in crude oil prices on the inter-national markets. Excluding the estimated taxincrease, heating oil and petrol were 4
34%
more expensive in January than at the end ofsummer 1999. Compared with January 1999,the price rise amounted to about one-quarter.Owing to their linkage to heating oil, gasprices likewise showed upward movement.The same applies to tenants’ district heatingand hot water costs. However, the generalenergy price increase was curbed by furtherreductions in electricity charges. Excludingthe computational tax effect, electricitycharges were lowered by about 8

Services have likewise become appreciably
more expensive at the consumer level recently.Prices in this sector were raised by slightlymore than 1%, seasonally adjusted, betweenSeptember and January. The main factors con-tributing to this development were insuranceservices, package tours and education ser-vices. There were further increases in housing
rents, too. In terms of the year-on-year rate ofprice change, the low point now appears tohave been passed in this sector; in January,the annual rate of increase was 1.2%, havingbeen no more than 1.0% in September.
By contrast, price movements in the case of
food and industrial products, which togetheraccount for almost half of the basket ofgoods, remained comparatively moderate upto the end of the period under review. Thelevel of prices for food was roughly 1
34%
down on the year in January. This is substan-tially attributable to the major chain stores’fierce competitive struggle to gain marketshares. At the beginning of 2000, consumerprices for industrial products were no higherthan 12 months before. In this sector, too,markets are being affected by keen competi-tion, which may even have intensified in theeuro area as a result of the introduction of asingle currency.
This is supported by the fact that German in-
dustrial producer prices for durable goodshave remained virtually unchanged for thelast nine months and that the year-on-yearrate of price increases has not exceeded+
12% for quite some time. At the start of
2000, prices for domestic non-durable indus-trial goods, which include food products andbeverages, continued to be around

mediate goods. In this sector, the upsurge inprices for mineral oil products combined withprice increases for iron and steel as well asnon-ferrous metals.
Import prices for those products likewise
went up noticeably under the impact of theworld markets. In the field of mining products(crude oil and non-ferrous metals), the year-on-year price increase amounted to around85% in December 1999, and prices for inter-mediate goods rose by no less than just under10% on the year. Although the rise in pricesfor imported capital, durable and non-durable goods also accelerated during thepast few months (not least owing to the de-cline in the euro exchange rate), the annualrates of increase, at between slightly less than1% and almost 1
12%, remained within com-
paratively narrow bounds up to the end ofthe period under review.
Domestic prices for construction work re-
mained largely unchanged up to the end oflast year. Although the aggregate construc-tion price level – which combines individualinformation on residential construction, com-mercial and office buildings, and road con-struction – increased slightly in seasonally ad-justed terms in the fourth quarter of 1999,the rise did not exceed the correspondinglevel in 1998.

38Macroeconomic requirements for a pay-rate policy fostering employment
Setting the level of wages in an economy is a com-
plex process of weighing-up and reconciling a largenumber of different considerations. Mechanisticderivations of the appropriate increases in wagesand salaries are scarcely possible for the individualpay agreements at the sectoral and regional level.However, from a macroeconomic perspective, it isentirely possible to develop criteria for assessing abasic employment-oriented strategy. Not only in theeconomic literature, but also in the broad guide-lines of the economic policies of the European Com-munity’s member states, for example, which havebeen approved by the European heads of govern-ment, the following determinants of a pay-rate pol-icy for promoting employment are used as a yard-stick:
1. Nominal wage increases must be consistent with
price stability
The ESCB has made it clear that price increases
which are inconsistent with the stability object-ive will not be “financed”. The monetary policystrategy is medium-term-oriented. This requiresmarket players and, in particular, managementand labour to adopt a forward-looking approachwhich disregards short-term volatilities and non-monetary shocks to which the price level is ex-posed. If, for example, there is a rise in oil pricesor indirect taxes, the resultant distribution effectin favour of non-residents and the governmentmust be accepted. Attempts to shift those bur-dens entirely to the corporate sector would ei-ther trigger further inflationary impulses or,owing to the decline in profits, reduce employ-ment opportunities. The oil-price and tax-in-duced year-on-year rate of inflation will at allevents probably amount to roughly 0.5 percent-age point in 2000. However, market participantsgenerally expect oil prices to drop significantlyagain in the further course of the year. Moreover,an accumulation of special factors will result in a“price bulge” in the first quarter of 2000, andthis fact must be taken into account when assess-ing the “price component”. Even if the oil price(which is currently at just under US$ 29 per barrelof Brent oil) and the euro exchange rate remainat their present levels, the year-on-year inflationrate will go down significantly from the springonwards. In spite of the current comparativelyhigh rate of consumer price inflation, which was1.6% in January, the Federal Government, in itsAnnual Economic Report for the year 2000, hasput overall inflation at no more than 1% or1
1/2%.2. A general gearing of the envisaged level of real
wages to productivity is entirely appropriate ina situation of full employment. If there is highunemployment – as has been the case for manyyears –, the scope for real wage increases is, bycontrast, limited.
The profitability of capacity-extending and job-
creating investment must be strengthened andmaintained. In practice, this means that the risein real wages must be lower than the expectedgrowth in productivity if employment is to rise.The margin required is not easily determinedempirically. By no means can there be a distribu-tion of that part of the statistically measuredproductivity gain which results from the shed-ding of jobs. This would only “cement” un-employment. The Council of Experts for the As-sessment of Overall Economic Trends has pro-posed that real wage increases be geared to thatrate of productivity growth at which the largestnumber of unemployed – i.e. including thosepersons with a productivity which is below cur-rent average – would be able to find new jobs.
3. The wage structure is to be geared to the pat-
tern of productivity
Uniform wage increases in all sectors of the
economy do not accommodate the differingskills of employees and the specific job require-ments, nor do they take account of the necessarystructural adjustments in the individual sectorsand regions. The potential for job opportunitiescan be fully utilised only if there is a local “fine-tuning” of wages. Both sides of industry canplay a crucial part in this by setting a frameworkwhich is as flexible as possible. This would alsoleave enough scope for laying greater stressagain on the idea of gearing wages and salariesmore to performance.
Overall, wage trends should provide a reliable basis
for corporate decisions and therefore be longer-term-oriented and forward-looking. A basic strat-egy of this kind would make it possible not only tomaintain the high degree of price stability that hasbeen achieved but also – embedded in a non-infla-tionary and stable macroeconomic environment –to strengthen the foundations of economic growthon a sustained basis and enhance the job-creatingefficiency of the growth process.

39growth rate of consumer prices of 0.6%, ne-
gotiated real wages and salaries went up by2%, compared with a rise of
34% one year
earlier. However, owing – inter alia – to the re-
duction in wages paid above the agreed scale,the increase in actual earnings was not ashigh. Nevertheless, labour costs increasedmarkedly from the enterprises’ perspective.Overall unit labour costs rose by
34%, after
having declined in the two years before.Labour’s share in the national income (adjust-ed for shifts in the employment pattern),which is a rough measure of the functionaldistribution of income, was around 72
34%a t
the end of the period under review; this wasjust under 0.5 percentage point more than inthe good period for the economy during theearly nineties.
1Compared with the average of
the nineties, the difference in 1999 amountedto –
34percentage point.
An appropriate share in output growth and the
demand for compensation for the decline inthe purchasing power of money usually play akey role in pay bargaining. A productivity-oriented real wage policy attempts to accom-modate the dual nature of wages as produc-tion costs for enterprises and demand-relevantcomponent of households. If the imputed infla-tion rate remains consistent with the centralbank’s anti-inflation policy objective, and if theimputed rate of productivity corresponds to thegeneral increase in labour productivity, wagesare not expected to cause macroeconomic dis-turbances. Moreover, there is no change in theprimary distribution ratio between enterprises’profits and employee’s wages and salaries.However, such a strategy requires a labourmarket which is largely in equilibrium. If, bycontrast, there is high unemployment – as is the
case in Germany – management and labourbear particular responsibility in terms of em-ployment policy. Wage developments shouldpromote, or at least not hamper, the creationof new jobs. Consequently, on January 9 ofthis year, the parties involved in the Bündnis für
Arbeit, Ausbildung und Wettbewerbsfähigkeit(Alliance for Jobs, Training and Competitive-ness) agreed in a joint declaration torecommend that employment-oriented andlonger-term agreements be concluded in theforthcoming pay round.
The appropriate wage level and wage struc-
ture cannot be settled precisely in advance atthe “negotiating table”: instead, they have tobe verified repeatedly against market per-formance. Nevertheless, a number of generalobservations can be made, which may serveas macroeconomic benchmarks (see the noteson page 38). Accordingly, a “pay-rate policywith staying power”, which uses some of thereal scope for income distribution for preserv-ing or creating new competitive jobs, can playa major part in bringing relief to the labourmarket. When assessing the price componentin wage settlements, pay settlements shouldtake account of the fact that the relativelyhigh annual inflation rates recorded in the firstquarter of this year are due to an accumula-tion of special factors; later on in the year,rates of inflation are likely to fall again signifi-cantly in a year-on-year comparison.
1The adjustment of labour’s share in the national income
is confined here – as usual – to the aspect of changes in
the employment ratio. There is also empirical evidence
that the development of labour’s share in the national in-
come has also been influenced, over the longer term, by
shifts in the sectoral distribution of employment.Requirements

Exports remained one of the main economic
driving forces in Germany during the fourthquarter of 1999. Orders received by Germanindustry from abroad grew sharply in the lastfew months of the year. At the same time ex-porters’ business expectations improved dra-matically whereas in the first six months of1999 pessimism only gradually gave way to amore positive outlook. Evidently the recoveryin Germany’s traditional export markets in thepartner countries of the euro area and in theother EU countries contributed most to themore optimistic sentiment that returned toGerman enterprises at the turn of the year.True, the competitive advantages associatedwith the depreciation of the euro against thecurrencies of non-euro-area countries like-wise improved exporters’ sales opportunitiesand to that extent helped to foster the recov-ery process; however, currency factors areunlikely to have been the crucial source ofstimuli given the great importance of intra-European trade and the frequently voicedview that exchange-rate advantages wereprobably only a temporary influence.
Although the seasonally adjusted value of ex-
ports rose by only
12% throughout the fourth
quarter of 1999 compared with the thirdquarter last year, it exceeded the level in thefourth quarter of 1998 by 10%. What ismore, the momentum behind this growth iseven greater than this figure suggests be-cause export sales in the first half of last yearwere below the level in the correspondingperiod of the previous year.

41the increase of approximately 9% compared
with the previous year is considerable. If ac-count is also taken of the fact that the ordersreceived by German industry grew muchmore strongly at the same time, namely by16
12% in value and just over 16% in real
terms, vigorous export growth can be expect-ed to continue in the near future, too.
Expansionary demand stimuli from abroad
came from virtually all of the market sectorsthat are important for German exporters. Thisunderlines the fact that the upward trendhad gained momentum both in regionalterms and in terms of the breakdown ofgoods. German exports to the other euro-area countries had been rising particularlysharply since the end of last summer. In thefour months from August to November (re-gional figures for December 1999 are not yetavailable) exports to customers in the euroarea grew by almost 5
12%, seasonally adjust-
ed, compared with the earlier period (April toJuly).
German exports of goods to non-euro-area
countries increased somewhat more slowlyduring the same period (by 3
12%). However,
trade with some countries expanded remark-ably fast. This applies in particular to theUnited Kingdom (15
12%) where growth had
recovered relatively quickly after the earlierweakness and where German and other sup-pliers from the euro area found favourablecompetitive conditions owing to the appreci-ation of the pound. In the former crisis coun-tries in South-East Asia, too, German export-ers again encountered greater demand; ex-ports to the region increased by 5
12% in thefour months under review. Furthermore, the
greater oil revenue of the OPEC countries isevidently now beginning to be reflected in acorresponding increase in import demand(just over 2
12%) whereas these countries’
powers to absorb were considerably restrict-ed during the Asian crisis. By contrast, exportsto the United States, where German suppliershad been participating intensively in the dy-namic market growth for some time, did notrise any further during the period under re-view. Exports to Japan continued to decline(– 1
12%) despite the considerable appreci-
ation of the yen against the euro; up to theend of the year the Japanese economy wasundermined by a lack of consumer and in-vestor confidence.DM

42Real imports of goods by Germany did not
keep pace with export growth during the lastquarter of 1999. Although the seasonally ad-justed value of imports rose by just over 1%compared with the previous three-monthperiod, the prices of imported goods in-creased by just under 3% in the final quarterowing to the sharp rise in the price of energyimports and the depreciation of the euro,with the result that real imports declinedslightly in the last few months of 1999. Witha rise of 4
12% in the fourth quarter of last
year, however, they were significantly abovethe level in the corresponding quarter of1998. This means that, compared with thegrowth in gross domestic product, which, ac-cording to provisional calculations, was2
14% greater in the fourth quarter of 1999
than a year earlier, German import demandremained within the longer-term average.
By contrast, the trend in nominal imports and
the breakdown of these imports have beenstrongly influenced by oil price rises for sometime. German import turnover with the majorcountries supplying petroleum, mineral oilproducts and natural gas has risen according-ly. For example, the value of imports fromOPEC countries, which recently supplied28% of Germany’s oil imports, increased by aseasonally adjusted 19
12% in the four
months from August to November. The rise inimports from the countries in transition incentral and eastern Europe (7%) is also dueprimarily to the increase in mineral oil andnatural gas imported from Russia. The equallysharp rise (of just over 5%) in German im-ports of goods from the other euro-areacountries is particularly remarkable againstRegional breakdown of foreign trade

43this background because this rise is not so
much a result of the price effects mentionedas a reflection of the cyclical upturn and theclose economic interdependence of the euroarea. By contrast, imports from the UnitedStates (despite the exchange-rate-relatedprice rises) increased only slightly, at
12%.
Apparently the strength of the US dollar isincreasingly having a curbing effect on realUS exports to the euro area.
The shifts in the price constellation in foreign
trade in favour of the oil producing countriesand the trading partners with appreciatingcurrencies ultimately prevented Germany’strade surplus from rising any further in thelast quarter of 1999. After the elimination ofseasonal factors the surplus amounted to 315
billion in the fourth quarter compared withjust over 315
12billion in the third quarter.
The somewhat smaller trade surplus, how-
ever, was accompanied by a significantlylarger deficit in the invisible current transac-tions with non-residents. The seasonally ad-justed deficit on services, factor income andcurrent transfers rose from 319
12billion in
the third quarter of last year to 324 billion in
the final quarter. The main reason for this re-sult was the larger deficit on service transac-tions with non-residents. However, a furtherrise in deficits was to be found in other invis-ible segments, too; this applies both to thebalance on factor income and – to a lesser ex-tent – current transfers to non-residents.Consequently, the German current accountran a total seasonally adjusted deficit of al-most 310 billion in the final quarter of 1999compared with one of just under 34
12billion
in the third quarter.
Financial transactions
Germany’s international financial transactions
during the final quarter of 1999 were charac-terised by special flows and the end-of-yearinvestment decisions of internationally orient-ed operators. Several large corporate mergerstook place in the period under review. Directinvestment flows, especially those recorded inthe balance of payments, swelled significantlyas a result, and portfolio transactions werealso affected to some extent. However, themillennium change and uncertainty about fu-ture interest-rate and exchange-rate develop-ments appear to have resulted in shifts intoCurrent account

there were net capital exports through directinvestment but capital imports through port-folio transactions.
If the balance of the securities transactions is
considered, there was little change from thethird quarter. While net capital imports of 39
billion were recorded between July and Sep-tember, these amounted to 36 billion in the
subsequent three-month period. Overall,however, there was also a slight decline incross-border securities flows (gross).
Non-residents, in particular, invested less in
the German market in the period under re-view than in the previous period (approxi-mately 34 billion less at 347 billion). Given
the see-sawing of long-term interest rates,foreign demand for German bonds and notesdeclined particularly sharply. 38

foreign funds flowed into the German bondmarket between October and Decembercompared with 324
12billion in the three

The weak demand for German bonds and
notes was presumably connected with for-eign investors’ growing preference for liquid-ity. At all events, they acquired Germanmoney market paper worth 323

with the year 2000 problem, the oscillation inlong-term interest rates (albeit with a distinctupward trend), speculation about an interestrate rise by the ECB and the ability of Germanbanks to offer more attractive terms in short-term deposit business since the introductionof remuneration for minimum reserves in theEurosystem probably encouraged increasedforeign investment in German money marketpaper. It must also be remembered, however,that the securitised money market had beenless well developed in Germany than in othercountries and that a process of catching uphad possibly emerged in Germany as a resultof monetary union. At all events, some of thetransactions recorded appear to be due tointerbank operations within the euro area.
Foreign interest in German shares also in-
creased slightly again towards the end of theyear ( 311 billion in the fourth quarter com-
pared with 310 billion in the previous one).
The improved economic outlook in Germanyand the announcement of changes in tax le-gislation which, among other things, are de-signed to make it easier to sell enterprises’participating interests and, in the case of cor-porations, to exempt the resultant profitsfrom tax led to a proper “end-of-year rally” inthe equity market and presumably attractedforeign investors as well.

46mained below the level in the previous quar-
ter. German investment in foreign securitiesmarkets also declined somewhat during thequarter under review even if it did not do soquite as sharply as foreign investment in Ger-man securities. Overall, German investorspurchased foreign securities worth 340
12bil-
lion between October and December com-pared with 342 billion in the previous three-
month period. More than one-half of thissum was invested in foreign shares ( 323
12
billion), approximately 310 billion of it result-
ing from a single direct investment transac-tion.
1It is obvious, however, that German
savers, too, continued to regard the macro-economic environment in the investmentcountries as fairly favourable and concen-trated their investments on the purchase offund units in foreign shares. However, it wasnot only the funds accruing to German in-vestment companies that rose again sharply;sales of share certificates issued by foreign in-vestment funds also strengthened somewhat(36
12billion) in the final quarter of 1999.
The products offered by these funds evidentlycorresponded to the preferences of some cus-tomers even better than those of Germaninstitutional investors.
In contrast to their dealings in shares and in-
vestment fund certificates German residents’investment in foreign bonds and notes wasdecidedly modest – as was the case with non-residents’ investment in the German market.Between October and December Germanresidents invested no more than 310
12billion
in this paper compared with 31812billion in
the previous quarter. Evidently uncertaintyover interest rates had kept German investorsfrom investing more heavily in paper that is
responsive to interest rate changes. Exchangerate risks were also avoided: as has been thecase since the beginning of last year, morethan 90% of the foreign bonds and notespurchased were denominated in euro and byfar the majority were issued in other euro-area countries. The average interest rateadvantage of ten-year government bondsissued by other euro-area countries overFederal German bonds was little changed atapproximately 20 basis points.
In contrast to what happened in portfolio
transactions, there were net capital outflowsthrough direct investment in the period underreview. At 36 billion, however, this was
somewhat less pronounced than in the threemonths earlier ( 39
12billion). The direct in-
vestment flows in both directions were essen-tially the result of several large corporate mer-gers. German enterprises in the telecommu-nications sector, in particular, added substan-
1If corporate mergers are settled on the basis of an ex-
change of equity, bookings of portfolio transactions may
arise in addition to direct investment flows. This happens
if shareholders with participating interests of less than
10% are involved; in the case of participating interests of
10% and above the transactions count as direct invest-
ment. In the case of the transaction concerned here the
former German shareholders received, in the course of
the merger, shares of the newly established foreign public
limited company in compensation for the transfer of their
old shares.
In the quarter under review two further mergers had an
impact on the cross-border transactions with German
shares. In the one case the former (foreign) shareholders
of the (foreign) enterprise taken over received shares is-
sued by the (German) company carrying out the take-
over; a purchase of German shares by non-residents had
therefore to be recorded in the balance of payments. In
the other case some of the shares of a German enterprise
were already held by non-residents. These shares were
transferred to the German credit institutions commis-
sioned to implement the merger and were recorded in
the balance of payments statistics as the sale of German
shares by non-residents. Both transactions were similar in
size with the result that they cancelled out.... shares

47tially to their participations abroad. In this
rapidly expanding economic sector therehave repeatedly been cross-border alliancesbetween major market players for some years– since the opening-up of the previously pro-tected national markets. The rapid techno-logical advances and the efforts made byfirms to be able to offer a wide selection ofservices in as many countries as possible arefostering the merger process. All in all, Ger-man enterprises invested just under 339 bil-
lion abroad between October and December1999.
Conversely, a larger volume of funds ( 332
12
billion) flowed into Germany through direct
investment in the fourth quarter of 1999than in the first nine months of last year as awhole. The fourth-quarter result was primar-ily affected by a merger in the chemical indus-try, during the course of which the newly es-tablished parent company set up its regis-tered head office abroad. It took over theshares of the local enterprise, whose share-holders received shares in the new publiclimited company in compensation – as de-scribed above. Although the short-termfinancial transactions between affiliated en-terprises that had dominated the area of dir-ect investment in earlier months increasedthe level of capital inflows, for the first timein the course of 1999 these did not play a de-cisive role in the period under review owingto the volume of transactions involved in themergers.
By contrast, unsecuritised credit flows result-
ed in net capital imports during the periodunder review. This applies in particular to thetransactions of non-banks. German enter-
prises and individuals received 317 billion net
from non-residents. This sum included furtherrepatriations of bank balances and the raisingof short-term loans abroad. On the otherhand, public authorities exported a smallamount of capital ( 33 billion net), mainly in
connection with the repayment of loans pre-viously taken up abroad.
The cross-border credit flows in the banking
sector, which in gross terms were quite sub-stantial, largely cancelled out. Foreign fundstotalling 314
12billion net accrued to Ger-
man credit institutions in the process. The in-flows were exclusively at the short end of themarket while net capital outflows resultedfrom long-term lending. 5

However, that improvementwas probably not quite sufficient to offset thedeterioration in the first three quarters, inwhich the deficit had increased comparedwith the first nine months of 1998 by 33 bil-
lion to 326 billion. For 1999 as a whole a
slightly larger deficit is therefore expectedthan in 1998 (approximately 328 billion, or
DM 55 billion). A sharp increase in tax re-ceipts was insufficient to fully compensate forthe decline in non-tax revenue (especially theBundesbank profit and, in addition, proceedsfrom asset disposals) and the faster rise in ex-penditure.
Tax receipts
1of the central, regional and local
authorities in the final quarter of last yearwere almost 6% above their level in thefourth quarter of 1998. Receipts from incometaxes increased overall by little more than2
12%, however (compared with 6% in the
third quarter). The main reason for this wasthat corporation tax, following a marked risein the amounts raised during the precedingquarters, yielded almost 5% less than in thefourth quarter of 1998. This may have beencaused by value adjustments to banks’ port-folios. By contrast, the inflow of assessed in-

50come tax showed a further surge (+ 29%).
Both advance tax payments and retrospectivetax payments increased significantly. Wagetax recorded only a moderate increase(+ 1
12%). This contrasted with the two prin-
cipal types of indirect tax, which remainedvery high-yielding. The amount raised fromturnover tax exceeded the figure in the cor-responding quarter of 1998 by over 7%,partly owing to additional receipts resultingfrom changes in tax legislation;

was further affected by the growth of privateconsumption and by investment in housingconstruction and public expenditure on tan-gible goods, which are both subject to turn-over tax. Mineral oil tax yielded as much as11
12% more following the increase in this
tax on April 1, 1999.According to the provisional out-turn (which
includes an estimate for local authority taxes),the amount of taxes raised in 1999 as awhole was just over 6% higher than in theprevious year. This exceeded the amount an-ticipated in the official tax forecast of autumn1998 (on which the 1999 budget figureswere largely based) by 35
12billion. The over-
all tax ratio increased by 0.8 percentage pointto 22.8% (as recorded in the financial statis-tics), but remained below the long-term aver-age.
Only a fairly small part of this rise was due to
the increase in energy taxation. The chiefcause was the strong growth of turnover tax(+ 7%). Another contributory factor was thecontinuing reversal of the erosion of assessedincome tax, not least owing to the ending ofthe special depreciation allowances for invest-ment in eastern Germany. The amount yield-ed by this tax virtually doubled in 1999 to al-most 311 billion, thereby far surpassing initial
expectations. Corporation tax receipts like-wise expanded substantially (+ 21%).
3Even
so, their volume was well down on the figureforecast in the autumn of 1998. Conversely,non-assessed taxes on earnings – whichlargely comprise investment income tax pay-able on dividends – yielded far more than hadbeen initially anticipated due to surprisinglyhigh profit distributions in 1999.

51hand, wage tax – which rose by less than
112% – barely met the expectations of au-
tumn 1998, despite higher negotiated payrates. This was primarily attributable to thelower increase in actual average earnings re-sulting from the strongly negative wage drift.The measures which came into effect at thebeginning of 1999 likewise tended to damp-en wage tax receipts.
The favourable financial trend of the central,
regional and local authorities in the fourthquarter related mainly to the Federal Govern-ment, which recorded a surplus of 34
12bil-
lion – this was twice as high as the budget ex-cess generated in the final quarter of 1998.This was fuelled by very strong growth of taxrevenue and disposals of participating inter-ests, especially the transfer of shares in thepost office enterprise Deutsche Post AG to
the German development bank Kreditanstalt
für Wiederaufbau (KfW). Consequently, the
Federal Government’s overall revenue ex-panded by 8
12%. Expenditure likewise grew
by the rather high rate of 512%, principally
on account of the payments to the Post Of-fice benefit funds and the higher transfers tothe statutory pension insurance scheme.
In 1999 as a whole the Federal Government
reduced its deficit by 32
34billion compared
with 1998 to around 326 billion (not quite
DM 5112billion). This was 3114billion lower
than the amount projected in the budget.Total expenditure was 31
12billion less than
budgeted and just over 5% more than actualexpenditure in 1998.
4Relief was afforded
notably by the fact that the transfers to theFederal Labour Office to make good its deficitwere almost 32 billion less than planned.
Claims on the Federal Government arisingfrom guarantees and other operating ex-penditure were likewise much smaller thanprojected. Together with various other less-than-budgeted expenditures, this more thancompensated for the additional spending dueto unemployment assistance and to the trans-fers to the Federal Railways Fund followingthe failure to sell off the stock of railwayworkers’ dwellings. On the revenue side,taxes exceeded the expected level by almost32
12billion. Moreover, blanket contingency
costs totalling around 31 billion (DM 2 bil-
lion) had been budgeted for to cover possibleTrends in the revenue from major taxes

52revenue shortfalls which failed to materialise,
however. The favourable budgetary trend en-abled the Federal Government to postponescheduled sales of financial assets in theamount of 35
12billion and thus to provide
extra leeway in subsequent budgets.
The position of the Federal Government’s off-
budget special funds deteriorated consider-ably in 1999. The surplus they generated lastyear was probably only half as large as theDM 24 billion they recorded in 1998. Thechief reason for this was the smaller size ofthe Bundesbank profit which – to the extentthat it exceeds DM 7 billion – is allocated tocutting the debt of the Redemption Fund forInherited Liabilities. The part of the Bundes-bank profit available for this purpose fell by34 billion to just over 34
12billion. The co-assumption of the debt of the Redemption
Fund for Inherited Liabilities by the FederalGovernment in mid-1999 also had a negativeimpact on the Fund’s financial balance be-cause it was accompanied by the discontinu-ation of the Federal Government’s grantswhich had previously been paid for the pur-pose of debt redemption, and which hadbeen reflected in a financial surplus for theFund in the same amount.
Full data are not yet available on the fiscal
out-turn of the Länder Governments in thefourth quarter of 1999. The deficit of 34 bil-
lion which they ran up in the first ninemonths of the year was over 33 billion less
than their shortfall at the three-quarter stageof 1998. The Länder Governments’ deficit for1999 as a whole may have amounted tosome 310 billion (roughly DM 20 billion),
compared with DM 26
12billion in 1998. This
was mainly attributable to the buoyant trendin tax revenue. What is more, expendituregrowth was again rather moderate, despitethe cost burdens arising from the relativelyhigh pay settlements.
Although no results are available yet for the
local authorities’ fiscal out-turn in the fourthquarter of 1999, it is likely that they again re-corded a revenue surplus in the year as awhole, which, however, probably failed tomatch the 1998 surplus of almost DM 5 bil-lion. Thus the transfers from the Länder Gov-ernments rose only marginally during the firstthree quarters and receipts from fees andcharges and disposals of participating inter-ests decreased markedly.

The central, regional and local authorities’ net
borrowing in the fourth quarter of 1999 to-talled 311
12billion, after having amounted
to32512billion in the first nine months. The
various levels of government ran down theirmoney market debt by 35
12billion but in-
curred new capital market debt amounting to317 billion. The bulk of this took the form of
sales of Federal bonds (Bunds), at over 38
12
billion, and of five-year special Federal bonds
(Bobls), at just under 36 billion. By contrast,
the government sector redeemed, in particu-lar, Treasury notes and savings bonds on bal-ance.
According to the figures available so far, the
central, regional and local authorities incurredslightly more than 337 billion in net new
debt in the course of 1999, pushing up thecumulative total to around 31.2 trillion. The
year-on-year increase was somewhat greaterthan in 1998. New borrowing primarily tookthe form of Bund issues, which means that
most of the newly incurred debt was onceagain long-dated.
Social security funds
In the last quarter of 1999 the statutory pen-
sion insurance scheme of wage and salaryearners recorded, as expected, a sizeable sur-plus of 35 billion. This was over 31 billion
more than the positive balance generated inthe fourth quarter of 1998. Besides the highlevel of contributions, which were swelled bythe effect of Christmas bonus payments, re-
ceipts were boosted above all by the add-itional grants from the Federal budget, whichwere financed via the increased taxation ofenergy consumption and basically did notbegin to flow until June 1999. Receipts werefurther bolstered from April 1999 by first-time contributions for part-time workersbelow a certain earnings level. Total receiptsin the fourth quarter were almost 5
12%u p
on the year. Expenditure grew by just under3
12%, with pension payments – the main ex-
penditure item – growing by just over 312%.
For 1999 as a whole the statutory pension in-
surance scheme posted a surplus of 3434bil-

54tributable to additional Federal grants, was
necessary in order to bring the fluctuation re-serves back up to their legally prescribed min-imum level of one month’s average expend-iture for the first time since 1994. Judging bythe quarterly and monthly statistics, this goalwas virtually achieved by the end of 1999.
The Federal Labour Office registered a more
or less balanced financial position in the lastquarter of 1999, whereas it had showed a
deficit of more than DM 1
12billion in the
same quarter of 1998. This marked improve-ment was due above all to a 4
12% fall in
spending. The amount spent on unemploy-ment benefits declined further (– 4%). Incontrast to the trend in the first nine monthsof 1999, payments in connection with activelabour market policy measures – which hadbeen stepped up sharply up to the end of1998 – likewise contracted in a year-on-yearcomparison (– 7%). Receipts rose by 1
12%.
For 1999 as a whole the Federal Labour Of-
fice ran up a deficit of 3334billion, or nearly
DM 712billion, compared with DM 734billion
in 1998. This was distinctly less than the an-ticipated topping-up amount of DM 11 billionearmarked in the Federal budget. Given thefalling number of unemployed persons, theamount of money spent on unemploymentbenefits was almost 8% less than in 1998. Bycontrast, active labour market policy meas-ures, in the form of training courses and jobcreation schemes (including the ImmediateProgramme for unemployed young people)cost almost 17
12% more than in the previous
year. Overall receipts went up by 3%, amongwhich the volume of contributions increasedby 2
12%.

55of the year. According to the provisional
(partly estimated) results published by theFederal Statistical Office, the general govern-ment deficit ratio came to 1.2%, as opposedto 1.7% in 1998.
5This owed much to the
plentiful flow of tax receipts. Consequently,overall revenue rose by 3
12% despite the
small growth of receipts from social securitycontributions and the contraction of otherreceipts. The taxes and social security ratioincreased for the first time since 1996 (by0.8 percentage point to 43.7%).
6
Expenditure growth in the public sectordoubled in 1999 compared with 1998 to2
12%. Higher negotiated pay rates contrib-
uted to a faster increase in wages and salar-ies. Spending on social benefits likewise in-creased more rapidly, above all in the wake ofhigher expenditure by the statutory health in-surance funds and the expansion of active la-bour market policy measures. Another factorwere the first-time payments by the FederalGovernment to the Post Office benefit funds.As a result, the general government expend-iture ratio, which had been declining since1997, rose slightly to 48.9%.
The marked decline in the deficit ratio last
year, in the context of weak economicgrowth, represented an advance towards fis-cal consolidation. While acknowledging thebudgetary improvement, however, it shouldbe borne in mind that the trend in public fi-nance was positively influenced by the pat-tern of economic growth as, inter alia, a dis-
proportionately large contribution to thatgrowth came from tax-yielding domestic de-mand. Moreover, a role was played by variousextraordinary factors, especially the large sur-
plus of the statutory pension insurancescheme and, in the field of assessed taxes,the substantial extra corporation tax pay-ments in respect of past years in which profit-ability was buoyant.
Budget plans for 2000 and outlook
The outlook for this year underscores the
need for further consolidation in respect ofpublic sector deficits. From the current per-spective no progress is likely towards reducingthe deficits, as defined in the national ac-counts,
7despite a favourable cyclical momen-
tum and the entry into force of the consolida-tion package. The main reason for this is thatthe growth in receipts is likely to be muchweaker. Thus the official tax estimate of No-vember 1999 (taking account of recentchanges in tax legislation) forecast a rise ofonly 2
12% in tax revenue compared with the
provisional actual out-turn in 1999, eventhough this was based on a perceptibly fasternominal rate of economic growth of over3
12% and the second stage of the increase
in energy taxation came into force at the be-ginning of this year. The causes of this weakrevenue growth are the shortfalls in receiptsresulting from measures – which likewiseentered into force at the start of this year –

which, from March 1, 2000, will also be used for the first
time as the basis for notifications under the excessive def-
icit procedure.
6The results given here differ in part from the figures of
the Federal Statistical Office (see notes to Table VIII.3 in
the Statistical Section of the Monthly Report).
7Using the budgetary definition, it is likely that the def-
icits will actually grow further, above all owing to the
lower privatisation proceeds.No noticeable

56relating to the second stage of the 1999/
2000/2002 Tax Relief Act and the extensionof family assistance measures plus a signifi-cant drop in retrospective assessed tax pay-ments for past years. In addition, major non-tax revenue – notably the Bundesbank profitand proceeds from sales of tangible assets –will presumably also decline. Moreover, thesurplus of the statutory pension insurancescheme will fall sharply following the replen-ishment of the fluctuation reserves. On theother hand, public finance trends this yearwill be positively influenced by the fact thatexpenditure growth will be dampened, notleast thanks to the extensive implementationof the consolidation package.
Regarding the current budget plans of the
various tiers of government, the Federalbudget for the year 2000 was approved bythe German parliament in December 1999.At around 325
12billion, the deficit projected
in the Federal budget remained unchangedvis-à-vis the draft budget. That is roughly 3
34
billion less than the provisional actual deficit
for 1999. Both receipts and expenditure havebeen revised upward somewhat comparedwith the draft budget figures. Whereas tax re-ceipts are forecast to exceed the amount re-ceived in 1999 by 3%, a steep decline is pro-jected in proceeds from the disposal of par-ticipating interests. Overall revenue is there-fore forecast to fall by
12%. Budgeted ex-
penditure is almost 1% lower than the provi-sional actual figure for last year, mainly on ac-count of the spending cuts agreed as part ofthe consolidation package. Higher-than-budgeted expenditure can already be fore-seen, however, in part because the FederalGovernment’s withdrawal from the financing
of housing allowances – which is factoredinto the Federal budget – has not been putinto practice.
In the case of the Länder Governments higher
deficits are envisaged in the budget plans.The amount of tax revenue will probablygrow at a below-average rate, inter alia
owing to the dampened development of theLänder tax receipts. Furthermore, a decreasein the transfers from the Federal budget is tobe expected. Overall revenue is therefore like-ly to exceed the 1999 level only marginally –unless substantial asset disposals take placefor budget financing purposes. On the otherhand, expenditure is to increase only moder-ately (by approximately 1
12%), which presup-
poses that this year’s pay rises in the publicsector are kept within narrow bounds.
The local authorities could record deficits in
2000 for the first time in two years. For ex-ample, only a small rise is expected in the vol-ume of trade tax owing to the falling trend inpayments of tax arrears for past years. Thetransfers from the Länder Governments,which play a major role in local authority fi-nances, might likewise be limited on accountof the higher deficits which the Länder Gov-ernments seem likely to incur. The rather un-favourable outlook on the revenue side willcompel the local authorities to exercise re-straint in their expenditure policy.
The social security funds, in particular, are
likely to have an unfavourable impact on fis-cal developments this year. The surplus whichwas generated last year in the statutory pen-Outlook

57sion insurance scheme will be largely elimin-
ated. Together with the measures of theBudget Consolidation Act, especially the tem-porary limitation of the increase in pensionsto the rate of inflation, the surplus made itpossible to reduce the contribution rate atthe beginning of the year to 19.3%. The Fed-eral Labour Office has budgeted for a deficit(to be covered by the Federal Government) of34 billion, which more or less matches the
actual deficit in 1999. In view of the reduc-tion in unemployment that is to be antici-pated, the actual deficit may well be lowerthan the target figure – as was the case inprevious years. In the statutory health insur-ance fund, following the abandonment ofthe originally planned health reform meas-ures, recourse will again be had to the instru-ment of capping spending through sectoralbudgets. As in the preceding years, no deficit-building trend is in evidence for the statutoryhealth insurance fund.
For the medium term the Federal Govern-
ment affirmed its determination to pursue asustained consolidation course in presentingan updated version of its stability programmeof December 1999 and in adjusting it in Janu-ary in the light of the better-than-expectedresults in 1999 and the implications of thedraft version of the Tax Reduction Bill which itsubmitted recently. The general governmentdeficit ratio (as the chart on this page shows)is to be cut to
12% by 2003. In the coming
year, however, it will rise temporarily (to1
12%) because of the effects of the compre-
hensive tax relief measures which are tocome into effect in 2001. In addition, theFederal Government intends to achieve acompletely balanced fiscal position by 2006
at the latest. In order to provide financial lee-way to achieve that aim – and in addition tolower the taxes and social security burden –the government expenditure ratio is to be re-duced from 48
12% in 1999 to 45% in 2003,
a goal which will require considerable effortsat all levels of government. A key task of fis-cal policy in the coming years will be to en-sure that this planned expenditure course isAs a percentage of gross domestic product

58rigorously adhered to, particularly as the
planned tax cuts are likely to make it harderto meet the deficit targets laid down in thestability programme.
The new tax-cutting plans which the Federal
Government put forward in December willlead to substantial revenue shortfalls (for de-tails see the table on page 59). The thirdstage of the 1999/2000/2002 Tax Relief Act,which was initially envisaged for 2002, is tobe brought forward to 2001. Additional reliefmeasures are to be introduced in 2003 and2005 which will progressively raise the basictax allowance to DM 15,000 and reduce theentry tax rate to 15% and the marginal taxrate to 45%. This will lead in 2003 (for thefirst twelve months in which the full effectwill be felt) to shortfalls amounting to an esti-mated 36
34billion, or DM 1312billion, rising
in 2005 to 318 billion, or DM 35 billion. The
Federal Government has announced thatthese shortfalls are to be financed withoutjeopardising its medium-term consolidationtarget. To this end it will rely on continuing itsstrict fiscal consolidation course but also on“self-financing effects” resulting from the taxcuts and on additional asset disposals.
In the bill which it has meanwhile presented,
the Federal Government also spelled out thedetails of its reform concept for corporatetaxation. The draft bill is largely based on theframework that had been announced earlier.In 2001 corporation tax is to be lowered to auniform rate of 25% for both retained profits(currently 40%) and distributed profits (now30%). Non-corporations – i.e. partnerships –will be given the option of paying corporationtax or of having their trade tax payments
partly offset against their income tax liability.Enterprises not subject to trade tax will bene-fit solely from the general income tax cuts.The present imputation system which allowsshareholders to credit the corporation tax al-ready paid on their dividends against theirpersonal income tax liability is to be replacedby an income tax relief on dividends. Anotherinnovation that is envisaged – and which islikely to be of far-reaching significance forstructural changes in the corporate sector – isthat corporations will no longer have to paytax on capital gains accruing from the sale ofparticipating interests in German firms (cap-ital gains resulting from the disposal of share-holdings in foreign enterprises are alreadytax-exempt). After subtracting the effect ofvarious counter-financing measures (especial-ly the tightening of the rules for claiming de-preciation allowances), the corporate tax re-form is to cut firms’ aggregate tax burden byabout 34
12billion, or DM 9 billion. It should
be borne in mind, however, that considerableextra net burdens have been imposed on thecorporate sector by the 1999/2000/2002 TaxRelief Act.
The proposals put forward by the Federal
Government will lead to a considerable re-duction in tax rates, especially corporation taxrates. To that extent they will make an im-portant contribution to the pressing require-ment to reduce the existing burden of taxesand levies and to improving Germany’s fiscalattractiveness to investors. In the longer run,however, further measures will be neededwhich ensure that different types of incomeand saving are not subject to differing tax re-New
