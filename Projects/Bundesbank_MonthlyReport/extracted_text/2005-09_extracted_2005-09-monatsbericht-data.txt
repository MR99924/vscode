5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a wholeIn the second quarter of 2005, real gross do-
mestic product (GDP), after adjustment forseasonal and working-day variations, re-mained just as high as in the first quarter.There was a working-day-adjusted year-on-year increase of 0.6%. The decline in net ex-ports was the main contributor to this side-ways movement. Firstly, exports did not ex-pand as sharply as in the first quarter and,secondly, imports increased considerably.Along with capital goods, more energy andconsumer products, in particular, were im-ported. Since final domestic demand con-tinued to progress sluggishly, a substantialamount of these goods and products wasprobably added to inventories. At all events,stock levels increased considerably. Further-more, the upturn in investment in machineryand equipment also continued. However, thiscontrasted with a further decline in house-holds’ purchases and construction invest-ment.
IndustryAt the beginning of the third quarter, there
was a sharp improvement in industrial busi-ness activity. In July, both new orders and out-put were notably higher than in previousmonths. However, the seasonally andworking-day-adjusted growth rates may over-state the cyclical increase insofar as thedampening impact of the summer holidaysthis year was probably less pronounced thanon a longer-term average.GDP in 2005

6In mathematical terms, orders received in July
were 6% above the average of the secondquarter, during which there had already beena significant expansion in the flow of orders.Once the calendar variations had been takeninto account, the figure was 7
1/C252% up on the
year, compared with just 2% during theperiod from April to June.
Following the temporary slowdown in the
spring, a large number of export orders camein again in July, a significant proportion ofwhich were major orders. The year-on-yearincrease went up from 3
1/C252% in the second
quarter to 113/C254%. The strongest growth was
recorded by the capital goods sector but thebasic goods sector was only marginally be-hind. The producers of consumer goods, onthe other hand, suffered slight setbacks.Domestic orders received, which had im-
proved somewhat in the second quarter,showed a slight seasonally adjusted increaseagain in July. However, the underlying ten-dency remained subdued. The year-on-yearincrease rose to 3
1/C254% after being just3/C254%i n
the second quarter. Consumer goods showedthe largest increase, followed by the basicgoods sector.
In July, industrial output expanded further.
The year-on-year increase, at 4%, was signifi-cantly higher than the figure of 2
3/C254% record-
ed in the second quarter. There was anabove-average increase in capital goods, al-though the producers of intermediate andconsumer goods also recorded a marked in-crease.
ConstructionThe situation in the construction industry was
looking somewhat brighter towards the mid-dle of the year. However, an end to the struc-tural adjustment still does not seem to havebeen achieved. For example, the situation re-garding incoming orders has, in fact, im-proved in the past few months, but this canmainly be put down to the end of the winterhold-ups. The fact that, well into June, sea-sonally adjusted incoming orders in the con-struction sector were down on the level atthe end of 2004 would suggest that this isnot a sustained revival. Incoming orders stillfailed to match their level in the same period12 months earlier.

7adjustment for seasonal and working-day
variations. Yet even here, a certain amount ofoverstatement cannot be ruled out. It maytherefore be assumed that the situation sta-bilised at a level which is still around 5%lower than the figure recorded for the sameperiod last year.
Labour marketAccording to the calculations of the Federal
Statistical Office, the seasonally adjustednumber of persons in work in Germany inJuly increased again slightly to 38.95 million.This increase was due solely, however, to anexceptionally sharp rise in the number ofcross-border commuters who are often em-ployed as seasonal workers in Germany. Ifthese seasonal workers are taken out of thefigures, employment was actually decliningslightly for the first time in several months.The fact that labour market policy was notgenerating any significant new stimuli to em-ployment probably played a part in this. Thefurther rise in the number of “one-eurojobs”, in particular, was largely offset by a de-cline in the number of persons receivingbridging payments and business start-upgrants. There was also a further slight reduc-tion in traditional job creation measures.
According to the Federal Employment
Agency, there was a further slight fall in un-employment in August. In seasonally adjustedterms, the number of persons officially regis-tered as unemployed went down to 4.796million. Although unemployment in westernGermany remained unchanged, there was adecrease in eastern Germany. However, thisEconomic conditions in Germany*

8hardly reflects a cyclical upturn and is, in fact,
more likely to be due, in part, to a stricter re-view of benefits entitlements. According tothe Federal Employment Agency, this had ledto some 15,000 persons no longer being in-cluded in the statistics. A further 10,000 de-partures from the statistics can be attributedto the effects of the Hartz IV reform (changesto work availability requirements and strongersupport in terms of job placement). The sea-sonally adjusted unemployment rate, as cal-culated by the Federal Employment Agency,remained at 11.6%.
According to the results of a telephone poll
carried out by the Federal Office of Statisticsbased on ILO criteria, the seasonally adjustednumber of unemployed persons fell to 3.82million in July. The rate of unemployment fellslightly from 9.1% in June to 9.0%.
PricesIn late August/early September, the inter-
national energy markets were affected by asurge in the price of oil and, in particular, re-fined oil products, primarily as a result of sup-ply shortages in the United States. On thespot market in Rotterdam, quotations for abarrel of Brent crude oil peaked at US$67
1/C252,
petrol soared to almost US$850 per tonne,and light heating oil was selling at US$655.At the beginning of August, a barrel of Brentoil was still being quoted at US$60
1/C252, petrol
cost US$610 and heating oil US$530. By mid-September, prices had eased off slightly, al-though they were still clearly above theirlevels in the first few days of August.The most recent development in oil prices is
only reflected to a small extent in consumerprices as prices are recorded in the middle ofthe month. Refined petroleum products weretherefore only 2% more expensive in Augustthan in July. The fact that the year-on-year in-crease remained largely unchanged at almost14% is due to similarly large price changes12 months earlier. This also applies to theconsumer price index as a whole. Its year-on-year annual rate even decreased slightly from2.0% in July to 1.9% in August. In the Har-monised Index, this figure remained at 1.9%.Viewed in isolation, however, the price in-creases, at a seasonally adjusted
1/C254% on the
month, were quite substantial. The cost ofservices, in particular, has increased, whereasthe prices of industrial goods and housingrents have remained largely unchanged.
Public finances
Indebtedness of central, state and
local government
In July, the indebtedness of central, state and
local government rose sharply by 320.2 billion.
With an increase of 315.8 billion, central gov-
ernment was the largest borrower. At thesame time, however, it considerably increasedits money market deposits (+ 314.5 billion).
Consequently, only a small part of the fundsborrowed in July was needed to offset thebudget deficit. Central government raised30.8 billion on the money market and 315 bil-
lion on the capital market. The sharpest in-crease was in the outstanding volume of Fed-eral bonds (Bunds) (+ 310.5 billion). The top-International

9up issue of a ten-year Bund alone raised 36.2
billion. At 3.19%, the issue yield was down by16 points on that of the first issue in May. Fur-thermore, in a departure from the annual issu-ance calendar, the 30-year Bund from Januarywas topped up. The tender allotment raised34.5 billion. Here too, the issue yield, at
3.78%, was considerably lower than that ofthe first issue (-26 points). With a coupon of4%, there was a considerable premium of3.9%. In addition to this, the two-year FederalTreasury note (Sch/C228tze) issued in June was alsotopped up. The tender allotment raised 34.4
billion. Including market management oper-ations, the outstanding amount of these debtinstruments rose by 35.1 billion. The monthly
issue of six-month Treasury discount paper(Bubills) raised a further 34.8 billion. Taking
into account current sales and a redemptionof35.9 billion, the outstanding volume rose
by30.1 billion. The volume of five-year Federal
notes (Bobls) in circulation went up by 30.8
billion as a result of market management op-erations. A redemption of debt certificates is-sued by the Currency Conversion EqualisationFund led to a decline of 31.1 billion.
State government increased its indebtedness
by34.5 billion in July. The outstanding vol-
ume of Treasury notes, which have, of late,accounted for the bulk of state governmentborrowing, rose by 31.2 billion. However, the
cumulative volume of cash advances andloans from banks against borrowers’ notesrose by 31.8 billion and 31.5 billion respect-
ively and again played a greater role in cover-ing the credit requirement. The total indebt-edness of local government appears to haverisen again marginally in July.Central government borrowing
In August, central government raised 315 bil-
lion gross on the capital market. Redemptionsamounted to 321.5 billion. Taking into ac-
count the repayment of money market loansamounting to 34.6 billion, there was thus an
overall debt reduction of 311.1 billion. In a
corresponding reversal of the picture in July,however, this was accompanied by a sharpdecline in central government’s money mar-ket deposits (- 313.1 billion). Borrowing was
once again concentrated on Bunds with anissue volume of 37.8 billion. The tender allot-
ment of the second topping-up of the ten-year Bund from May alone raised 35.3 billion
with an issue yield of 3.24%. Conversely, asizeable redemption of Bobls was due. Theseries 136, which was issued in August 2000Net borrowing in the market

count market management operations, theoutstanding amount of Bobls declined by314.3 billion. The tender allotment of six-
month Bubills, by contrast, yielded 34.8 bil-
lion in revenue. As a result of redemptions,however, the outstanding volume fell by 30.2
billion on balance.
Securities markets
Bond marketFollowing the strong figures in the previous
month, the issue volume in the German bondmarket declined to 3113.7 billion in July and
was thus on a par with the same month lastyear. After taking account of redemptionsand changes in issuers’ holdings of their own
debt securities, net sales amounted to 38.7
billion but were below those of July 2004owing to higher redemptions. Sales of foreigndebt securities in the German market fell no-ticeably, with the outstanding amount ofthese securities decreasing by 36.2 billion.
On balance, only the public sector tapped the
bond market in the month under review. TheFederal Government increased its net issuingactivity compared with the previous month byaround 311 billion to 315.8 billion. Specifical-
ly, it issued 37.9 billion (net) worth of ten-
year Federal bonds (Bunds) and 34.2 billion in
the 30-year maturity segment. On top of thisit also issued two-year Federal Treasury notes(Sch/C228tze) for 34.5 billion (net) and a small
amount of Treasury discount paper (Bubills).Increases in central government’s own hold-ings of five-year Federal notes (Bobls) ex-ceeded gross sales by 31.0 billion. State gov-
ernment borrowed a net total of 30.9 billion
in the capital market. The Currency Conver-sion Equalisation Fund, which was set up pri-marily to consolidate the balance sheets ofthe east German banking system followingthe asymmetric conversion of claims and li-abilities into D-Mark, paid off the remainingdebts of 31.1 billion and was dissolved.
German credit institutions reduced their net
domestic capital market debt by 35.2 billion
in July after issuing debt securities of justunder 324 billion net in June. The decrease
was primarily due to redemptions of public-sector Pfandbriefe (- 39.0 billion) and the
small net sales of other bank debt securities(31.8 billion); in June, total net sales in theseNet borrowing in the market by central

11segments had amounted to around 320 bil-
lion. In addition, 31.4 billion worth of debt
securities issued by specialised credit institu-tions and 30.6 billion of mortgage Pfand-
briefe were sold on balance.
Domestic non-financial enterprises redeemed
bonds and notes worth 31.7 billion on bal-
ance. This was due entirely to the reductionin short-term securities, while the level ofdebt in longer-dated securities increasedslightly.
Only foreign investors made purchases in the
German bond market recently: they bought315.8 billion worth of debt securities, one-
third of which was accounted for by securitiesissued by private sector borrowers and two-thirds of which was invested in governmentsecurities. Domestic credit institutions pur-chased domestic debt securities worth 31.7
billion, above all bank debt securities, but re-deemed foreign bonds and notes on a consid-erable scale (- 37.2 billion on balance). Do-
mestic non-banks reduced their bond port-folios by 37.8 billion. Although they pur-
chased public-sector debt securities worth34.8 billion and foreign debt securities to the
value of 31.0 billion net, they sold a sizeable
volume of debt securities issued by domesticprivate sector borrowers (- 313.6 billion).
Equity marketIssuing activity in the German equity market
was subdued in July. The overall sales of 30.6
billion comprised domestic listed, domesticnon-listed and foreign shares in equal propor-tions. Domestic credit institutions were themain buyers and purchased a total of 32.2
billion in equities, most of which were do-mestic shares. Foreign investors purchased31.0 billion net worth of German equities in
July. This is a significant drop compared withthe high purchases of the two precedingmonths. As a result, however, purchases ofshares by non-residents are now back aroundthe level of July 2004. Domestic non-banksoffloaded shares in the amount of 32.6 billion
in the month under review, the bulk of whichwas made up of domestic securities.

12the general public, specialised funds reserved
for institutional investors and foreign mutualfunds. Inflows to domestic funds open to thegeneral public consequently reached a levellast seen at the start of 2003, with share-based funds, money market funds ( 31.1 bil-
lion each) and bond-based funds ( 30.9 billion)
placing the bulk of fund units. By contrast,mixed funds, open-end real estate funds andpension mutual funds only attracted a smallamount of investment. Domestic non-banksaccounted for the greatest demand and pur-chased fund shares for 37.4 billion (net), pri-
marily from domestic mutual funds ( 34.2 bil-
lion). Domestic credit institutions boughtfund shares amounting to 31.6 billion on bal-
ance, the bulk of which from domestic funds.Foreign investors placed a net 31.8 billion in
German mutual funds.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus of 37.3 billion in July 2005, compared
with 311.0 billion in the previous month. A
decrease in the trade surplus and an increasein the deficit on invisible current transactions,which comprise services, income and currenttransfers, contributed to the decline.
According to provisional calculations from the
Federal Statistical Office, the foreign tradesurplus fell by 32.6 billion from the June fig-
ure to 314.1 billion in July. The seasonally ad-
justed surplus was also down by 31
1/C252billion
(to313 billion). This was due to a sharp rise in

sharply (5%) than exports (31/C252%) in a three-
month comparison (May to July, comparedwith February to April) – a development thatwas partly price-related.
The deficit on invisible current transactions in-
creased in July by 31.3 billion on the month
to35.7 billion. This increase can be attributed
mainly to the larger deficit on services, whichrose by 31.6 billion to 33.9 billion. At the
same time, net cross-border income fell from30.8 billion in June to 30.5 billion in July. In
contrast to this slight decrease in net cross-border income, the deficit on current trans-fers fell by 30.6 billion to 32.3 billion.
Cross-border portfolio investment again led
to net capital imports in July ( 320.3 billion,
compared with 344.9 billion in the previous
month). Purchases of securities by foreignportfolio investors amounting to 318.7 billion
(net) were a major contributory factor, eventhough the figure was noticeably down onthe month ( 368.5 billion in June). Foreign in-
vestors focused primarily on German bondsand notes ( 313.0 billion), notably public
bonds ( 311.4 billion). By contrast, German in-
vestors reduced their holdings of foreign se-curities on balance by 31.7 billion. While they
increased their holdings of shares (by 30.9 bil-
lion) and mutual fund shares ( 33.6 billion),
they sold 37.0 billion worth of bonds and
notes, especially euro-denominated bonds.In contrast to portfolio investment, direct in-
vestment resulted in net capital exports of34.2 billion in July. The main reason for this
was that foreign parent companies withdrewfunds from their branches domiciled in Ger-many ( 34.3 billion) through internal group
credit transactions. Transactions by Germandirect investors led to minor net outflows offunds ( 30.1 billion).
In July, there were net outflows of 312.8 bil-
lion through the non-securitised credit trans-actions of non-banks. At 311.2 billion net,
the financial operations of public authoritiesplayed a prominent role in this respect. Publicauthorities increased short-term claims at for-eign banks to a large extent, while at thesame time reducing corresponding liabilitiesto a lesser extent. Enterprises and individualstransferred funds amounting to 31.6 billion
to foreign bank accounts in July. The credittransactions of the banking system also re-sulted in net capital exports ( 310.6 billion).
39.1 billion was exported through the banks’
cross-border transactions. At the Bundes-bank, it was particularly an increase in claimsin connection with the gross payment systemTARGET that led to outflows of funds worth31.5 billion.
The Bundesbank’s reserve assets fell in July
– at transaction values – by 30.3 billion.

15The performance
of German credit
institutions in 2004The performance of the German banks
improved last year. Nevertheless, theGerman banking industry is only grad-ually regaining its former sound profit-ability. Like the year before, 2004failed to produce a radical recovery.Once again, the cautious improvementin profitability derived mainly from thecost side. By contrast, it is still not pos-sible to speak of a general reversal oftrend in terms of income-related devel-opments. This might be due to theweak economic growth during the2004 financial year.
The published individual accounts
drawn up in accordance with the Ger-man Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetz-
buch ) indicate that (net) income from
German banks’ operating business in-creased. There was a slight improve-ment in both net interest and net com-missions received, more than offsettingthe declining own-account tradingprofits, which had been especially highin 2003. Added to this was a fall in ad-ministrative spending. Lower risk pro-visioning and the declining balance on“extraordinary account” likewise con-tributed to the improvement in profitfor the financial year. If taxes on in-come and earnings are taken into ac-count, this was positive again follow-ing a deficit in 2003. For the current fi-nancial year so far, a further moderaterecovery in domestic banks’ perform-ance is emerging.

16Income from interest business
After significantly adjusting their balance
sheets in 2003, domestic banks further re-duced their risk assets in the 2004 financialyear. Factoring on the part of individualbanks, which was considerable in somecases, is also likely to be reflected here. Unlikein 2003, banks nevertheless managed toachieve earnings growth in interest business.However, this was ultimately due to the fact
that interest expenditure declined moresharply than interest income. Interest expend-iture fell by 38.5 billion to 3218.6 billion, as
against a fall in interest income from 3308.7
billion to 3303.6 billion. This resulted in net
interest received rising by 33.3 billion to 385.0
billion. As is revealed in a long-term analysis,this is a quite typical development, which inthe past has often boosted German creditinstitutions’ performance in periods of lowor lowered interest rates (see box on pages18-19). After a perceptible decline in 2003, theshare of net interest received in earnings fromdomestic banks’ operating business went upagain in the reporting year from 70.2% to73.4%. On balance, despite a minor expansionagain in the volume of business, the interestmargin – the ratio of net interest received tothe banks’ balance sheet total – rose slightly by0.02 percentage point to 1.18%. As lendingwithin the banking sector was expanded onlyslightly in the reporting year, the balance sheettotal – after adjustment for interbank business,which has no effect on net interest received –likewise showed only a marginal increase. As aresult, the interest margin relative to the adjust-ed business volume went up only slightly aswell from 1.60% in 2003 to 1.63% in thereporting year.
The marked increase in net interest received
was attributable, above all, to the commercialbanks – in this instance, exclusively the bigbanks. In contrast to the general develop-ment, there was a sharp rise in interest re-ceived by the big banks. The increase wasdue, in particular, to a marked year-on-yearrise in current income from shares and otherDM bn € bn

interest received. Given only slightly higherinterest expenditure, this was also reflected innet income from interest business, which hadbeen no more than weak in 2003. Followinga marked decline in 2003, the share of netinterest received in the big banks’ operatingresult thus showed a perceptible increaseagain and, in fact, roughly matched the aver-age of the past ten years. Although the bigbanks slightly expanded the statistically ad-justed business volume again after cutting itback noticeably in 2003, the interest marginin 2004, at 0.98%, on balance, was clearlyabove the previous year’s figure of 0.85%.

made in the allocation of the banks to the respective
banking categories. Besides “Regional and other com-

the “Landesbanken” as well as the “Special purpose

18Deutsche BundesbankThe impact of changes in short-term interest rates on the performance of German credit institutions
The impact of capital market rates on the perfor-
mance of banks or their net interest received hasalready been investigated for Germany resultingin the finding of a positive correlation with atime lag of one to three years.
1However, much
less is known about what effect central bankrates have on the banks’ profitability. As theinterest rate channel plays a major role in thetransmission of monetary policy impulses in Ger-many, it may be assumed that changes in centralbank rates and the money market rates, whichfollow them closely, do have an influence on theway banks structure their terms and conditionsand, therefore, possibly on their profitability aswell.
Below, a simple empirical approach will be used
to investigate how much evidence there is(along with a possible influence of capital mar-ket rates) for a relation between the Germanbanks’ income and the money market rate.
2The
present study is confined to changes in net inter-est received as one of the German banking in-dustry’s major income components.
It is only in new business or under variable-rate
contracts that the banks can promptly pass onchanges in their refinancing costs on the moneymarket to their customers. Therefore, the influ-ence of a change in interest rates on the banks’profit and loss accounts is likely to dependon the maturities and/or interest rate fixation
periods in lending and deposit business.
In the German banking system, longer-term ma-
turities are more in evidence in lending businessthan on the liabilities side. It may, therefore, beassumed that, say, rising interest rates impactmore quickly on interest paid than on interestreceived. Consequently, this should be reflectedinitially in lower net interest received, ie the dif-ference between interest received and interestpaid. Conversely, net interest received will prob-ably benefit temporarily from an interest ratecut. In both cases, however, temporary adjust-ment effects are in play – not lasting changes inthe level of income.
As net interest received is of widely differing im-
portance for the individual categories of banks,the estimation of the following two-equationsystem is broken down by category of bank.

banking industry, which are discussed in the main text, were used forthe estimation. All variables are entered as logarithms into the equa-tion. Owing to the non-stationarity of the variables, the estimation is
carried out in first differences. — 4Furthermore, a “Dummy Hypo”
variable was included in the equations to take account of the reclassi-fication of Hypo-Bank (which had been classified as a regional bankbefore its merger with Vereinsbank in 1998) as a big bank. — 5This is

and second lags.4In order to model separately
the influence of cyclical changes as well aschanges in the capital market rates at the longend, GDP and the ten-year yield on debt securi-ties in the second and third lag were addition-ally incorporated as explanatory variables.
5The
two-equation system is estimated applying theSUR method
6for the period from 1970 to 2004
with step-by-step elimination of the non-signifi-cant variables. The results are shown in the tableabove.
The estimation results confirm the expected rela-
tion. As surmised owing to the differing matur-ity structure, interest paid reacts more stronglythan interest received.
7Larger differences be-tween the individual categories of banks do be-
come apparent, however. For example, changesin the money market rate have a stronger con-temporaneous influence on interest receivedand paid in the case of the big and regionalbanks than they do for the savings banks andcredit cooperatives, although the impact de-clines more markedly in the ensuing period. Bycontrast, comparing the overall impact of an in-terest rate impulse on the profit and loss ac-counts of the individual categories of banks re-veals that the reaction of net interest received issomewhat more pronounced for the savingsbanks and credit cooperatives. However, thisdoes not differ substantially from the reaction inthe case of the big banks or the regional banksand other commercial banks.
consistent with the expected lagged impact of the capital market
rates on net interest received. See, for example, Deutsche Bundes-bank, The performance of German credit institutions in 1998,Monthly Report , July 1999, pp 27-57. The incorporation of simulta-
neous yields as well as yields lagged by one period does not produceany essential changes in the estimation results. — 6A Zellner (1962),

20income with weak growth in the volume of
business, the savings banks’ net interest re-ceived fell in the period under review despitethe slightly rising business volume. This wasdue to perceptibly declining interest receivedfrom lending and money market transactions.Among the categories of banks which typical-ly have a smaller interest margin owing to thefact that they concentrate on interbank andwholesale banking business, both the region-al institutions of credit cooperatives and theLandesbanken achieved a slight increase inthe interest margin.
Net commissions received
Following a period of stagnation in 2003,
German banks were again able to slightly im-prove their net commissions received. In2004, they were 31.0 billion up on the year
at325.3 billion. The moderate rise in commis-
sions paid was more than offset by thegrowth in commissions received. In relationto the balance sheet total, however, net com-missions received stagnated at 0.35%.
The bulk of the increase in net commissions
received in the reporting year was accountedfor by the savings banks, who improved theircommissions result by 30.4 billion to 35.6 bil-
lion. The savings banks’ network-relatedgrowing insurance business is likely to havebeen one significant factor in this. The com-mercial banks, which generated just under55% of the net commissions received by thedomestic credit institutions, achieved nomore than weak growth in this sector with anincrease of 30.2 billion to 313.5 billion.Interest received by credit

21Net profit or net loss on financial
operations
The net profit from the domestic banks’
financial operations in the 2004 financial yeardeclined sharply following a record outcomein 2003. At 31.3 billion, the German banks
recorded their poorest net profit in own-account trading of the past ten years.
This development was essentially due to the
big banks and – as the published individualaccounts show – one big bank in particular.After achieving the largest net profit fromown-account trading for more than ten yearsin 2003, in the year under review the bigbanks recorded the lowest net result from fi-nancial operations since 1994 at 30.6 billion.
One of the reasons for this was decliningearnings from investments in emerging mar-
kets and from trading in convertible bondsand interest rate derivatives. The other cat-egories of banks, too, were unable to buckthe trend of declining net profits from finan-cial operations, although own-account trad-ing traditionally plays a far less important partin their overall result.
Administrative expenditure
The German credit institutions continued
their cost-cutting efforts in the 2004 financialyear and were able, once again, to reducetheir administrative expenditure somewhat.Overall, general administrative costs fell from377.3 billion in 2003 to 375.8 billion in the
reporting year. Staff costs, which still accountAs a percentage of the average balance sheet total  1

22for more than half of administrative expend-
iture, fell only slightly by 30.3 billion to 341.2
billion, even though there was a 11,500 re-duction in the number of employees in thedomestic banking industry. Given the sever-ance payments provided, this is hardly surpris-ing, however. Most of the reduction in costswas accounted for by other administrativespending, which essentially comprises operat-ing expenditure, expenditure on third-partyservices and depreciation of tangible fixedassets. In relation to the balance sheet total,general administrative expenditure in the re-porting year went down by 0.04 percentagepoint to 1.06%.
It was mainly the commercial banks that were
able to reap the benefits of earlier cost-cuttingprogrammes and, in particular, make a furtherreduction in administrative expenditure. Con-
trary to the general trend, there was hardlyany further reduction in the number of em-ployees in the private banking industry in theperiod under review following significant cut-backs in the past few years. Nevertheless, theearlier staffing economies are taking effectnow that the costs of adjustment have ceasedto be a factor. For instance, in this category ofbanks, a decline in staff costs as well as inother administrative spending caused generaladministrative expenditure to fall by 31.0 bil-
lion to 333.4 billion. For the first time in more
than 15 years, the savings banks, too, man-aged to significantly lower their administrativecosts. At 318.9 billion, general administrative
expenditure was 30.5 billion, or 2
1/C252%, down
on the year. Although it was, above all, thesavings banks that made the sharpest adjust-ment – at least in absolute terms – in the re-porting year with a staffing reduction of 6,500,the savings in administrative costs were attrib-utable only to a limited extent to lower staffingcosts. In the case of the credit cooperatives,general administrative costs remained largelyat the 2003 level of 313.0 billion, even though
the number of employees was reducedmarkedly in this category of banks as well. Asthe credit cooperatives also recorded a slightincrease in the business volume, however,administrative expenditure in relation to thebalance sheet total fell from 2.32% in 2003 to2.28% in the reporting year.

23contribution to the overall result again in fi-
nancial year 2004. The other operatingcharges in the narrower sense fell so sharplythat the profit contribution, at 34.1 billion,
was even slightly up on the already very highfigure for 2003 – despite the perceptible de-cline in other operating income in the nar-rower sense. This was largely due to the im-proved results of the commercial banks, how-ever. In the reporting year, too, at 31.2 billion
compared with 31.4 billion in 2003, the re-
gional and other commercial banks again re-corded the highest net profit of all categoriesof banks in this sector. However, with a rise of30.7 billion to 30.9 billion, it was the big
banks that achieved the highest growth. Thiswas due mainly to the elimination of specialIT-related charges and of business continuitymeasures in the case of the subsidiary of asingle institution, as the relevant annual re-
port revealed.
Slight improvement in the operating
result before valuation of assets
Overall, the improvement in the partial oper-
ating result, comprising the higher net inter-est and net commissions received as well asthe lower administrative costs, was greaterthan the losses in the net profit from own-account trading. The operating result beforevaluation of assets, which contains not onlythe partial operating result and the incomefrom own-account trading but also the im-proved net other operating income orcharges, therefore rose slightly from 339.0

24ing period. This also meant that the domestic
banks were able to make a further slight re-duction in their cost/income ratio. With a re-duction of 1 percentage point, the improve-ment in the cost/income ratio based on totaloperational income was, in fact, somewhatlarger in 2004 than in 2003. After statisticaladjustment, nearly all categories of institu-tions recorded a slight decline in administra-tive expenditure in relation to operational in-come. The fall was particularly marked in thecase of the regional institutions of credit co-operatives and the regional banks.
Net income or net charges from the
valuation of assets
As in 2003, the German banking industry
was able to make a marked reduction in itsrisk provisioning in the 2004 financial year.Net charges from the valuation of loans,claims and securities, at 317.2 billion, were
34.5 billion, or 20
1/C252%, down on the year. In
the case of banks showing, on balance,write-offs and write-downs, these fell by 33.9
billion to 319.4 billion. The increase in value
adjustments and the release of provisions,which are less important in terms of volume,had a similar effect. These went up by 30.6
billion to 32.2 billion.

25amounted to 0.24% in the reporting year,
compared with 0.44% in 2002 and 0.31% in2003, and thus roughly matched the levels of2000 and 2001. On balance, 31.4 billion was
added to the fund for general banking risks(pursuant to section 340 (g) of the GermanCommercial Code) in 2004. However, in theperformance analysis presented here, thisamount is allocated to the disposition ofprofit (accumulation of reserves) and is there-fore not reflected in a lower profit for the fi-nancial year.
Write-downs on debt securities, which accrue
in part to net income or net charges from thevaluation of assets, amounted to 30.6 billion
in 2004, which was perceptibly lower than in2003 ( 31.9 billion). This means that, in the re-
porting year, too, most of the net valuationcharges are likely to have been accounted for
by banks’ lending business. In this respect, forthe first time since 1999, domestic Germancredit institutions encountered a decliningnumber of corporate insolvencies, which de-creased by
1/C252% to 39,213. As there was a
simultaneous increase in the percentage ofsmall firms affected by insolvencies, risk provi-sioning from the German banks’ corporatebanking business probably played a less im-portant role than it had done in 2003, espe-cially as the German banks are likely to havemade a further reduction in loans to enter-prises as part of the general decline in theirrisk assets. By contrast, the sharply risingtrend in consumer insolvencies continued in2004 (+46% to 49,123) and therefore againplaced a greater strain in the banks’ profitsthan in the year before.

to households constituting a comparativelysmall share of the total volume of loansand the fact that they therefore have a rela-tively minor impact on risk provisioning as awhole.
The big banks and the Landesbanken, ie
mainly those banks which had been particu-larly affected by the steep increase in risk pro-visioning in 2002, sharply reduced their netvaluation charges. The regional banks andother commercial banks also cut back theirrisk provisioning. By contrast, the savingsbanks involved in retail business recordedhigher net charges than in 2003, whereasthose of the cooperative banks remainedmore or less unchanged. Overall, the strainplaced on the individual categories of banksby net income or net charges from the valu-
ation of assets varied considerably. In relationto the average balance sheet total, the bigbanks, the Landesbanken and the regionalinstitutions of credit cooperatives allocated0.17%, 0.05% and 0.17% respectively forrisk provisioning. In the case of the regionalbanks and other commercial banks, the per-centage share amounted to 0.40%.

crease was widely spread, it was especiallypronounced for the big banks and the Lan-desbanken, both of which had suffered sharpsetbacks in the past. By contrast, the savingsbanks recorded a slight fall in their operatingresult.
Other and extraordinary income or
charges
In the reporting year, net other and extraor-
dinary income or charges improved onlyslightly from - 315.5 billion in 2003 to - 312.3
billion, thus remaining on a scale which, on alonger-term comparison, reduced the resultof the German banking industry extremelysharply. As in 2003, some categories of bankswere particularly affected by this develop-ment. Thus, the negative balance of the“extraordinary accounts” in the case of theregional banks and other commercial banks(-32.6 billion following - 32.5 billion) as well
as the Landesbanken (- 34.5 billion following
-34.6 billion) remained at the same level as in
2003, while it was halved in the case of thebig banks but was again at a comparativelyhigh level at - 34.4 billion, having been - 38.0
billion. As in 2003, the other categories ofbanks made a comparatively small contribu-tion to the “extraordinary accounts” of allcredit institutions.
In contrast to 2003, when the development
of the “extraordinary accounts” was domin-ated by the slump in the net result from creditinstitutions’ financial investment business,this, at - 30.3 billion, made no more than asmall contribution to the negative outcome
of these accounts in 2004. Specifically, in thecase of institutions which showed netcharges from write-offs and write-downs inrespect of participating interests, shares in af-filiated enterprises and securities treated asfixed assets, these declined from 37.5 billion
in 2003 to 31.4 billion in 2004.
3However,
the matching (net) income also declined from32.2 billion in 2003 to 31.1 billion in 2004.

paired the balance on “extraordinary ac-count” less severely than in 2003, whiletransferred profits increased slightly from33.6 billion to 33.9 billion and net income
from the release of special reserves fell ( 312
billion following 3387 billion).
Above all, however, it was net extraordinary
income or charges in the narrower sense thathad a negative impact, amounting to - 37.2
billion in the reporting year (compared with-34.2 billion in 2003), with mainly the big
banks and Landesbanken suffering significantstrains arising from the extraordinary accountin the narrower sense. In the case of the bigbanks, net extraordinary income or chargeswere at more or less the same high level as in2003 (- 33.5 billion compared with - 33.6 bil-lion). Besides charges associated with restruc-
turing measures, this mainly reflected specialwrite-downs from the property financing areaof a single bank, as the published individualaccounts show. The deterioration in the bal-ance of the extraordinary accounts in the nar-rower sense was, however, mainly due to thecategory of Landesbanken (- 32.8 billion fol-
lowing - 30.6 billion). Some of the Landesban-
ken were affected by the repayment obliga-tions resulting from the EU investigations intothe granting of state aid. The improvementlikewise achieved by this category of banks inthe net result from financial investment busi-ness was a long way from offsetting the in-creased charges.Breakdown of other and extraordinary income or charges*

29Profit for the financial year,
taxes on income and earnings
The declining burden from the “extraordinary
account” led to an increase in the profit forthe financial year before tax which was great-er than the increase in the operating result. In2004, the German banking industry’s profitfor the year before tax totalled 310.4 billion,
compared with only 31.8 billion in 2003. This
positive trend may be observed across mostof the categories of banks. It is also apparent,however, that the improvement in the profitfor the year before tax can also be seen as acorrection of earlier developments. It was,therefore, most obvious in those categories inwhich the decline had been especially markedin the past few years. In addition to the Lan-desbanken ( 30.5 billion compared with - 32.2
billion), these were mainly the big banks(-32.1 billion compared with - 37.3 billion),
which nevertheless in total showed a nega-tive figure for the third time in succession.The credit cooperatives ( 33.0 billion com-
pared with 32.9 billion) were likewise able to
slightly improve their pre-tax profits, whilethe savings banks ( 34.5 billion as against 34.8
billion) and the mortgage banks ( 30.6 billion
after 30.8 billion) suffered minor losses.
The overall more favourable performance de-
velopments in the reporting year were also re-flected in the fact that the German banksshowed a higher return on equity, which haddeteriorated in the two years before. Calcu-lated on an average of all banks and beforetax, it amounted to 4.21% in 2004, com-pared with 4.49% in 2002 and 0.72% in2003. However, this meant it was still clearlydown on the level of the period from 1997 to
2001, in which there were marked differ-ences between the individual categories ofbanks.
Driven by income, taxes on income and earn-
ings rose slightly from 35.5 billion in 2003 to
35.6 billion in the reporting year. Whereas
most categories of banks recorded higher taxcharges in 2004, these were perceptiblylower for the savings banks which, owing toa special effect based on the non-recognitionof write-downs to their going-concern valuefor tax purposes, had had to pay extensivetax arrears in 2003.

30After tax, the German banking industry’s net
profit for the 2004 financial year totalled34.8 billion compared with a net loss of - 33.7
billion in the previous year. Both the bigbanks and the Landesbanken showed a nega-tive result. As in previous years, in calculatingthe balance sheet profit, substantial lossescarried forward, totalling 32.6 billion in 2004,
reduced the profit for the year after tax. Inaddition, 31.4 billion net was allocated to the
fund for general banking risks, thus puttingpressure on profits. In the reporting year, too,the German banking industry drew on provi-sions and participation rights capital to stabil-ise the recorded balance sheet profit, albeiton a perceptibly smaller scale than in 2003.

Overall, the balance sheet profit shown bythe German banks increased only slightly. Itamounted to 33.9 billion in 2004, after beingno more than 33.6 billion in 2003 and as
much as 34.8 billion in 2002.
Outlook
For the current financial year so far, a further
moderate recovery in domestic banks’ per-formance is emerging. For example, risingequity prices, at least in the first half of theyear, should result in good net commission in-come and a higher year-on-year trading re-sult. The restructuring measures implementedin the reporting year will probably push downadministrative costs further, which shouldcertainly benefit, not least, the savings banksReturn on capital of individual categories of banks*

31and the credit cooperatives as well. However,
in interest business, it remains to be seenhow far an increase on the result for 2004can be achieved. In this respect, the continu-ing weak growth path of domestic economicactivity, at least in the first half of 2005, stoodin the way of a sustained rise. However, thecontinuing decline in the number of corpor-ate insolvencies, at least in the first half of theyear, will probably ease the situation with re-
gard to the valuation result. Finally, as thingsstand at present, there are no identifiablespecial factors, such as the EU investigationsinto the granting of state aid, that would notonly place a burden on the performance ofindividual categories of banks but also, on ac-count of their scale, have a perceptible im-pact on the aggregate performance figures.

45Recent trends in
individual paymentsSince November 2001 the Deutsche
Bundesbank has been operatingRTGS
plus, the biggest individual pay-
ment system within TARGET, the real-time gross settlement system of theEuropean Union central banks. Eachday in RTGS
plusaround 170 participat-
ing banks settle roughly 140,000 pay-ments with a value of more than 5500
billion. Thus, RTGS
plusis a key factor in
the infrastructure of Germany as a fi-nancial centre. Having explained theconcept of RTGS
plusin July 2000 and
described its initial experiences withthe system in April 2002, in this articlethe Bundesbank presents individualpayment systems from a broader per-spective. The article starts by illustrat-ing the significance of individual pay-ment systems for central banks, outlin-ing the most important stimuli behindthe dynamic transformation which hasbeen observed over the past few years.Exogenous factors, such as the intro-duction of the euro and the globalthreat of terrorism, have played amajor role. The article then goes on toidentify considerable innovations inand changes to individual payment sys-tems and concludes by discussing somecurrent issues.

46over and fast processing, which frequently
allow immediate settlement of payments inreal time. As well as processing paymentswhich arise from interbank transactions,banks also use these systems for urgent cus-tomer payments which in former times wouldhave been authorised telegraphically andneed to be transferred as quickly as possiblefrom the transferor’s bank to the beneficiary’sbank. Owing to the high volumes, individualpayment systems are extremely important forthe financial stability of a country. Apart froma few private providers, it is mainly centralbanks that act as system operators since indi-vidual payment systems are also of primaryimportance to monetary policy, the effects ofwhich are felt on the money market. An effi-cient money market requires that centralbank money – ie balances on accounts heldat the central banks – can be moved quicklyand safely between banks. Owing to the highdegree of liquidity of central bank money andcentral banks’ resistance to insolvency, thesepayment systems are particularly suitable forthe settlement of transactions processed onother markets (eg securities markets) or inother systems. Operating the system them-selves gives central banks the advantage ofbeing able to control the design of these im-portant systems taking into account risk andefficiency. Furthermore, as players of thebanking industry geared towards the com-mon good, they offer competitively neutraland open access to their payment systems.
The mandate stating that the Bundesbank
shall arrange for the execution of domesticand international payments, which has beenenshrined in section 3 of the Bundesbank Actsince 1957, underlines that in the area of pay-
ments the Bundesbank is to act solely in thepublic interest and is not to pursue any com-mercial objectives. This legal basis has sincebeen supplemented by Article 105 (2) of theTreaty establishing the European Community(EC Treaty) and Article 22 of the Statute ofthe European System of Central Banks (ESCB)and of the European Central Bank (ECB),which explain that one of the tasks of theESCB is to promote the smooth operation ofpayment systems. The statutory provisions ofthe European Union (EU) also provide thatthe Bundesbank is to act in accordance withthe principles of an open market economy.
The Bundesbank fulfils its legal mandate in
the field of cashless payments by assumingthree different functions, all of which ultim-ately contribute to the high degree of securityand efficiency in German payments. Firstly, aspart of the general payment policy, the Bun-desbank acts as a catalyst and facilitator ofcurrent developments. Secondly, it assumesthe role of payment systems overseer – a taskwhich has taken shape in the past few yearsas a result of increasing emphasis on the po-tential risks involved in operating paymentsystems. Thirdly, the Bundesbank also oper-ates its own payment systems. While itsliquidity-saving real-time gross settlement sys-tem, RTGS
plus, is of key importance to the
German financial sector owing to its pro-nounced relevance to monetary policy andfinancial market stability, the Bundesbankplays only a complementary role in retail pay-ments with its RPS system (Retail PaymentSystem).

47Individual payment systems in a
state of flux
Increasing competition, cost pressures and
the integration of regional markets are thedriving forces behind the rapid developmentsin individual payment systems and also signifya particular challenge for the Bundesbank.
In particular, the users’ influence on the on-
going development of payment systems hasincreased, not least as a result of greateremphasis on cost/benefit considerations. TheBundesbank has been implementing changesto existing systems or creating new systems inresponse to customer requests for some time.The high level of acceptance and the wide-spread use of systems operated by the Bun-desbank are attributable not least to thisstrong focus on the market’s and the custom-ers’ needs. The close cooperation with thebanking industry resulted in the introductionof numerous innovative and trend-setting sys-tems. For example, the net system ElectronicAccess Frankfurt (EAF) launched in 1990, wasexpanded to form the hybrid system EAF 2in 1996 and ultimately transformed intothe liquidity-saving real-time gross systemRTGS
plusin 2001.
Important stimuli for increased security and
efficiency in payment systems also came fromnew legal and regulatory framework require-ments. These mainly included the “CorePrinciples for Systemically Important PaymentSystems” adopted by the G10 central banksin 2001. They define principles for the designand operation of payment systems, whichmust be observed and implemented by

48the respective system operators. Compliance
with these principles is checked by the centralbanks as part of their function as overseer.Furthermore, statutory measures taken large-ly at the EU level have helped to reduce legalrisks in payments. Thus, pursuant to theSettlement Finality Directive of 19 May 1998,payment orders and any netting are legallyenforceable even in the event of insolvencyproceedings against the participant. However,payment systems profit from this protectiononly if they have been notified to the Euro-pean Commission in accordance with theprovisions of the Directive.
Information technology plays a key role in the
ability to use customer requirements concern-ing payment transactions to improve therange of services. Only the technological pro-gress of the past few years has made so manytrend-setting developments possible. Now-adays, infrastructure and software compon-ents are less expensive and considerably moreefficient, thus creating the basis for the devel-opment and implementation of new func-tionalities. This is especially evident in internettechnology, which allows users of individualpayment systems – similar to online bankingcustomers – total transaction transparency byproviding up-to-date information in real timeand ensuring fast and simple interaction withthe system.
The changing structure of banks and financial
markets is having a considerable impact onindividual payment systems. Mergers and ac-quisitions, in particular, are resulting in in-creased concentration of the settlement ofpayments. Although, on the one hand, thismay raise operational efficiency and improve
the use of liquidity, on the other hand, thereis greater potential risk if technical disruptionsoccur or creditworthiness deteriorates. Fur-thermore, the system operators must antici-pate lower payment volumes and – for cross-border acquisitions – take account of morepronounced international lines of develop-ment.
The introduction of the euro in 1999 has cer-
tainly had the most lasting impact on pay-ment systems in Europe. On the supply-side,two new cross-border individual paymentsystems, the TARGET system of the EU centralbanks and the EURO1 system of the EuroBanking Association (EBA), were created.TARGET consists of 17 EU national real-timegross settlement systems (RTGS), including theGerman RTGS
plussystem. Ultimately, these
pan-European infrastructures have increasedthe flexibility of European banks in decidingon various clearing options. At the sametime, traditional (cross-border) correspondentbanking in Europe has become much lessimportant, especially since the first pan-European clearing house for retail payments,STEP2, started operating in 2003.
From the outset, the TARGET system has been
evolving into the leading system in Europe. In1999 around 160,000 payments (includingdomestic payments) with a value of almost31 trillion were settled on average each day.
Since then transaction volumes have steadilyincreased. In 2004 around 1,500 banks rout-ed on average roughly 270,000 payments aday, amounting to 31.7 trillion, via TARGET.Technological

49However, the terror attacks of 11 September
2001 had a lasting impact on the infrastruc-tural development of the financial system,too. The attacks in New York, as well as thosein Madrid and London, have clearly shownthat terrorism has reached a new internation-al dimension, representing a great potentialrisk to the financial system. This applies espe-cially to those payment and clearing systemswhich are systemically important because oftheir function or their turnover volumes. Fur-thermore, the power failures in the UnitedStates, Canada, Italy and Sweden have madeit evident that the functional viability of sys-tems can be directly threatened. In responseto these events, business continuity plans,which enable operations to continue as nor-mal in emergency and disaster situations,have been vigorously pursued.
Recent developments in the system
design of individual payment systems
Until the 1980s individual payment systems
were dominated by net procedures. In netsystems payments are exchanged betweenbanks during the day and initially onlycleared. The final settlement of the partici-pants’ debit and credit positions takes placein central bank money at the end of the dayto save liquidity. In the wake of the sharp risein payment volumes and the increasing inter-nationalisation of financial flows, globalawareness of the risks of such net proceduresincreased. These risks occur above all when aparticipant is unable to meet its payment obli-gations at the end of the day. The credit andliquidity risks arising from the necessary rever-sal of payments may result in a systemic risk.
Consequently, the “Committee on InterbankNetting Schemes of the Central Banks of theGroup of Ten Countries” at the Bank forInternational Settlements (BIS) laid down min-imum requirements for cross-border nettingprocedures in the “Lamfalussy Report” in1990. As a result, efforts were intensified toreduce payments risks, resulting in the cre-ation of three lines of development, which allultimately address the trade-off between lowrisk owing to rapid payment settlement andlowest possible costs owing to a low use ofliquidity.
Secured net systems – an example being the
EURO1 system of the EBA – retain the trad-itional processing logic of net systems andallow payments to be settled at low liquiditycosts using the principle of bilateral or multi-lateral clearing. Various security mechanismshave been put in place to alleviate the associ-ated credit and liquidity risks. These include,for example, defining bilateral and multilat-eral credit limits to restrict the overall positionof a participant throughout the day, deposit-ing collateral to cover any shortfalls and set-ting up a loss-sharing scheme among partici-pants.
The first hybrid systems appeared in the mid-
1990s. These are net systems which havebeen enriched with elements from the RTGSsystems, thus allowing payment only oncethe funds are available. The EAF 2, introducedby the Bundesbank in 1996, was the tem-plate for a development which has since beentaken on by the French PNS system (Paris NetSettlement, 1999) and the American CHIPS

50system (2001). A crucial element of the EAF 2
was that individual payments were effectedin short intervals with immediate finality.Since offsetting payments did not usuallymatch exactly, to settle the difference in theamounts, recourse was made to central bankmoney which was provided in advance inlimited amounts by the participant. With theaid of efficient algorithms which took advan-tage of the two-way flow of offsetting pay-ments a very low level of liquidity of onlyDM3 billion was needed to settle a deliveryvolume of more than DM715 billion.
The third line of development was the
real-time gross settlement systems, whosedesign includes liquidity-saving and liquidity-managing elements, thus rendering hybridsystems superfluous. The Bundesbank wasalso a pioneer of this development. In 2001 it
integrated its gross system ELS (Euro Link Sys-tem) with the hybrid system EAF 2 to formthe new liquidity-saving RTGS
plussystem. The
concept has since been realised in othercountries (eg BIREL in Italy). In these new, ad-vanced real-time gross settlement systems, asin the traditional real-time gross settlementsystems, all submitted payments are pro-cessed as they are received and settled withimmediate finality as long as there is sufficientcover. Owing to the continuous use of algo-rithms, offsetting payments from other par-ticipants may also be extensively used ascover in addition to the participant’s creditbalance on its central bank account and theintra-day credit provided by the central bank.This ensures a timely and liquidity-saving exe-cution of payments throughout the day.

51thermore, advanced real-time gross settle-
ment systems offer participants a wide rangeof options for managing their liquidity.
The introduction of the euro should enable
the development of a Single European Pay-ments Area alongside the single euro area.The TARGET system, founded in 1999, madea first positive contribution to this integration.However, it quickly became clear that thedecentralised structure consisting of the17 RTGS systems as the national TARGETcomponents has a structural disadvantagesince, from a cost and performance perspec-tive and owing to potentially vulnerable sys-tem stability, an optimal market supply can-not be ensured in the medium term. The en-largement of the EU by ten countries on1 May 2004 aggravated this problem. TheESCB begun working on a new TARGET gen-eration (TARGET2) in 2002. The Europeanbanking industry expressly requested a singleTARGET2 platform. The associated technicalconsolidation, broad harmonisation of ser-vices and standardisation of interfaces wouldoffer all European credit institutions a similarlyhigh level of services and, as a result of theconcentration of payment flows, in particular,would allow pan-European liquidity manage-ment. In October 2003 the Bundesbank andthe central banks of France and Italy submit-ted a common offer to develop and operatesuch a TARGET2 platform, which was adopt-ed by the Governing Council of the ECB on16 December 2004. This offer was based onthe idea of retaining key conceptual modulesfrom present systems, for example theRTGS
plusprocessing logic, in the future TAR-
GET2 system. TARGET2 will therefore fall intothe category of an advanced real-time gross
settlement system. All the Eurosystem centralbanks as well as the central bank of Denmarkand some of the new EU member states willuse the TARGET2 single platform from theoutset.
Beyond the currency borders, too, the first
signs of greater integration as a result of theincreased interlinking of economic activity arebecoming apparent. For example, since Sep-tember 2002 the Continuous Link Settlement(CLS) system has been used for the cashsettlement of international foreign exchangetransactions in 15 different currencies. CLShas achieved a market share of around 30% –measured in terms of global foreign exchangetransactions. The 100,000 transactions car-ried out daily involving two currencies aresimultaneously settled according to thepayment-versus-payment (PVP) principle. Thiseliminates the foreign exchange settlementrisk. The participants must provide centralbank money in advance in order to settletransactions. This involves close cooperationbetween the CLS system and the respectiveRTGS systems of the central banks operatingin the various time zones. Ultimately, CLS re-quires that the participants exercise preciseand global liquidity management.
Another new concept is the development of
standardised arrangements for settling pay-ments in foreign currencies by banks. Theseprocedures have features of payment systemsbut may also be considered as specific corres-pondent banking. There may be a need forsuch arrangements in international financialcentres (such as Hong Kong). They may, how-TARGET 2

52ever, also be employed by countries which
maintain a high volume of payment transac-tions with neighbouring countries, but wheredomestic banks are unable to participate inthe neighbouring countries’ payment systemsfor legal reasons. An example is the SwissEuro Clearing Bank (SECB) domiciled inFrankfurt and the settlement arrangements“EuroSIC” that it uses to allow Swiss creditinstitutions to settle euro payments amongthemselves and with EU countries. Further-more, in future the fact that, owing to global-isation, an increasing number of paymentflows are concentrated at a few large banksmay well be of significance.
Focus on liquidity management
In addition to being as cost-effective as pos-
sible, individual payment systems must alsoresolve the classic trade-off between low-level liquidity requirements and fast execu-tion. Modern individual payment systems,such as RTGS
plusand TARGET2, attempt to
satisfy these two objectives equally usinghighly developed processing logic and a widerange of information and control options.Consequently, the participant is responsiblefor and has precise control over its liquidityposition and payment flows. As a generalrule, a whole series of different parametersare available for this purpose.
– Payment processing is controlled by as-
signing priorities. These are often specifiedby the participants when they transmitthe payment. In some cases, such as thecentral bank’s monetary policy operations,
the system can also assign priorities.
– The participant can reserve a certain part
of its liquidity resources for particularlytime-critical payments, ie the settlementof securities transactions.
– Payments can often be submitted a few
days in advance or assigned an exact exe-cution time.
– Using sender limits the participant can re-
strict the amount of liquidity to be paidout to certain participants. If these limitshave been reached, further payments forthe participant are only executed once thecounterparty makes its own payments. Asa result of this, a high synchronisationof payment flows and consequentlyliquidity-saving processing are possible.For the counterparty, sender limits are anincentive to submit payments early; onthe whole they help to reduce risks in pay-ments and thus contribute to financial sta-bility.
– In TARGET2 it will also be possible for the
participants to combine several accountsinto one group which may allow a consoli-dated overall view of liquidity, or addition-ally, be used as a liquidity pool in the indi-vidual accounts.
Throughout the day, the participant can
change its parameters, for example, theamount of the limits can be adjusted or thepriority of a payment can be upgraded ordowngraded. Specific payment-related par-

53ameters can, however, only be changed as
long as the payment has not been executedwith finality. A web-based interactive infor-mation and control module is often used as atechnical aid. This enables the participants toview their current account balance at anytime, display the processing status and thedetails of a payment or monitor their ingoingand outgoing queues. This transparency en-ables the participant to obtain an exact as-sessment of the current liquidity position anda projection of the future liquidity position.
A high payment throughput and an optimal
use of available liquidity can be achieved inmodern individual payment systems by imple-menting highly developed clearing mechan-isms. An attempt is made to execute pendingpayments owing to lack of cover as quickly aspossible. RTGS
plususes complex mathematic-
al procedures, which either attempt to con-tinuously identify offsetting payment flows atvery short intervals or work on an event-oriented basis. The latter is the case, for ex-ample, if the order of the queue is changedor if new payments submitted by other par-ticipants can be used to cover pending pay-ments.
For both the central banks of the G10 coun-
tries and in the Eurosystem, the spectrum ofeligible collateral for intraday credit has beenbroadened several times in the past fewyears. For example, the Eurosystem’s standardlist of eligible collateral was extended on1 July 2005 to include euro debt instrumentsissued by G10 countries not participating inEMU, and from 1 January 2007 bank loanswill also be eligible. The resultant extendedaccess to intraday credit, which is interest-
free in the Eurosystem, does not renderliquidity savings and management elementsof modern individual payment systems obso-lete. Regardless of their liquidity position,credit institutions can enforce offsetting pay-ments by setting limits, thus preventing theircounterparts from claiming the sender’sliquidity. Moreover, peak loads in the liquidityrequirement and increasingly conflicting de-mand for central bank money by securitiessettlement systems and foreign exchangesystems can be more effectively and conveni-ently intercepted.
Technical communication and
infrastructure
The technical communication between par-
ticipants and the system is very important fora sophisticated payment system. Standard-ised, secure and cost-effective means of com-munication must be found. The standardsfor messaging established by SWIFT
1have
dominated individual payment systems forsome time now, allowing highly automatedstraight-through processing for all parties.However, many payment systems now alsouse the SWIFTNet communication serviceprovided by SWIFT for payment flows, infor-mation and management. SWIFT provides asophisticated, highly secure and highly avail-able network with worldwide coverage (over200 countries) which is also used by eight ofthe G10 countries for sending messages intheir national real-time gross settlement sys-

54tems. However, this induces increased risk if
SWIFT is unavailable. Thus, in the context ofpayment systems oversight, the central bankshave committed SWIFT to providing compre-hensive pre-emptive measures to ensure busi-ness continuity in the event of an emergencyor a disaster.
The rise in potential external dangers is re-
flected in the considerable improvement inbusiness continuity concepts and pre-emptivemeasures, particularly in the area of systemic-ally important payment systems. One of theinitial focal points was the preparation of ef-fective communication concepts in crisis situ-ations. Now all participants are under obliga-tion to prepare for a number of differentscenarios for restarting systems and resumingbusiness operations. Wide-area disaster scen-arios must also be reckoned with. The futureTARGET2 concept will counter this threat bysplitting operations between four locations intwo distant regions.
Securities settlement systems and other
systems settling in central bank money
Besides the individual payment systems oper-
ated by the central banks, there are also anumber of other systems used to settle finan-cial transactions. Securities settlement sys-tems, in particular, play a significant role.According to the international standards forpayment systems oversight, the settlement ofsystemically important payment systems andthe monetary settlement of securities shouldbe carried out preferably in central bankmoney. Although the use of commercial bankmoney is also possible, it is increasingly less
attractive given the high degree of securityand liquidity of central bank money. As a gen-eral rule, real-time gross-settlement systemsoperating in central bank money are used forsettling payments or balances of other sys-tems. The way they interact can be set up indifferent ways.
Using the interfaced model, the transactions
of participants in the securities settlementsystems are settled by interacting with therelevant payment systems in central bankmoney. By contrast, in the integrated model,the central bank outsources its account ser-vices for the cash leg of securities settlementto the securities settlement system, and thecentral bank money accounts held there aremanaged only by the banks. In Germany aguarantee model is used, in which the poten-tial debit positions are secured by centralbank liquidity provided in advance (or by aguarantee from the Bundesbank for the cor-responding amount) without account man-agement being outsourced to the securitiessettlement system.
Governance; participant structure
For almost all individual payment systems, the
central banks act as owner and operator. Theadvantage of this is that payments can be set-tled easily in central bank money via centralbank accounts. In some cases, such as theFrench PNS, the Belgian ELLIPS and the UKCHAPS sterling/euro, the payment systems(sometimes without account management)are jointly owned by the central banks and

55the private sector. In addition, there are also
some examples of privately operated individ-ual payment systems, such as CLS, EURO1and CHIPS (United States), which have touse one of the real-time gross-settlementsystems of the central banks for the ultimatesettlement of payments in central bankmoney. The Swiss SIC system is a special case,whereby the central bank has formally out-sourced the operation of the real-time gross-settlement system and account managementto the private sector. However, de facto re-sponsibility lies with the Swiss central bank,which, through various contracts, was able toensure an overriding degree of influence onthe system (including the right to have a sayin system changes and the oversight of thesystem’s daily operations).
The future TARGET2 system of the EU central
banks will also present a special case. Al-though payment system operations will belargely concentrated on platforms operatedby the German, Italian and French centralbanks (3CB), the principle of decentralisationin the ESCB will be reflected by the fact thateach central bank in the ESCB will remainfully responsible for maintaining the businessrelations to its own customers. In fact, the EUcentral banks will be outsourcing the oper-ation of the system to the single shared plat-form operated by the 3CB. Unlike outsour-cing to a commercial third party, this is not atraditional form of outsourcing, but a special-isation within the ESCB, which may pave theway for setting up service centres at the spe-cific central banks of the ESCB.All individual payment systems set certain
access criteria in order to prevent risks orachieve a favourable service level for the sys-tem. As a general rule, these criteria mustbe objective and publicly disclosed. Centralbanks, in particular, ensure that these accesscriteria permit fair and open access not onlynominally but in practice, too. In this way, allbanks, even smaller institutions, can beoffered direct and competitively neutral ac-cess to interbank clearing.
Moreover, in view of the increasing complex-
ity of system concepts, direct participationentails considerable investment costs, whichmay not be feasible for some smaller banks.In such cases, these banks resort to an indir-ect participation by using a direct participantto settle their individual payments. Owing toits nature, this is a correspondent banking re-lation, which may be of strategic importancein associations, such as the savings bank andcooperative bank sectors in Germany. From arisk policy perspective, a widespread use ofindirect participation may mean that paymentflows are concentrated on a smaller numberof direct participants and that payments aresettled in their books – and thus in commer-cial bank money.
Ultimately, there is no clear guideline for the
desired ratio between direct and indirect par-ticipants. Rather, it depends on the bankstructure in the relevant country, on individualcost/benefit ratios and other traditional fac-tors. Therefore, the spread of direct partici-pants ranges from around 7,800 banks inthe US Fedwire system to less than 20 par-ticipants in the CHAPS system in the UK.

Individual payment systems still in
a state of flux
Particularly intense discussions are currently
underway with regards to the operatingtimes of individual payment systems. For ex-ample, the Swiss SIC system is already open24 hours for submission of payments and23 hours for processing. Moreover, the USFedwire system recently extended its operat-ing times to 22 hours. Longer operatinghours may make the payment systems moreattractive by creating a higher processing cap-acity and allowing better interaction withother financial market segments (eg securitiestransactions). Operational risks for system op-erators and participants may also be reducedand available liquidity and computer centreservices used more efficiently. However, ex-tending the operating hours means consider-ably higher costs. Therefore, for TARGET2 theintention is to offer only limited night-timeservices, the sole purpose of which will be thesettlement of ancillary systems. The Europeanbanking industry, in particular, has made itclear that from a cost/benefit viewpoint, itsees no initial need for TARGET2 to be fullyopen throughout the whole night.
Against the background of technological de-
velopments, many observers expect a closerintegration of the individual payments and re-tail payments segments in the near future. In-dividual payment systems are characterisedby the speed and security of their paymentprocessing, which is reflected in a relatively
high settlement price. However, the fact thatthese systems are used not solely for largepayments is evident, for example, in the Ger-man RTGS
plussystem: more than 70% of all
payment orders are for amounts of less than350,000 and almost 30% for amounts less
than 32,500. At the same time, the process-
ing times in European retail payment systemshave been reduced further partly in responseto statutory provisions but also as a result ofinnovative providers mostly in the smaller EUmember states. Some retail payment systemsalready offer additional daytime processingcycles, which allow a same-day settlement.Given that nearly all larger countries still haveseparate systems for individual and retail pay-ment systems and that the settlement costsfor retail payments play a particularly majorrole, it is still likely to be several years beforeretail payments can also be settled in real-time.
Central banks have a substantial interest in
the most widespread use of secure and highlyliquid central bank money. However, centralbanks hold the monopoly for providing cen-tral bank money. In order to profit from theadvantages of central bank money, some sys-tem operators – such as CLS – have changedover to a “prefunding” approach, in whichcentral bank money has to be provided bythe participants in advance on a central bankaccount held for the system operator. A fur-ther step would be if the central banks wereto outsource their account management toexternal system operators (see page 54). Inthe long term, such a development would re-sult in a withdrawal from operational busi-24-hour

57ness and may endanger the banking compe-
tence of the central bank. Furthermore, thestrategic dependency on the contractorwould expose the central bank to consider-able economic and reputational risks. In fact,it would be questionable whether the centralbank – supported only by contractual agree-ments – could continue to control and shapethe development of the highly sensitive areaof central bank money provision to a suffi-cient extent. Moreover, under the principle ofcompetitive neutrality, it would have to pre-vent individual systems from obtaining privil-eges with regard to the use of central bankmoney and gaining competitive advantagesover other private providers. Outsourcing toseveral, rival systems would be the answer.However, the resultant splitting of liquiditywould probably lead to an inefficient overallsolution in conflict with the current approachof managing liquidity in the central bank sys-tem and would most likely make liquiditymanagement more difficult for central banksand other banks.
When the central bank operates its own sys-
tem, the fundamental question arises ofwhether pricing decisions must always meetthe principle of full cost coverage. Economicreasons would initially indicate that a cost-oriented price policy will result in a provisionof services in line with market conditions andprevent a misallocation of resources. On theother hand, there is good reason to believe
that with their services central banks react tomarket imperfections or generate external ef-fects which are not covered by market pricesand may legitimate accountability for the op-erational activities of central banks. Individualexamples might include a particularly highquality of business continuity provisions or ahigh level of security for settlements – espe-cially owing to immediate finality in centralbank money – which have a positive impacton the stability of the entire financial market.The resultant scope of flexibility in the pricingpolicy can, however, be evaluated only on acase-by-case basis and with restraint. Further-more, such leeway is reduced when the cen-tral bank imposes obligations on other systemoperators as part of payment systems over-sight, leading to a quality comparable to thatof their own services.
Successful individual payment systems are
based on market needs, change with themarkets and will in future take on the shapewhich is best suited to dealing with the forth-coming challenges. The Bundesbank will ob-serve the changes in individual payment sys-tems in accordance with its mandate undersection 3 of the Bundesbank Act and will con-tinue to contribute to the high level of secur-ity and efficiency in its role as partner to thebanks, service provider within the Eurosystemand pro-active facilitator.

59The role of
volatility patterns in
financial marketsA broad range of stress indicators is
drawn on for the ongoing monitoringof financial markets. Volatility develop-ments in the prices and yields of assetsplay a special role in this contextowing to their dual nature as both astress factor and a stress indicator.With respect to financial stability, it isimportant to differentiate between alevel of volatility that reflects funda-mentally justified price movementsunder normal market conditions anddetrimental excess volatility. The dy-namic evolution of the dispersion ofasset price movements, in turn, ischaracterised by particular patternswhich will be illustrated using stockmarket volatilities as examples. Onesuch pattern is an alternation betweenphases of high and low volatility.This phenomenon must be taken intoaccount in the formation of expect-ations regarding the future disper-sion of share prices. The followingempirical analysis comes to the con-clusion that volatility patterns andother stress indicators as at end-August2005 do not indicate any immediatelypending problems. However, this doesnot lessen the need to keep financialmarket stability at the focus of atten-tion.

60Volatility in the financial markets –
both a stress factor and a stress indicator
The term volatility describes the extent to
which asset prices fluctuate over a givenperiod. It is often expressed in terms of thestandard deviation of the changes of logarith-mic asset prices. However, as a rule, volatilitychanges over time. Alternatively, therefore,volatility is often computed using an expo-nential weighting scheme, with more recentobservations receiving a higher weighting inthe calculation than observations of the moredistant past.
1
From an investor’s point of view, volatilityoften serves as a proxy for uncertainty. Intechnical terms, volatility is a symmetricmeasure that increases both during periodsof marked positive price changes as well asduring periods of sharply declining prices.However, particularly the latter are perceived
2
by investors as being stressful,3whereas,
– other things being equal – strong upswingsin prices are less likely to cause concern.
4
Since for risk-averse investors the risk of see-ing lower valuations of their investment pos-itions when volatility increases is regarded asoutweighing the chances of possible risingvaluations, they will demand to be compen-sated for taking on such risks. This is one ofthe key concepts of portfolio theory. Hencestrong market-wide
5price movements – par-
ticularly if they occur unexpectedly and arenot hedged – can lead to problems concern-ing liquidity and creditworthiness, either dir-ectly or indirectly by an altered perception onthe part of (potential) counterparties. If sev-eral or for the financial system particularlyrelevant market participants are negatively af-
fected at the same time by sharp, unexpectedmarket movements, this may lead to disrup-tions in the various functions of the finan-cial system (such as payment settlement, risktransfer and risk assessment, credit and li-quidity allocation). This may in turn spill overto the real economy and price developmentsas capital suppliers will become more awareof potential information deficits. Their riskawareness may increase. Capital demanders,too, may take an increasingly cautious viewwhen assessing investment opportunities.Greater uncertainty and negative changes inhouseholds’ assets may also lead to a deteri-oration in consumer confidence. The extent

2Financial institutions attempt to assess the vulnerability
of their portfolios to certain pre-defined events by using
value at risk models and stress tests. Such events might
include price movements on the equity markets, ex-
change rate and interest rate movements etc. See
Deutsche Bundesbank, Stress tests at German banks –
methods and results, Monthly Report, October 2004,
pp 75-84 and Deutsche Bundesbank, Stress testing the
German banking system, Monthly Report, December

3In line with Illing and Liu (2003), financial market stress
can be described as the pressure which is exerted on eco-
nomic agents by uncertainty and changing expectations
concerning losses on the financial markets. The level of
financial market stress ultimately depends on the degree
of vulnerability of the financial system and the scale of
the shock. In this context, the degree of stress varies with
the size of the expected loss, risk, uncertainty regarding
future losses as well as the attitude towards risk of the
financial market participants. A crisis can thus be defined
as a phase of extreme financial market stress. See M Illing
and Y Liu (2003), An Index of Financial Stress for Canada,
Bank of Canada Working Paper 2003-14.
4From the perspective of the financial market supervis-
ory authorities, such price upswings are interesting all the
same: frequent and sharp price surges may be a sign of
euphoric exaggeration and may lead to the formation of
bubbles and hence precede and exacerbate stress situ-
ations which arise from subsequent price corrections.
5Precisely in phases of very sharp share price move-
ments, price changes of individual shares regularly show
a high degree of correlation. The diversification potential
attained through equity diversification cannot provide a
safeguard against such market-wide developments.Volatility as a

61of such spill-over effects hinges largely on
the respective financial market environment:portfolios which are strongly leveragedthrough derivatives and credit financing,the widespread pursuit of stop-loss andtrend-following strategies as well as liquiditycrunches and low transparency all amplifyvolatility and heighten the risk of systemicinstability.

Fluctuations in the volatility of asset yieldsare, however, not only a stress factor; volatil-ity patterns can also serve financial marketobservers as stress indicators. A look back atthe past shows that sharp upswings in volatil-ity may occur as an accompanying feature ofparticular stress situations in the financialmarkets. This is illustrated below using the ex-ample of the equity markets in Germany andin the United States. Extreme volatility up-
swings in the German share price index (DAX)and the Dow Jones Industrial Average haveoccurred regularly during financial marketepisodes which can be considered particularlystressful
7and can be associated with events
which placed a particular strain on the finan-cial markets.
When looking at the historical development
of share price volatility on the equity market(see chart), the volatility spike in the fourthquarter of 1987 is particularly striking. On19 October 1987, the Dow Jones lost over% p a

for this slump, which was the largest loss everto be recorded on a single day on the US mar-ket: waning confidence in the sustainabilityof the large US current account deficits, fearsof recession, a speculative price bubble andnew trading techniques (portfolio hedgingthrough automatic sales) all contributed tothe slide of share prices. At the same time,against the backdrop of a very critical debateon the consequences of highly leveragedbuy-outs, the US Congress discussedlegislative changes aimed at making hostiletakeovers by way of such buy-outs

more difficult. This further clouded the out-look for share prices. The volatility of theDow Jones peaked on 21 October at a levelof 106.6% per year, compared with an aver-age of 14.9% per year since 1980.
Continuous changes in asset prices and yields
are, of course, a natural feature of financialmarkets in response to the constantly chan-ging relationship between supply and de-mand. The unceasing stream of new informa-tion leads to reassessments of future incomefrom assets and to a constant adjustment ofsupply and demand as well as of the pricesand yields of the assets in question. Changesin exogenous data and a potential change intheir evaluation mean there will always be acertain amount of asset price dispersionwhich represents an equilibrium adjustmentto new data and assessments. Hence, notevery fluctuation in the rate of price changesposes a risk to financial market stability.
Volatility that mirrors the fundamentals is a
hallmark of efficient financial markets. Itmerely reflects the intensity of change in the
underlying fundamentals and the resultingassessment uncertainty as to future develop-ments. However, if a major negative shock onthe equity market occurs, this, together withthe resulting (direct) increase in volatility, evenif it is in line with the fundamentals, createsstress in the financial system. In such a scen-ario, even a destabilisation of the financialsystem is possible. This is compounded by thefact that, following a sharp increase, the vola-tility often tends to exhibit considerable per-sistence or even rise further. Distinct patternsof volatility clusters, which accompany abruptand possibly self-reinforcing share price pro-cesses, may be a reflection of market ineffi-ciencies. While a definitive judgement canoften only be made ex post, central banksand supervisory authorities also have to con-duct an ex ante or contemporaneous assess-ment with respect to potential undesirabledevelopments in the context of monitoringfinancial markets.
9This diagnosis requires
appropriate indicators as well as proceduresfor their analytical evaluation. As regards thelatter, experience has to be relied on to a con-siderable extent.
8A leveraged buy-out (LBO) denotes the acquisition of
an enterprise that is financed to a large extent by bor-
rowed capital. In this way, the equity capital used for this
purpose is leveraged, which may enable investors to
achieve a correspondingly high return on equity.
9With respect to financial stability aspects, a very low
level of volatility (over an extended period of time) can
also give cause for concern if it, for example, encourages
investors to underestimate the risks of possible valuation
corrections when making investment decisions or to
overrate return considerations to the detriment of risk as-
pects. See IMF, Global Financial Market Developments,

63Volatility and its dynamics –
modelling concepts
In the past, extreme share price slumps were
frequently followed by phases of increasedprice fluctuations on the equity market (rippleeffect – see chart opposite). Furthermore,above and beyond these extreme episodes,sharp price swings appear to exhibit a ten-dency to cluster. Major movements of theDAX and the S&P 500 have often been fol-lowed by marked countermovements andphases of increased price volatility. Also,negative tail events, defined here as dayswhen the share price index falls by more than3%, seem to be concentrated during certainperiods (see the box “Volatility and negativeextreme events illustrated by the DAX andthe Dow Jones Industrial Average” onpage 64).
One explanation for such phenomena might
be that periods of marked price fluctuationsare solely due to a relatively high frequency ofnew information which changes the markets’assessment. Hence, volatility would then sim-ply be the result of share price fluctuations inline with the fundamentals. But this is ratherimplausible. It is more likely that in such casesvolatility often also reflected heightened ner-vousness in the markets. New informationwas thus also differently received.
Hence asset price changes which generate
market tensions might trigger a change inagents’ risk assessment and also raise the de-gree of risk aversion, for example owing to anarrowing of the room for manoeuvre follow-ing the initial stress event. As market-widemovements have greater stress potential than
changes in individual share prices, the formercould become the focus of investors’ atten-tion. In the perception of stock market invest-ors, the prospects of different enterpriseswould then be adjusted by the same yard-stick, ie in the light of general market devel-opments. Such a macro-market convergenceof investor behaviour would lead to a dearthof counterparties, and large share priceVolatility and "yield pattern"

Industrial Average
Periods of extreme volatility are associated with 
very sharp changes in prices or yields. For invest-ors, a particularly severe depreciation of the assets in their portfolio can be stressful. If, for example, one deﬁ  nes a negative extreme event 
as a slump in the stock market index of more than 3% compared with the previous day,
1 the 
number of such days per annum differs mark-edly over time for the DAX and the Dow Jones. However, both show pronounced spikes in the number of negative extreme events in 1987, 1998 and 2002. These years are associated with stock market crises and protracted phases of greatly increased volatility. The crises were trig-gered by “Black Monday” in October 1987, the Russian crisis and ensuing problems of the LTCM 
hedge fund in 1998 and the accounting scandals 
in 2002 (eg Enron, Worldcom etc.).
Consequently, extreme events often represent 
“exceptional movements” triggered by unique circumstances. Therefore, attention is instead 
generally focussed on volatility in terms of 
average observed ﬂ  uctuations when attempt-
ing to derive expectations regarding future ﬂ uc tuations. Nevertheless, these are inextricably 
linked to extreme events as protracted phases of especially high volatility are often heralded by 
negative extreme events.

65swings across the entire market would be the
natural consequence.
High sensitivity to new information and the
subsequent correction of perceived exagger-ations may lead to further share price swings.In this way volatility sometimes develops aself-reinforcing momentum of its own whichmust be taken into account in the process ofmodelling and when interpreting volatilitypatterns.
The historical volatility of a time series in the
sense of average realised fluctuations (per de-fined time unit)
10is traditionally calculated as
an empirical standard deviation.11A simple
way of forming expectations concerning fu-ture volatility – particularly for a short-termexpectation horizon – would be to form sta-tionary expectations. In this case, at a point intime t-1, one would expect a volatility for twhich corresponds to the historical volatilitymeasured at t-1.
If, for instance, equity market yields are ana-
lysed over a longer period of time, it emergesthat phases of varying fluctuation intensitycan frequently be observed (see chart onpage 63). These phenomena of, first, a non-constant variance, ie one which changes overtime (heteroscedasticity), and second, its pat-tern of clusters (conditional heteroscedasti-city) are relevant for financial market stabilitybecause they mean that sharp share priceswings generally occur in clusters. Hence itcan be seen that an historical standard devi-ation (volatility) of the equity market yield cal-culated with a moving window of a givensample length
12does not remain constant,but varies. If, however, volatility fluctuates
over time, it makes sense to derive expect-ations about future volatility using a dynamicapproach.
The simplest approach is to first extend the
traditional method by applying a weightingscheme which takes greater account of morerecent observations when calculating historic-ally realised volatility. By contrast, a calcula-tion of the simple standard deviation meansthat observations made in the more distantpast are weighted just as strongly as the morerecent observations.
13Alternatively, there-
fore, the exponentially weighted historicalvolatility is often calculated by financial mar-ket practitioners. This is computed as the rootof the average of past fluctuations with expo-nentially declining weights for observationsof the more distant past. By using an updat-
10The calculation of the historical volatility of a time ser-
ies depends on the data frequency and the selected time
unit respectively. Thus one can calculate five-minute,
daily, or monthly volatilities, in which the choice of data
frequency should depend on market liquidity, among
other things. As a rule, although high- frequency data re-
sult in more precise estimates, it is better to select longer
data intervals in the case of less liquid markets. See
S-H Poon and C W J Granger (2005), Practical Issues
in Forecasting Volatility, Financial Analysts Journal ,
Vol 61 (1), pp 45-56.
11For reasons of comparability, volatilities are subse-
quently often annualised. To this end, the standard devi-
ation calculated at a certain observation frequency is
multiplied by the root of the number of possible observa-
tions per year. As an approximation, the annualised his-
torical volatility can be calculated by multiplying the vola-
tility per business day by a factor ofﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
250p
(see also Euro-
pean Central Bank, Monthly Bulletin, May 2000, box 2:
Recent trends in the volatility of stock price indices). The
calculation assumes that there are 250 business days per
year. However, as the individual observations are unlikely
to be independent drawings of identically distributed ran-
dom variables, this annualisation is naturally prone to po-
tential biases.
12See box on pp 66-67.
13When using a moving window this applies as long as
these observations are still within the window. After that,
however, they are factored into the calculation with a
weight of zero.Deriving

In this example, let the DAX yield be defined as
the change in the natural logarithm (log) of theDAX compared with the previous day’s value, ier

At time t-1, let observations (realised values) for

The corresponding “historical volatility” at time
t-1 (the simple standard deviation of the sample)is calculated as the square root of the variance.For a longer time series of past observations, thesample variance may also be calculated at differ-ent points in time using a moving window oflength M, ie using sections of length M of thefull sample. Start and end-dates of the samplesections in this case are correspondingly repos-itioned at each step, ie these dates are eachmoved step-by-step and unit-by-unit to the cur-rent boundary.
As the average yield remains close to zero over
time, the formula for the sample variance can beapproximately calculated as the weighted aver-age of the previous squared yield values

The “expectations” derived under such a simpleapproach display a pattern over time that looksvery similar to the one-step volatility expect-ations obtained from time series models forboth yields and the dynamic development of thevariance of the unsystematic component (theerror process) in the yield equation.

itional formula using a moving window in thiscase stems from the use of a relatively short ob-servation window.

68ing formula, the volatility to be determined at
t can be approximately calculated quite sim-ply by using the value obtained for the previ-ous period (ie for t-1) and the fluctuation real-ised in t (see the box on pages 66-67). Empir-ically optimal weights for the respective ob-servation period can be determined throughestimation; the most widespread applica-tions, however, mostly refrain from such esti-mations in favour of using ad hoc specifiedvalues.
Particular observable volatility patterns must,
however, also be taken into account in esti-mation approaches. In this context, the cat-egory of the ARCH and GARCH (GeneralisedAutoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasti-city) approaches
14is one possibility of model-
ling a dynamic development of both theunderlying time series and the variance of thedisturbance process using past data (see boxon pages 66-67). The process which describesthe GARCH variance can be used to establisha time series for the volatility expected for therespective following period, taking accountof the conditional heteroscedasticity.
15More-
over, by extending the equation for theyield process, the GARCH-M approachmakes it possible, for instance, to take intoaccount a possible systemic feedback effectof the expected volatility – and hence theexpected risk of an investment – on the ex-pected yield.
Further generalisations of the GARCH ap-
proach primarily concern the modelling ofthe conditional variance process.
16The expo-
nential GARCH model (EGARCH) introducedby Nelson, for instance, allows one to takeinto account potential asymmetric effects of
residuals and leverage effects of negativeresiduals on the process of the logarithmicconditional variance.
17
By contrast, the measure of implied volatilityis a concept which stems from the models forpricing options – or conditional claims. For agiven volatility, such a pricing model (for ex-ample, the Black-Scholes models)
18can be
used to derive the fair price of an option onan underlying on the basis of certain assump-tions. By comparison, if the data observableon the market – the option price at time t,the strike price of the option and the price ofthe underlying in t – are taken as the startingpoint, the pricing model can be “inverted”.This gives the volatility at which the realised
14Mentioned at the beginning of this article was the
phenomenon of clustering in the level of volatility, which
has key implications for financial stability. In other words,
volatility changes over time: this is called heteroscedasti-
city. This was first taken into account by Engle (1982) in
the autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic model and
then generalised by T Bollerslev (1986) in the GARCH
model, where the prefix G stands for “Generalised”.
Under the ARCH approach, variance is explained solely
by its past pattern. The GARCH approach adds the esti-
mates of variance made for preceding periods. See

dasticity with Estimates of the Variance of United King-

regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity, in: Journal of
Econometrics, April, Vol 31 number 3, pp. 307-327.
15It can be shown that the calculation of variance using
an exponential weighting can be viewed as a special case
of a simple GARCH model. See J C Hull (2000), Options,

69option price corresponds precisely to its
“fair” model-based value.19This measure is
thus obtained implicitly from the methodused to price options. Moreover, owing to themarket price orientation, this volatility can beseen as the average price dispersion which isexpected by the market.
20Furthermore, it is
customary to derive implied measures of vola-tility also at the aggregated level for broadmarket indices. For a number of years, volatil-ity indices have also been available for select-ed financial market indices which shouldmake it possible to trade volatility directly, forexample via derivatives. These indices includethe VDAX which is calculated on the basis ofoptions, as well as the VIX as a measure ofdispersion of the S&P 500 share price index inthe US market.
21For the above example of
the DAX, there is a clear correspondencebetween developments in the realised volatil-ity of the daily changes of the logarithmicDAX value (ie the DAX yield) and the volatilityindex VDAX. This illustrates again that inthe case of a short expectation horizon,there is generally a relatively high degreeof congruency in the changes of the volatilityexpectations derived from the various ap-proaches.

The chart above shows thedevelopment of this ratio for the DAX andDow Jones (with a reference period of60 trading days) since January 1980. In con-trast to indicators such as the CMAX, (histor-ical) volatility is, technically speaking, a sym-metric measure. However, in its role as astress indicator, it should react in phases offalling asset prices in particular.
Indeed, the phases of exceptionally high vola-

23The leverage hypothesis and the volatility feedback
hypothesis serve as explanations for such a joint occur-
rence of volatility and falling share prices. The leverage
hypothesis states that in the event of a falling stock mar-
ket value, the percentage share of equity capital falls. As
the equity capital bears the entire enterprise risk, the
volatility of the equity capital should consequently in-
crease. By contrast, according to the volatility feedback
hypothesis, volatility shocks lead to share price declines.

71The fact that increased volatility may be a
sign of nervous financial markets is alsounderscored by a comparison of volatilitywith further measures which are widely usedas stress indicators.
For example, an increase in the yield premia
on risky bonds and opposite developmentson the equity and bond markets are seen as apossible expression of shifts in investor port-folios to relatively safe securities. The questfor safety is viewed as a sign of increased pes-simism and a lower willingness to take onrisk.
24
The chart opposite shows a clear corres-pondence between the volatility of assetprice changes on the equity market and dif-ferences between the risk premia of riskierand less risky corporate bonds. Moreover, ris-ing volatility has been frequently associatedwith a growing divergence between the pricemovements of government bonds and shareindices (see chart on page 72). However, thefact that the indicators of the quest for safetyin the financial markets do not exactly matchthose of the stress indicator “volatility” canbe seen, inter alia , in the developments of the
past few months. Thus yield spreads on thebond market started to widen in March ofthis year, although from the second half ofMay they began to narrow again some-what.
25In addition, from the middle of last
year, opposite movements have repeatedlybeen observed between government bondsand equity valuations. The volatility patterns,however, showed no significant upswings upto end-August 2005. Despite a slight in-crease, equity market volatility in the USAStock market volatility and

72and in Germany is still at a very low level by
historical standards. All in all, the stress levelat the moment appears to be relatively low.
However, it should be borne in mind that
spread movements and equity-governmentbond correlations are not only indicators ofthe quest for safety. Portfolio shifts betweengovernment bonds and equities are just asmuch the result of a search for yield as asearch for safety; widening spreads could, for
example, be triggered to a considerable ex-tent by changes in the assessment of defaultrisk in line with the fundamentals.
Hence the various indicators would lead to
slightly differing assessments of the stressperceived on the financial markets during cer-tain phases (albeit not at the current end).When it comes to assessing financial marketstress, therefore, volatility patterns are indica-tors which should be evaluated in the overallcontext, ie together with additional informa-tion and instruments. Undisputedly, however,volatility patterns are of key importance forassessing the situation in financial markets.This stems from their dual nature as a stressfactor and an indicator which is available on atimely basis.
In its Global Financial Stability Report of April
this year, the IMF suggested that the marketsmight be exhibiting an exaggerated level ofconfidence.
26This assessment seems plaus-
ible in the light of the relatively low level ofvolatility seen, for example, on the equitymarkets in the USA and Germany up to theend of August 2005. Moreover, a look at thepast shows that financial market phases oflow volatility may be followed by sharp shareprice movements and that episodes of ex-treme volatility have generally been associ-ated with “stress” in the financial markets.Furthermore, no final judgment can be madeas to the extent to which market dynamics in70

73the past few years have been shaped by spe-
cial factors, such as the excess liquidityobserved in the markets or the growing im-portance of hedge funds. This can impair theindicative quality of conventional stress indi-cators. It is therefore important in the contextof gauging the danger of future financialmarket stress to identify such “special fac-tors” and to take due account of them when
assessing the development of financial mar-ket stress indicators on the one hand and fi-nancial market stability on the other. Ideally,such an analysis should ultimately serve toidentify potential crisis constellations at anearly stage – preferably before they material-ise.

75Potential financial risk
faced by the
International
Monetary FundExceptionally large exposures of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)and their concentration among a veryfew large debtors have led to a consen-sus in the international community toreduce these exposures. However, thiswill be possible only in the medium tolong term as, in the short term, recentrepayment commitments have had tobe revolved once again to avoid impos-ing an excessive balance of paymentsburden on the affected countries.Once country-specific repayment obli-gations have reached a critical massboth for the balance sheet of the Fundas the creditor and for the debtor’s bal-ance of payments, this raises the ques-tion of a potential default risk or of aneed for provisioning. At the sametime, however, the IMF was deliberate-ly designed as a “risk-free” mechanismand hence has no need to price a riskpremium into its lending rates, thusproviding support to the debtor as in-tended. However, large and en-trenched exposures do entail financialrisks of a specific nature to the Fund,where the usual banking (ie statistical-ly empirical) concept of default riskcannot be applied. The avoidance orcontrol of such risks is also an elementof a broadly based strategic review ofIMF policies in international fora.

76High credit concentration at the IMF
The historical development of the Fund’ s credit
portfolio can be described as follows. Duringthe first stage – up until the mid-1970s – theFund’s members were, at different times, bothcreditors and debtors, in a rotation schemeakin to that of a credit union. The largest debt-ors were industrial nations. In a second stage– between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s –the IMF found itself in a more polarised pos-ition, with developing countries and emergingeconomies as its “borrowers” and the indus-trial countries (more precisely, the G10 andSaudi Arabia) as its “depositors”. This madethe Fund more akin to a bank. In the secondhalf of the 1990s, a series of dramatic balanceof payments crises occurred, resulting in un-precedented large IMF exposures to emergingmarket economies that were controversialfrom a systemic standpoint owing to “moralhazard”. In some of the cases, these loans re-mained short-term and were repaid on sched-ule. In other cases, however, the repayment ofthese exceptional loans proved to be difficult.Since then, the Fund’ s loan portfolio has beenmore strongly concentrated on exposures(three in particular) to emerging economieswhich, by any standard, are exceptionally largeand deeply entrenched. This has been giventhe name “credit concentration” in the inter-national discussion. (See the table on page 77.)
In mid-2005 the volume of outstanding IMF
credit (excluding undisbursed commitments)stood at US$78 billion. Of this figure, 64%was accounted for by only three borrowers.Admittedly, this oft-cited percentage is relative-ly meaningless in isolation. After all, the Fund’sjob is not to diversify its loan portfolio but to
deal with actual balance of payments needswithout discriminating against any country. Ifthe number of cases of need remains small,the IMF’s lending is accordingly “concen-trated”; this would appear to be a rather posi-tive sign of a relatively crisis-free global eco-nomic environment. Credit concentrationtherefore cannot be examined in isolation fromthe amount and duration of the exposures.
It is therefore more meaningful to state that,
as at mid-2005, the three largest exposuresaccounted for 28% of the consolidatedquotas of the traditional donor countries(G10 and Saudi Arabia). (In mid-2003 this fig-ure had peaked at an all-time high of41.7%.) Here, too, the decisive factor is notthe arithmetic concentration on the assets ofthe IMF’s balance sheet but instead the per-centage of the revolving IMF financial re-sources which is being tied up by a very smallbut unchanging group of borrowers over arelatively long period of time.
If “large” (by this definition) and entrenched
exposures were to harbour a default risk, thiscould impair the IMF’s capacity to provide newloans to cover other members’ new balanceof payments needs (through, for instance, theneed to accumulate reserves that would haveto be subtracted from the total funds avail-able). In that case, such a “credit concentra-tion” would entail financial risks to the abilityof the IMF to function as a credit union.

77IMF has no nominal default risk
The IMF’s lending terms are pegged to the in-
dustrial countries’ risk-free money marketrates. They are therefore not related to mar-ket rates for the debtor countries. Preciselytherein lies the support for debtor countriesin crisis situations, in which the only other al-ternative would be for those countries to refi-nance themselves at prohibitive market rateson the international capital market (leavingaside in this specific context developing coun-tries without capital market access).
The intentional absence of country risk pre-
mia in the IMF’s lending rates is also designedto safeguard the spirit of solidarity within theFund community. All member countries haveequal access to IMF support (for the samebalance of payments needs and the samecredit facilities). The IMF, in turn, protects it-self against country risk by attaching the ap-propriate conditionality to the adjustmentprogramme, but not through country-specificinterest and maturity terms, such as wouldhave to be applied by commercial lenders.
Since individual country risks are not supposed
to be reflected in the lending terms, the IMF isnot an insurance mechanism in the privatesector sense. Since there is no “minimumcredit standing” that could be invoked todeny a country membership of the Fund, theIMF cannot be defined as a “mutual insuranceIMF: Comparison of credit

78community” either.2The systemic require-
ment of offering uniform lending terms irre-spective of country risk is therefore inconsist-ent with recent proposals to the effect of pro-viding precautionary, yet risk-proportionateIMF credit lines irrespective of an acute need.
Firstly, if the financial terms were to remain
uniformly favourable, all countries would begiven an incentive to take advantage of suchprotection (ie there would be no mechanismto limit demand).
3Secondly, if demand were
to be controlled by risk-adjusted terms, an ap-plication for such risk insurance would causethe market to look at that country more nega-tively than at other countries – with potentiallyunintended, harmful consequences. (For thisreason, the Contingent Credit Line (CCL) wasabandoned owing to a lack of demand.) Third-ly, if the idea is to minimise the effects on thedebtor of a negative market assessment, theeffect would be tantamount to an IMF guar-antee that private creditors would always beable to recover their assets. Private creditors’expectation of being “bailed out” by the IMFin a crisis, initially “only” speculative, wouldthen become a preordained certainty.
From the point of view of the Fund commu-
nity as a whole and the creditor nations inparticular, low risk-free lending rates – neces-sary under the systemic policy goal of acutecrisis containment – are acceptable only if de-fault risk is eliminated accordingly. There aretwo elements to eliminating default risk. First-ly, if a country encounters international finan-cial difficulties and has, for instance, to re-schedule liabilities to commercial foreigncreditors, IMF loans themselves are not affect-ed by such rescheduling. This absolute senior-
ity of IMF exposures is referred to as theFund’s “preferred creditor status”. Secondly,if a country’s liquidity situation makes it diffi-cult for it to repay even highly subsidised IMFloans, the Fund can theoretically revolvethese repayment obligations indefinitely. Un-like commercial lenders, the Fund is notbound by prudential accounting principlesand therefore does not need to form anyadditional provisions. To offset the absence ofaccounting restrictions, this type of revolvingis generally associated with a tightening ofeconomic policy requirements. In this case,too, potential default risk to the Fund is notcovered by imposing risk premia on IMF lend-ing or Fund provisioning; instead, it is sup-posed to be eliminated through the economicprogramme conditionality which the debtorcountry is required to fulfil.
4
2The IMF is less of an insurance scheme and more of a
social pay-as-you-go system, the difference being that
benefit claims cannot be differentiated individually with-
out departing from the principle of uniform contribution
payments and uniformly defined balance of payments
needs. Membership of the Fund as such does provide a
certain type of “insurance protection” in that otherwise
access to supporting loans would not be available in a
case of need.
3According to the proposals, the usual IMF interest rates
would be levied only if an insurance event were to actual-
ly occur. If insurance protection were given, only a “com-
mitment fee”, ie a refundable provision fee, would be
charged (0.25% on amounts up to 100% of the quota
and 0.1 % on amounts beyond that threshold).
4The fact that – to a very limited extent – some countries
are in arrears to the IMF does not contradict the concep-
tual absence of default risk. Such arrears are the result of
a conscious assessment by the IMF , as the creditor, that it
will not be able to come to an agreement with the debtor
on terms for revolving the loan. The costs of such “ar-
rears” are apportioned to the Fund community by adjust-
ing the Fund’s global interest rate margin in order to
avert the accounting effects on the Fund’s capacity to
grant new loans. Moreover, for the extreme event of a
country leaving, or being expelled from, the IMF, as envis-
aged in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, a global reserve
for the permanent loss of redemption payments is main-
tained. See also the box on pages 84 and 85.Lending rates

79Historically, this privileged relief of IMF loans
from default risk was not only accepted butvirtually demanded by commercial lenders,who sometimes have to bear a large defaultrisk themselves. After all, only by being cap-able of being revolved indefinitely irrespectiveof commercial risk assessments can IMF lend-ing improve, in a balance of payments crisis,the liquidity conditions for servicing commer-cial loans that are not revolving in nature. Putdifferently: if IMF loans were not entirely freeof the risk of being subject to a potential re-scheduling themselves, they would not makeany net contribution to increasing the debt-or’s capacity to service other debts (whichwould face rescheduling). Yet this is preciselywhat is at stake in a typical “crisis”. On theFund’s side of this desirable systemic mechan-ism, however, the task of balancing the un-limited revolving nature of IMF loans throughan additionally adapted economic condition-ality (as a non-commercial form of “collat-eral”, as it were) still remains. The aim is al-ways to put a clear time limit on any “revolv-ing” in order to maximise the uncommitted,freely available financial resources for the restof the Fund community as a cooperativeunion.
It therefore follows from the systemic task of
the IMF mechanism that IMF loans have to befree of default risk. In this sense, it is correctto conclude that the IMF has no default riskand that, consequently, no provisions need tobe formed for a non-existent risk. One mightargue that, systemically speaking, the IMF, assuch, is already a “reserve” which offsets in-herent risks of the international financial sys-tem.Credit augmentation risk in place
of default risk
Since, for the reasons mentioned above, the
IMF is not exposed to nominal (statutory) de-fault risk, it also makes little sense to applythe country-specific empirical probabilities ofdefault used by the private banking industryto the IMF’s loan portfolio in order to evaluateits “credit quality”, as has sometimes beensuggested.
However, since potentially endangered IMF
loans tend to be rolled over (generally in com-bination with changes to conditionality), de-fault risk is replaced by permanent rolloverrisk or the risk of credit augmentations. Thesetypes of risk are of the same nature as abudget overrun risk. Consequently, this mayvery well be regarded as a material financialrisk, as unplanned credit augmentations tieup funds (unexpectedly) and thereby reduce –at least temporarily – the remaining availableIMF resources for other countries accordingly.
Admittedly, this applies to all IMF loans, and
these “costs” are the costs of regular Fundoperations. They need to be compared withthe financial gains from adjustment in thedebtor country. This cost-benefit analysisholds equally for “credit augmentations” andfor “initial loans” (see pages 81 and 82 formore on the problem of the long-term natureof Fund exposures). The extent to which IMFlending may be affected overall by the risk ofthe Fund community sustaining a loss ofavailable funds – even without nominal de-fault risk to the Fund – therefore depends onthe size and certainty of these financial ad-

The purpose of this temporary as-sistance is that the economic policy require-ments attached to the loan enhance thedebtor country’s international liquidity per-manently, which means that the IMF loan canbe repaid as quickly as changing financial cir-cumstances permit.
The permanent liquidity gains from economic
adjustment gradually replace the short-termliquidity gain from the original IMF loan. IMFprogramme efficiency can thus be conceptu-alised as a balance between the size of per-manent liquidity gains from adjustment andthe sum of repayments to the IMF (ie the vol-ume of the original IMF loan). If the perman-ent adjustment gains exceed the volume ofthe IMF loan, one could speak of a lasting netgain. A situation in which adjustment gainsare exactly equal to the IMF loan is defined as“minimum efficiency” or the “break-evenpoint”. The Fund community “sustains aloss” if the adjustment gains fail to match theamount of the original loan. The probabilityof such a case constitutes the Fund’s specificrisk of financial loss.
All IMF loans bear such a risk of loss. The IMF
has consciously refrained from applying risk-adjusted interest premia and provisions to
minimise this risk, opting instead to adaptconditionality and to revolve loans. Adjust-ments to conditionality ensure that the occur-rence of a loss (in the budgetary sense of an“unscheduled prolongation of a loan”) is notpermanent – ie not a “sunk cost” but only adelayed repayment.
In this sense, the ever-present programme
risk of IMF loans does not need to be inter-preted as the risk of a “terminal” financialloss to the Fund as long as conditionality – ifnecessary – can always be tightened.
Consequently, the risk of a permanent finan-
cial loss to the Fund community arises only if
– additional adjustments to conditionality
no longer seem realistic, either for eco-nomic reasons or for reasons related todomestic politics in the debtor country;
– lasting gains in international liquidity
achieved to date by the debtor countrythrough economic adjustment have failedto equal the level of outstanding IMFcredit;
– IMF exposure to the debtor country is sig-
nificant from the point of view of the restof the Fund community – more precisely,if the resulting redemption paymentsmake a significant contribution to theFund’s liquidity position.
If the term “adjustment to conditionality” is
replaced by “programme efficiency”, onecould say that the Fund community faces un-

81desired and unforeseen material financial
risks from the exhaustion or terminal loss ofprogramme efficiency, while the debtor coun-try’s international liquidity is still insufficient.
Such a case is usually classified as structural
insolvency (to distinguish it from temporary il-liquidity). If financial bridging and the Fund’seconomic policy conditionality cannot sufficeto restore the debtor’s international liquidity,the only solution left is debt rescheduling, in-cluding the possibility of losses for privatecreditors.
Illiquidity versus insolvency
A conceptually accurate distinction between
illiquidity and insolvency is not always easyfor the Fund – in its role as an “internationalcrisis manager” – to maintain in practice. Ig-noring the outbreak of crises by arguing thatthe solvency risk is too great is not an optionfor the Fund. Where this is the Fund’s object-ive assessment, the best it can do is to worktowards linking short-term financial bridgingto a call for a structural rescheduling.
In addition, the progressive transition in inter-
national capital movements from bank creditsto negotiable market instruments has made itmore difficult to distinguish between illiquid-ity and insolvency in acute crises. An abruptreversal of capital inflows to an emergingmarket economy – a sudden loss of confi-dence or a sudden change in risk assessment –will be reflected in a sharp short-term rise inrisk premia on that country’s internationalinterest payments and probably also in a de-preciation of that country’s currency. Hence
the country would not be able to service itsexisting foreign debt over the medium termand would therefore be insolvent. However,to what extent is it justifiable to extrapolatethe current market data into the medium-term future if they diverge sharply from pastaverages? What medium-term market valu-ation assumptions should the Fund commu-nity make when distinguishing between il-liquidity and insolvency in a manner consist-ent with the Articles of Agreement whenreaching credit decisions?
In today’s international market conditions,
the distinction between illiquidity and insolv-ency is, of necessity, a probabilistic concept or– conversely – a risk measure. Seen this way,one could take the previously defined case ofa permanent loss of IMF programme effi-ciency while the debtor remains insufficientlyliquid internationally and rephrase it as fol-lows: the risk of the Fund community sustain-ing a financial loss arises to the extent thatIMF exposures which were originally intendedas short-term liquidity assistance turn out,over time, to be unintended exposures tostructural insolvency situations.
This risk of financial loss by having to con-
tinue to support an insolvent debtor mani-fests itself for the Fund not in the same man-ner as a nominal default risk but in an “upset-ting” of the balance of interests between thedebtor and the creditors, including the IMF.Put differently, the incentive structure associ-ated with the normal functioning of the IMFreverses itself. The desired elimination of de-fault risk to the Fund (in favour of lending

82rates without default risk premia) then cre-
ates an offsetting, Fund-specific “shadowrisk”. This “shadow risk” is manifested in thefact that the Fund may be compelled to injectadditional financial resources (budget over-runs), thereby diminishing the resources avail-able to all others. It may also be compelled torequest the debtor to make increasingly un-realistic adjustments (budgetary waste). Also,the debtor country itself may find it more ra-tional to impose a unilateral moratorium onthe repayment of outstanding debt to theFund instead of discussing the terms of re-volving the loan with the IMF because theleeway thus gained in terms of internationalliquidity exceeds the potential gains to be ex-pected from an additional adjustment of IMFprogramme conditionality. Finally, privatecreditors may come to believe that the add-itional positive effects of the extension of anIMF programme are so small or uncertain thatthey would be more likely to recoup a largervalue of their loans through the inclusion ofthe IMF’s exposure itself in a rescheduling. Allsuch risk variants (and any attendant costs ofbalance sheet provisions) ultimately reflectthe risk of a loss of additional IMF programmeefficiency.
Potential implications for IMF policy
Exposures which have to be revolved in order
to suppress default risk but which no longerensure additional (“marginal”) programmeefficiency are at odds with the Fund’s finan-cing mechanism itself and therefore also withthe agreed terms of reference between theFund and its creditors. These terms stipulatethat deposits with the Fund are liquid and
risk-free and can therefore continue to beentered as part of the “official foreign re-serves” of the depositor countries. The use ofsuch deposits for what are essentially (aftermultiple revolving) long-term and increasinglyrisky credit exposures is, as a general prin-ciple, not permitted under this financingmechanism. This therefore raises the questionas to how the Fund should deal with expos-ures that have unintentionally turned into“long-term risky exposures”.
The global reserves which the Fund has been
accumulating for payment arrears for sometime now may quickly prove to be insufficientunder unfavourable conditions. (See the boxon pages 84 and 85.)
There are three conceivable strategies for a
fundamental review of the IMF’s risk manage-ment practices: firstly, to reduce risky expos-ures as quickly as possible to ensure con-tinued compliance with the Fund’s financingmechanism; secondly, to adapt the financingmechanism to the requirements imposed byrisky exposures; and thirdly, to remove riskyIMF exposures from the Fund mechanism andtransfer them elsewhere.
Although these three strategies represent a
clear conceptual delineation of the options,the operational decisions faced by the Fundcommunity in day-to-day operations are notalways as clear-cut. When it comes to prac-tical implementation, hybrid solutions andcompromises are essential, either for lack oftime or because different Fund shareholdershave different preferences.

83There are three specific approaches that
could be pursued for managing unintendedfinancial risks in the Fund: firstly, to tightendebt sustainability analysis and increase itsrole both in lending decisions and in assessingprogramme efficiency; secondly, to apply indi-cative absolute upper lending limits not as apercentage of debtors’ IMF quotas but rela-tive to debtor-specific macroeconomic indica-tors (eg exports, foreign currency debt); andthirdly, to create special refinancing mechan-isms for unintended risky exposures.
Debt sustainability analysis
Currently, the IMF staff analysis defines the
objective of a sustainable external debt anduses it to derive a consistent policy target forthe primary government balance (overall bal-ance minus interest expenditure). This meansthat fiscal policy is being used as the key in-strument in controlling the current accountbalance or, more precisely, the external finan-cing need. It is the associated sensitivity an-alysis that lends to the debt sustainability an-alysis its particular importance as a basis for aprobabilistic “risk assessment” for the Fundcommunity as a whole. This is understood asthe quantitative analysis of how quickly, andby how much, a debt sustainability thresholdwould be exceeded in the event of unfore-seen shocks (exchange rates, internationalinterest rates, oil prices etc).
It is still normal Fund procedure to assume in
the analysis that the original fiscal policy tar-get (normally a primary surplus as a percent-age of GDP) will always be reached, in orderto test whether this target will also be suffi-
cient to ensure or restore the sustainability offoreign currency debt even in the event of ashock-related change in foreign currencydebt. What is not analysed, however, is whatadditional fiscal policy measures would be ne-cessary to ensure continued compliance withthe predefined fiscal policy goal even underunfavourable conditions, or how realisticsuch additional measures would be. This ana-lytical gap could be closed by basing the sen-sitivity analysis not on meeting a fiscal bal-ance target which is fixed by assumption buton unchanged public expenditure levels andtax rates (ie on a “no-policy-change” as-sumption), with the balance (primary surplus)varying endogenously depending on theshock involved. This would make risks to debtsustainability, and thus potential financialrisks to the Fund, easier to recognise from theoutset.
Financial risks to the Fund in the event of
doubtful debt sustainability could also becontained more easily if Fund programmesset indicative upper limits for external debtservicing. To avoid conveying the impressionof direct interference in creditor-debtor rela-tionships, such upper limits could be formu-lated in a suitably implicit manner, for in-stance, as a percentage of exports or as an in-terim target for the current account balanceless debt service (interest and redemptionpayments). At all events, it would be desirablefor the Fund to state explicitly the debt sus-tainability assumption that is being used, incompliance with the Articles, to justify itslending.

84Deutsche BundesbankThe IMF’s current approaches to controlling financial risk
For some time, the IMF has been accumulating rela-
tively small precautionary balances in its balancesheet, which are not correlated with credit risk, to off-set possible arrears (which are in violation of the Art-icles). These balances are composed of the General Re-serves and the Special Reserves as well as the SpecialContingent Account (SCA-1).
The difference between the two types of reserves is in
their use: the Special Reserve, established in 1957,safeguards against deficits in the Fund’s operations,whereas the General Reserve, created in 1958, meetscapital losses. Moreover, the General Reserve can berefunded to the member states in proportion to theirquotas by a 70% majority of the voting power in theExecutive Board, whereas no distribution of the Spe-cial Reserve is permitted (as long as the Fund con-tinues to exist). For IMF members, the reserves repre-sent an indirect asset; in the event of the Fund’s li-quidation, reserves would be distributed amongmembers in proportion to their quotas. The reservesare accumulated by retaining income. At the end ofthe financial year, regular net income is transferred tothe Special Reserve. The net income target, which isreset annually, is 5% of the reserves at the beginningof the financial year, unless otherwise decided by theExecutive Board. Other income, especially incomefrom surcharges, is transferred to the General Reserve.This income is more volatile as it is dependent on theuncertain movement of the SDR interest rate and thevolume of outstanding credit.The SCA-1, established in 1987, was designed to pro-
tect against the financial consequences of protractedarrears. It meets potential income losses to the IMF re-sulting from the ultimate default of the borrower.The funds of the SCA-1 are accumulated in the burdensharing mechanism. This mechanism is designed tospread the financing burden evenly among creditorand debtor countries by slightly increasing thecharges paid by debtors on IMF loans and accordinglyreducing the remuneration received by creditor na-tions. Once overdue payment obligations to the IMFhave been met, the financial resources accumulated inthe SCA-1 are refunded to member countries. Theycan also be refunded earlier if so decided by a 70%majority of the voting power in the Executive Board.Funds must be refunded in proportion to each mem-ber’s contribution to the SCA-1.
At the end of April 2005, the IMF’s precautionary bal-
ances reached SDR 7.3 billion, of which SDR 5.7 billionwere reserves and SDR 1.6 billion were SCA-1 funds. Inview of the increased risks to the Fund’s overall bal-ance sheet, in November 2002 the Executive Board de-cided to increase the precautionary balances to SDR10 billion over the medium term, double the stock inNovember 2002. This figure was not derived analytic-ally or risk-appropriately but instead negotiated polit-ically.
In addition to precautionary balances, there are sev-
eral other approaches for internally protectingagainst risks from IMF lending. Prudent lending prac-tices remain the key instrument. Self-imposed access

DEUTSCHE
BUNDESBANK
Monthly Report

85rules restrict a debtor country’s access to IMF resources
to 100% of the quota per year and 300% cumulative-ly. Higher access is permitted only under strictly de-fined exceptional cases. Four criteria need to be metsimultaneously: exceptional acute capital accountpressure, medium-term debt sustainability, the pro-spect of regaining capital market access during theIMF programme, and a strong and politically deliver-able adjustment programme.
Furthermore, the IMF uses a system of surcharges and
special fees to limit access to IMF credit and create in-centives for the early repayment of disbursed funds.There is, however, no risk-adjusted differentiation offees. Instead, a volume-based approach is applied,with outstanding credit in excess of 200% of thequota subject to a 1% surcharge, the figure going upto 2% from 300% of the quota and up. There are alsotime-dependent surcharges on purchases under theSupplemental Reserve Facility (SRF) of between 3%and 5%. Commitment fees are levied for unusedcredit tranches. If applicable, special fees equivalentto the difference between the rate of charge and theSDR interest rate apply to overdue repayment obliga-
tions to the IMF’s General Resources Account that areless than six months outstanding.
The IMF’s burden sharing mechanism not only gener-
ates income for the SCA-1 but also protects the IMFfrom income losses arising from overdue charges bycompensating for the shortfall through temporary in-creases in the rate of charge while lowering the rateof remuneration. This way, the IMF’s debtors and cred-itors alike pay the overdue charges of the defaultingdebtor. Burden sharing capacity is limited, however, asthe remuneration rate cannot be any lower than 80%of the SDR rate. Although the rate of charge is not le-gally subject to an upper limit, a sharp increase is like-ly to encounter insurmountable resistance from debt-or countries – especially if it is not accompanied by asimultaneous reduction of the remuneration rate. Assuch, the procedure provides only limited protectionagainst the non-payment of charges and does notcover overdue repayment obligations.Overview of the IMF’s current approaches to internal risk reduction

86Debt sustainability risks, and hence potential
financial risks to the Fund, could be balancedmore deliberately and systematically withtranche disbursement risk. The (mostly quar-terly) disbursement of credit tranches underagreed lending programmes could be predi-cated more strongly on whether the originaldebt sustainability assumptions are still met.
Credit limits
Unusually turbulent capital account crises in
the past ten years have led the Fund commu-nity to create the option of granting short-term financial support at levels which – underspecific, clearly defined conditions – have nolonger needed to be limited by the applicantcountry’s IMF quota (“exceptional access”).
5
It still makes sense to have such an option inexceptional crisis situations. In the meantime,however, the experience of actual recourse tothis option has shown that such extraordinar-ily large IMF financial packages – even underoptimistic assumptions or where objectives ofeconomic policy adjustment have been suc-cessfully achieved – can overstretch the debt-or’s balance of payments and ability to repaythe loan. The consequence has been a re-peated rollover of exceptionally large IMFloans despite the fact that the statutory con-ditions for exceptional access to Fund re-sources no longer exist.
This experience raises the question as to
whether the – still desirable – quantitative de-tachment of access to loans from the coun-try’s own IMF quota in certain crisis situationsshould not, at the same time, also be bal-anced out by another type of upper limit for
Fund loans, expressed as a percentage ofmacroeconomic indicators for the debtorcountry such as exports, GDP and total for-eign currency debt in order to prevent exces-sive “repayment stress” but also in the inter-est of reducing the risk to the Fund commu-nity. In the past, this question had alreadybeen discussed within the Fund communityand initially been rejected; however, recentexperiences (unplanned revolving, repaymentobligations to the Fund as the principal bal-ance of payments problem) have caused thisquestion to resurface.
It would make sense if the Fund’s indicative
macroeconomic upper lending limits were de-fined not by one single indicator (eg repay-ment obligations to the Fund as a percentageof exports) but instead in terms of the simul-taneous reaching of several indicator levels(see above). In particular, the duration of theovershooting of critical threshold levelsshould play a decisive role. After all, in orderto assess overall financial risks to the Fundcommunity, it is not the short-term, tempor-ary ability of the Fund to react to acute crisesthat is important but the risk of an unexpect-ed entrenchment (and associated “repay-ment uncertainty”) of IMF exposures oncethe crisis has been overcome.
5Four criteria have to be met simultaneously before a
country is eligible for exceptional access to IMF resources.
These criteria are: exceptional acute balance of payments
pressure on the capital account, a debt that is sustainable
over the medium term, the prospect of regaining access
to financial markets in the near future, and a convincing
and politically deliverable adjustment programme. The
objective is to restrict exceptional access to IMF loans to
rare exceptions.

87Under the Fund’s specific stability mandate,
“upper credit limits”, as an additional riskpolicy instrument, could only be an indicative,not a prohibitive instrument. This gives rise tothe question what should be “triggered” byreaching or exceeding non-prohibitive uppercredit limits. For instance, indicative, non-prohibitive upper credit limits could, in bal-ance sheet terms, trigger the formation ofprovisions or reserves, known as “precaution-ary balances” in Fund terminology. A similareffect would be achieved by deducting ex-pected redemption payments from risky Fundexposures from the budgeted “available”Fund resources for new lending (the “forwardcommitment capacity”), ie reducing the avail-able budgetary resources as a precautionarymeasure.
The reaching of indicative upper credit limits
could trigger precautionary premia – notcountry-specific but duration-specific or level-specific – on the interest rates for loans to theaffected debtors. Higher debit interest rateson outstanding exposures once indicativeupper credit limits have been reached or with-in the context of a slide in probabilistic pro-gramme efficiency could be linked to a “non-borrowing” programme with adjusted condi-tionality, but without new financial lendingcommitments and without revolving out-standing loans, ie with no additional financialrisks to the Fund.
Reaching indicative upper credit limits could
also generally trigger a modification of pro-gramme conditionality. For instance, thereaching of indicative upper credit limitscould lead to the complementing of existingprogramme conditionality by means of add-
itional upper debt servicing limits as a per-centage of exports (potentially with an impli-cit rescheduling requirement).
Changes in the IMF’s financing
mechanism and the off-balance-sheettransfer of “problem loans”
It is not “normal” programme risk, but rather
only the ultimate loss of programme effi-ciency, that would burden the assets of theIMF’s balance sheet with a kind of rollover orcredit augmentation risk which would not beconsistent with the liquid, risk-free nature ofthe liabilities of the Fund’s balance sheet.Members’ IMF “deposits” (quotas) couldthen no longer be regarded as liquid, “readilyavailable” official foreign currency reserves.The fact that this risk would tie up fundswould also be detrimental to other potentialFund borrowers.
To resolve such an unintended contradiction,
“problem exposures” – which are no longerassociated with programme efficiency buthave to be revolved to suppress nominal de-fault risk – could be removed from the Fund’sregular balance sheet and transferred eitherto another international institution (for in-stance, a multilateral development bank thatgrants long-term loans) or to a new “specialaccount” at the Fund itself. These exposures– and therefore also the default risk or risk ofperpetual rollover – would be funded out ofthe government budgets of the members ofthe Fund or World Bank. The extent to whichthese countries would then adjust the lending

88terms to a level commensurate with risk or
identify the risks explicitly in their budgetswould then be a conscious and transparentdecision made on development policy andbudget policy grounds.
One potential alternative would be to link the
rate of interest on problem IMF loans not tothe (fixed and risk-free) financing costs of theFund but to the international market ratesapplicable to the debtor. There are a varietyof levels where such a peg could be set. Thepure market solution or full commercialisa-tion of these exposures would be representedby a rate of 1 to 1. However, such a pegcould also be set at a level somewhere below1 to 1, which would mean that IMF interestrates on “problem exposures” would remainsubsidised. The statutory principle of “equaltreatment” and “uniformity of lendingterms” for all IMF borrowers would then nolonger be interpreted as “the same level ofinterest” but as “the same interest subsidycomponent”. Exposures with rates of interestthat are pegged to market-valued risk premiacould admittedly no longer be covered byrisk-free currency reserves. The costs of sub-sidising interest rates in this fashion wouldthen have to be covered by the members’ na-tional budgets. The systemic advantage ofswitching from uniform IMF interest rates touniformly subsidising (variable) market ratesof interest for risky IMF exposures is that thecosts of this risk would be immediately trans-parent.Outlook
In the recent past, a certain systemic policy
conflict has emerged between the IMF’s refi-nancing mechanism (where deposits with theFund are sufficiently liquid and risk-free thatcreditors can continue to report them as for-eign currency reserves in their balance sheets)and the Fund’s actual lending policies. Thisconflict will have to be resolved in the nearfuture – if possible, by a lending policy thattakes a more critical view of risk – in order tomaintain the functional viability of the Fundin its role as a systemically beneficial stabilis-ing mechanism.
Although the discussion has already begun, it
is still in its early stages. In the relevant inter-national fora, it is embedded in a morebroadly based debate on the IMF’s future stra-tegic orientation (referred to as the IMF stra-tegic review), which is also intended to coverthe pure economic policy surveillance func-tion of the Fund without lending, the divisionof responsibilities between the IMF and othermultilateral institutions, and the Fund’s in-ternal governance rules. A first step in stra-tegic reform has already been agreed in theform of the “exceptional access framework”which, in the event of exceptional capital ac-count crises, makes it possible, under certainconditions (especially debt sustainability), togrant loans irrespective of normal, quota-related access limits. Especially in today’sworld of deregulated capital markets, suchan “emergency mechanism” is, and remains,a beneficial feature as long as there is alwaysa clear “definition” of the necessary condi-tions. Looking ahead, and given recent diffi-

89culties encountered by several former crisis
countries in actually repaying their exception-ally large loans from the IMF, it would beequally desirable to agree on certain risk con-trol principles, such as macroeconomic upperlimits for borrowing from the IMF. This would
ensure that the Fund’s credit policy continuesto follow a consistent systemic policy orienta-tion.
