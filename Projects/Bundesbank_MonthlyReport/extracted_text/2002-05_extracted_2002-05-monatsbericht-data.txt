5Seventh Act
amending theBundesbank ActWhen Germany entered into the third
stage of monetary union on 1 January1999, the monetary policy powers ofthe Deutsche Bundesbank were trans-ferred to the Community level. TheBundesbank’s duties and tasks havetherefore changed. The Seventh Actamending the Bundesbank Act of23 March 2002, as published in theFederal Law Gazette (Bundesgesetz-
blatt) on 28 March 2002, takes account
of the changes in the underlying con-ditions by altering the way the Bundes-bank is organised. The Act also pro-vides for some technical adjustmentsto the Bundesbank Act arising fromthe introduction of the euro. This art-icle explains how the Seventh Actamending the Bundesbank Act, whichentered into force on 30 April 2002,came into being and presents its mainprovisions.
The Deutsche Bundesbank as part of the
European System of Central Banks
When the third stage of European monetary
union began on 1 January 1999, the partici-pating member states transferred their mon-etary policy powers to the Community level.Since that date the European System of Cen-tral Banks (ESCB) has borne responsibilityfor the single European monetary policy. TheDeutsche Bundesbank is an integral partof the ESCB. Monetary policy decisions aretaken by the Governing Council of the Euro-pean Central Bank (ECB), the ESCB’s supremedecision-making body. The President of the

6Deutsche Bundesbank is a member of the
Governing Council of the ECB, together withthe governors or presidents of the 11 othernational central banks of the EU memberstates participating in monetary union andthe six members of the Executive Board ofthe ECB.
The transfer of responsibility for monetary
policy to the Community level has trans-formed the Bundesbank’s role; instead of hav-ing sole responsibility for Germany it nowshares responsibility for the euro area. TheBundesbank no longer has any independentmonetary policy decision-making powers.Since 1 January 1999 its mandate in the fieldof monetary policy has been to participate inthe decision-making process and in the tasksof preparing, implementing and communicat-ing the decisions of the Governing Council ofthe ECB.
The need to adjust the governing and
decision-making structures
It was already clear some time ago that the
Bundesbank’s new role would necessitate a re-form of its management and decision-makingstructures. Since the Bundesbank Act enteredinto force in 1957 these structures had consist-ed of a plurality of decision-making bodies:the Central Bank Council, the Directorate andthe Executive Boards at the Land CentralBanks (of which there were most recentlynine). At the centre was the Central BankCouncil of the Deutsche Bundesbank whichpreviously had decision-making powers withregard to monetary policy. The Central BankCouncil comprised the members of the Direct-orate and the Presidents of the Land Central
Banks. The thinking behind the legislature’sdecision to establish this structure was that arange of opinions being represented in thecentral bank’s governing body would make asubstantial contribution to the quality of itsmonetary policy. With the transfer of monet-ary policy powers to the Community level,there was, however, no longer any justificationfor this multiplicity of decision-making bodieswithin the Bundesbank structure.
Views and proposals of the Central Bank
Council regarding the organisationalstructure
The reform debate was launched by the
Deutsche Bundesbank itself. In July 1999 theCentral Bank Council published its views andproposals on the future organisational struc-ture of the Bundesbank (for further details,see Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report,
July 1999, pages 5-16).
The views of the Central Bank Council started
with six key points which included, for ex-ample, combining the Bank’s decision-makingbodies (Central Bank Council, Directorate andExecutive Boards of the Land Central Banks)in a new single governing body, maintainingthe principle of collegiality in the process ofdecision-making as an important means ofensuring independence and appropriate pro-fessional support for the President in carryingout his tasks in the Governing Council of theECB. In the Central Bank Council, however,opinions differed as to how the key pointsshould actually be implemented; consequent-ly, it presented two options which reflected

Deutsche
Bundesbank
Monthly Report

7the differing views and preferences of its
members.
Option 1 provided for the establishment of
an eight-member board of directors domi-ciled in Frankfurt am Main. The President andthe Vice-President and two members of theboard were to be nominated by the FederalGovernment and four other members by theBundesrat. In addition, the intention was thatDeutsche Bundesbank should maintain its re-gional structure by retaining nine regional of-fices. The Executive Boards of the Land Cen-tral Banks were to be replaced by regionalmanagers who would be obliged to act on in-struction from the board of directors andhave no autonomous powers. The suggestionwas that it might be possible to protect re-gional interests by the internal transfer of theresponsibility for certain regional areas to in-dividual members of the single governingbody. The proposal also made provision foroffices to be maintained in the regions andfor these offices then to function as the pointof contact for the political bodies and socialgroups at the level of the federal state (Land) .
Central to Option 2 was the idea of combining
the Central Bank Council, the Directorate andthe Executive Boards of the Land CentralBanks in a single governing body, whichwould continue to be known as the CentralBank Council. In addition to the President andthe Vice-President, it was to comprise no morethan four other members permanently estab-lished in Frankfurt am Main and the Presidentsof the Land Central Banks (which were tonumber seven in future). The right to nomin-ate the President, the Vice-President and theother members of the governing body based
in Frankfurt am Main was to be reserved forthe Federal Government. As in the existingprocedure, the Presidents of the Land CentralBanks, domiciled in the regions, were to benominated through the Bundesrat by the Land
governments concerned. Under this option,the Land Central Banks were to retain statu-tory tasks although the (former) Central BankCouncil, the Directorate and the ExecutiveBoards of the Land Central Banks would ceaseto exist as decision-making bodies.
Central/regional government working
group and key issues raised by theFederal Minister of Finance
After the views of the Central Bank Council
had been published, a number of differentmodels for restructuring the Deutsche Bun-desbank were discussed. In order to advancethe reform plans, in early March 2000 theFederal Minister of Finance and the Ministersof Finance of the federal states agreed to setup a joint working group. This was made upof the Federal Minister of Finance and theMinisters of Finance from Lower Saxony,North Rhine-Westphalia, Saxony and Bavaria.The central/regional government workinggroup appointed an eight-member group ofexperts to draw up proposals for a solution tothe issues relating to the structural reform ofthe Bundesbank on which the Federal Gov-ernment and the Land governments could
not reach an agreement.
In early July 2000 the group of experts, led by
the former Bundesbank President Karl OttoPöhl, presented a report on the structural re-

Deutsche
Bundesbank

8form of the Bundesbank. Most of the experts
were in favour of reducing the number ofLand Central Banks from nine to five and ofmaking them regional offices. Each of thesewas to be headed by a regional president,who would also be one of a ten-memberBundesbank management board. The FederalGovernment was to nominate the President,the Vice-President and three other boardmembers permanently established in Frank-furt am Main. The five regional presidentswere to be nominated by the Bundesrat afterconsulting the Land governments and to be
given regional responsibilities.
At the end of January 2001 the Federal Minis-
ter of Finance presented his views on how theBundesbank should be restructured. Crucialto the plans was the establishment of a six-member board of directors, with the Presi-dent and the Vice-President being nominatedby the Federal Government and the othermembers by the Bundesbank President. TheLand Central Banks were to be replaced bynine regional offices headed by Land CentralBank Presidents. The regional offices were tolose the autonomous powers conferred onthem by law and their presidents were not tobe represented on the Bundesbank’s board ofdirectors.
Seventh Act amending the Bundesbank
Act – from the draft bill prepared byspecialist officials via the governmentdraft to the Act
In mid-April 2001 the Federal Ministry of Fi-
nance published a draft bill prepared by spe-cialist officials ( Referentenentwurf , hereinafterreferred to as the preliminary draft). Only a
matter of weeks later, at the start ofJune 2001, the Federal Government submittedits bill to the Bundesrat for initial comment.The Bundesrat rejected this draft, as it failed toacknowledge the importance of the Land Cen-tral Banks in building confidence in the singleEuropean currency and did not take sufficientaccount of Germany’s federal structure, thedecentralised structure of the German bankingindustry or the fact that the corporate land-scape was dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises. The bill was subsequently de-bated in the Bundestag and its committees. Ata meeting of the Financial Committee of theBundestag at the end of February 2002, anumber of far-reaching amendments to thegovernment draft were given majority approv-al; these received parliamentary approval on1 March 2002. When it met on 22 March 2002,the Bundesrat did not call upon the Concili-ation Committee of the Bundestag and Bun-desrat. The Seventh Act amending the Bun-desbank Act was therefore published in theFederal Law Gazette on 28 March 2002 andentered into force on 30 April 2002.
Whereas the technical adjustments relating
to the introduction of the euro went throughthe legislative process virtually unchanged,substantial amendments were made to thenomination rights regarding the new govern-ing body.
Governing Board in Frankfurt – the sole
governing and decision-making body
The Seventh Act amending the Bundesbank
Act deals first and foremost with the changes

Deutsche
Bundesbank

9to the organisational structure of the Deutsche
Bundesbank. The preliminary draft, the gov-ernment draft and the Act which came intoforce on 30 April 2002 provide for the estab-lishment of a Governing Board as the solegoverning and decision-making body. Pursu-ant to section 7 (1), second sentence, of theBundesbank Act,
1the Governing Board has
the task of governing and managing theBank. The Governing Board thus assumes, inparticular, the tasks of the Directorate and ofthe Executive Boards of the Land CentralBanks as well as the remaining tasks of theCentral Bank Council following the loss of itsmonetary policy powers. From the start of thelegislative process, provision was consistentlymade for the abolition of the ExecutiveBoards of the Land Central Banks and forthe removal of their autonomous decision-making authority as laid down in the formerversion of the Bundesbank Act.
In establishing a Governing Board based at
the Deutsche Bundesbank’s head office inFrankfurt am Main, the legislator’s aim was tobring the Bundesbank’s organisational struc-ture into line with its new mandate and to im-prove its European orientation by strengthen-ing the position of the Central Office. Theclear simple lines of the Deutsche Bundes-bank’s new organisational structures were in-tended to equip it to adjust more quicklyto new developments, thereby helping toreinforce Germany’s position as a financialcentre.Composition and appointment of the
Governing Board
During the legislative process, the number of
board members went up from six, as foreseenin the preliminary draft and the governmentdraft, to eight in the Act which has nowentered into force. This increase should beviewed in the light of the about-turn of theFinancial Committee of the Bundestag withregard to the formulation of the nominationprocedure for members of the GoverningBoard. The preliminary draft and the govern-ment draft still provided for the President andVice-President to be nominated by the Fed-eral Government and for the other fourmembers of the Governing Board to be nom-inated by the President of the Deutsche Bun-desbank in agreement with the Federal Gov-ernment. By contrast, section 7 (3), secondsentence, of the Bundesbank Act providesthat the President, the Vice-President andtwo other members of the Board be nomin-ated by the Federal Government while theother four members are nominated by theBundesrat in agreement with the FederalGovernment. This complete return to a plur-ality of nominating bodies, which is compar-able with the former procedure for nominat-ing the members of the Central Bank Council,has generally been viewed as reinforcing theBundesbank’s independence and thereforewelcomed as a positive move.
1Unless otherwise indicated, sections of the Bundesbank
Act refer to the Bundesbank Act in force since 30 April
2002 as amended by the Seventh Act amending the Bun-
desbank Act.

10By giving various bodies responsibility for
nominating the members of the GoverningBoard, section 7 (3), third sentence, of theBundesbank Act also provides for the Gov-erning Board to be consulted about the nom-inations of the Federal Government and ofthe Bundesrat. This was not included in thepreliminary draft or the government draft butalso reinforces the independence of the cen-tral bank. No amendments have been madeto the previous version of the BundesbankAct with regard to the appointment of themembers of the Deutsche Bundesbank’sdecision-making body: they are appointed bythe Federal President (section 7 (3), first sen-tence, of the Bundesbank Act), they mayhold office for between five and eight years(section 7 (3), fourth sentence, of the Bundes-bank Act), they hold office under public law(section 7 (4) of the Bundesbank Act) andthey must have relevant professional qualifi-cations and experience (section 7 (2), secondsentence, of the Bundesbank Act).
Provisions governing the tasks of the
Governing Board
The provisions of the Seventh Act amending
the Bundesbank Act relating to the tasks ofthe new governing body of the DeutscheBundesbank deal with the allocation of re-sponsibilities, the voting procedures withinthe Governing Board and the chairing ofBoard meetings. With regard to the allocationof responsibilities, section 7 (1), fourth sen-tence, of the Bundesbank Act, enables theGoverning Board to delegate responsibilityfor dealing with specific matters to one of itsmembers. The intention is to provide thelegal basis enabling the Governing Board to
allocate specific areas of responsibility to itsindividual members in order to ensure that itstasks are carried out effectively without im-pinging on the joint responsibility of the Gov-erning Board and its fundamental orientationas a collegial body. Section 7 (1), third sen-tence, of the Bundesbank Act provides forthe issue of an organisational statute whichestablishes the allocation of responsibilitieswithin the Governing Board and specifies thetasks which may be delegated to theRegional Offices.

The provisions relating to the chairing ofmeetings of the Governing Board and to thevoting methods correspond by and large tothe previous provisions applicable to theDirectorate of the Deutsche Bundesbank. Pur-suant to section 7 (5), first to third sentences,of the Bundesbank Act, the Governing Boarddeliberates under the chairmanship of thePresident or Vice-President and takes its deci-sions by a simple majority of the votes cast; inthe event of a tie, the chairman has the cast-ing vote.
Veto rights of the President of the
Deutsche Bundesbank
The preliminary draft and the government
draft gave the President of the Deutsche Bun-desbank extensive veto rights. Decisions re-garding the allocation of responsibilities, theapproval of the annual accounts and the

11standard cost accounting now included in the
new Act cannot be taken by the GoverningBoard without the President’s approval. Giventhe concomitant reduction in the overall re-sponsibility of the Governing Board for theBank as a whole and therefore of the prin-ciple of collegiality, the Financial Committeeof the Bundestag ultimately left the Presi-dent’s veto right in respect of a decision to al-locate tasks as it was in the statute of theDeutsche Bundesbank. However, this is nowto be found in section 7 (5), fourth sentence,of the Bundesbank Act. Since section 34 ofthe former version of the Bundesbank Acthas now been repealed, the Act makes noprovision for a statute. According to the Ex-planatory Memorandum, the legislator deemsa statute such as that which essentially com-prised the regulations governing the mode ofoperation of the three former Bundesbankdecision-making bodies to be redundant.
Members of the Federal Government
are not entitled to participatein meetings of the Governing Board
Members of the Federal Government are no
longer entitled by law to take part in meet-ings of the governing body of the DeutscheBundesbank, as provided for in section 13 (2)of the former version of the Bundesbank Act.Given the transfer of the Bundesbank’s mon-etary powers to the Community level and theresultant remodelling of the governing anddecision-making structures, the legislatornow considers this kind of formalised entitle-ment to be inappropriate. In the ExplanatoryMemorandum, the fact that the Bundesbankstill has an advisory and informational obliga-tion in monetary policy issues of major im-
portance pursuant to section 13 (1) of theBundesbank Act is deemed to make up forthe loss of these participation rights. TheGoverning Board of the Deutsche Bundes-bank is, however, still entitled to invite mem-bers of the Federal Government to its meet-ings.
Regional Offices of the
Deutsche Bundesbank
From the outset, the view of the Federal Gov-
ernment was that the abolition of the Execu-tive Boards of the Land Central Banks andtheir statutory autonomous powers was to bepart and parcel of the structural reform of theBundesbank. Given the return to a plurality ofbodies nominating the members of the Gov-erning Board, the Act as passed by the Bun-destag goes beyond the provisions of the pre-liminary draft and the government draft.These two documents made provision for theBundesrat to nominate the heads of the Re-gional Offices and for them to continue tohold office under public law. Pursuant to sec-tion 8(2) of the Bundesbank Act, each Re-gional Office is now headed by a civil servantwho is obliged to carry out the instructions ofthe Governing Board of the Bundesbank. Hisofficial designation is “President of the Re-gional Office”. The Presidents of the RegionalOffices are not represented on the GoverningBoard. The Regional Offices are no longerdesignated as “Land Central Banks”.
In conjunction with the reorganisation of
management structures at the RegionalOffices, the autonomous decision-making

Bundesbank

12powers of the Executive Boards of the Land
Central Banks as enshrined in section 8 (2) ofthe former version of the Bundesbank Acthave also been abolished. The legislator’sview was that duplication of work at theRegional Offices and the former process ofcoordination through the Central Bank Coun-cil would thus be avoided. This is intended tolead to a streamlining of and greater effi-ciency in the Bundesbank’s organisationalprocedures.
Transitional provision for the members of
the Bundesbank’s governing bodies
Pursuant to the preliminary draft and the gov-
ernment draft, the members of the Director-ate were to become members of the newGoverning Board and the Presidents of theLand Central Banks were to head the Region-al Offices. The Vice-Presidents and othermembers of the Executive Boards of the LandCentral Banks, however, were to be removedfrom office upon the entry into force of theSeventh Act amending the Bundesbank Act.As the legislator eventually decided that nom-ination rights in respect of the members ofthe Governing Board should be split betweenthe Federal Government and the Bundesrat,this transitional provision could not remain asit was. It was amended so that all membersof the Directorate – with the exception of thePresident – as well as some of the Vice-Presi-dents and other members of the ExecutiveBoards of the Land Central Banks were toleave office when the Seventh Act amendingthe Bundesbank Act came into force. The re-maining Presidents of the Land Central Bankshave become the Presidents of the RegionalOffices for the remainder of the term of office
stipulated in their contracts.
Advisory Boards at the Regional OfficesThe Seventh Act amending the Bundesbank
Act retains provisions relating to the con-tinued existence of the Advisory Boards at theRegional Offices. As far as advisory issues atmeetings of the Advisory Board are con-cerned, section 9 (1) of the Bundesbank Actprovides for an alignment with the newunderlying conditions. Previously, the Advis-ory Board was to confer with the President ofthe Land Central Bank on questions of mon-etary policy and with the Executive Board ofthe Land Central Bank on the performance ofthe Advisory Committee’s duties in its area.Now the Advisory Board confers with thePresident of the Regional Office solely on theexecution of the tasks falling to that area.Section 9 of the Bundesbank Act no longerprovides for participation of the Land Minister
of Economics and the Land Minister of Fi-
nance as provided for in section 9 (4) of theformer version of the Bundesbank Act.
The Deutsche Bundesbank’s one-tier
branch network
The new provisions of section 10 of the Bun-
desbank Act should also be viewed in thelight of the structural reform of the Bundes-bank. No distinction is now made betweenbranches (Hauptstellen) and sub-branches
(Zweigstellen). In future the Deutsche Bun-
desbank will maintain branches (Filialen),
which are subject to the authority of the rele-vant Regional Office. According to the Ex-

Deutsche
Bundesbank
Monthly Report
May 2002
13planatory Memorandum, this change will
lead to the internal organisation of the Bankbeing more streamlined and more efficientbut also allow scope for flexibility. Due ac-count is thus taken of the fact that the Bun-desbank is, as a matter of policy, to be repre-sented throughout Germany. However, theBundesbank does need to make allowancefor changes in the banking environment. Asin the past, it will continue for reasons of costto adapt the service it provides throughoutthe country to the demand from the credit in-stitutions, with supply and demand still, ofcourse, being interrelated in terms of thequantity and quality of the services provided.
New provisions relating to cost
management
The preliminary draft provided for amend-
ments to section 26 of the Bundesbank Act,some of which were modified and otherscompletely rejected in the course of the legis-lative procedure. The debate centred on therights to be given to the Bundestag to absolvethe Governing Board, at the end of each fi-nancial year, of its responsibilities and tomake recommendations in respect of theBundesbank’s expenditure. Given that the in-dependence of the national central banks inthe ESCB is enshrined in Community law, theconcerns about these provisions expressedafter the publication of the preliminary draftled to the provisions relating to absolving theGoverning Board of its responsibilities beingdropped from the government draft. Further-more, the “recommendations of the Bundes-tag concerning the expenditure of theDeutsche Bundesbank” became “recommen-dations concerning improvements in its effi-
ciency”. However, even the ensuing provisionmet with strong reservations. As part of theconsultation procedure pursuant to Article105 (4) of the Treaty establishing the Euro-pean Community (EC Treaty), the EuropeanCentral Bank expressed its concern that par-liamentary rights of this nature would under-mine the independence of the Deutsche Bun-desbank. It also considered the absolving ofthe Governing Board of its responsibilitiesand any recommendations by the Bundestagoriginally provided for in the draft bill as in-compatible with Community law. Althoughparliamentary opinions of this kind are notformally binding, external political pressurecould be brought to bear which would com-promise the position of the President of theBundesbank as a member of the GoverningCouncil of the ECB and thus the independ-ence of one of the ESCB’s decision-makingbodies. Apart from the fact that, contrary tothe Explanatory Memorandum to the draftbill, this procedure was unparalleled in Com-munity law, provisions of this kind wouldsend the wrong signals and undermine boththe spirit and the letter of Article 108 of theEC Treaty. The financial markets and the gen-eral public might interpret this as the FederalRepublic of Germany changing tack in termsof its anti-inflationary stance, particularly asGermany had been a strong advocate of thecentral banks having extensive independence– during the preparations leading to theMaastricht Treaty, for example. In the end,the legislator also decided against introducinga parliamentary entitlement to make recom-mendations concerning improvements to theefficiency of the Deutsche Bundesbank.

14The ensuing new provision in section 26 (4) of
the Bundesbank Act relating to cost account-ing means that a previous recommendation ofthe Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrech-
nungshof) is established in law, although, as
far as its organisational structure permitted,the Bundesbank had already put this into prac-tice. The additional requirements relating tothe forwarding of documentation on the costaccount to the Federal Ministry of Finances,the Federal Court of Auditors and the Bundes-tag, as established in section 26 (5) of theBundesbank Act, is intended to contribute toenhancing cost transparency.
Technical adjustments of the
Bundesbank Act
With regard to the amendments of a tech-
nical nature in the Seventh Act amending theBundesbank Act, a distinction needs to bemade between provisions arising from thechangeover of the German legal system tothe euro and provisions clarifying the tasks in-cumbent on the Deutsche Bundesbank pursu-ant to the EC Treaty and the Statute of theESCB.
Converting capital and reserves to euroOwing to the need to convert the legal acts
to euro, in section 2 of the Bundesbank Act,the Bundesbank’s capital of five billionDeutsche Mark has been converted to euroand rounded to 32.5 billion. A similar amend-
ment is made to the provisions of section 27of the Bundesbank Act, which stipulates howprofits are to be distributed. Therefore, theamount of the statutory reserves quoted insection 27, number 1, of the Bundesbank Act
has been changed from 5 billion DeutscheMark to 32.5 billion and that part of the net
profit up to the maximum amount of 500 mil-lion Deutsche Mark which may be transferredto the statutory reserves has been convertedto euro and rounded to 3250 million.
The rounding of the Bank’s capital and the re-
serves means that the Bank’s own funds havebeen reduced by just under 3113 million. Pur-
suant to the transitional provision of sec-tion 45 (3), third sentence, if the first annualaccounts following the entry into force of thenew Act show that the full amount whichmay legally be held as reserves has beenreached, the Bank’s net profit will be in-creased by this amount.
In section 35 of the Bundesbank Act, which
deals with the unauthorised utterance anduse of monetary tokens, the words“Deutsche Mark” are replaced by the word“euro”. With regard to the issue of liquiditypaper established in section 42 of the Bun-desbank Act, the amount of 50 billionDeutsche Mark is converted to euro androunded to 325 billion.
Managing the official foreign reserves
and contributing to the stability of thepayment and clearing systems
By virtue of the Seventh Act amending the
Bundesbank Act, section 3 of the Bundes-bank Act provides for the holding and man-aging of the official foreign reserves of theFederal Republic of Germany, in particulargold and foreign currency, to be included in

Deutsche

15the tasks of the Deutsche Bundesbank. This
central bank activity, which was not previous-ly referred to explicitly in the BundesbankAct, is one of the basic tasks of the ESCB pur-suant to Article 105 (2), third indent, of theEC Treaty and Article 3.1, third indent, of theStatute of the ESCB. In addition, section 3 ofthe Bundesbank Act now clarifies the duty ofthe Deutsche Bundesbank to contribute tothe stability of the payment and clearing sys-tems. The Act thus takes account of the pro-vision in Article 105 (2), fourth indent, of theEC Treaty and Article 3.1, fourth indent, ofthe Statute of the ESCB, under which one ofthe basic tasks of the ESCB is to promote thesmooth operation of payment systems.
The Deutsche Bundesbank’s transactions
with credit institutions and other marketplayers
Section 19 of the Bundesbank Act contains a
completely reworked description of the Bank’sarea of business, taking account of the monet-ary policy provisions of the Statute of theESCB and of the relevant requirements of theGoverning Council of the ECB. Accordingly,the previous restriction of the Deutsche Bun-desbank’s business activities to credit institu-tions in the area in which the Bundesbank Actis law has been deleted and the possible busi-ness partners extended beyond “credit institu-tions” to cover “other market participants”.
In addition, in accordance with Article 18.1 of
the Statute of the ESCB, the transactionswhich the Deutsche Bundesbank is entitled to
conduct with its business partners are listedin section 19 of the Bundesbank Act. Theseinclude the granting of loans backed by col-lateral and the buying and selling of claims,marketable securities and precious metals onthe open market either under repurchaseagreements or outright (spot or forward). Ac-cordingly, it has been possible to delete sec-tion 21 of the previous version of the Bundes-bank Act, which dealt with open market op-erations separately.
The previous provision listed eligible collateral
in detail; this is no longer the case. In add-ition, the collateral may be sold in future assoon as the maturity is reached rather thanonly when the debtor defaults. The ways inwhich this collateral may by realised now in-clude appropriation and the Bundesbank isentitled to use these assets not only in theevent of insolvency proceedings being insti-gated against the debtor, but also in theevent of a previous security measure taken inrespect of the debtor (in particular, section46a of the Banking Act). Given the cross-border use of eligible assets in the “corres-pondent central banking model”, it is madeclear that the selling options are also to applyif the Deutsche Bundesbank sells on behalf ofanother member of the ESCB. Given theESCB’s monetary policy instruments, whichprovide for a deposit facility and fixed-termdeposits, the option of accepting depositsother than giro account deposits has beenadded.

20The international
and EuropeansettingDevelopments in the world economy
The world economy probably bottomed out
in the winter months. The economic improve-ment was led by the US economy. Now signsof economic recovery are beginning to mountin the euro area as well. The world economyreceived a healthy dose of support from eco-nomic policy. Central banks in the UnitedStates and western Europe, in particular, cuttheir key interest rates sharply during 2001.In addition, the US government shifted to anextremely expansionary fiscal-policy path. Theeuro-area economy was supported by allow-ing automatic stabilisers to work.
The cyclical upward tendency in most indus-
trial countries and emerging economies is un-likely to result in appreciably higher annualaverage growth rates for 2002, though. Ac-cording to the latest forecast by the Inter-national Monetary Fund (IMF), however, theUnited States and Canada, with growth ratesof 2.3% and 2.5%, respectively, will be theonly two major industrial countries to im-prove substantially on their previous year’s re-sults (1.2% and 1.5%, respectively). The euroarea and the United Kingdom, at 1.4% and2.0%, respectively, will probably have resultsroughly similar to those in 2001 when theiroutput growth rates went up to 1.5% and2.2%, respectively. According to the IMF, an-nual growth rates in the euro area and UKwill not be considerably higher until 2003,when each area will achieve just under 3%growth. However, Japan’s real gross domesticproduct (GDP) is expected to continue to godown slightly in 2002.Global

21According to IMF calculations global GDP
rose 2.5% in 2001. This meant that a world-wide recession, which is defined by IMF staffas growth below 2.5%, and which had beenpredicted as late as December, was only justaverted. Even so, it was still the worst resultsince 1993, when growth was 2.2%. Thisyear, global production, according to theApril 2002 issue of the World Economic Out-look, will rise by 2.8%, followed by 4.0% in2003. Real world trade declined slightly in2001 for the first time since the beginning ofthis time series after growing by 12
12%i n
2000. In the wake of the general economicrecovery, cross-border trade in goods andservices will probably also pick up. For 2002IMF staff predict a rise of 2
12% followed by a
612% increase in 2003.
The large US current account deficit, which
recently grew perceptibly once again, poses aconsiderable risk to the global economic up-swing. This is the background behind the in-creasing trend towards protectionism in theUnited States, which, if its trading partnerstake countermeasures, may well present aconsiderable disruption to global recovery.The worsening Middle East crisis is likewise adanger to the world economy. Beginningwith their last low in mid-January 2002, inter-national crude oil prices increased by around40% up to the beginning of April. Sincethen, they have occasionally eased slightly,but a renewed setback cannot be ruled outas long as the political turmoil in that regionpersists.
Buoyed notably by special factors, the US
economy was growing surprisingly strongly inseasonally adjusted terms as early as the
fourth quarter of 2001, enabling it to make aconsiderable improvement in its starting pos-ition for 2002. In the first quarter of this yearthe pace of growth actually picked up per-ceptibly. According to preliminary estimates,total production rose by 1
12%, after adjust-
ment for seasonal and working-day vari-ations, compared with both the previousperiod and the same period a year before. Animportant factor was that the destocking ofinventories was not as pronounced as in au-tumn 2001.
By contrast, the seasonally adjusted rise of
just over
12% in private final demand was
weaker than in the last quarter of 2001,when the extremely attractive financing ratesoffered by car manufacturers drove up pur-IMF forecast for 2002 and 2003*

22chases of durable goods. Such purchases sub-
sequently went down by 2%. All in all,though, private consumption rose by 1%thanks to the brisk demand for non-durableconsumer goods, putting it at just under3
12% higher than its previous year’s level. At
the same time, the seasonally adjustedhousehold saving ratio – beginning at a verylow level in the last quarter of 2001 – wentup by well over 1
12percentage points to
2.1%. The key factor was the seasonally ad-justed rise in disposable income by just over2
12% from the previous period owing, above
all, to the tax cut which formed part of thetax-reform package passed in mid-2001 andwhich took effect on 1 January 2002.
Investment in housing construction surpassed
the depressed level of the previous quarter bya seasonally adjusted 4%. That was associ-ated not only with the favourable financingrates but also with the unusually mild wea-ther in many parts of the country followingthe turn of 2001-2002. By contrast, thedownward trend in commercial investmentwhich had begun in the spring of 2001 con-tinued, with such investment declining by1
12% from the previous period and 1012%
on the year. Seasonally adjusted real exportswent up for the first time since summer2000, by just over 1
12%. Imports grew much
more strongly, by just over 312%. The deficit
in the real foreign balance therefore reacheda new record low.
The strong US growth in the first quarter
must not divert attention from the weak linksin the US economy which continue to exist.As the year progresses, they could become in-creasingly apparent once the influence of the
strong stimuli to the inventory cycle begins torecede, as is likely to be the case. (Accordingto information available so far GDP growth islikely to decrease appreciably as early as inthe second quarter.) The primary factor de-serving of mention here is commercial invest-ment activity, in which no broad improve-ment is visible just yet. The extreme underutil-isation of production capacity in industry,which – despite the fact that the degree ofutilisation has been on the rise again sinceearly 2002 – at last report was as low asSeptember 2001 (and June 1983 beforethat), is probably the main cause. In somesectors of the economy there still seems to beovercapacity which must be reduced since itcan no longer be put to economic use. Inaddition, the massive corporate debt couldrestrain investment growth.
The force exerted by private consumption
must not be overestimated, either. In 2001consumption weakened relatively little, whichmeans that, in the short run, it can only pro-vide little additional stimuli to the economy,as no major pent-up demand can be expect-ed to exist. In the financial markets, too, re-cent assessments of further developments inthe US economy have been somewhat moremuted. This has been reflected in a trend to-wards falling share prices and a weakening ofthe dollar against the currencies of importanttrading partners.
The revival of total output in winter 2001-
2002 has not made a dent in the labour mar-ket just yet. In the first four months the num-ber of employed persons was 0.3% lower,

23seasonally adjusted, than in the fourth quar-
ter of 2001, during which it had fallen by0.4%. The unemployment rate did fall notice-ably in January and February, yet shot backup to 6.0% in April, reaching its highest levelsince August 1994 – most notably owing tothe statutory enlargement of the group ofpeople eligible to receive unemployment as-sistance. Despite the sharp rise in energyprices in March and April, the price climateremained calm throughout. On average overthe first four months of 2002 consumerprices were only 1.3% higher than a yearearlier; however, core inflation, ie excludingfood and energy prices, was 2.5%.
Because of their close relations with the US in
their function as suppliers, the East Asianemerging economies have now overcome thepronounced economic slump into which theyhad lurched in 2001. The more buoyantdemand for IT products played a major role.The Mexican economy, around nine-tenths ofwhose exports are sent to the United States,has been receiving considerable expansionarystimuli from its northern neighbour. In therest of Latin America, the cyclical recovery hasbeen making visibly slower progress. This isprobably because, on the heels of the eco-nomic and financial crisis in Argentina andthe political turmoil in other countries, invest-ors have assessed the risks for the region tobe greater than had previously been the case.In Argentina, whose economy is clearly in theprocess of contracting at present, no turn forthe better can be expected in the short term.In the central and east European reformcountries the economy cooled off only rela-tively little in the past year. The growth ratecan be expected to pick up noticeably this
year, with the probable rise in demand fromwestern Europe also playing a role.
In the past few months Japanese enterprises
once again recorded increases in foreignorders. In addition, the adjustment of inven-tories slowed down. The contracting trendgripping the economy as a whole thereforeseems to be gradually receding. In the firstquarter of 2002, however, domestic final de-mand remained weak. Private consumptionwas adversely affected mainly by the worsen-ing of the labour market and income situ-ation. Commercial investment is still on adownward trend because high overcapacity,plummeting profits and sluggish lending bybanks have dampened propensity to investand curtailed scope for borrowing. Publicinvestment likewise continued its decline.Thanks to increased exports, however, indus-trial production rose for the first time in along time (+
34%), reducing its year-on-year
deficit to -11%. The seasonally adjusted de-cline in the price level continued in April, fol-lowing a short interruption in March causedby higher prices for energy. Recently con-sumer prices were 1.2% lower on the year.The deflationary trend is thus continuing.
The UK economy hardly grew any further
during the 2001-2002 winter. According toinitial estimates, the stagnation of real GDPwhich occurred in autumn 2001 continued inthe winter months of 2002. However, thefirst quarter of 2002 still saw year-on-yeargrowth of 1%. Seasonally adjusted industrialproduction continued its slide while valueadded in the services sector grew by

24The UK economy was supported anew by pri-
vate consumer demand, which – in terms ofretail turnover – was a seasonally adjusted1% higher in the first quarter than in the pre-ceding three-month period and 5
12%u po n
the same period in the previous year. Govern-ment expenditure is likely to have risen rathersharply as well. The government budgetedconsiderably more funds towards improvingthe public infrastructure. Consumer price in-flation picked up in March owing to the high-er prices for energy and services. Excludingmortgage interest payments, year-on-year in-flation was 2.3% following 2.2% in February.
Macroeconomic trends in the euro area
In the fourth quarter of 2001, real euro-area
GDP , after seasonal adjustment, was downfrom the preceding period for the first timesince early 1993, by
14%. It was up only12%
from the previous year’s result. In the last fewwinter months, for which no national ac-counts data are available thus far, the con-traction of total production does not seem tohave lasted, though. First-quarter industrialproduction was
12% higher than in the last
quarter of 2001, with the year-on-year de-cline shrinking to 3%. Capacity utilisation inthe euro area continued to fall following theturn of 2001-2002.
The rather strong improvement in industry
confidence that took place betweenDecember 2001 and March 2002 did notcarry over into April. A look at the individualcomponents of this indicator shows thatmore favourable production expectations andprogress in the adjustment of inventories
were recently offset by a more negative as-sessment of the situation regarding neworders. Consumer confidence even cloudedover slightly in April. Households assessedboth their financial situation over the next12 months and the economic trend lessfavourably on the whole than in March.
Owing to the weak starting position at the
beginning of this year, annual averagegrowth in the euro area, according to the IMFforecast cited above, will, at 1.4%, be some-what lower than in 2001. The euro area willtherefore probably surrender the growth ad-vantage over the United States which it hadgained last year. Throughout the 1996-2001period US GDP growth averaged 3
12% com-
pared with 212% in the euro area. As regards
prosperity, however, it seems advisable to fac-tor the depreciation of the capital stock outof GDP and to incorporate differences inpopulation growth into such a country-by-country comparison. The resultant real per-capita net domestic product, which mayserve as a crude measure of income, went upin the United States by an average of 2
14%
per year between 1996 and 2001 and thus“only” a little over
14percentage point more
than in the euro-area countries (for more seethe appendix starting on page 34f).
The situation on the euro-area countries’ la-
bour markets grew gloomier at the beginningof 2002. Although total employment hasprobably gone up slightly until the present,this increase is not as large as it was in thesame period last year. In the fourth quarter,the latest period for which statistics are avail-GDP down

25able, the annual growth rate was less than
1% for the first time in just over four years.The main reason was that industry and con-struction already visibly failed to achieve theprevious year’s employment levels. The shed-ding of labour in those two sectors is likelyto have continued in the first few months ofthis year as well. The number of unemployedpersons has tended to point slightly upwardssince April 2001. In March 2002 around11.5 million persons were unemployedthroughout the euro area, or 1
14% more
than during the last low reached 11 monthsbeforehand. Since October 2001 seasonallyadjusted unemployment has remained un-changed at 8.4%.
Euro-area inflation has recently slowed down.
As measured by the Harmonised Index ofConsumer Prices (HICP), year-on-year infla-tion went down to 2.4% in April as against2.7% in January. At the beginning of the yearthe harsh winter weather which struck Eur-ope, including the Mediterranean countries,caused food prices to skyrocket. Prices havesince then returned to normal. The relief wasall the more noticeable in the year-on-yearrate because in the spring of 2001 animal dis-eases and a spate of bad weather had like-wise driven food prices upwards. In the areaof energy prices a favourable base effecthelped to limit the inflationary effect of thelatest increases in heating oil and petrol pricescaused in particular by the rise in world mar-ket prices for crude oil. Spring 2001 also sawconsiderable increases in energy prices. Therewere rising inflationary tendencies in the areaof industrial goods and services.

261.8% more for industrial goods than twelve
months previously, and for services the priceincrease amounted to 3.1%.
The regional disparities in inflation rates re-
mained high in the first few months of 2002as well. Inflation remained well above theeuro-area average in Ireland, Greece and theNetherlands. Germany, France, Austria andLuxembourg once again recorded relativelylow rates of price increase.
Current account and exchange rates
At the beginning of this year, too, euro-area
foreign trade was still under the spell of thesluggish world economy which shaped devel-opments up to the end of last year. In the firsttwo months of 2002 the euro area’s exportsto non-euro-area countries (after seasonal ad-justment) just barely reached their previousyear’s levels. Imports of goods, in fact, werejust over 1% lower than in the last twomonths of the preceding year. On balance,this made the euro area’s trade surplus forJanuary and February 2002, at 321
12billion
(seasonally adjusted), 3112billion higher than
in the two preceding months. At the sametime, though, the deficit in invisible currentaccount transactions rose by roughly thesame amount, which caused the overall cur-rent account to close in January and Februaryat a surplus of 38 billion, unchanged from the
preceding period.
In the first few months of this year the euro’s
exchange rate was marked by repeatedmood swings in the foreign-exchange mar-kets. However, they did not lead to major
shifts in the exchange-rate structure. Theeuro, having strengthened noticeably follow-ing the smooth introduction of euro cash atthe beginning of the year, came under re-newed pressure soon thereafter. It was forcedto surrender much of the ground it hadgained previously against the US dollar,whereas it was able to hold its own againstthe other currencies. Since mid-April, how-ever, the euro has also made visible gainsagainst the US dollar.
The euro began the year at just over US$0.90
and then slid to around US$0.86 by the endof January. Other important currencies lost alot of ground against the US dollar, too.At that time information got out that theUS economy was able to return to positivegrowth figures in the fourth quarter of lastyear. However, against the background ofconflicting signals being issued by individualearly-warning indicators and frequently chan-ging assessments of the outlook for theUS economy, developments on the foreign-exchange markets changed directions repeat-edly in the period thereafter. In the first halfof March the US dollar came under pressurefollowing a warning by the Federal Reserveconcerning the stubbornly high US current-account deficit. In the second half of March,however, sentiment shifted back in favour ofthe US dollar following reports that US GDPgrowth in the fourth quarter of 2001 hadbeen revised upwards and that new statisticson consumer confidence made the US eco-nomic situation look unexpectedly bright. Itwas only in mid-April that the euro-US dollarrate underwent a more sustained correction

27once the markets came to believe that
US economic recovery would be slower thanexpected, whereas forecasts for the euro areacontinued to assume that economic growthwould recover vigorously during the furthercourse of the year. As of late the euro wasquoted at around US$0.91, already some-what higher than at the beginning of theyear.
During the period under review the euro oc-
casionally lost ground against the Japaneseyen, too, though it has recently regainedsome of that ground. The appreciation of theyen (against the US dollar, too), however,stood in contrast to the continued precariousstate of Japan’s economy. The repatriation ofa large volume of funds from abroad by Jap-anese financial institutions shortly before theend of the Japanese fiscal year is likely tohave played a decisive role. However, in thepast few weeks the picture shifted back inthe euro’s favour following reports that Jap-anese fourth-quarter economic growth waslower than expected. As of late the euro, atjust over ¥116, was still just under 3% lowerthan its rate at the beginning of the year.
Against the pound sterling, however, the
euro remained within a rather tight band ofbetween just under £0.63 and around £0.61during the entire period under review. Largelyin parallel with the development of the euro-US dollar exchange rate, the pound sterlingweakened noticeably against the US dollar inJanuary yet was able to recoup its losses inthe subsequent period. As this Report went
to press the euro was quoted at just under£0.63.As a weighted average against the currencies
of the euro area’s 12 most important tradingpartners, the euro’s exchange rate haschanged very little since early this year. Giventhat inflation rates in the industrial countriesare quite similar, the exchange rate thereforecontinues to support the euro-area countries’international competitiveness. However, theadvantages to the euro-area economy result-ing from this support cannot be expected toDaily data

Monetary policy and financial markets
in the euro area
In the spring months the Governing Council
of the ECB continued its “steady-as-she-goes”interest-rate policy, leaving the Eurosystem’skey interest rates unchanged. The main refi-nancing operations have all been conductedas variable-rate tenders with a minimum bidrate of 3.25%. The interest rates for the mar-ginal refinancing facility and the deposit facil-ity have remained unchanged at 4.25% and2.25%, respectively. The monetary andmacroeconomic situation both indicated thatinterest rates did not need to be changed.The relatively strong monetary growth sloweddown since the turn of the year and theweakening of credit growth continued, withthe result that monetary developments didnot point to any risks to price stability. Al-though temporary influences caused the de-cline in the current rate of inflation to belower than expected, inflationary pressureshave been limited even in the context of thesecond pillar of the ECB’s strategy, despite theforthcoming economic recovery. However, fu-ture risks still exist with regard to wages andoil prices.

rates have, on balance, risen distinctly despitea temporary decline in April. In mid-May theywere 30 to 40 basis points higher than inmid-February. Thus the yield curve on themoney market has become even steeper.That means that market participants expectthe Eurosystem to raise key interest rates overthe course of the year.
During the period under review ongoing
management of the money market was con-ducted exclusively through the use of maintenders. January’s extremely disparate maintender volumes have since realigned them-selves. When gauging these volumes, theEurosystem particularly had to make sure thatthe liquidity effects resulting from the sharpfluctuations in general government depositswith the Eurosystem – particularly at the endof February, the beginning of April and thesubsequent turn of the month – were offsetas soon as possible. It was also necessary toneutralise the inflow of funds caused by thedistribution to the Federal Government on11 April of its share of the Bundesbank’s2001 profit, which amounted to 311.2 bil-
lion. Banknotes in circulation, the liquidity ef-fects of which were difficult to forecast in thefirst few weeks following the introduction ofeuro cash, no longer presented a major chal-lenge to liquidity management during theperiod under review. Only at the end of thereserve management periods and, as usual,at the end of each month and quarter didEonia deviate relatively sharply from the maintender rate.

30temporarily took major recourse to the mar-
ginal lending facility as part of their end-of-period reserve management operations.
Between February and April, the autonomous
factors determining bank liquidity generated,on balance, 313.3 billion of inflows to credit
institutions (see adjacent table). This mainlyreflected the continuing return flows of bank-notes denominated in legacy currencies andthe distribution of the Bundesbank’s profit.The decline in the minimum reserve require-ment by 31.2 billion also had an expansionary
effect. The Eurosystem accordingly reducedthe volume of its main refinancing operationsduring the period under review by 314.6 bil-
lion to an average of 3112.7 billion. On the
whole, recourse to the standing facilitiesremained low.Last year’s very strong monetary growth
weakened visibly in the first few months ofthis year. In the first quarter of 2002 thebroadly defined M3 monetary aggregategrew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate ofonly just over 2
12%, compared with just
under 912% in the second half of 2001. The
growth of the German contribution to M3was just as muted as that of euro-area M3.Despite the distinct slowdown in growth, M3,at the end of March, was still up 7.3% on theyear. The reduction of liquidity holdings in theeconomy, which had been expanded stronglyin connection with the major uncertaintygripping the financial markets in the previousyear, is therefore only making slow progress.It is true that this “surplus liquidity” remainsunlikely to pose the threat of inflation. How-ever, if it continues to exist even in the face ofprogressing economic recovery and a deteri-orating price outlook in the euro area, this as-sessment will have to be reviewed.
Of the individual components of M3, cur-
rency in circulation rose visibly in the firstquarter of 2002, though it did not come closeto recovering from the beating it took in therun-up to the introduction of euro banknotesand coins. The replenishment of cash hold-ings probably took place at the expense ofovernight deposits, which went down again,seasonally adjusted, in the period under re-view for the first time since mid-2000. Onbalance, M1 did increase somewhat in thefirst quarter of the year; at the end of Marchits year-on-year rate was 5.8%. Other short-term bank deposits continued to rise sharplyin the first quarter.

agreed maturity of up to two years, too,posted gains, though these gains were not asgreat as in the preceding quarters. By con-trast, negotiable financial instruments wentdown after adjustment for seasonal vari-ations.
Lending to the private sector continued to
weaken during the period under review. Atthe end of March, lending by MFIs to euro-area enterprises and households were up5.4% on the year, as against 6.7% at the endof December. The increase in securitised lend-ing to the private sector, at 33.2 billion, was
particularly small, with special circumstancessurrounding a German bank having made acontribution. Loans and advances faredsomewhat better, rising at a seasonally ad-justed annual rate of 5
12% between January
and March following just under 5% in thefourth quarter of 2001. MFIs’ lending to thepublic sector was clearly increased for season-al reasons. The longer-term inflow of funds toMFIs in the euro area remained rather mutedduring the period under report. Excludingcapital and reserves, money capital formationwas only 3.5% higher at the end of Marchthan a year before. Outflows of funds to non-euro-area countries probably tended todampen monetary growth in the first quarterof 2002. Following the strong inflows of pay-ments in securities transactions in the secondhalf of 2001, payment flows have since re-versed.
On the euro-area capital markets the rise in
interest rates which began in late autumn2001 continued until the end of March. Itwas supported in great measure by investors’
confidence that the world economy wouldsoon recover, along with slightly increased in-flation expectations. Incipient doubts regard-ing the sustainability of the economic up-swing caused yields to fall slightly in April. Atthe same time, market players’ uncertaintyabout future interest-rate developments onthe bond market decreased. In early May,concerns about future price risks and theDaily data

caused interest rates to rise once again. Atlast report the yield on ten-year governmentbonds averaged 5
13% in the euro area, just
under one-third of a percentage point higherthan in mid-February.
The yield spread between the capital market
and the money market continued to open upslightly during the period under review, from172 basis points in mid-February to 186 basis
points at last report. With short-term moneymarket rates having changed little, the euro-area yield curve has grown steeper, particu-larly at the short end. This reflects the pro-spect of a forthcoming cyclical upswing, yetalso the somewhat gloomier outlook forprices and the assumption of increased cen-tral bank interest rates.
In mid-February yields on ten-year US Treasur-
ies were around ten basis points lower thanthose on comparable bonds issued by euro-area countries. Afterwards, buoyed by opti-mistic assessments of the US economy, theypicked up somewhat faster than euro-areayields. Consequently the interest-rate disad-vantage of ten-year US government bondswas temporarily reduced. In mid-May yieldson US Treasuries were once again five basispoints lower than on European governmentbonds owing to the recent, more mutedassessment of the outlook for growth.
In the euro area the spreads on corporate
bonds having a lower credit rating initiallycontinued to slide following a particularlystrong increase in autumn, against the back-ground of the expected economic recovery.Given recent renewed scepticism regardinggrowth expectations, these yield premiumseven surpassed their mid-February level,which means that, on balance, assessmentsregarding the creditworthiness of these enter-prises have not improved.

beginning of the period under review.1
As this Report went to press, quotations on
euro-area equity markets – measured interms of the Dow Jones EuroStoxx index –were 2% higher than in mid-February. Initiallyprices picked up distinctly when market par-ticipants, looking at positive early economicindicators, increasingly assumed that a quickand strong recovery of the world economywas in the offing. As the period progressed,quotations receded. On the whole, in mid-May European companies’ stock-marketquotations were, on average, over one-thirdlower than their all-time highs of March 2000.
In similar fashion to the bond market, price
developments on stock markets largely fol-lowed those in the US. There, too, investors’confidence in the economy increased, even ifsome disappointing company reports andearnings forecasts did not necessarily confirmthis confidence. The high-tech sector was astriking example. Ultimately share prices inthe United States fell slightly. In the euro area,as well, stocks from the technology, media
and telecommunications sector (TMT) cameunder strong pressure following dashed earn-ings expectations, whereas cycle-dependentstocks from the consumer and capital goodssectors and financial paper were able to holdtheir own.
The generally expected economic recovery
has led to a stabilisation of analysts’ forecastsregarding corporate profits. The average an-nual profits expected for companies listed onthe Dow Jones EuroStoxx index,
2which in
February 2002 were nearly 18% lower than ayear before, were not scaled back any further.Long-term expectations of profit growthwere even raised slightly to annual rates ofover 12
12%. However, the still very high
standard deviation of the forecast valuesshows that analysts remain uncertain aboutthe future earnings developments of listedcompanies.

34Appendix:
Discussing the growthand prosperity gapbetween theUnited States and theeuro areaAverage annual macroeconomic output in
the euro area rose by 2.4% between 1996and 2001, and thus appreciably more slowlythan in the United States (+3.6% pa). Thegrowth differential between the USA and theeuro area is probably , for the most part, nota cyclical phenomenon. This is indicated, inter
alia, by various estimates of overall produc-
tion potential, according to which, over thelonger run, too, the USA is on a much higherand steeper expansion track than the euroarea.
Using a Solow decomposition of growth rates
to examine the supply-side background be-hind economic growth, one finds that theeuro area’s problems are centred on the la-bour market. In the second half of the 1990sthe annual contribution by labour as a factorof production to economic growth was only0.4 percentage point, or just one-quarter ofthe value for the United States.
1In addition,
the residual component, which is connectedto total factor productivity, is considerablystronger in the USA, where capital as a factorof production likewise made a greater contri-bution to growth.
The relative inflexibility of labour markets
plays a dominant role in scholarly studies ofthe euro area’s growth disadvantage. Esti-mates of the non-accelerating inflationaryrate of unemployment (NAIRU), which is sub-stantially higher in western Europe than in

35the United States, are cited as empirical evi-
dence of the high level of structural un-employment. The faster increase in total fac-tor productivity in the United States is attrib-uted to two factors: more intensive researchand development work, and evidence thatnew technologies proliferate more rapidly inthe United States than in Europe. The new in-formation and communications technologies(ICT) are a striking example. An OECD studyshows that the US ICT sector contributed anannual average of just under one percentagepoint to real GDP growth between 1995 and2000, compared with
14percentage point in
the major European industrialised countries.2
The main reasons cited are institutional differ-ences, such as labour-market rigidities, a lackof venture capital, and generally large bur-eaucratic roadblocks hampering the estab-lishment of enterprises. It appears that therelatively entangled web of regulations in theeuro area is not only getting in the way of the“New Economy” but is also smothering eco-nomic activity in many sectors.
In the meantime, the euphoria with which
the “New Economy” was greeted in somequarters, which peaked in 2000, has recededappreciably on both sides of the Atlantic,making way for a more realistic view of thesituation. That has also shed new light on thegrowth gap between the USA and the euroarea. Unlike just a few years ago, today someobservers are critically examining whetherthis gap will remain as large as it was in thesecond half of the 1990s. In particular, thefact that macroeconomic imbalances in theUnited States are likely to increase followingthe renewed recovery of the economy is con-sidered to pose a risk to the upswing in the
USA and the overall world economy. It is alsouncertain whether the investment-promotingdecline in the relative prices of capital goodswill continue at its earlier pace.
In addition, the size of the reported growth
gap is put into perspective by indications thatmethodological differences in calculating realGDP lead to the USA’s growth advantagebeing overstated. The different methods ofevaluating or capturing quality differences inthe statistical measurement of prices used bythe United States, on the one hand, and bymany euro-area countries, on the other, are aparticularly notable example. The Bundes-bank estimated that total average output inGermany between 1996 and 1999 wouldhave been just under
14percentage point
higher if the US method of deflation hadbeen applied.
3
Moreover, it should be borne in mind that thesharp increase in ICT investment in the UnitedStates has been offset by a considerable risein depreciations. In terms of prosperity, it isadvisable to factor the depletion of the cap-ital stock out of GDP because it does not rep-resent distributable income. From 1996 to2001 real depreciations in the United Stateswent up by an average of 7% a year, aroundtwice as much as in the euro area. The depre-ciation ratio, ie the ratio of real depreciationsto price-adjusted GDP , which is an approxi-

ciations, rose in the United States from 12%in 1995 to 14% in 2001, compared with anincrease of just under one percentage pointto 15
12% in the euro area.
The importance of depreciations has risen
much more sharply in the United States thanin western Europe for several reasons. One isthat the real (gross) investment ratio in theUnited States rose by 3
12percentage points
to just under 2112% of real GDP between
1995 and 2001. This increase was sharperthan that in the euro area, where the ratiorose by one percentage point, likewise reach-ing just under 21
12%. The main factor behind
these increases is the investment boomcaused by the development of the “NewEconomy” in the second half of the 1990s,which was much more pronounced in the
United States than in western Europe. Theother reason is that the use of hedonicmethods of price measurement in the UnitedStates made an important contribution to therise in the investment ratio by creating par-ticularly strong “growth effects” in ICT goods(which are almost always classified as invest-ments) compared with standard methods.
4,5
Because of the stronger growth of real fixedcapital formation, growth of the real capitalstock was also more dynamic in the UnitedStates than in the euro area. The shift inthe structure of the use of macroeconomicdemand towards fixed capital formation isalready enough to explain the increase in theweight of depreciations relative to GDP . Itmust also be borne in mind that, owing tothe use of degressive depreciation formulas,depreciations contained in the US national ac-counts are chronologically more closely linkedto investment in fixed assets than in euro-area countries, where depreciations in the na-tional accounts are usually linear.
6
In addition, the depletion of the value of fixedassets rose particularly sharply in the UnitedStates in the second half of the 1990 owingto changes in the structure of capital goods.This is associated with the fact that the in-1995 = 100

37vestment boom in the United States was
focused more strongly on ICT goods than inthe European industrialised countries; suchgoods generally have a shorter life-span thantraditional machinery and equipment.
7This is
also indicated by tax write-off rules in Ger-many. PCs, for instance, have an imputed life-span of three years, putting them at thelower end of the scale; automobiles have tobe written off over six years, lorries over nine,and company buildings over 33 years.
Owing to the sharp rise in the share of depre-
ciations in US macroeconomic output, thereal net domestic product, which approxi-mates an economy’s distributable incomemore closely than GDP , grew by 3% per yearbetween 1996 and 2001,
12percentage point
less than GDP . In the euro area, real net do-mestic product growth, at 2
14% per year,
was only14percentage point slower than
GDP . A comparison of the net domestic prod-uct reduces the growth advantage of theUnited States to “only” just under one per-centage point. It must be borne in mind,though, that this effect – apart from the dif-ferences in the methods used for deflationand depreciation – will lose importance oncethe euro area, as is generally expected,catches up in ICT investment over the comingyears. For the reasons mentioned above, thedepreciation ratios will then rise as well.
An analysis that puts prosperity at the fore-
front should also contain a per-capita assess-ment. A country with a fast-growing popula-tion needs to generate a correspondinglygreater increase in real income than a countrywith a less-rapidly expanding population if itwishes to maintain or even increase the pros-
perity of its citizens. Between 1996 and 2001the US population grew by an average of justunder 1% owing to a higher birth rate and asizeable influx of immigrants, whereas theeuro area’s annual population growth wasonly
14%. Thus, per-capita real net domestic
product in the United States grew by 214%
per year as against 2% in the euro area.
This per-capita assessment results in a growth
differential of “only” one-quarter percentagepoint between the two economic areas. Onthe one hand, this means the prosperity gapbetween the United States and the euro areaprobably did not grow as much during thesecond half of the nineties as the differencesReal per-capita net domestic

38in GDP growth would suggest. On the other,
the fact that the gap between the USA andthe euro area in real per-capita net domesticproduct grew and did not – as could havebeen expected – converge is not exactly asign of economic strength on the part of theeuro area.
In the USA real per-capita net domestic prod-
uct was just under US$28,700 in 2001. Thiswas nearly 50% greater than in the euro areaand a third larger than in Germany. Per-capitaincomes in the euro area and in Germany
were converted into US dollars using purchas-ing power parities; this generally presents amore reliable picture of differences in pricelevels between countries, at least over theshorter run, than market exchange rates. Atany rate, on the whole there is much to besaid in favour of not only using the standardand mainly output-oriented GDP for inter-national growth comparisons but also includ-ing income-relevant operating variables fromthe national accounts.

German capital market interest rates again
rose slightly in the spring quarter on balancein line with US and European yields. The yieldon ten-year Federal bonds outstanding inmid-May was 5
14%, which was just under
13percentage point higher than in mid-
February. Interest rates on Federal securitieswith a shorter residual maturity rose a littlemore. The interest rate spread of ten-yearFederal bonds over one-year paper narrowedmarginally to 119 basis points. The interestrate discount on ten-year Federal bonds com-pared with the average rate of other Euro-pean government bonds, which in autumn2001 had amounted to roughly 25 basispoints, contracted to around 19 points asfrom February 2002. The yield spread of ten-year debt securities issued by domestic banksover comparable Federal bonds remainedfairly small in the period under review, atroughly
14percentage point. Long-term infla-
tion expectations (based on polls conductedamong experts) increased slightly in thecourse of spring. At around 3
14%, the ex-
pected real long-term interest rate neverthe-less remained relatively low.
Whereas short-term bank interest rates, which
are more strongly influenced by terms in themoney market, showed little change betweenJanuary and April, the longer-term debit inter-est rates rose slightly in line with capital mar-ket rates. The cost of mortgage loans at a rateof interest locked in for ten years increased byjust over

to less than 3500,000) and 6.6% (for a credit
volume of 3500,000 to less than 35 million).
In April banks charged 8.5% for current ac-count credit (for a credit volume of 3500,000
to less than 32.5 million), which was a fraction
more than in January. By contrast, interestrates charged on personal credit lines were re-duced marginally to an average of not quite12

On the liabilities side of the balance sheet, theinterest rate paid on fixed-term deposits witha three-month maturity (for an investmentamount of 350,000 to less than 3500,000)
stood at 2.8% in April, which was slightlyhigher than in January, whereas the rate ofinterest paid on deposits with a one-monthmaturity decreased somewhat to 2.7%.
Share prices
When this Monthly Report went to press,
prices in the German equity market, as meas-ured on the broad CDAX share price index,were 2% up on their level in mid-February.For a time the quotations were boosted bypositive leading indicators of business activitywhich nurtured expectations of a rapid andstrong economic recovery. Stock prices fellagain, however, when those expectationsevaporated. Consequently, German shareswere still more than 40% down comparedwith their historical peak in March 2000.
Given the reduced share price volatility during
the period under review, market players’ un-certainty concerning the likely evolution ofGerman blue chip prices likewise lessened ini-tially before increasing towards the end of
the quarter amid a more sceptical mood con-cerning the scale of the upswing.
The individual stock market segments dis-
played rather divergent trends of late. Thusquotations on the Neuer Markt segment fornew and growth stocks again came underpressure. In the past three months theNEMAX all-share price index fell by 12%. Bycontrast, the share prices of mid-cap enter-prises listed on the MDAX improved by a fur-ther 3%.

41lated at market prices, gross sales of debt se-
curities issued by domestic borrowers rosefrom 3213 billion in the fourth quarter of
2001 to 3239
12billion. After deducting re-
demptions and adjusting for changes in is-suers’ holdings of their own bonds and notes,net sales amounted to 348
12billion, as op-
posed to 320 billion between October and
December of last year. In net terms, onlybonds with maturities of more than one yearwere issued. By contrast, the volume ofmoney market paper outstanding fell by afurther 36 billion. Sales of foreign bonds and
notes, which on balance were exclusively de-nominated in euro, declined compared withthe preceding quarter from 324
12billion to
319 billion. Total sales of debt securities in the
German bond market in the first quarter of2002 thus came to 367
12billion.The rise in borrowing was caused primarily by
increased issuing activity by credit institutions.In the first three months of this year theyraised 335 billion net from selling their own
debt securities, compared with only 35 billion
in the previous quarter. Their favoured issu-ance vehicle was other bank debt securities,which brought in 320 billion. But larger
amounts of debt securities issued by special-ised credit institutions and mortgage Pfand-
briefe were also sold (for 38 billion in each
case). As in the preceding three months, thenet amount of public Pfandbriefe outstanding
declined. The public sector increased its in-debtedness on the bond market in the firstquarter by 313 billion. The biggest public bor-
rower was the Federal Government, which is-sued new paper in the amount of 320 billion.
TheLand governments sold debt securities
worth 36 billion. The special Federal funds,
especially the “German Unity” Fund and theTreuhand agency, redeemed 310 billion
worth of their outstanding bonds. The vol-ume of corporate bonds outstanding rose by3
12billion.
The outstanding amount of commercial
paper issued by domestic industrial and com-mercial enterprises contracted by about one-third during the period under review. This israther atypical and might indicate a worsen-ing of firms’ short-term financing situation,given that in the past sizeable redemptionsof commercial paper – unsecured discountpaper with maturities of less than one yearthat is traded in the money market – tendedto be made at the end of a year or half-year.Commercial paper, the creditworthiness ofwhich is rated by the big agencies, has playedMonthly averages

though increasing use has been made of thisvehicle in recent years for short-term corpor-ate financing in view of its lower interestrates compared with bank loans.
In the first three months of 2002 domestic
enterprises placed new shares with a marketvalue of 33
12billion. This was only half the
volume of new shares issued in the equitymarket in the last three months of 2001,even though the first initial public offering(IPO) in six months was launched on theNeuer Markt segment in March. The net vol-ume of foreign equities sold came to 315
12
billion, so that the total amount of resources
procured on the German stock market cameto319 billion.
Investment activity
in the securities markets
Domestic non-banks were the principal pur-
chasers in the German bond market in thefirst quarter of 2002. They expanded theirbond portfolios by 344
12billion. Three-
quarters of the total were domestic bondsand notes. German credit institutions boughtdebt securities worth 322 billion net, mostly
in the form of domestic bank debt securities(311
12billion). They invested 39 billion in for-
eign securities, predominantly paper denom-inated in foreign currencies. Non-resident in-vestors acquired German debt securities inthe net amount of 31 billion in the early part
of this year, whereas they had added 312
12
billion worth of German bonds and notes to
their portfolios in the previous quarter. Thisdecrease is solely attributable to the offload-
ing of money market instruments for 322 bil-
lion net.
Domestic non-banks purchased equities total-
ling 319 billion in the first quarter. Foreign
shares made up the bulk of this total. Duringthe same period foreign investors added 39
billion net worth of German equities to theirportfolios. Following a lull of six months, theyagain undertook portfolio investments on amajor scale ( 36 billion). As in the preceding
quarter, domestic credit institutions resoldshares (for 38
12billion).
Sales of domestic investment fund certificates
between January and March amounted to318
12billion, which was well down on the
total in the preceding quarter ( 33312billion).DM bn  5 bn

43This drop in the inflow of resources was due
to the poorer performance of the specialisedinvestment funds in line with the seasonalpattern; on balance they received 35 billion,
compared with 320
12billion in the last quar-
ter of 2001. By contrast, the inflow of newcash accruing to investment funds open tothe general public, at 313
12billion, matched
the prior-quarter total. Demand focused onopen-end real estate funds, which recordedinflows of 37 billion. Bond-based funds and
money market funds both obtained 32
12bil-
lion, whereas new investment in share-basedmutual funds, which carries a greater risk,was again moderate, at 31 billion net. Units
of foreign mutual funds were sold in Ger-many for 37
12billion net.Deposit and lending business
of monetary financial institutions (MFIs)with domestic customers
In the first quarter of 2002 domestic custom-
ers increased their overnight deposits withGerman MFIs at a much slower pace than be-fore (measured on a seasonally adjustedbasis). Even so, their deposits expanded at aseasonally adjusted annualised rate of over7%. The ongoing preference for this highly li-quid form of investment indicates that it maybe some time before a more normal patternof investment activity is resumed. Moreover,German investors – especially employed per-sons – currently seem to be favouring liquiditymore than investors in other euro-area states;at the EMU-wide level, overnight deposits fellappreciably during the period under review inseasonally adjusted terms.
The reduction of deposits with an agreed ma-
turity of up to two years continued apace inthe first quarter of 2002. In January, in par-ticular, the volume of short-term time de-posits was depleted substantially (after ad-justment for seasonal variations). This pre-sumably owed something to the divergentinterest rate trends: falling interest rates forshort-term time deposits (due to seasonal fac-tors) and rising rates for longer-term time de-posits. Domestic insurance companies, in par-ticular, appear to have shifted substantialamounts of short-term time deposits intolonger-term time deposits. Deposits with anagreed maturity of more than two yearsshowed a corresponding sharp expansion inthe first quarter of 2002, increasing by 37.3
billion; this contrasted with the stagnantInvestment activity in the German

44trend shown in the two preceding quarters
on account of the marked uncertainty prevail-ing in the financial markets. Employed per-sons, by contrast, continued to display littleenthusiasm for long-term time deposits withGerman MFIs.
In the first quarter of this year domestic in-
vestors again topped up their savings depositswith an agreed period of notice of up tothree months. Although even the better re-munerated special savings instruments withan agreed period of notice of three monthsusually have an interest rate disadvantage,depending on the amount and duration of theinvestment, compared with other interest-bearing bank deposits (especially time de-posits and longer-term savings deposits), theyhave the advantage of comparatively high li-quidity. The amount which investors maywithdraw without notice or penalty from asavings deposit with an agreed period of no-tice of three months was increased at the be-ginning of the year to 32,000 per month. De-
posits with an agreed period of notice of overthree months were run down further in thefirst quarter (by 35.7 billion); one year earlier
they had fallen by only 30.5 billion. As a
result, the shift towards short-term savingsdeposits strengthened, despite a somewhatsteeper yield curve for deposits with a longerperiod of notice.
Seasonally adjusted lending by German MFIs
to the domestic private sector fell noticeablyin the first quarter. This was due exclusivelyto a steep fall in securitised lending by onebank owing to a change in business policy.By contrast, loans to the domestic private sec-tor went up a little, although the year-on-
year rise to end-March was no more than1.1%. Besides the slack economic momen-tum – which per se is tending to dampen the
demand for borrowing despite the favourablefinancing terms – this may also be attribut-able in part to a more cautious lending policyon the part of credit institutions: in a situationof narrow margins in lending business and agrowing number of insolvencies (based onpartial evidence), banks appear at the mo-ment to be making stricter demands on bor-rowers’ creditworthiness and collateral whengranting new loans.
Looking at the main categories of private-
sector borrowers in Germany, lending to indi-viduals contracted slightly in the first quarter.Given the subdued cyclical trend and the re-Lending and deposits of monetary

45sulting greater income uncertainty, house-
holds’ willingness to take up consumer loanshad already dissipated by mid-2001. Enter-prises, too, marginally reduced their indebt-edness to German MFIs during the periodunder review. Above all, wholesale/retailtraders and manufacturing firms cut their
bank liabilities further. However, this was off-set to some extent by an increase in lendingto enterprises in the energy, gas and watersupply sector and in the transport and com-munication sector. In the building industry,which overall remained in the doldrums,housing construction loans rose moderatelybetween January and March, compared witha stagnant trend in the previous quarter.
The indebtedness of domestic public author-
ities to German MFIs decreased by 31.1 bil-
lion in the first quarter of 2002. This com-pares with a drop of 38.9 billion in the same
period in 2001, although that figure hadbeen depressed by the redemption of equal-isation claims on government, which arechiefly held by German MFIs. By contrast, do-mestic MFIs further boosted their portfoliosof securities issued by German public author-ities in the period under review (by 33.3 bil-
lion). Their unsecuritised loans showed a de-crease of 34.4 billion, however, compared
with an increase of 34.0 billion during the
first three months last year.Seasonally adjusted

46Economic conditions
in GermanyUnderlying trends
The cyclical slowdown in the German econ-
omy, which had been marked by a14% de-
cline in real gross domestic product (GDP)during the second half of 2001, did not con-tinue in the first few months of this year. Thestabilisation of conditions that was identifi-able towards the end of last year led into aperiod of slight recovery in the first quarter.The upturn was not broad-based, however.Overall capacity utilisation is unlikely to haveincreased yet. If the economy is moving onno more than a flat and narrow path ofgrowth – as at present – even minor disrup-tions or downturns in sentiment can have asevere impact. It is not least for that reasonthat future developments in oil prices and thisyear’s pay negotiations are of particular im-portance.
According to the Bundesbank’s own provi-
sional calculations, overall output in the firstquarter of 2002, after adjustment for season-al and working-day variations, is likely to havebeen about
14% higher than in the final quar-
ter of last year. Having matched the previousyear’s level in the fourth quarter of 2001,working-day-adjusted output, was, for thefirst time, slightly down on the year, however.After adjustment for the number of workingdays (of which there were significantly fewerthan in the same period of 2001), there was,in fact, a decline of around 1%.
In the wake of the international cyclical up-
turn, the main stimuli in the first few monthsof the year were external. This enabled theGerman economy to benefit rapidly from theEmergence

47improvement in the global environment –
something that was also clearly reflected inan increased intake of foreign orders. Thelikely first-quarter rise in net exports is mainlyan indication of continuing weak domesticdemand. This, in turn, put a brake on importactivity. Business investment remained verysubdued owing to the low utilisation of fixedassets, which affected machinery and equip-ment as well as buildings. Furthermore, pres-sure on inventories also persisted in the first
quarter. In addition, it was not only with re-gard to residential construction that house-holds remained very restrained. Major pur-chases for consumption purposes were alsoput on hold in many cases. Surveys under-taken by the consumer research institutionGesellschaft für Konsumforschung (GfK) indi-
cate that the propensity to purchase remainslow. It may be that the various price influ-ences in the first quarter have curbed house-holds’ propensity to consume. Also, surveysshow that the outlook for incomes is stillrated as not especially favourable. The factthat the labour market was feeling the impactof the economic slowdown up to the end ofthe period under review may have played apart in this.
Output and labour market
Following its observable decline since spring
2001, industrial output stabilised in the firstfew months of the current year. Average sea-sonally adjusted output in the period fromJanuary to March was more or less exactly ashigh as in the fourth quarter of last year. Theyear-on-year fall, which was somewhat over4% in autumn 2001, increased to 5
14%–
owing, in part, to a base effect.
This meant that industrial enterprises’ cap-
acity utilisation was down again. Accordingto the ifo surveys, the degree of capacity util-isation in March 2002 – adjusted, as far aspossible, for seasonal variations – amountedto 81
12% of the standard level. This signified

average, the fall was roughly 2 percentagepoints.
Developments in output varied widely from
sector to sector. Intermediate goods, for ex-ample, recorded a seasonally adjusted 2% in-crease in output compared with the lowestpoint in autumn 2001. The best performancein this sector was by manufacturers of chem-icals, chemical products and man-madefibres, whose output grew by almost one-tenth. At 5%, manufacturers of basic metalsalso attained a notable increase. Producers ofconsumer goods also performed well. In con-trast to this, there was a further slide in cap-ital goods output, with the drop in durablegoods output being even more marked. Allmajor branches of the capital goods sector,especially motor vehicles manufacturers,manufacturers of machinery and equipmentand the electrical engineering sector, report-ed a decline in production. Among consumergoods producers, manufacturers of radiosand televisions, in particular, suffered sharpfalls in output.
Right up to the present, the situation on the
labour market has been marked by a declinein employment and a rise in unemployment.According to Federal Statistical Office data,the seasonally adjusted number of persons inwork had fallen to 38.66 million by February.This was around 145,000, or 0.4%, lowerthan in the comparable period of 2001. Inthe fourth quarter, the year-on-year declinehad been only half as large. The constructionsector and, latterly more and more, industry,too, have been cutting back their workforces.There are likely to have been cuts in staffing
levels in some areas of the services sector aswell. At the same time, more and more per-sons have seen their working hours reduced.In April, around 245,000 persons were re-corded by the labour exchanges as being onshort-time work, being employed, on aver-age, for not quite two-thirds of their normalworking hours.

with the majority coming from industry.
At the end of April, the number of persons
registered as unemployed with the FederalLabour Office amounted to 3.97 million inseasonally adjusted terms. As shown in thestatistics, this figure was scarcely higher thanin the preceding months. The year-on-year in-crease, which had been as much as almost200,000 in January, fell to 155,000. As calcu-
lated by the Federal Labour Office, the sea-sonally adjusted unemployment rate hadbeen 9.6% for the past four months. The cor-responding figure in line with internationalstandards was 8.1%.
However, it would be inaccurate to regard
this development as already being the start ofa cyclical improvement on the labour market.In point of fact, there has also been an “ad-justment” in the unemployment statisticsrecently. The calling into question of the ef-fectiveness of the job placement activitiesundertaken by the labour exchanges led tointensified efforts in that area. These includedthe launching of a “job placement offensive”with the help of additional staff, and steppingup the implementation of the measures con-tained in the JOB-AQTIV Gesetz that entered
into force at the start of the year. This act(AQTIV stands for “activate, qualify, train, in-vest, place ( vermitteln )”) provides for an as-
sessment of each unemployed person’s jobprospects and an agreement on gettingpeople back to work that contains a bindingindividual placement strategy. In addition, un-employed persons are obliged to step uptheir own efforts to find a job.
The labour exchanges’ calls for greater per-
sonal involvement have evidently led to manypersons previously registered as unemployednot re-registering or, as older members of thelabour force, making use of their right toforgo job placement. Some time ago, in fact,a study conducted by the Institut für Arbeits-

Other e cono mic publications . — 2 The nu mber of vacanc ies has been est imated from  the firm su rveys of the IAB. —

Bundesbank ‘s own ca lculations. — 4 ILO de finition.It recent ly beca me evident that the official stat -
istics on job place ment for une mploy ed persons 
had been overstated . This is a se rious matte r 
because one of the labour e xchan ges‘ most 
impor tant tasks is t o he lp to create a match 
bet ween the job seeke rs registe red with the m 
and the de mand for labour in the ec onomy .
A recent stud y produced b y the European Cen -
tral Bank (ECB) in c ooperation with the nat ional 
cent ral banks1 reveals that d ifficulties in match -
ing su pply and de mand on the labour market 
exist n ot only in Germany but a lso in othe r 
euro-area c ount ries. Over the last ten years, for 
example, the Be veridge cu rve, which sh ows the 
relationsh ip bet ween une mploy ed persons seek -
ing work and vacanc ies, has sh ifted s ignificant ly 
outwards. An outward sh ift of the cu rve indi-
cates a s imultane ous increase in une mploym ent 
and vacanc ies resu lting from  increas ing structu ral 
difficulties in the match ing process . In Germany, 
for instance , the nu mber of vacanc ies increased 
from  just over 1 millio n in 19922 to what is est i-
mated t o be a round 1.5 millio n in 2001, while 
the une mploym ent figure went u p from  2.6 mil -
lion t o 3.1 millio n du ring the sa me period.
The causes of th is increas ing discrepanc y lie on 
both the su pply side and the de mand s ide . The 
supply side causes include the impact of de mo -
graphic de velopm ents on the st ructu re of the 
economically act ive population as reflected in, 
say, the a geing process and immigr ation. It a lso 
includes chan ges in the participation rate of 
men and women . The de mand s ide is a ffected , 
among othe r th ings, by structu ral chan ge, which 
is cha racte rised b y a tendenc y for the se rvices 
sect or to gain ground at the e xpense of produc -
tion. Moreover, all these fact ors occu r in s pecific 
regional form s which c reate points where es pe-
cially hea vy imbalances a re c oncent rated .The c onclusion d rawn b y the ECB is that th is mis-
match can be a lleviated , ab ove a ll, by reduc ing 
rigidities on the labour market . This includes , 
not least , pruning ad ministrative regulations and 
impro ving the c oordinat ion of ta x syste ms with 
une mploym ent bene fits. One of the measu res 
open t o employ ers could be t o offer more flex-
ible working hours in the form  of models ta ilored 
to individua l requirements . Employ ees need t o 
take the initiative regarding educat ion, training 
and learning as well as mobility. Mana gement 
and labour, which play a c rucial role in dete rmin-
ing the c ost of labour input, have a large de gree 
of responsibility. Official employm ent se rvices 
can take on ke y tasks in impro ving market t rans -
parenc y - someth ing the individua l jobseeke r is 
hardly ab le to acc ompli sh on a b road sca le.
As desc ribed in the ECB‘s ana lysis, developm ents 
on the eu ro-area labour market in the late 199 0s – 
with rising employm ent and falling une mploy -
ment – were, in fact , clearly positive. However, 
the dens ity of regulation st ill appears to be t oo 
high, ne gative incent ives t oo strong and flexibil-
ity too low for ach ieving a th oroughgoing and

51the Federal Labour Office, revealed that al-
most 30% of persons who are out of workare not seriously interested in a new job. Halfof them belonged to the group of oldermembers of the labour force who, in theforeseeable future, will be switching frompre-retirement to becoming recipients of apension. A further 7% had registered as un-employed in order to secure rights to socialbenefits. Irrespective of this, it has becomemore difficult to match supply and demand
on the labour market over the longer term. Arecent study undertaken by the EuropeanCentral Bank in cooperation with the nationalcentral banks has shown that this situationapplies not only to Germany but also to anumber of other euro-area countries (seenotes on page 50):
Orders received
Demand for German industrial goods picked
up slightly at the start of 2002. Although in-coming orders in the first few months of theyear did not match their level in December,new orders in that month had been inflatedby backlog effects. Orders that had initiallybeen put on hold in the wake of the 11 Sep-tember terrorist attacks were placed as theglobal economy increasingly regained itsfooting. In order to characterise the cyclicaltrend, it is therefore useful to compare thefirst few months of the current year with thefinal quarter of 2001 as a whole. In seasonallyadjusted terms, orders received in the Januaryto March period were around
34%u po n
the fourth quarter of last year. This represent-ed a marked decline on the year, although–a t4
12% – it was not as pronounced as in
the final months of 2001, when a figure ofalmost -8% had represented a new low.
Up to that point, the slight improvement in
incoming orders had been sustained solelyby foreign demand. In seasonally adjustedterms, orders from abroad in the first threemonths were 3
12% up on their level in au-
tumn last year. They were only 1% down onSeasonally adjusted, quarterly, log scale

52the year, compared with -9% in the fourth
quarter of 2001. Intermediate goods were inparticular demand, but capital goods andconsumer goods also performed well.
Domestic demand early in the year failed to
match autumn levels, however, and, at 7
14%,
the year-on-year decline was, in fact, some-what greater than before. It was only in inter-mediate goods that orders picked up slightly.By contrast, consumer goods and capitalgoods producers both suffered a further de-cline in orders.
Construction orders continued to be very sub-
dued at the start of 2002. New constructionorders reported in the January-Februaryperiod were scarcely up on the low level ofthe autumn months in seasonally adjustedterms. The level was almost 5% down on thecomparable period at the start of 2001. Al-though this decline was not quite as large astowards the end of last year, when it hadbeen more than 7%, it has to be borne inmind, however, that orders have been declin-ing now for several years. Industry, in particu-lar, has cut back its construction projectsagain recently. Following a seasonally adjust-ed decline of around 4
12% compared with
the final quarter of 2001, orders in Januaryand February fell to their lowest level sincethe early nineties, when statistics for thewhole of Germany began. By contrast, in thefirst two months of this year, public sectorclients placed significantly more constructionorders than they did towards the end of lastyear. There was also a slight increase in year-on-year terms. This development is hardlylikely to be sustained, however, since the cen-tral, regional and local authorities remain in a
tight financial situation. The amount of in-coming orders in residential construction atthe start of the year largely held steady attheir autumn level, which was no more thanhalf as high as in 1995. The construction per-mits granted in January and February do indi-cate an upturn in demand, however.Seasonally adjusted, quarterly, log scale

53Prices
The price climate has become calmer again of
late. This followed a perceptible deteriorationearly in the year caused mainly by further taxincreases and weather-induced shortages ofsome food products. Four-fifths of the sharpprice rise at the start of 2001 can be traced tothose factors, whereas the changeover fromthe D-Mark to the euro in cash payments hadscarcely any impact in terms of pushing upprices.
1While it is true that the prices of
many everyday goods and services in fre-quent demand did go up noticeably in manycases, this – contrary to popular opinion –had little effect on the overall consumer pricelevel as measured by the consumer priceindex. This is due to the fact that the pricerises which were repeatedly cited by the gen-eral public and which had a perceptible im-pact on price sentiment among many con-sumers – such rises took place, for example,in selected services provided by the hotel andcatering industry and by some craft trades –make up only a relatively small part of theoverall basket of goods. This basket com-prises the important area of rents, for in-stance, which are included in the basket witha 20% weighting, as well as consumer dur-ables, such as cars, furniture and householdelectrical appliances. In these cases, however,the euro prices were largely derived exactlyfrom the earlier D-Mark prices. In some casesprices were even reduced. This is likely tohave received less attention in many quarters,most notably because such purchases aremade only at fairly long intervals. Further-more, people are probably generally moreaware of price rises than they are of fallingprices. The impression that prices are going
up is also encouraged by the fact that pricesare often converted from euro into D-Markusing the 1:2 “rule of thumb”. This is intend-ed to allow an easy comparison with trad-itional D-Mark prices but, seeing as the“real” conversion factor is 1:1.955583, theresulting figure is too high.
According to the official statistics, consumer
prices went up by 0.5% between Januaryand April in seasonally adjusted terms, corres-ponding to an annual rate of 1.8%. Lowerprices, especially for seasonal foods, were off-set by rising prices for refined oil products.The year-on-year rate of price increase, whichis generally regarded as a yardstick of infla-tion, went down from 2.1% in January to1.6% in April. Base effects in the case of foodplayed a part in this, since BSE and foot-and-mouth disease as well as unfavourable wea-ther conditions had led to a marked increasein food prices last year. Excluding food prod-ucts, the year-on-year rate of increase, at1.5%, was comparatively stable.
That was mainly due to the fact that the year-
on-year rate of price increase for both indus-trial goods and housing rents remained large-ly unchanged. In April, industrial goods wereup 1.5% on the year, and housing rents were1.4% higher than one year before. At 2.0%in April, the year-on-year rate of price in-crease for services was only a little slowerthan at the start of the year, when the figurehad been 2.2%. Energy cost somewhat morein April 2002 than in April 2001. The principal

54reason for this was a further sharp rise in
prices for refined oil products, which offsetthe decline that had been recorded sincesummer 2001.
International oil prices, which had fallen to just
under US$19 per barrel of North Sea Brent inmid-January, were at more than US$26 in thelast few weeks of the period under review. Inearly April, they even peaked at US$27
14for a
time. This price rise – driven partly by specula-tion – was mainly due to fears of increased pol-itical tension in the Middle East which threat-ened to impede the supply from the producingcountries in that region. On the demand side,the exceptionally mild weather conditions havemore than compensated for the gradually ris-ing cyclical needs.
The rising prices for crude oil and refined oil
products have also made German imports asa whole significantly more expensive. Meas-ured by the import price index, the level inDecember, which marks the most recent low,was overshot in March by a seasonally adjust-ed 1
34%. The year-on-year decline went
down to 2.5%, compared with 4.7% at theend of 2001. This was partly due to the factthat the onset of winter weather in the firstfew months of the current year had led for atime to sharp increases in the prices of agri-cultural products. Excluding these influences,prices remained largely constant, with theyear-on-year fall amounting to 2
14% in both
December and March.
The oil factor was also reflected in domestic
industrial prices. The seasonally adjusted riserecorded in the course of the year so far wasChange from previous year, quarterly

55due solely to higher energy prices. The price
level did show a 0.2% decline on the year inMarch but this was largely due to a sharp fallin the price of some intermediate goods. Thisoffset the continued rise in the cost of capitaland consumer goods, which amounted to1.6% and 1.0%, respectively, year on year.
Given the continuing structural difficulties in
the construction sector, there was scarcelyany increase in the cost of construction work
up to the end of the period under review.Construction prices in the first quarter of2002 were more or less at exactly the samelevel as one year before. Slight price increaseswere identifiable only in the case of mainten-ance work in the housing sector. This con-trasted with price reductions for shell con-struction work.

There have been growing signs of a recovery
in Germany’s foreign trade since the begin-ning of the year. For example, the assessmentof the global economic environment has im-proved because the chances of a cyclical up-turn have become more realistic in many ofGermany’s major trading partner countries.This first became discernible in the orders re-ceived from abroad. Having emerged fromtheir low in the fourth quarter of 2001, ex-port orders in the first quarter of this yearwere 3
12% above their level in the previous
quarter. Accordingly, the assessment of ex-port expectations in Germany’s manufactur-ing sector is now significantly brighter. Over-all, the revival in demand for exports of goodsin the first quarter of 2002 resulted in a sea-sonally adjusted rise of just under 1
12% com-
pared with the extremely poor out-turn in thefourth quarter of 2001 when the value of ex-ports declined by over 3% compared withthe previous period.
According to the statistical information cur-
rently available (ie up to the end of February2002), most of the increased foreign demandfor German products came from markets out-side the euro area. While seasonally adjustedexports to other euro-area countries virtuallystagnated in a three-month comparison (De-cember 2001-February 2002 compared withthe previous period), sales to other countriesincreased, in some cases significantly so. Forexample, exports of goods to the UnitedStates – which again recorded a cyclical up-turn in the period under review – rose by 4%in a three-month comparison whereas theyExports of

57had declined by 9% in the period before. At
the same time, adjustment pressure in the ITsector also appeared to ease worldwide, withthe result that the economic environment forGerman exporters improved from this direc-tion, too. Sales to the emerging economies inSouth-East Asia, which had been hit particu-larly hard by the setback in this sector andhad been declining almost throughout 2001,increased in the three months between De-cember 2001 and February 2002 by no less
than 6
12% compared with the previous
period. In the information and communica-tion sector as a whole, however, there wasstill no chance of repeating the high exportlevel achieved at the end of 2000 and the be-ginning of 2001. Despite the recent rise, salesin the period under review were still 8
12%
below that level.1Exports to the OPEC coun-
tries also increased sharply (+6%). There wasalso a renewed rise, albeit a more moderateone than before, in German exports to cen-tral and eastern Europe. Demand from thesecountries, in contrast to that from otherexport markets, had a stimulating effect onGerman exports throughout 2001. As a re-sult, the volume of goods exported to centraland eastern Europe between December 2001and February 2002 was almost 9
12% greater
than a year earlier whereas German exportsof goods as a whole were 2
12% lower than a
year before.
In contrast to exports, which gathered pace
in the first quarter of 2002, imports againsustained a fall. In seasonally adjusted termsthe value of imported goods was 4% belowthe level in the final quarter of 2001. The pro-nounced weakness in January had a particu-larly marked effect on the quarterly result. Atthe same time, however, there was also an-DM bn  5 bn

the breakdown of goods in foreign trade. The recording
of foreign trade is now in line with the standardised main
categories laid down by the EU, and the list of goods has
been converted to Version 2002 (GP2002) for the pur-
poses of the production statistics. In addition, the cat-
egories of goods in the food industry and in trade and in-
dustry (EGW) have been thoroughly revised. Seasonally

58other fairly sharp rise (of almost 1%) in import
prices in the first quarter, partly as a result ofdevelopments on the crude oil markets. Thismeans that after the elimination of priceeffects real imports of goods were actuallyslightly further below (just over 4
12%) their
level in the previous quarter than when thecalculation is made at current prices; theytherefore remained much below demand inGermany, which at the turn of the year wasgenerally subdued. Evidently domestic de-mand was being met to an unusually largeextent from home production and from thedepletion of inventories. At all events, theimports of intermediate inputs between De-cember 2001 and February 2002 (more re-cent data are not yet available) declined par-ticularly sharply compared with a year earlier.
German imports of goods from the other
euro-area countries declined at an above-average rate between December 2001 andFebruary 2002; however, the decline in im-ports from the EU countries that are not par-ticipating in monetary union was even strong-er. By contrast, suppliers in the emergingmarkets of South-East Asia were less affectedrecently by Germany’s greater reluctance toimport. The turnover of suppliers in centraland eastern Europe also remained relativelygood on the German market.
Despite the slight deterioration in the terms
of trade, the countervailing developments onthe export side and the import side again re-sulted in a larger seasonally adjusted Germantrade surplus in the first quarter of 2002. Itrose by 37
12billion to 333 billion. At the

Financial transactions
Damaging reports about balance sheet ir-
regularities by US firms, hostilities in the Mid-dle East and changing expectations with re-spect to future developments in the worldeconomy determined the climate on theinternational financial markets in the firstthree months of this year. The general invest-or scepticism that prevailed at the beginningof the quarter gradually gave way to growingconfidence on the publication of surprisinglypositive US economic data. This led to achange in expectations about interest rates.The yields on government bonds and theprices of equities on both sides of the Atlanticincreased discernibly. More recently, however,doubts about the strength and soundness ofthe economic driving forces began to increaseagain. The generally hazy picture of the eco-nomic outlook was reflected to some extentin Germany’s statistically recorded financialtransactions with non-residents, and the fi-nancial flows changed direction from onemonth to the next.

60March of this year net amounts of capital
were exported through portfolio investmentand credit transactions while net importsarose through foreign direct investment.
The international influences can be particular-
ly clearly seen in portfolio investment. As inthe previous two quarters, the caution shownby financial market players in the first threemonths of 2002 was ultimately reflected inthe comparatively modest cross-border in-vestment in securities. Even so, total net cap-ital exports amounted to 326 billion. In the
first quarter of 2001, however, outflows offunds had amounted to 348
12billion (net).
In the first three months of 2002 German in-
vestors acquired foreign securities worth 334
billion. Although this was more than in theprevious two three-month periods ( 34
12bil-
lion and 332 billion respectively), which were
significantly affected by the events of Sep-tember 2001 it was considerably less thanusual at the beginning of a new year. At 315
billion, German residents invested about halftheir investable funds in the bonds and notesof non-resident issuers. Euro-denominatedbonds predominated, as has frequently beenthe case since the start of monetary union.Especially at the beginning of the year, it isparticularly institutional investors that regu-larly invest fairly substantial sums in theseinstruments, which offer somewhat higherinterest rates than German bonds and notesbut are not subject, additionally, to exchangerate risks.

61quired foreign shares worth 37 billion com-
pared with 33 billion in the final quarter of
2001. Uncertainty about future economic de-velopments abroad was not the only factorinfluencing German savers. Their investmentdecisions were probably also affected by re-ports on the problematical balance sheetpractices of some US enterprises.
The demand from German investors for share
certificates of foreign investment companies,by contrast, proved to be fairly robust, at37
12billion, during the first three months of
the year. One reason why the margin of fluc-tuation of the funds invested in investmentfunds certificates is fairly narrow when meas-ured in terms of the volatility of cross-bordershare acquisitions might be that it is mainlyinvestors with longer-term investment hori-zons who invest in this segment.
With regard to cross-border financial transac-
tions in the opposite direction, non-residentinvestors showed no more than scant interestin German securities during the period underreview and added paper worth a total of 38
billion to their portfolios (compared with 317
billion in the three-month period earlier).However, the comparatively small total bal-ance masks the fairly large shifts that foreigninvestors made between the various instru-ments in response to changing interest rateand economic prospects. For example, theysubstantially reduced their holdings of moneymarket paper, ie debt certificates with a ma-turity of one year or less, in the first quarterof the year ( 322 billion) whereas they invest-
ed at the same time in longer-dated debt se-curities ( 322
12billion). Paper issued by gen-eral government also found favour again for
the first time since the safe-haven inflows lastautumn. Given the difficulty of estimating fu-ture interest rate developments, this paperwas presumably in demand not least becauseof its greater liquidity. At the same time, for-eign investors acquired bank debt securitiesworth 310 billion. The interest rate premium
of these securities over Federal Governmentbonds declined by 25 basis points on a quar-terly average and was therefore only abouthalf as much as the average level last year.
Foreign funds flowing on to the German
share market and into German investmentfunds between January and March amountedto36 billion and 31 billion respectively; in ag-
gregate that was somewhat more than in theprevious quarter ( 3
12billion and 34 billion).
For some time now global equity flows ap-pear to be shifting in favour of the euro area,and German shares have apparently alsobeen benefiting from the reorganisation ofinternational portfolios. More recently, a cer-tain “reserve” with respect to US equitiesmay also have had a stimulating effect.
Sluggish international economic develop-
ments and the rather modest corporate prof-itability prospects likewise left their mark oncorporate direct investment. As in the previ-ous quarter, enterprises continued to behesitant to acquire cross-border participatinginterests between January and March. Par-ticularly large corporate acquisitions, whichhad characterised events on the financialmarkets on several occasions over the previ-ous few years, were no longer evident in themore recent past.

62the year direct investment resulted in net cap-
ital imports (of 31012billion); there had al-
ready been net inflows (of 34 billion) in the
three months earlier.
German enterprises invested 3212billion
abroad during the period under review – pri-marily through German companies buildingup equity interests in their foreign branches.Particularly German enterprises operating inthe communications field used this financinginstrument to strengthen their positions inthe United States and the euro area.
Conversely, however, foreign firms also in-
creased their presence in Germany. Duringthe period under review their total volume ofinvestment amounted to 313 billion and was
therefore somewhat greater than in the previ-ous quarter ( 310
12billion). Here, too, foreign
investment was largely in the form of injec-tions of investment capital into subsidiarieseven if part of these inflows of funds was dueto capital restructuring within one enterprisewhich left the net result of foreign direct in-vestment in Germany unaffected.
As in the other segments of the financial ac-
count, the balance of non-securitised credittransactions was also comparatively low dur-ing the period under review because thecredit flows in the various sub-segmentspartly cancelled out. For example, enterprisesand individuals transferred 310
12billion net
abroad at the beginning of the year whereasin the previous quarter they had reducedtheir balances with banks abroad for balancesheet purposes. The fact that enterpriseswere temporarily parking funds accruingfrom a spate of issues on the international
capital market in foreign banks played a rolein this connection. General government, bycontrast, left its balances with credit institu-tions domiciled abroad virtually unchanged.
The value of the non-securitised external
transactions of the entire banking system,which may ultimately be interpreted as thecounterpart of the other external paymentsrecorded in the balance of payments, was notsignificant either (- 33
12billion net) between
January and March. Only the German creditinstitutions recorded an influx of funds fromabroad ( 313
12billion), and that occurred ex-
clusively at the short end of the market ( 319
billion). By contrast, the external credit trans-actions recorded by the Bundesbank resultedin a balance on the assets side of 317 billion,Net capital exports: −

64Public financeBudgetary development of central,
state and local government
The budget outturn of central and state gov-
ernment (the figures for local government arenot yet known) deteriorated significantly inthe first quarter of 2002. The deficit rose by310 billion to 327 billion compared with the
same period in 2001. A key factor in this wasthe fall in revenue (-7
12%) due mainly to an
unfavourable trend in tax receipts. By con-trast, expenditure increased by almost 2%,not least owing to a sharp rise in interest pay-ments and transfers to the social securityfunds.
In the remainder of this year, by contrast, cen-
tral, state and local government should re-cord a more favourable outturn than lastyear. Thus, in contrast to the trend in the firstthree months, a significant increase in tax re-ceipts may be expected. In addition, revenuewill be boosted by the much higher Bundes-bank profit. Finally, it is likely that expendituregrowth will decelerate, particularly as severalLand Governments recorded high extraordin-
ary expenditure in the second half of lastyear. The budget deficit of central, state andlocal government could marginally decreaseoverall in 2002 after having jumped last yearby315
12billion to 348 billion. Even so, it will
presumably be higher than envisaged in thebudgets (if no additional measures are taken)owing above all to the likely large tax short-falls.Overview

65The tax receipts1of central, state and local
government again developed unfavourably inthe first quarter of this year. They were 5.8%lower than the corresponding figure in thesame period of last year. That figure, how-ever, had been only marginally depressedby the tax reform. Besides this “base effect”,the persistently sluggish macroeconomic situ-ation – especially falling corporate earningsand retail trade turnover – and technical taxfactors also contributed to the lower receipts.
Among the different types of income tax, the
outturn for assessed taxes, in particular,worsened considerably. Corporation tax yield-ed30.7 billion, which was 31 billion less than
in the first quarter of 2001. In the case of as-sessed income tax, the negative balance ofinpayments and outpayments widened by afurther 31.3 billion to - 33.6 billion). The per-
sistent slide in corporation tax receipts seemsto be due mainly to the fact that the ad-vanced payments fell further because of theunfavourable trend in profits. Another signifi-cant factor in the year-on-year comparison isthat the tax cuts which came into force at thebeginning of 2001 did not have a full impactin the first three months, so that receipts inthe first quarter of last year were still quitehigh. This had a negative influence on as-sessed income tax receipts, too, althoughthey were depressed (even more sharply thanlast year) by the tax grant to home buyers,which is predominantly paid in March.
2Non-
assessed taxes on earnings likewise yieldedfar less than a year earlier (-29%), reflectingthe lowering of investment income tax rateson dividends at the beginning of 2002 and adecline in disbursements. In addition, revenuefrom wage tax was 2.6% down on thecorresponding figure last year because of thefurther raising – likewise with effect from thebeginning of 2002 – of child benefit, which isbooked against wage tax receipts. Further-more, last year’s corresponding figure hadonly been partly affected by the tax cut of2001 and had been inflated by the delayedpayment of end-of-year bonuses.
In the case of indirect taxes, the decline in
turnover tax receipts that had already beenrecorded last year continued (-1.6%). Thiswas caused partly by the decline in retailChange from previous year

reduction in taxable investment in the hous-ing sector and in government investment. Bycontrast, receipts from mineral oil tax(+4.6%), electricity tax (+14%) and insurancetax (+7.8%) rose sharply in the wake of theincreases introduced at the beginning of theyear.
3
During the remainder of this year tax receiptsare expected to develop more favourably be-cause several negative factors in the year-on-year comparison will cease to apply and therevenue trend is likely to be buoyed increas-ingly by the expected economic recovery. Ac-cording to the latest forecast of the WorkingGroup on Tax Estimates, tax revenue will in-crease by 1.9% in the course of this year.
However, receipts look set to fall 311.7 billion
short of the figure envisaged in the compar-able forecast from autumn last year – onwhich the budget is largely based – giventhat the tax expectations contained in thatforecast were not even met in respect of2001 and that the macroeconomic growthassumptions for this year have meanwhilebeen revised downwards further.
4These ex-
pected large shortfalls primarily relate to cor-poration tax and turnover tax, reflecting theless favourable profit trend and the weakergrowth of taxable domestic sales comparedwith the earlier expectations. Furthermore,the additional revenue from combating turn-over tax evasion is likely to be lower thaninitially expected. In addition, a marked fall isexpected in wage tax receipts, above allowing to the less favourable employmenttrend vis-à-vis the assumptions made last au-tumn. Based on expected growth in nominal
GDP of 2
12%, the national tax ratio (as de-
fined in the government’s financial statistics)will marginally contract compared with lastyear (to 21.5%), despite the tax increaseswhich came into effect at the beginning of2002.
In the first quarter of 2002 the Federal
budget recorded a deficit of 321

67pecially by a decline of 7% in tax revenue. Ex-
penditure, by contrast, increased by 312%.
Expenditure on interest payments rose par-ticularly sharply (+15
12%), partly because
Federal securities did not enjoy a high pre-mium in the first quarter of 2002, in contrastto last year. Furthermore, transfers to thestatutory pension insurance scheme againincreased considerably.
Compared with the outturn for 2001, a def-
icit increase of 32
12billion to just over 32312
billion is envisaged in the Federal budget for
2002.5Considerable risks are discernible on
the revenue side, however. Thus, accordingto the most recent tax estimate, there will beshortfalls vis-à-vis the planning of around33 billion. It is only because transfers to the
EU – which are offset against tax receipts –will be considerably lower than originally
planned that revenue shortfalls of the FederalGovernment will be noticeably limited. Ex-penditure on the whole could develop alongthe same lines as expected, by increasing con-siderably after a decrease in the last twoyears. This owes strongly to the fact that theFederal Railways Fund’s need for grants willgo up again considerably after being tempor-arily sharply lowered last year by the extraor-dinary revenue out of the sale of railwayworkers’ dwellings. In addition, grants to thestatutory pension insurance scheme, whichare financed by revenue from the “ecologytax”, will continue to increase sharply. Inter-est payments will rise markedly, too. More-over, the Government plans to step up ex-penditure on external and internal security.
The special funds recorded a deficit of just
over 3
12billion in the first quarter, which was
just over 312billion lower than the previous
year. For 2002 as a whole a large surplus isexpected which will significantly exceed the35 billion recorded in 2001. This improvement
is due to the higher distribution of Bundes-bank profits by 33 billion compared with last
year. From the total amount of just over 311
billion, 33
12billion, as in the previous year,
accrues to the Federal budget, the larger shareis transferred to the Redemption Fund forInherited Liabilities in order to repay debts. 5 bn

5The deficit trend, as reflected in the actual outturn for
2001 and the predicted outturn for 2002, deviates
strongly from net government borrowing. This is due to
the high rate of coin collection last year and high coin sei-
gniorage budgeted for this year in connection with the
changeover to the euro. These financial transactions
affect net borrowing but not the deficit. The Government

68The budgets of the Land Governments re-
corded a deficit of 39 billion in the first quar-
ter of 2002, thus exceeding last year’s figureby almost 35 billion. While expenditure grew
by almost 1
12%, revenue fell by 7%. In add-
ition to the decrease in tax receipts by 612%,
other revenue also declined noticeably. In theremainder of the year, however, tax revenue,in particular, is expected to develop morefavourably. Furthermore, extraordinary bur-dens, which significantly affected severalLand Government budgets in the latter part
of last year, have disappeared. Against thisbackground, the deficit this year should belower overall than in 2001, when a recordamount of 327
12billion occurred. The deficit
of318 billion predicted in the budget plan-
ning is, however, likely to be overshot owingprimarily to the shortfalls in tax revenue.
For the local authorities only the outturn from
2001 is available in which there was a deficitof almost 34 billion, following a surplus of
just under 32 billion in 2000. Revenue fell by
just over 2% in total. This was mainly due tothe sharp decline of well over 5% in munici-pal tax revenue but also to the significantdecrease in transfers – the bulk of whichare funded out of the general tax-sharingarrangements – from the Land Governments.
Expenditure, by contrast, rose more sharplythan in previous years by almost 2%. How-ever, special effects, such as a voluminous ac-quisition of participating interests in Baden-Württemberg and the disbursement of one-off heating subsidies, also played a role. Inview of the weak development of tax revenueand the cut in municipal transfers in severalLänder , there is still no sign of a significanteasing of local government’s budgetary situ-
ation for this year.
The indebtedness of central, state and local
government rose sharply by just under 327
12
billion in the first quarter. 31112billion, on
balance, was borrowed from the capital mar-kets. Money market debt increased by 316
billion. The credit markets received consider-able claims amounting to 320
12billion, in
particular from the Federal Government. TheLand Governments and the special funds re-
quired borrowed resources amounting to al-most 35 billion and 3
34billion respectively.

In the first quarter of 2002 the wage and sal-
ary earners’ pension insurance scheme re-corded a deficit of 32.4 billion, which was
30.9 billion higher than in 2001. The revenue
from contributions between January andMarch overshot the figure for the previousyear by a mere 0.6%, which was also influ-enced by the unfavourable employment situ-ation. Overall revenue increased by 2.2%owing to the sharply increasing Federalgrants. Expenditure grew significantly morestrongly by 3.8%. Compared with the firstquarter of 2001, 3.6% more was spent onpensions. This was not only due to the pen-sion adjustments mid last year of 1.91% inwestern Germany and 2.11% in easternGermany but also to the – albeit marginallyslower – increase in the number of pensioners
by 1.3%.
In 2002 as a whole, too, the statutory pen-
sion insurance scheme will record a consider-ably higher deficit than last year. In thesecond half of the year the expenditure pres-sure will increase even further since pensionsare to be raised by 2.16% in western Ger-many and 2.89% in eastern Germany witheffect from 1 July 2002. In addition, the high-er health insurance contributions to be paidon behalf of pensioners will effectively in-crease expenditure. The Federal Governmentrefrained from raising the contribution rate tothe pension insurance scheme, a move whichwould, in principle, be required for a bal-anced budget. The financial gap arising fromthis will be closed by a recourse to the fluctu-ation reserves, whose statutorily requiredminimum level has been lowered from 1 to0.8 month’s expenditure. In view of the un-favourable employment trend and the strong-er pension adjustments effective from mid-2002 it cannot be ruled out altogether thateven this value will be undershot at the endof the year.
The Federal Labour Office showed a slight
financial deterioration in the first quarter of2002. Thus the deficit grew by 30.2 billion to
31.6 billion compared with 2001, although
the increase in expenditure, at 2.0%, was onthe whole moderately low. However, totalrevenue, primarily as a result of the deterior-ation in the employment situation, overshotlast year’s figure by a mere 0.3%. Spendingon unemployment benefits increased by4.1%. While in western Germany 10.8%

70more was spent, in the eastern part of the
country there was a sharp decline of 8.7%.Apart from the considerably larger rise – inrelative terms – in unemployment in theWest, the fact that an ever increasing numberof jobless persons in the East are losing theirclaim to unemployment benefits the longerthey have been unemployed also seemed toplay a role. This is also likely to be linked withthe constant decline of job creation measures(which give rise to new claims to unemploy-ment benefits). In the first quarter, expend-iture on such measures in Germany as awhole declined by just over one-fifth on theyear. The level of spending on vocationaltraining remained virtually the same as in2001, leading to a total decrease of 4.0% ofthe costs of active labour market policies.
The Federal Labour Office’s demand for grants
in the amount of 32.0 billion for the whole
year as planned in the budgets appears to berather limited now in view of the sustainedstrain on the labour market. So as not to ex-ceed this amount, a tight spending constraintis required for active labour-market policies.
For the financial development of the statutory
health insurance funds and nursing care in-surance scheme, only results until the end of2001 are available. According to these re-sults, the health insurance institutions record-ed a deficit of 32.8 billion last year which was
a serious deterioration and which was dueparticularly to sharply increasing expenditureon pharmaceuticals. Expenditure on benefitsin total increased by 3.6%, while revenuefrom contributions grew by a mere 1.4%.Many health insurance institutions wereforced to raise their contribution rates at the
beginning of 2002 not only to avoid moredeficits but also to replenish the statutoryminimum reserves.

71The statutory nursing care insurance scheme
was able to finance its slight deficit of 30.1
billion in 2001 out of its reserves, which, incontrast to those of the health insurance in-stitutions, were abundant with slightly morethan 34
12billion. As revenue from contribu-
tions grew by 1.5%, the nursing care insur-ance institutions profited from a comparative-ly low increase in expenditure of 1.1%.Thanks to a one-off payment from the Fed-eral Government amounting to 30.6 billion,
7
the outturn for 2002 is expected to be more
favourable, although the 2001 Supplemen-tary Nursing Benefits Act envisages additionalexpenditure on benefits, particularly forpeople suffering from dementia.
Trends of the general government
budget
Last year the general government deficit ratio
(central, state and local government and thesocial security funds as defined in the nationalaccounts and excluding UMTS sales in 2000)rose by 1.4 percentage points to 2.7%, pri-marily following the extensive revenue short-falls in the wake of the tax reform. This figureis therefore not far from the 3% ceiling set inthe Maastricht Treaty.
8
In a long-term approach, too – which alsoconsiders future demographic developments –the government consolidation requirementincreased again last year. This is clear in theoutturn of new calculations undertaken with-in the context of generational accountingwhich was set up on the basis of the legalframework in force in 2001. As explained indetail on page 72, the long-term sustainabil-
ity of public finance deteriorated vis-à-vis2000, mainly owing to the considerable rev-enue shortfalls following the tax reform andother non-cyclical factors.
This year the cyclical share of the government
deficit will increase because macroeconomicdevelopments, seen on an annual average,will continue to lag behind potential outputgrowth. There are also additional require-ments out of the increase in child benefit,higher expenditure on internal and externalsecurity, increased spending on old-age provi-sion and rising interest payments. These areoffset by the fact that the taxes and socialsecurity ratio is likely to rise perceptibly. Thereasons for this are the further stage of the“ecological tax reform”, the tobacco and in-surance tax increase and the pronounced risein the average contribution rate to the statu-tory health insurance funds. The additionalmeasures for combating turnover tax evasioncould also result in additional revenue. Finally,general government budgets will be relievedin 2002 by the fact that profit distribution ofthe Deutsche Bundesbank has been higherthan in 2001 and various one-off expenditureitems from last year will no longer have animpact.
9The Federal Government’s transfers
7In 1995 the nursing care insurance institutions gave the
Federal Government 30.6 billion to support the building
of care facilities in eastern Germany. Pursuant to Article
52 of the Nursing Care Insurance Act, this amount is to
be repaid in 2002.

72Development of the long-term sustainability of public finance in 2001
The question as to whether the long-term sustain-
ability of public finance improved or deterioratedlast year can be analysed using the technique ofgenerational accounting. The annual consolidationrequirement derived therefrom gives some indica-
tion of the change in the long-term fiscal burdens
which are to be expected, in particular, in view ofthe projected demographic developments.
1The an-
nual consolidation requirement indicates by howmany percentage points the general governmentexpenditure ratio would have to be lowered or the
general government revenue ratio raised to enable
the fiscal status quo prevailing in the base year tobe sustained over the long term without anyfurther changes. Changes in the macroeconomicsetting ensuing from demographic trends or re-actions to policy measures are disregarded, how-ever.
Two different scenarios are considered within the
context of generational accounting. A “status quoscenario” assumes that the fiscal conditions prevail-ing in the base year will remain unchanged in thefuture. The age-specific per capita amounts for the
individual government revenue and expenditure
categories that are observed in the base year arekept constant – except for an adjustment for pro-ductivity growth. By contrast, a “policy scenario”captures policy changes which have been adoptedin that year but which will take (full) effect only ata future date. This facilitates a more realistic assess-
ment of what additional fiscal policy measures are
needed.
Under the status quo scenario – adjusted for cyclical
and other exceptional factors – the annual consoli-dation requirement (which, unlike the current def-
icit, includes the long-term demographic trend) in-
creased significantly last year by 1
34percentage
points to 412% of GDP. This sharp deterioration was
primarily due to the revenue shortfalls linked to thetax reform, which far exceeded the additional re-ceipts from the increase in indirect taxes. Further-more, the revenue trend for several taxes was much
weaker in 2001 than might have been expected in
the light of the changes in legislation and overalleconomic developments. In addition, the contribu-tion rate to the statutory pension insurance schemewas lowered. On the expenditure side, the increasein several social benefits and the rise in spending by
the statutory health insurance funds was offset by
generally tight budget management.Under the policy scenario the annual consolidation
requirement last year was noticeably lower, at3
14% of GDP, than in the adjusted status quo scen-
ario owing to the measures due to come into effectat a later date. This was attributable to future sav-
ings by the statutory pension insurance scheme
which far exceed the additional tax relief measuresadopted for the next few years. But under the pol-icy scenario, too, the sustainability of public financeworsened considerably in 2001 compared with2000. The annual consolidation requirement rose
by 1
14percentage points. The tax reform played no
part in this, however. As it had already beenadopted in 2000, the resultant tax shortfalls in sub-sequent years were included in the policy scenariofor 2000. By contrast, those deteriorations in the ad-justed status quo scenario that are not due to statu-tory measures adopted before 2001 are also re-
flected in the policy scenario.
Measures adopted in 2001 but which will only come
into effect at a later date also contributed greatlyto this deterioration, especially the dropping of the“demographic factor”, which with the adoption of
the pension reform was abandoned in formal
terms, too. By contrast, a comparison of two otherelements of the pension reform – the dampeningimpact of notional private pension plan contribu-tions on the size of the pension adjustment, on theone hand, and the tax shortfalls due to the govern-ment promotion of private pension plans, on the
other – shows a marginal net improvement in fiscal
sustainability.
2The other policy changes adopted
in 2001 for future years had no significant influenceon the annual consolidation requirement: the risein child benefit from the beginning of this yearshould be largely offset by additional revenue ex-
pected from the “Act Combating Fiscal Evasion”
and the increase in tobacco and insurance tax. Thepolicy scenario shows an overall deterioration inthe long-term sustainability of public finance com-pared with 2000 even after stripping out the effectof the demographic factor which, although in for-mal terms it was dropped only with the adoption of
the pension reform, was abandoned in political
terms much earlier.
Even though the figures shown here must be inter-
preted with caution, the results show that last yearfiscal policy was still not sustainable. Compared
with 2000, the long-term sustainability of public fi-
nance actually deteriorated noticeably.

pension reform – such as the new rules for disabilitypensions, the increased offsetting of surviving dependants’pensions against income and the change in the pensionformula after 2010 – have been disregarded.

73to the EU budget are also likely to be relative-
ly low once again. Overall a further increaseof the deficit ratio can, therefore, be avoided– provided that a consistent policy of expend-iture restraint is carried out at all levels ofgovernment.
A sharp reduction of the general government
deficit is required in 2003 and 2004 in orderto reach at least a close-to-balanced budget-ary position. Every EU member state commit-ted themselves to this common position byadopting the Stability and Growth Pact in1997. The last two German stability pro-grammes envisaged reaching this objective by2004. In connection with the discussion of apossible “early warning”, the Federal Gov-ernment once again pushed for this commit-ment, thus contributing, not least, to preserv-ing the credibility of the financial politicalrules in monetary union. However, in order toreach this objective by 2004, extensive con-solidation efforts are required. Although themacroeconomic trend in the next two yearscan be expected to support the reduction ofthe government deficit, in view of the factthat the bulk of the deficit is structurallyrelated, it can only be durably reduced bysustainable measures. In view of the nextstage of the income tax reform coming intoforce in 2003 and the fiscal objective oflowering the taxes and social security ratiofurther, it will also be imperative to stringentlylimit government expenditure.
Due to the defined federal structure of public
finance in Germany and the high deficitswhich are also existent at Land Government
level,
10it was of particular importance that ina special meeting of the Financial Planning
Council in March, the Federal Governmentand Land Governments clearly recognised
their joint responsibility vis-à-vis Europeancommitments and the objective of a balancedbudget for their respective level of govern-ment. In order to achieve this goal, it was,inter alia , decided that in 2003 and 2004 the
Federal Government would reduce its ex-penditure by an average
12% p.a. and the
Land Governments and the local authorities
would, in principle, each step up their ex-penditure by a maximum of 1% p.a. This willrequire a considerably larger constraint onspending than has been envisaged in the cur-rent medium-term plans. In addition to verytight budget management, cuts in currentbenefits could prove necessary, too. In orderto ensure that consolidation efforts will becrowned with success in the entire generalgovernment sector, however, shifting the costbetween the government levels is to beavoided as much as switching from expend-iture to tax concessions.
If specific government benefits were to be ex-
tended or if tax cuts were to exceed theamounts appropriated in the budgets, thiswould necessitate tighter savings in otherareas. As has been seen in the past, fiscalpolicy-makers should not rely on an “auto-matic consolidation” by, say, hoping for morefavourable macroeconomic developments re-sulting in additional receipts or by countingon the short-term self-financing effects of tax
10As defined in the national accounts, last year the def-
icit of the Federal Government and its special funds as
well as that of state and local government was 327 billion

74cuts. Such a fiscal policy based on hope
would not tie in with the European commit-ments which – together with the more de-tailed national decisions – form the frame-work for fiscal policy decisions and whichshould be specified and credibly underpinnedby suitable consolidation measures.
Irrespective of its key importance in enhanc-
ing the credibility of European fiscal regula-tions, the reduction of the deficit ratio in2003 and 2004 does not contradict macro-economic requirements. Measured against astructural deficit ratio of around 1
12%i n
2000, fiscal policy in 2001, a year which wascharacterised by a low growth rate, was ex-pansively arranged. The structural deficit ratiorose to just over 2
12%. It is likely to fall againthis year but still be noticeably above the level
of 2000. The years 2003 and 2004, when fis-cal policy makers will have not only to com-pensate for higher deficits but also to achievethe consolidation needed to attain a close-to-balanced underlying budgetary position, will,according to general expectations, be markedby a cyclical revival. Should the deadline bywhich a balanced budget is to be reached beput back again despite the commitments, thecredibility of fiscal rules in the EU and of Ger-man fiscal policy could be impaired. The con-comitant negative effects on financial marketparticipants’ expectations and the increaseduncertainty, which could be reflected in inter-est rate increases in financial markets, wouldhave a negative impact on the macroeco-nomic outlook.

time rather than their level. They are calculated as the weighted average of nature of the data (nominal or effective) or the compilation method. Thenational interest rates provided by the national central banks. The national country weights for the euro area retail bank interest rates are derived from
