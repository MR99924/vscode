Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Having experienced a noticeable setback in the 
third quarter, the German economy is expected 
to see marked growth again in the final quarter 
of 2018. The direction of the underlying cyclical 
trend is currently only moderately upwards. 
However, the output of motor vehicles is ex -
pected to be ramped up gradually after a sharp 
contraction in the third quarter, which was 
probably due mainly to difficulties with a new 
procedure for measuring emissions. Nonethe -
less, the normalisation in the automotive sector 
will possibly be slower than assumed initially. 
One indication of this is that, according to data 
provided by the German Association of the 
Automotive Industry (VDA), the number of pas -
senger cars produced in October and Novem -
ber was not up on the third- quarter level in 
seasonally adjusted terms. Orders received in 
the sector increased substantially in October 
but this was driven solely by orders from 
abroad. Weak domestic incoming orders and 
depressed registration figures could be an indi -
cation that consumers in Germany are currently 
holding back with their purchases. The debate 
about driving bans for older diesel cars in par -
ticularly polluted towns and cities might be a 
factor here. By contrast, the boom in the con -
struction sector continues. The outlook for the 
labour market and employees’ incomes is still 
excellent, too. However, sentiment among 
businesses has clouded over perceptibly of late. 
Overall, in spite of certain catch-  up effects in 
the automotive sector, the expansion in the 
German economy is not likely to be stronger in 
the current quarter than the average for the 
first half of the year.Industry
In seasonally adjusted terms, industrial output 
in October 2018 declined perceptibly on the 
month (-½%). Compared with the third- quarter 
level, the decrease was somewhat smaller at 
¼%. The main reason for the subdued result 
was a one- off development in the pharmaceut -
icals sector where, following a higher increase 
previously, output was now significantly lower 
(-15¼%). Consequently, the production of con -
sumer goods was also down substantially over -
all (-2¾%). While the production of intermedi -
ate goods remained at the level of the previous 
quarter, producers of capital goods were able 
to clearly step up their output (+¾%). The 
automotive sector, which had to significantly 
lower its output in the third quarter due to dif -
ficulties introducing the WLTP test standard for 
emissions, also reported an increase in output 
(+½%). Nonetheless, output here was still con -
siderably lower than the level seen before the 
WLTP turmoil. It might take slightly longer to 
overcome the production bottlenecks than ini -
tially anticipated. After seasonal adjustment, 
data from the German Association of the Auto -
motive Industry already available for November 
on the number of manufactured motor vehicles 
remained at the low levels of the previous 
months.
Seasonally adjusted new orders received by 
German industry rose slightly in October 2018 
on the month (+¼%). However, order intake 
was up significantly more strongly compared 
with the average of the third quarter (+1¼%). 
This growth was driven mainly by a strong 
surge in demand from the euro area (+8%), pri -
marily on the back of numerous orders in the 
other transport equipment sector. The increase 
was fairly substantial even excluding this sector 
(+1¼%). German manufacturers also received 
more orders from non- euro area countries, but 
the increase here, at ¾%, was slightly more 
moderate. By contrast, domestic orders con -German econ -

tracted by a significant 2%. With regard to the 
individual sectors, producers of capital goods, 
in particular, enjoyed a strong increase in de -
mand (+2¼%). Along with other transport 
equipment, the automotive sector also re -
ported a significantly higher order intake 
(+4¾%). Orders from abroad experienced an 
extremely strong rise in the sector, while there 
was a decline in domestic orders. Overall, how -
ever, the volume of orders still fell significantly 
short of the level seen in the first half of 2018, 
as delivery difficulties related to the WLTP test 
procedure had a heavy impact on orders in the 
automotive sector in the third quarter. Orders 
received by intermediate goods manufacturers 
meanwhile remained at the third- quarter level. 
The volume of new orders in the consumer 
goods industry was even slightly down on the 
last quarter (-¼%).
Nominal industrial sales did not follow indus -
trial output down, but instead saw a significant 
month- on- month increase of 1% in October 
2018 after seasonal adjustment. Compared 
with the average of the third quarter, growth 
was somewhat less pronounced (+½%). In re -
gional terms, only the domestic sales of Ger -
man industrial enterprises saw a significant rise, 
with German mechanical engineering firms, in 
particular, enjoying high sales figures. By con -
trast, turnover in the euro area and in non- euro 
area countries stagnated. Broken down by sec -
tor, sales of capital and consumer goods pro -
ducers rose at similar rates. Sales of intermedi -
ate goods remained at the level of the previous 
quarter, however. Nominal exports of goods in 
October 2018 saw a clear seasonally adjusted 
rise on the previous month (+¾%). In quarter- 
on- quarter terms, the growth rate was some -
what lower, at ½%. After adjusting for price 
effects, there was only a slight increase in ex -
ports (+¼%). In October, nominal goods im -
ports were up substantially on the previous 
month’s level in seasonally adjusted terms 
(+1¼%). Compared with the high average of 
the third quarter, there was therefore still a 
marked increase of ¾%. In price-  adjusted 
terms, however, goods imports were clearly Industrial sales

down on the previous quarter’s level (-½%). 
This was owing to the recent steep increase in 
the cost of energy imports.
Construction
In October 2018, construction output was 
down slightly on the month (-¼%) after sea -
sonal adjustment. By contrast, a substantial 
1¼% increase in activity was reported com -
pared with the average of the third quarter. 
This was chiefly due to construction activity in 
the finishing trades recently showing strong 
growth (+2¼%), whilst output in the main con -
struction sector was only up moderately (+¼%). 
At the same time, other economic indicators 
also suggest that the buoyant construction ac -
tivity in Germany is set to continue. According 
to the ifo Institute, the assessment of the busi -
ness situation in the main construction sector 
at the end of the period under review is only 
slightly short of the peak level reached recently. 
Furthermore, equipment utilisation and the 
range of orders in the sector increased slightly 
from an already very high level.
Labour market
Employment growth was solid in October 
2018, as in the past few months. The number 
of persons in work rose by a seasonally ad -
justed 37,000 on the month. Employment was 
up by 559,000 persons or 1.3% in comparison 
to the same month in the previous year. This 
was first and foremost attributable to the 
strong increase in jobs subject to social security 
contributions, which, at +675,000 persons or 
2.1%, showed a significantly stronger rise than 
overall employment in a 12- month comparison. 
However, the year- on- year figure dropped 
slightly towards the end of the period under 
review. Both the number of people in low- paid 
part- time employment and that of self- employed 
continued to decline. The indicators of demand 
for labour have shown mixed tendencies of 
late but all are clearly expansionary. However, intensifying labour market tightness is increas -
ingly becoming a limiting factor. The average 
time it takes to fill vacancies has risen further.
Unemployment fell distinctly in November. The 
Federal Employment Agency reported 2.28 mil -
lion unemployed persons after seasonal adjust -
ment, 16,000 fewer than in the previous 
month. The unemployment rate declined by 
0.1 percentage point to 5.0%. The number of 
unemployed persons was down by 182,000 on 
the year. In view of the already low number of 
people receiving benefits under the statutory 
unemployment insurance system, the decline 
was experienced virtually entirely in employ -
ment amongst persons receiving the basic wel -
fare allowance. According to the unemploy -
ment barometer of the Institute for Employ -
ment Research (IAB), the decline is likely to 
continue in the next few months.
Prices
Crude oil prices were clearly down in Novem -
ber 2018, mainly due to increased supply. They 
were just under 20% lower compared with 
Octo ber, but still around 4% higher than in 
the previous year. They remained broadly un -
changed in the first half of December. As this 
report went to press, a barrel of Brent crude oil 
cost US$61. The discount on crude oil futures 
was US$¾ for deliveries 6 months ahead and 
US$½ for deliveries 12 months ahead.
Import prices rose markedly in October. Energy 
prices showed a steep increase but other goods 
became slightly more expensive, too. This was 
also true of domestic producer prices for indus -
trial products, albeit in slightly less pronounced 
form. The annual rate of increase in import 
prices was up slightly to 4.8% and in producer 
prices remained almost unchanged at 3.3%.
Consumer prices (HICP) were up slightly by 
0.1% in November after seasonal adjustment.

because transport costs were higher due to 
low water levels in rivers. Prices for industrial 
goods excluding energy also edged up slightly. 
Prices for services were down marginally, how -
ever, mainly owing to lower prices for package 
holidays. By contrast, rents were still going up 
moderately. Consumers paid slightly less for 
food. Annual HICP inflation fell from +2.4% to 
+2.2% (CPI +2.3% from +2.5%) partly owing to 
a base effect and excluding energy and food 
from +1.5% to +1.2%, mainly due to the sig -
nificant decline in prices for package holidays.
Public finances
Statutory health  
insurance scheme
The statutory health insurance (SHI) scheme 
posted a surplus of €1 billion in the third quar -
ter of 2018. This constituted a year- on- year im -
provement of €½ billion. The surplus recorded 
by the health insurance institutions remained 
virtually unchanged, at €1 billion. However, the 
health insurance fund’s 2017 deficit of just over 
€½ billion receded almost entirely.
At 3½%, the health insurance institutions’ ex -
penditure increased at the same pace as their 
revenue, which is largely derived from health 
insurance fund transfers. The rise in spending 
was slightly subdued as administrative costs 
saw below- average growth and other expenses 
decreased. Spending on benefits, by contrast, 
increased by almost 4% overall, while the num -
ber of insured persons rose by nearly 1%. Ex -
penditure growth in the particularly important 
areas of hospital treatment, outpatient treat -
ment and pharmaceuticals was below average. 
Outlays for remedies and therapeutic appli -
ances, above all, climbed steeply, not least due 
to a rise in professional service fees.
The health insurance fund’s transfers to the 
health insurance institutions increased by al -
most 1 percentage point less than its revenue. 
Despite somewhat lower supplementary contri -bution rates,1 contribution receipts rose signifi -
cantly (4½%). Employees’ contributions in -
creased by almost 5% on account of favour -
able developments in wages and on the labour 
market, while pension contributions grew by 
3½% due to the somewhat higher mid-2018 
pension adjustment. Revenue growth was 
slightly dampened by the fact that the central 
government grant has stopped increasing.
In the first three quarters taken together, the 
surplus recorded by the health insurance insti -
tutions declined to €2 billion; this stood at €2½ 
billion in the same period last year. The health 
insurance fund’s deficit dropped by €½ billion 
to just under €3½ billion. The statutory health 
insurance scheme once again looks likely to 
record  a significant surplus for the year as 
a  whole (2017: €3 billion, according to the 
annual  accounts).
The official SHI estimators foresee a further 
marked rise in income subject to compulsory 
insurance contributions (4%) in the coming 
year. Employees’ income is expected to see 
slightly weaker growth of just over 3½%. For 
pensions, however, a considerably stronger 
increase  of 5½% is anticipated, not least on 
account  of the 2019 benefit expansions. The 
health insurance fund will transfer the expected 
contributions to the health insurance institu -
tions in full.2 According to the official SHI esti -
mators, the institutions’ expenditure levels will 
rise at an accelerated rate of just under 4½%. 
The number of insured persons is expected to 
increase further. Several measures are also set 
to have burdening effects in the coming year. 
Self- employed persons on lower incomes will 
have to pay lower contributions, and hospitals 
will receive full reimbursement of additional 
nursing staff costs. This represents a departure 
from the usual system of case- based lump- sum 
payments, which are intended to support eco -Moderately

nomic efficiency. Furthermore, a shift is occur -
ring in favour of the long- term care insurance 
institutions – the health insurance institutions 
will, in future, transfer just over €½ billion per 
year to their equalisation fund in order to 
finance  additional places for fully inpatient eld -
erly care. In spite of these burdens, the Federal 
Ministry of Health sees potential for cutting 
supplementary contribution rates. The rate 
deemed necessary for full coverage of relevant 
costs for next year was reduced by one- tenth 
of a percentage point to 0.9%. Very high 
reserve  levels in some cases (€21 billion across 
all health insurance institutions at last count) 
are an argument in favour of a temporarily 
greater decline in the actual average rate. How -
ever, the potential for rate cuts calculated by 
the Federal Ministry of Health was only utilised 
to a minor extent this year; rather, the reserves 
were built up even further.
The particularly favourable financial situation at 
present should not hide the fact that, in the 
longer term, expenditure is likely to increase at 
a faster pace than income subject to compul -
sory insurance contributions, even in the ab -
sence of statutory benefit increases. If no coun -
termeasures are taken, a further rise in supple -
mentary contribution rates can be expected. 
Enterprises will also be directly affected by this 
because of the return to joint financing in 2019. 
While discussions about stepping up social 
secur ity spending in numerous areas are on -
going, the negative repercussions of increasing 
contribution rates should be considered. In this 
vein, measures to boost the efficiency of the 
health sector remain important.
Public long- term care 
insurance  scheme
The public long- term care insurance scheme 
posted a deficit of €1 billion in the third quarter 
of 2018.3 The second Act to Strengthen Long- 
term Care (Pflegestärkungsgesetz II)  had led to 
increasing deficits year- on- year since the begin -ning of 2017, but the latest quarterly result 
levelled  off.
The 4½% increase in total revenue kept pace 
with contribution receipts, which regained mo -
mentum somewhat. Total expenditure rose by 
just under 5%, while spending on benefits in 
kind was up by only 3%. Fully inpatient care 
–  the largest benefit area  – once again re -
corded a decline. Growth slowed further in the 
remaining sectors of benefits in kind. This ap -Financial

plied to cash benefits, too; although, at 10½%, 
these still continued to rise substantially. The 
reform of 2017 increasingly shifted expenditure 
growth onto this latter category, which in -
cludes, in particular, nursing benefits and pen -
sion insurance scheme contributions for non-  
professional carers.
In the first three quarters, the deficit climbed by 
€1 billion to €3 billion. The fourth quarter could 
close unchanged. In 2019, the contribution 
rate will increase by 0.5 percentage point to 
3.05% (plus an extra 0.25% for childless per -
sons), creating additional revenue of €7½ bil -
lion. In addition, the health insurance institu -tions will co- finance recently increased bene -
fits, such as boosting the number of nursing 
staff. In 2019, a greatly improved result and a 
significant surplus in the public long- term care 
insurance scheme are therefore likely.
High surpluses can be expected in the medium 
term, too, if benefits are not expanded to a 
particularly great extent. As a consequence, the 
general reserve is set to increase significantly. 
However, in light of the foreseeable burdens 
caused by demographic developments, this 
trend is set to reverse again in the future. An -
other contribution rate rise thus seems likely. 
Just as in the case of the health insurance 
scheme, this should be borne in mind when 
discussing an expanded range of benefits  – 
even if such an expansion appears viable in the 
short term on account of a high level of re -
serves.
Securities markets
Bond market
In October 2018, gross issuance in the German 
bond market amounted to €111.1 billion, which 
was up significantly on the figure for the previ -
ous month (€91.4 billion). After deducting re -
demptions and taking account of changes in 
issuers’ holdings of their own bonds, net sales 
of German debt securities came to €7.8 billion. 
The outstanding volume of foreign debt secur -
ities in Germany fell by €4.3 billion in the 
month under review, which meant that the 
total volume of debt instruments in the Ger -
man market rose by €3.5 billion.
Domestic credit institutions issued bonds worth 
€10.7 billion net in October (compared with 
€9.0 billion in September). The outstanding vol -
ume of debt securities issued by specialised 
credit institutions (€4.6 billion) and of other 
bank debt securities (€4.2 billion) increased in 
particular, and that of mortgage Pfandbriefe 
(€2.2 billion) was up too, albeit to a lesser ex -

debt by €4.5 billion in the reporting month fol -
lowing low net redemptions in the previous 
month (€0.1 billion). On balance, the issuance 
was attributable exclusively to other financial 
intermediaries, while non- financial corpor -
ations redeemed bonds in net terms.
In October, the public sector redeemed debt 
securities in the amount of €7.4 billion net 
(compared with net issuance of €2.1 billion in 
September). Ultimately, this was attributable 
solely to central government, which reduced its 
capital market debt by €7.7 billion. It mainly re -
deemed five- year Federal notes (Bobls, €14.2 
billion) and Treasury discount paper (Bubills, 
€3.2 billion). This contrasted with net issuance 
of two- year Federal treasury notes (Schätze, 
€3.4 billion) and of ten- year and 30- year Fed -
eral bonds (Bunds, €3.5 billion and €1.4 billion 
respectively). State and local government is -
sued new bonds worth €0.4 billion net.
Foreign investors were the main buyers on the 
domestic bond market in the month under re -
view, acquiring German debt securities for a 
net €4.8 billion. On balance, they acquired 
solely paper issued by the private sector, while 
selling public bonds. The Bundesbank pur -
chased debt securities with a net value of €3.7 
billion, chiefly within the scope of the Eurosys -
tem’s expanded asset purchase programme 
(APP). The fact that this amount is lower than 
in previous months reflects the reduced 
monthly purchase volume under the APP . Do -
mestic non- banks expanded their bond port -
folio by €3.3 billion, purchasing only domestic 
paper in net terms. By contrast, domestic credit 
institutions sold debt securities totalling €8.2 
billion net, mainly parting with domestic paper.Equity market
In October, domestic enterprises issued €1.2 
billion worth of new shares in the German 
stock market, compared with €0.2 billion in the 
previous month. Holdings of foreign equities in 
the German market fell by €0.9 billion. Ultim -
ately, domestic shares were purchased solely by 
non- resident investors (€1.8 billion). Domestic 
credit institutions and non-  banks sold equities 
worth €1.2 billion and €0.3 billion net respect -
ively.
Mutual funds
In October, domestic mutual funds recorded 
net inflows of €6.7 billion, compared with €5.8 
billion in September. On balance, specialised 
funds reserved for institutional investors were 
virtually the sole beneficiaries of these inflows 
(€6.0 billion). Among the fund providers, it was Net issuance of

Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €15.9 billion in October 2018. The result was 
€5.6 billion down on the level of the previous 
month. This was chiefly attributable to a reduc -
tion in the balance of invisible current transac -
tions, which comprise services as well as pri -
mary and secondary income.
In the reporting month, the surplus in the 
goods account decreased slightly by €0.2 bil -
lion on the month to €19.2 billion. Goods im -
ports expanded at a somewhat faster pace 
than goods exports.
Germany recorded a deficit of €3.3 billion in 
invisible current transactions in October, com -
pared with a surplus of €2.0 billion in Septem -
ber. The turnaround was largely attributable to 
growing deficits in the secondary income and 
services accounts. In the secondary income 
account , the deficit widened by €2.8 billion to 
€6.4 billion. This was primarily the result of 
higher payments to the EU budget stemming 
from financing related to gross national in -
come. The deficit in services rose by €2.1 billion 
to €3.5 billion. This was driven by rising ex -
penditure, particularly on travel and IT services. 
By contrast, the revenue side saw rises in a 
number of items, particularly transport services, 
and declines in others, chiefly research and 
develop ment in other business services, almost 
balance each other out. In addition, net re -Decrease in

ceipts on primary income dipped slightly by 
€0.4 billion to €6.7 billion, with income falling 
at a somewhat faster rate than expenditure.
Cross- border portfolio investment in Germany 
continued to be shaped by increased uncer -
tainty in the euro area in October, which re -
sulted in investors operating more cautiously. 
All in all, there were net capital imports total -
ling €13.3 billion (September: net capital ex -
ports of €7.9 billion). Domestic investors parted 
with foreign securities worth €8.0 billion net. 
These instruments encompassed debt securities 
(€4.3 billion), investment fund shares (€2.2 bil -
lion) and shares (€1.5 billion). Securities trans -
actions by foreign investors likewise led to net 
capital inflows in Germany (€5.4 billion). This is 
due mainly to purchases of debt securities 
(€4.8 billion), particularly money market instru -
ments. In addition, they acquired German 
shares (€1.6 billion) and disposed of investment 
fund shares (€1.0 billion).
Direct investment generated net capital exports 
of €5.7 billion in October, compared with €1.9 
billion in September. Domestic enterprises’ for -
eign direct investment resulted in net outflows 
(€6.6 billion). In particular, they increased their 
equity capital (€6.3 billion), with reinvested 
earnings playing an important role. Over the 
same period, intra- group lending went up only 
slightly (€0.3 billion); whereas trade credits 
went up, financial credits were reduced. For -
eign enterprises likewise stepped up their direct investment in Germany (€0.9 billion). This was 
achieved exclusively by providing equity capital 
(€1.4 billion), particularly in the form of re -
invested earnings. By contrast, foreign parent 
companies reduced their intra- group lending to 
subsidiaries in Germany by €0.5 billion.
Other statistically recorded investment – which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments – registered net 
capital exports of €16.9 billion in October, up 
from €5.9 billion one month previously. In this 
context, cross- border transactions were largely 
offset by non- bank transactions. While enter -
prises and households recorded net capital ex -
ports (€4.0 billion), transactions by general 
government in Germany gave rise to capital 
inflows  (€3.3 billion). By comparison, there 
were net capital exports of €16.3 billion in the 
banking system as a whole. These were driven 
by outflows recorded by monetary financial in -
stitutions (excluding the Bundesbank) in the 
amount of €27.9 billion. By contrast, the Bun -
desbank received net inflows of funds from 
abroad (€11.6 billion in net terms): TARGET2 
claims declined by a greater margin than the 
liabilities arising from non-  residents’ deposits 
with the Bundesbank (decreases of €28.9 bil -
lion and €19.6 billion respectively).

transaction values – by €0.7 billion in October.Inflows in

Outlook for the German economy – 
macroeconomic  projections for 2019 and 
2020 and an outlook for 2021
The German economy is likely to continue to boom over the projection horizon. The most recent 
damper in the third quarter of 2018 was probably largely caused by temporary supply- side diffi -
culties in the automotive sector and is likely to be quickly resolved. However, it is probable that 
aggregate capacity utilisation, which is already at a high level, will increase only slightly further 
in the coming years: gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to grow at a marginally faster 
pace than potential output, the growth rate of which is also in decline. In this context, demo -
graphic trends play a key role. On the supply side, they will restrict further growth in employment 
and thereby contribute to increasing shortages on the labour market. On the demand side, they 
will depress the need for housing as well as enterprises’ propensity to invest. The fact that domes -
tic demand will nevertheless remain brisk is due to private consumption. It will be supported not 
only by strong wage growth, but also, in 2019 in particular, by expansionary fiscal policy. Further -
more, it is assumed that external economic conditions will be stable. Exports, the underlying 
trend of which is currently subdued, should again grow more in line with the moderate expansion 
of sales markets over the medium term.
In such a scenario, real GDP could rise by around 1½% per year in calendar- adjusted terms. How -
ever, the relatively stable annual average growth rates mask the fact that quarterly growth rates 
over the course of 2019 will be, on average, considerably higher than in 2018 and then drop off 
again somewhat.
Measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), inflation will initially fall from 
1.9% in 2018 to 1.4% in 2019, before reaching 1.8% again in 2020 and 2021. The main reason 
for the swing from 2018 to 2019 is prices for energy and food. While they have risen sharply in 
2018, they will only see limited growth next year. This masks the fact that, against the back -
ground of high aggregate capacity utilisation and considerable growth in unit labour costs, the 
prices of other goods and services are increasing at an accelerated pace. Excluding energy and 
food, the inflation rate is therefore likely to climb from 1.2% this year to 1.8% in 2020. In 2021, 
it could reach 2.0%.
Public finances will continue to benefit from very favourable framework conditions over the pro -
jection horizon. The general government surplus could amount to around 2% of GDP in 2018. In 
the future, it will probably diminish considerably again since fiscal policy will be eased. The debt 
ratio is likely to stand at nearly 60% at the end of 2018 and then continue to fall.
Compared with the June 2018 projection, it is now expected that German economic growth will 
be only marginally higher than potential output growth in the coming year. The inflation forecast 
for 2019 was revised markedly downwards, mainly due to the changed outlook for energy prices. 
For economic growth and, to a lesser extent, for the rate of inflation, it is downside risks that 
predominate as things stand today.Deutsche Bundesbank

Economic outlook1
In the second and third quarters of 2018, the 
German economy saw only very subdued 
growth. Adjusted for seasonal and calendar ef -
fects, real GDP rose by a total of just 0.3% dur -
ing these quarters. It thus fell well short of the 
expectations expressed in the June projection.2 
The main reason for this was the 0.2% drop in 
economic output in the third quarter, which 
was largely due to a significant, temporary 
one- off effect in the automotive sector. How -
ever, the underlying cyclical trend was also 
muted. There were extensive production losses 
in the automotive industry as a result of consid -
erable problems relating to the introduction of 
a new EU- wide standard for measuring exhaust 
emissions.3 The subsequent downturn in auto -
mobile exports contributed to the fact that ex -
ports remained broadly stagnant throughout 
the second and third quarters of 2018. Even 
without this one-  off effect, exports saw only 
subdued growth. Furthermore, private con -sumption, which had so far been a key main -
stay of the economic upswing, did not make 
any additional gains overall despite the favour -
able developments on the labour market. By 
contrast, a positive impact on demand came 
mainly from housing investment, which re -
mained highly dynamic, and commercial invest -
ment, which continued to rise.
A fairly strong rise in GDP is expected again in 
the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter 
of 2019. The problems in the automotive sector 
should gradually be overcome, and both the 
production and exports of automobiles will 
return  to normal levels. Although a meaningful 
recovery of the production losses in the third 
quarter is not assumed, this countermovement 
will boost GDP growth in both the final quarter 
of this year as well as the first quarter of next 
year. This countermovement masks the fact 
that the underlying cyclical trend is likely to re -
main fairly subdued in the fourth quarter of 
2018 and the first quarter of 2019 as well. This 
is indicated by the business expectations 
amongst enterprises, which were only cau -
tiously optimistic of late. The main reason for 
the subdued prospective underlying trend 
dynamics   is the just moderate growth in ex -
ports – adjusted for rebound effects from the 
anticipated recovery in automotive exports. By 
contrast, housing investment is expected to 
once again make significant gains. Further -
more, private consumption should again see 
strong growth due to the exceptionally good 
labour market situation as well as additional 
stimuli arising from fiscal measures that will 
come into effect at the start of 2019.German econ -

Over the further course of 2019, it is expected 
that the momentum of the German economy, 
and the underlying trend dynamics, will firm 
again. Alongside robust domestic economic ac -
tivity, this will be ensured by exports, which 
– even after the rebound effects in the auto -
motive sector have abated – are likely to rise 
roughly in line with the moderate expansion of 
German exporters’ sales markets. Over the rest 
of the projection horizon, economic growth 
will slow down slightly. Demographic trends 
play a key role in this. On the supply side, the 
existing shortages on the labour market will 
become more severe, which will restrict growth 
potential. This will be especially pronounced in 
the construction sector, which is already oper -
ating at close to full capacity at present. On the 
demand side, demographic trends are leading 
to waning growth in the need for housing. 
Housing investment, which is currently con -
tinuing to surge, will therefore lose a distinct 
amount of momentum. Due to the increasingly 
short supply of labour, commercial investment 
is likely to experience only comparatively sub -
dued growth over the entire projection hori -
zon. The fact that domestic demand will never -
theless remain high in the coming two years is 
due to private consumption. Supported by 
lower oil prices, it should return to its old 
strength following the dip this year. The tight 
conditions on the labour market will lead to 
robust  wage growth. Moreover, consumers will 
benefit from expansionary fiscal policy, particu -
larly in 2019.
Overall, this paints a picture of an ongoing, but 
only minimally stronger economic boom. After 
an increase of 1.5% this year, calendar- adjusted 
real GDP should rise at a somewhat higher 
pace in 2019 and 2020, supported by expan -
sionary fiscal policy. In 2021, the pace of growth 
could fall back slightly to 1.5%.4 However, the

mask the varying dynamics over the course of 
the year. The 2018 full-  year rate, which is not 
influenced by the large carry- over from the pre -
vious year, will come out considerably lower 
than the annual average growth rate due to 
the downturn in the third quarter. By contrast, 
when viewed over the entire year, the full- year 
growth rate for 2019 will be markedly higher 
(see the table on p. 17). This means that dis -
tinctly lower annual average GDP growth than 
in the June 2018 projection is estimated for 
2018 and 2019 (see the adjacent table). The 
main reason for this downward revision is the 
unexpected dip in the third quarter of 2018, 
which will continue to dampen the annual 
average GDP growth rate in 2019 due to the 
smaller statistical carry- over. In both years, de -
velopments in the sales markets of German ex -
porters are now estimated to be less favour -
able. The fiscal measures to promote growth, 
which were also factored into the projection, 
are unable to compensate for this.
According to this projection, the German econ -
omy will grow at a somewhat faster pace than 
potential output in every year of the projection 
horizon. The potential growth rate for 2018 
and 2019 is estimated at 1.5%. Subsequently, 
as the potential labour supply will hardly in -
crease due to demographic trends, it is likely to 
decline to 1.3% in 2021. The level of aggregate 
capacity utilisation, which is already high at 
present, will therefore rise slightly further over 
the projection horizon.
Germany’s exports were still experiencing a lull 
in the second and third quarters after having 
risen strongly up to the end of 2017. They thus 
fell well short of the expectations expressed in 
the June projection. Whilst exports to the 
United States and to the majority of Asian 
countries rebounded in the second and third 
quarters from a weak start to the year, exports 
to the United Kingdom, above all, declined 
considerably. Alongside only moderately in -
creasing foreign demand, the temporary supply

Underlying conditions for macroeconomic projections
This projection is based on assumptions 
made by Eurosystem experts about the 
global economy, exchange rates, commod-
ity prices and interest rates. The assump-
tions are based on information available as 
at 21 November 2018. The assumptions re-
garding economic activity in the euro area 
are derived from projections made by the 
national central banks of the euro area 
countries.1 These incorporate all fi  scal policy 
measures which have been either adopted 
or adequately specifi  ed and are likely to be 
implemented.
No change in momentum for global 
economy and trade
The global economy (excluding the euro 
area) slowed down somewhat in the second 
and third quarters of 2018, meaning that 
growth fell just short of the level assumed 
in the June projection. The pace of expan-
sion is expected to pick up a bit by the end 
of the year and then remain steady over the 
projection horizon. In this context, growth 
in advanced economies (excluding the euro 
area) will probably tail off a little. First, in 
the United States, the effects of expansion-
ary monetary policy measures on economic 
growth will dissipate. Second, given the 
high degree of capacity utilisation already 
achieved in many of these countries, a cyc-
lical slowdown is on the cards. It is likely in 
some countries that monetary policymakers 
will respond to expectations of higher infl  a-
tion rates. As for the United Kingdom’s 
withdrawal from the EU, it is assumed for 
the purpose of this projection that no tariffs 
will be introduced before the end of 2020. 
The assumption for 2021 is that the transi-
tion to new trade relations will have a 
dampening effect on economic growth in 
the United Kingdom.2In emerging market economies (EMEs), 
growth is expected to accelerate again 
somewhat over the projection horizon after 
dipping over the course of this year. Here, 
the continued gradual economic slowdown 
in China will be offset by increased growth 
in other east Asian and commodity- 
exporting countries. Furthermore, eco-
nomic activity in some EMEs will recover 
after being adversely affected by turbulence 
in their fi  nancial markets. All in all, the 
global economy (excluding the euro area 
and weighted by purchasing power parity) 
looks set to expand by 3½% per year over 
the next three years following growth of 
3¾% this year.
Following a rise of just over 5% this year, 
international trade (excluding the euro area) 
is expected to increase in line with global 
economic growth between 2019 and 2021 
at an unwavering rate of 3½% per year. 
While German exporters’ sales markets ex-
panded to a far more subdued extent than 
global trade in recent quarters, growth is 
set to rebound somewhat in the fi  nal quar-
ter of 2018 and the fi  rst quarter of 2019, 
making it – over the remainder of the pro-
jection horizon, too – broadly in step with 
international trade developments. As a re-
sult of increased protectionist measures, ex-
pectations relating to global trade took an 
even harder hit compared with the June 
projection than those concerning global 
economic growth.3

Technical assumptions of the projection
Uncertainty surrounding the extent of avail-
able production capacity to compensate for 
possible production losses in Iran and Ven-
ezuela drove up crude oil prices substan-
tially until early October 2018. Since then, 
higher output by major oil producers as 
well as an increase in production and larger- 
scale stockpiling by the United States have 
contributed to a considerable drop in prices. The US Administration also agreed with cer-
tain countries to allow them to continue 
importing Iranian oil despite the entry into 
force of sanctions. Expectations that de-
mand will become more subdued in future 
may also have played a role. The forward 
quotations from which these projection as-
sumptions are derived indicate that crude 
oil prices will continue to fall. Based on the 
lower level that has now been reached, 
however, the annual average decline will be 
far less substantial –  especially in 2020  – 
than had still been assumed in the June 
projection. The prices of other commodities 
on a US dollar basis are set to rise moder-
ately, in line with global economic growth, 
over the projection horizon. However, they 
have fallen since the June projection was 
prepared, which will have a dampening ef-
fect even on next year’s average rate of 
change.
Following its June 2018 meeting, the 
ECB Governing Council announced that it 
expects key interest rates to remain at their 
present levels at least through the summer 
of 2019 and in any case for as long as ne-
cessary. Market participants’ expectations 
of an interest rate increase going forward 
were thus pushed further into the future. 
Ultimately, the technical interest rate as-
sumptions for the EURIBOR and the yield on 
long- term German government bonds,4 
which are derived from market expect-
ations, fall short of the expectations set out 
in the June projection. Starting from a very 
low baseline, banks’ lending rates are also 
expected to rise only moderately over the 
projection horizon. The results of the eco-
nomic survey conducted by the German

sidered safe, such as Federal securities, were also af-
fected by safe haven fl  ows against the backdrop of 
uncertainty surrounding Italian fi  scal policy. See

Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) 
in the autumn of 2018 show that the per-
centage of enterprises citing fi  nancing diffi   -
culties as a risk to their business growth has 
fallen to a new all- time low. Overall, highly 
favourable fi  nancing conditions are as-
sumed over the projection horizon.
The stronger forward guidance concerning 
key interest rates in the euro area caused 
the euro to depreciate against the US dollar 
following publication of the June projec-
tion. A shift in expectations concerning fu-
ture interest rate hikes by the Federal Re-
serve had a similar effect. Over the course 
of the fourth quarter, discussions about the 
Italian government’s fi  scal policy stance as 
well as upbeat US economic data put pres-
sure on the single currency, causing it to de-
preciate further against the US dollar. The 
euro traded at US$1.14 in the period used 
for deriving the exchange rate assumptions, 
which was just over 3% lower than the as-
sumptions in the June projection. Com-
pared with 38 currencies of major trading 
partners of the euro area, however, there 
were only minor changes, as depreciation 
against the US dollar was offset by signifi  -
cant appreciation against the currencies of 
several EMEs.
More moderate pace of growth in the 
euro area
Following dynamic developments last year, 
economic expansion in the euro area con-
tinued at a somewhat more moderate pace 
in the fi  rst half of 2018. Admittedly, eco-
nomic activity suffered in the third quarter 
due to temporary production stoppages in 
the German automotive industry. Economic 
output continued to increase in most other 
euro area countries, however.5 It is assumed 
that the somewhat more subdued pace of 
growth above potential observed in the fi  rst 
half of the year will continue over the pro-jection horizon. As capacity utilisation in-
creases, sustained job creation in conjunc-
tion with signifi  cant wage rises will pave 
the way for solid growth in domestic de-
mand, although labour force constraints 
will become more marked in some coun-
tries. Growth rates for euro area exports are 
expected to be in line with sales market de-
velopments.
Compared with the June projection, ex-
pected GDP growth in the euro area (ex-
cluding Germany) was, following an in-
crease of 2.1% this year, revised downwards 
by around two- tenths to 1.7% for next year. 
As in the June projection, growth of 1.7% is 
expected for 2020, with the rate then po-
tentially falling slightly to 1.5% in the fol-
lowing year.
Fiscal policy expansionary, particularly 
next year
The fi  scal policy measures taken into ac-
count will have an expansionary effect over 
the next three years, especially in 2019. This 
is due in large part to the measures speci-
fi  ed under the Federal Government’s coali-
tion agreement.6 First and foremost, there 
are plans to spend more on pensions, 
healthcare and long- term care. In addition, 
central, state and local government intend 
to raise spending on childcare, education, 
transport infrastructure, domestic security 
and defence. Factoring in these measures, 
taxes and social contributions will decline 
only slightly in relation to GDP . For example, 
income tax cuts will be covered by add-

pean setting, Monthly Report, November 2018, 
pp. 10-21.
6 Most of the priority measures contained in the coali-
tion agreement are taken into account in the projec-
tion. However, the planned partial abolition of the soli-
darity surcharge, in particular, had not been suffi   ciently 
fl  eshed out to be included (revenue shortfalls in the 
order of €10 billion per year are estimated).Deutsche Bundesbank

standard for measuring exhaust emissions was 
a key factor behind the weak export momen -
tum. This led to a slump in exports of motor 
vehicles to other EU countries in the third quar -
ter of the year. These problems should grad -
ually be overcome, meaning that a rebound 
effect is to be expected in the final quarter of 
2018 and the first quarter of 2019.5 However, 
excluding this normalisation effect, the under -
lying trend should remain relatively subdued to 
begin with. The effective exchange rate of the 
euro, which has recently stabilised at a fairly 
high level, could have a temporary dampening 
effect on export growth. New industrial orders 
from abroad have also shown a trend decline 
in the past few months. In addition, the export 
expectations of both the ifo Institute and the 
DIHK have dropped. Germany’s exports and 
their underlying trend dynamic are expected to 
resume their strong growth over the remainder 
of the coming year. Then, as in the two years 
thereafter, they are likely to increase almost in 
line with German exporters’ sales markets, which are seeing moderate growth (see the 
section on the international environment on 
p. 19 ff.). Outside the euro area, German export -
ers are likely to retain their market share over 
the projection horizon.6 Germany’s exports to 
the euro area, by contrast, are expected to lag 
behind growth in the export sales markets. 
Here, Germany is losing price competitiveness 
on account of its unit labour costs, which are 
rising significantly more strongly than those of 
other euro area countries.
In spite of flagging foreign demand and turbu -
lence in the German automotive sector, the up -
turn in business investment continued into the Business invest -
ment continuing 
to increase only 
moderatelyitional revenue from progressive taxation. 
Furthermore, the changes to social contri-
butions will, all in all, have a minimal impact 
on the government budget. The rise in the 
contribution rate to the public long- term 
care insurance scheme will broadly offset 
the reduction in the contribution rate to the 
unemployment insurance scheme (change 
of 0.5  percentage point respectively). On 
average, a slight decrease in supplementary 
contribution rates is assumed for the health 
insurance institutions next year. Members 
of the statutory health insurance scheme 
will see their contributions go down due to 
the return to equal fi  nancing by employer 
and employee. However, enterprises, the 
various levels of government and the statu-
tory pension insurance scheme will pay cor-
respondingly higher contributions.

6 This probably also applies to the sales markets in China, 
where German industry, which is strongly geared to capital 
goods, has so far been remarkably resilient despite the 
structural realignment away from investment-  driven eco -
nomic growth towards consumption- fuelled growth. See

second and third quarters of 2018. However, 
expansion lagged far behind the expectations 
expressed in the June projection. In light of the 
German economy’s advanced position in the 
business cycle coupled with exceptionally fa -
vourable financing terms by historical stand -
ards, the level of commercial investment activ -
ity can only be classed as moderate.7 A further 
significant increase in global aggregate de -
mand over the projection horizon, as well as 
the associated pressure on already-  high levels 
of production capacity utilisation, suggest that 
a further rise in business investment could be 
on the cards. The propensity of enterprises to 
invest has been comparatively low of late; this 
could, however, be related to the unfavourable 
demographic trends that would trigger a flatter 
potential growth path in the German econ -
omy.8 A further subdued expansion of business 
investment can therefore still be anticipated.
Strong demand for housing and sharply rising 
prices continue to shape the housing market. 
At the same time, construction prices are in -
creasing substantially, which is consistent with 
the overall picture of high capacity utilisation in 
the construction industry. The sector is none -
theless still faring remarkably well in terms of 
expanding production, in spite of the tight la -
bour market. Indeed, housing investment in 
the second and third quarters of 2018 was con -
siderably more buoyant than had been as -
sumed in the June projection. It is, however, 
assumed that the rate of housing investment 
expansion will slow later on in the projection 
horizon. This view is corroborated by the fact 
that, on the supply side, it is becoming increas -
ingly difficult to recruit skilled labour and con -
sequently to continue expanding capacity at 
the same pace as before. On the demand side, 
the demographically driven future decline in 
the number of newly established households 
will increasingly lessen growth in demand for 
housing. The fall in Germany’s native- born 
population as well as the expected dip in immi -
gration levels will be contributory factors here. 
Mortgage rates, assumed to be trending slightly 
upwards, are also likely to be a drag of sorts. The favourable labour market developments 
and related positive income prospects for 
households will not entirely offset these damp -
ening influences on housing demand. Real 
housing investment will thus see increasingly 
moderate growth in the coming years.
Growth in government investment is set to 
markedly outstrip GDP growth over the projec -
tion horizon. It is assumed that additional funds 
will be earmarked, in particular, for transport 
infrastructure, childcare facilities and schools. 
The healthy fiscal situation of many state and 
local governments is having a positive impact.

7 This impression is reinforced by the fact that, following 
the revision to the national accounts carried out in August 
2018, the commercial investment ratio was markedly lower 
last year, and thus also at the current end, than previously 
reported.

society   and commercial fixed asset formation in the con -
text of neoclassical growth theory, see Deutsche Bundes -
bank, A reference value for business investment in Ger -
many, April 2017, pp. 44-46. Survey results indicate that 
labour supply shortfalls have already been constraining 
commercial investment for some time. In this vein, in cor -
porate surveys conducted in 2017 by the Cologne Institute 
for Economic Research (Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft, 
IW), 49% of the surveyed enterprises indicated that a 
shortage of skilled labour represented an obstacle to in -
vestment – this figure had stood at 33% in 2014. See 
H. Bardt and M. Grömling (2017), Hausgemachte Investi -
tionshemmnisse, IW-  Kurzberichte 78. For over two years 
already, surveys conducted by the DIHK have identified a 
shortage of skilled labour as the greatest risk to business 
activity.Deutsche Bundesbank

necks, a lack of land for new building projects 
and capacity constraints in the construction 
sector will probably continue to have a restrict -
ive effect. The latter will also cause construc -
tion prices to continue their steep climb over 
the projection horizon.
Following what was already a comparatively 
subdued rise in 2018, gross fixed capital forma -
tion is set to lose further momentum overall in 
the next two years. This is chiefly on account of 
the considerably decreased growth rates in 
housing investment. In 2021, gross fixed capital 
formation could see an even weaker increase, 
as things currently stand.
Although households enjoyed a considerably 
higher amount of real disposable income in the 
second and third quarters of last year, their 
spending level remained virtually unchanged in 
real terms. The household saving ratio thus in -
creased significantly more strongly than was 
forecast in the June projection. This was mainly 
attributable to the marked decline in private 
consumption in the third quarter, to which un -
expected one- off factors contributed. Along -
side the hot and dry weather, which resulted in 
a slump in clothing sales in the retail trade sec -
tor, for instance, difficulties in the automotive 
industry are also likely to have played a role 
here. As a case in point, the new standard for 
measuring exhaust emissions, which has been 
mandatory since the beginning of September, 
was not certified in good time in the case of 
many different makes of car, which may have 
delayed motor vehicle purchases. Furthermore, 
the increasing number of bans already imposed 
and other threatened bans on diesel vehicles 
with high emissions levels in particularly con -
gested cities may have unsettled consumers. 
Some potential car buyers probably decided to 
bide their time. These reservations could persist 
somewhat longer.
Soon, however, in view of consumer senti -
ment, which remains upbeat, private consump -
tion should again rise strongly overall. This 
should also continue throughout the projection Gross fixed

horizon. Private consumption is even expected 
to gain in importance as a key mainstay of 
growth. One indication of this is the high 
underlying trend dynamic of households’ real 
disposable income, expected to dip only slightly 
over the projection horizon, created by favour -
able labour market developments. Although 
employment growth has gradually been slow -
ing, earnings have risen consistently, even after 
adjustment for inflation. Moreover, especially 
next year, an additional impetus will come from 
various fiscal measures providing relief for em -
ployees in particular. However, a considerable 
portion of the especially strong income growth 
expected in 2019 will probably be set aside as 
“rainy day” provisions. For the same reason, an 
increased saving ratio is also likely over the pro -
jection horizon.
Real government consumption has lagged be -
hind GDP growth in 2018.9 One factor behind 
this is that the refugee expenditure captured 
here is declining further, exerting a dampening 
effect. Over the next few years, though, gov -
ernment consumption is expected to increase 
more strongly once again in view of the 
planned fiscal loosening and the favourable 
general government fiscal situation. Aside from 
tangible goods purchases, a significant expan -
sion of healthcare and long- term care benefits, 
as well as of personnel expenditure, is ex -
pected.
Imports saw very lively growth in the second 
and third quarters of 2018, having fallen some -
what at the beginning of the year. Unusually 
strong stockpiling contributed to this; however, 
inventories should already normalise again be -
fore long. Imports are expected to rise steeply 
over the projection horizon. Whilst in the past 
few years exports have strongly influenced im -
port growth, domestic demand will increas -
ingly become a driving force over the projec -
tion horizon. Moreover, the German economy’s 
interconnectedness with its trading partners is 
likely to expand further. The share of aggregate 
demand which is satisfied, either directly by im -
ports or indirectly through intermediate goods, is therefore expected to continue to climb. 
Trading partners within the euro area, in par -
ticular, are set to capitalise on buoyant German 
imports, not least because they stand to be -
come still more price competitive than their 
competitors in other countries.
The high current account surplus has dropped 
perceptibly this year on account of weak ex -
ports and increased commodity prices. The ap -
preciation of the euro, which, taken in isol -
ation, brings down import costs, does not pro -
vide a sufficient counterbalance. The current 
account surplus is likely to decline further in the 
coming years, chiefly due to volume effects in 
the trade balance. Due to dynamic domestic 
demand, real imports will increase considerably 
more strongly relative to the moderate real 
growth in exports. Taken in isolation, however, 
price effects increase the trade surplus – the 
terms of trade will probably improve, because 
export prices are rising more strongly than 
those of imports. The latter are primarily being 
depressed by crude oil prices, which are as -
sumed to be falling. It is assumed that the bal -
ances for primary and secondary income will 
not change substantially all together. Overall, 
the current account balance could decline 
markedly to 6.8% of GDP by 2020.
Labour market
The positive labour market developments con -
tinued in the second and third quarters. Em -
ployment growth, at +220,000 people in sea -
sonally adjusted terms, was roughly in line with 
the expectations expressed in the June projec -
tion. By contrast, the total number of hours 
worked in the latest two quarters rose some -
what stronger than anticipated. Registered un -
employment fell perceptibly in the last six 
months, in line with projections.Government

The solid increase in employment is likely to 
continue over the next few months. Leading 
indicators of employment growth remain fairly 
positive, though there are mounting signs of 
labour shortages. Registered unemployment is 
likely to continue to decline slightly in line with 
pretty lively demand for labour.
In a growing number of industries and profes -
sions, employment is no longer being con -
strained by demand, but rather by the supply 
of qualified labour. These labour market ten -
sions will intensify over the projection horizon, 
notwithstanding the fact that expectations re -
garding GDP growth have been lowered rela -tive to the June projection. The demographic 
ageing of the population is increasingly shrink -
ing the labour supply. In addition, a consider -
able number of hitherto economically inactive 
resident persons have recently entered the la -
bour force; however, like immigration, this 
source of labour will increasingly dry up.10
Germany’s labour force participation rate has 
risen considerably since 2004 and has now 
reached a very high level even by international 
standards. Similarly high growth will therefore 
probably no longer be possible in the future. In 
addition, a negative age structure is having a 
dampening effect. The progressive ageing of 
the population means that the number of 
prime- agers with the highest activity rates is 
declining while the number of older persons 
who tend to have a comparatively low partici -
pation rate is increasing. The overall labour 
force participation rate will nonetheless rise 
slightly according to this projection as the par -
ticipation rate is assumed to grow notably in all 
age groups. The greatest potential is among 
the group of those aged between 60 and 70 
years. Labour force participation among 
women of prime age is also likely to continue 
to rise as childcare infrastructure in Germany is 
expanded further. Another factor is the increas -
ing labour market integration of the refugees 
who fled to Germany in 2015 and 2016, who 
were disproportionately young and male and 
therefore tend to have a high propensity to 
participate in the labour force.
Net immigration to Germany has fallen consid -
erably in the last two years. And in the first half 
of 2018, it dropped slightly again, according to 
information provided by the Federal Statistical 
Office. With economic conditions in the EU im -
migrants’ main countries of origin improving all 
the time and demographic change having an 
increasing impact there, too, a gradual decline 
in net immigration from the EU is anticipated … and set to

over the projection period despite high de -
mand from Germany. Higher immigration from 
non- EU states could have a stabilising effect; it 
is, however, not yet as high as immigration 
from EU countries. The projection forecasts net 
immigration totalling 400,000 persons for the 
current year. This is the lowest figure since 
2012, but is still considerable. In the following 
years, immigration is likely to remain strong 
despite continuing to decline gradually.
All in all, the growth of the labour force will 
roughly halve every year of the projection 
period from just under 1% in 2018. As labour 
demand will rise stably, the number of regis -
tered unemployed will decline further. By 2020, 
the unemployment rate could drop to 4½%, 
and it is likely to remain on a downward trajec -
tory even in the year after that. In addition, the 
fact that average working hours per employee 
have already been rising since the beginning of 
2017 is likely to help mitigate supply con -
straints. In step with unemployment, the num -
ber of those involuntarily working part- time 
has already dropped in recent years. Moreover, 
the trend towards greater working time auton -
omy and the further expansion of childcare in -
frastructure are expected to cause a rise in 
average working hours of those persons work -
ing part- time voluntarily, in particular. There is, 
moreover, likely to be an increase in the number 
of overtime hours worked as a result of short -
ages of skilled labour. Overall, growth in the 
number of hours worked will nonetheless be 
curbed significantly by the sharply slowing rise 
in the labour force over the projection horizon.
Labour costs and prices
Negotiated wages have been rising consider -
ably more strongly this year than in the past 
three years.11 The main factors are the clear 
tightening of the domestic labour market in 
conjunction with the strong economy. Employ -
ers and employees in major sectors of the 
economy such as the metal- working and elec -
trical engineering industry, the main construc -tion industry and the chemicals industry there -
fore agreed perceptibly higher wage increases 
in this year’s wage round than in the previous 
negotiated wage adjustment. The agreements, 
which will run for more than two years in some 
cases, specify large wage increases at the be -
ginning of the agreement, but often markedly 
lower phased increases in the later stages.
With economic growth still above potential 
and given pronounced labour market tight -
ness, even higher wage rises are likely in future 
negotiated wage agreements in the years 
covered by the projection than in 2018. The 
fact that the phased wage increases that will 
enter into force in the next two years based on 
the collective agreements reached in this year’s 
wage round are low (or wholly absent) will, 
however, dampen average growth rates. Nego -
tiated wages will therefore rise no faster in 
2019 and 2020, at 2.8% in each case, than in 
2018.12 In 2021, the dampening effect of the

will cease, and annual average growth in nego -
tiated wages should accelerate considerably.
With labour shortages increasing, actual earn -
ings are likely to rise even more than negoti -
ated wages over the period covered by the 
projection – as has been the case for some 
years now. Factors contributing to this positive 
wage drift are that employees’ average work -
ing hours are expected to rise as are compen -
sation components that exceed collectively 
agreed rates and performance- based bonuses 
for staff. Next year, it is likely to be somewhat 
dampened by the return to full joint financing 
of the statutory health insurance. The higher 
labour costs this will entail could cause enter -
prises to be slower to expand wages and bene -
fits that exceed wage agreements. In 2020, by 
contrast, the comparatively moderate annual 
average increases in negotiated wages suggest 
a particularly large wage drift. From a macro -
economic perspective, the increases in the 
statutory minimum wage in 2019 and 2020 are expected to exert only very little upward pres -
sure on average wages.
As for actual earnings, compensation per em -
ployee, which additionally contains employers’ 
social security contributions, will rise sharply 
over the projection horizon. The return to full 
joint financing of the statutory health insurance 
will be reflected in a one- off spike in the cost of 
labour in 2019. The cut to the contribution rate 
to unemployment insurance and the simultan -
eous increase in the contribution rate to the 
public long- term care insurance scheme at the 
beginning of 2019 will largely cancel each 
other out. Growth in unit labour costs, which is 
accelerating considerably this year, not least as 
a result of weak productivity growth,13 is likely 
to slow as productivity growth is expected to 
recover fairly rapidly. Nonetheless, it is likely to 
remain strong throughout the projection hori -
zon.
The recent spike in unit labour costs was re -
flected only partially in domestic inflation as 
measured by the GDP deflator, because it was 
associated with perceptibly lower profit mar -
gins at the macroeconomic level. However, the 
expected normalisation of the growth of unit 
labour costs and the good economic condi -
tions throughout the projection horizon sug -
gest that enterprises will gradually increasingly 
pass on rising labour costs to consumers. This 
should allow margins to recover to a large ex -
tent. As a result, growth in the GDP deflator 
will accelerate considerably over the projection 
horizon. One key reason for the strong domes -
tic inflation is the booming construction sector, 
where already very high price momentum is ini -
tially expected to accelerate yet further.
Consumer prices rose considerably in the 
second and third quarters of 2018. Having ini -

13 Weak productivity growth reflects the fact that eco -
nomic output is expanding distinctly more slowly than in 
2017 – in part because of the recent temporary production 
stoppages in the automotive industry – whilst employment 
is not losing much momentum.Deutsche Bundesbank

pressed in the June projection, they rose unex -
pectedly sharply from September onwards. In 
November, the Harmonised Index of Consumer 
Prices (HICP) rose 2.2% on the year, 0.4 per -
centage point more than forecast in the June 
projection. This was largely attributable to the 
surprisingly steep increase in energy prices. 
Food prices also rose much faster than antici -
pated. This is likely in part the result of the ex -
ceptionally hot and dry weather, which was 
reflected in higher agricultural producer prices. 
Inflation excluding the volatile energy and food 
components (the core rate) was slightly lower 
than anticipated, however. Services prices, in 
particular, rose more slowly than projected. 
This was the result, amongst other things, of 
the partial abolition of fees for day care facil -
ities for small children in a number of federal 
states in August, which had a fairly strong im -
pact in terms of dampening prices. However, 
the increase in rents and prices for other ser -
vices was also slightly smaller than expected. 
By contrast, prices for industrial goods exclud -
ing energy rose more sharply than forecast in 
June despite hefty rebates on clothing. This can 
probably be attributed in part to the depreci -
ation of the euro against the US dollar and the 
perceptible inflation that this is likely to have 
caused for imports, which are frequently in -
voiced in US dollars.
According to this projection, the core rate will 
increase significantly from 1.2% this year to 
1.8% in 2020, and may even go up further still 
in 2021.14 The high – and rising – degree of ag -
gregate capacity utilisation as well as persist -
ently strong growth in unit labour costs are 
likely to accelerate the increase in the price of 
goods (excluding energy and food) and services 
in the coming years. Higher import prices will 
also push up prices.15
However, the price of energy, which is still cur -
rently making a major contribution to the 
headline inflation rate, is likely to edge up only 
slightly over the projection horizon. Assump -
tions attribute this to falling crude oil prices. In 
2019, food prices are set to temporarily rise at only a moderate rate as it is assumed that agri -
cultural producer prices will stop adding to cost 
pressure. However, in 2020, sharp wage 
growth will make an impact in this area, too.
With regard to headline inflation, two oppos -
ing trends are apparent. While core inflation is 
set to rise, on the one hand, there is an as -
sumption that crude oil prices will fall, on the 
other. According to this projection, HICP head -
line inflation will initially fall from 1.9% in 2018 
to 1.4% in 2019 due to the sharp slowdown in 
energy price inflation, before then returning to 
1.8% in 2020, due especially to growth in the 
core rate. Headline inflation could well stay put 
in 2021.
Public finances
In 2018, the general government surplus will 
rise significantly from an already high level of 
1% of GDP in 2017 and may even attain around 
2% of GDP . This improvement has been driven 
by dynamic growth in social contributions and 
above all taxes, where growth even outpaced 
that of the macroeconomic reference variables. 
On the expenditure side, there is no nuclear 
fuel tax repayment to be made, unlike in 2017. 
A further decline in unemployment and falling 
interest expenditure are also providing relief. 
Overall, despite the greater uptake of guaran -
tees by HSH Nordbank, expenditure has been 
rising at only a moderate pace. The structural 
(i.e. after adjustment for cyclical and specific 
one- off effects) surplus is also likely to increase 
again.Consumer

14 On average for 2018, the upturn has thus been inter -
rupted, partly due to one- off effects. However, the core 
rate was already back up somewhat of late, despite having 
been dampened temporarily in November by a fall in pack -
age holiday prices.
15 The proposed infrastructure levy will still raise the core 
rate in 2020 slightly despite the compensating motor ve -
hicle tax relief for residents. The HICP is based on the do -
mestic concept, which means that domestic expenditure 
by non- residents is included in the basket of goods and is 
taken into account when measuring inflation.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
December 2018  
29

A marked decline in the surplus is projected for 
next year. In the years thereafter, after factor -
ing in the corresponding measures (see p. 21), 
it will then slip only slightly to around 1¼% of 
GDP . Public finances will continue to reap the 
benefits of a healthy economy, falling interest 
expenditure and the end of burdens from pri -
vatising HSH Nordbank. However, strains else -
where will have a greater impact. The social 
security funds as well as the various levels of 
government will notably increase spending on 
many areas. The agreed tax cuts will also weigh 
on public finances. However, they will not di -
minish the structural revenue ratio by much 
due, not least, to tax progression.
In comparison with the baseline of this projec -
tion, the Federal Government agreed to a more 
substantial easing of fiscal policy, without spe -
cifying in greater detail what shape this may 
take. The coalition agreement thus contains 
not only additional priority projects, such as a 
partial abolition of the solidarity surcharge, but also envisages making use of any additional 
finan cial leeway. Such leeway does indeed exist 
in the baseline, which still reports clear struc -
tural surpluses and swelling reserves. Overall, 
state and local government would likewise 
post relatively high surpluses. It thus appears 
logical to take further measures and bring 
down the surpluses by a greater amount.
The debt ratio is likely to decline rapidly over 
the entire projection horizon. It may fall below 
the reference value of 60% agreed in the EU in  
2018 already (end-2017: 63.9%) – for the first 
time since 2002 – aided by both budget sur -
pluses recorded by the various levels of govern -
ment and increasing nominal GDP growth 
in  the ratio’s denominator. Furthermore, 
government- owned bad banks are expected to 
continue deleveraging their portfolios and re -
paying debt.
Risk assessment
The projection presented here outlines the 
most probable macroeconomic scenario for the 
German economy from today’s perspective 
under the assumptions given. However, uncer -
tainty relating to the macroeconomic outlook is 
high, although it has tended to ease somewhat 
since the June projection. Various develop -
ments that are not included in the baseline 
scenario may cause actual economic activity 
and consumer prices to differ from the projec -
tions. Overall, the downside risks for economic 
growth and – to a lesser extent – for the infla -
tion rate, which still stem above all from the 
external environment, are higher than the pos -
sibility of greater growth momentum and price 
dynamics resulting, in particular, from the fact 
that fiscal policy in Germany is likely to follow 
an even more expansionary course.
The debate started by the United States on fu -
ture international trade relations has not inten -
sified any further of late. In fact, there have 
been a number of signs of easing tensions in 
recent months in the form of new trade agree -Expansionary

ments. However, there is still an elevated risk of 
growing protectionism worldwide which could 
perceptibly impair Germany’s export- oriented 
economy. The threat of a disorderly Brexit has 
not been averted, either. If the United Kingdom 
were to withdraw from the European Union 
without a transitional phase and a free trade 
agreement, this would cause severe disruptions 
to the financial sector and the real economy. In 
addition, economic activity in Germany would 
face further downside risks arising from the 
international environment should geopolitical 
tensions intensify in regions such as the Middle 
East. Moreover, uncertainty in connection with 
the direction of the Italian government’s fiscal 
and European policy could lead to turmoil on 
the financial markets and hamper real eco -
nomic growth. This could have a negative im -
pact on the banking system and trigger conta -
gion in other euro area countries.
With regard to the domestic economy, the op -
portunities for greater economic growth would 
appear to outweigh the risks at this point. 
There is a certain risk that the problems experi -
enced by the German automotive industry in 
adjusting to the new procedure for measuring 
emissions may last for longer than expected. It 
is also possible that continuing discussions 
about banning older diesel vehicles in several 
German cities, for instance, may have curbed 
demand for motor vehicles to a greater degree 
than assumed here. However, the information 
currently available suggests that such a scen -
ario is not very probable. It is more likely that 
fiscal policy will provide added impetus. Not all 
of the Federal Government’s fiscal policy inten -
tions have yet been factored into the projec -
tion. In addition, both the current position of 
Germany’s general government, as well as the 
medium- term outlook, are so favourable that 
additional expansionary measures do indeed 
look likely.

have a major impact on the consumer price 
projection in particular. The price of crude oil 
has fallen significantly (see p. 20) since the date 
on which the assumptions for the projection 
were made. Thus, at present, risks for the infla -
tion rate are skewed to the downside, for 2019 
in particular. But aside from these short- term 
developments, upside and downside risks are 
currently broadly balanced. On the one hand, 
sharper US sanctions on Iran and political ten -
sion in major oil-  producing countries, such as 
Venezuela, could push up the price of crude 
oil. On the other hand, risks of a weaker global 
economy suggest that the price may come 
down.
Risks for the expected headline rate of infla -
tion, too, are slightly to the downside. Higher 
tariffs are likely to temporarily exert additional upward pressure on inflation. The more expan -
sionary stance of fiscal policy Germany is ex -
pected to take is another factor which could 
well put additional upward pressure on prices. 
However, weaker global or domestic demand 
for goods would continue to ease the rate of 
inflation beyond the dampening effect on the 
oil price. One final source of considerable un -
certainty for the statistically measured inflation 
rate will be the transition to a new weighting 
scheme for the HICP in 2019. This will particu -
larly affect major components of the consumer 
price index, such as rents and package holi -
days, where the transition will mean methodo -
logical changes in the measurement of prices. 
However, it is currently not clear whether these 
statistical changes will have a positive or a 
negative impact.Given oil price,

German enterprises’ profitability and 
financing  in 2017
In keeping with the extremely favourable overall economic environment in 2017, non- financial 
corporations were once again able to improve on their very strong profitability of the preceding 
year. Sales grew much more strongly than in the previous five years, driven by lively demand on 
the sales markets at home and abroad as well as by price effects. In the reporting year, the 
increases in sales revenues are likely to have been caused by volume and price effects in equal 
measure, as prices for goods and services rose roughly half as much as sales. Moreover, the 
widespread upturn in aggregate economic activity in the reporting year was reflected in the 
strong sales growth observed across a broad range of sectors. Despite the first rise in procure -
ment prices in several years and the additional pension provisions made necessary by the further 
decline in the discount rate, enterprises’ average pre- tax returns in the reporting year reached 
their highest level since the record high in 2007.
The equity ratio of non- financial enterprises, which had been rising sharply since the end of the 
1990s, increased only moderately in the major sectors of the economy in 2017. The fact that the 
most recent growth was below the average for the last two decades could indicate saturation 
tendencies not only in the equity bases of large enterprises in particular, but lately of smaller and 
medium- sized enterprises, too. After the lull in the previous year caused by the extension of the 
reference period used to calculate the discount rate, the discount rate- related increase in pension 
provisions was up again in 2017. Overall, provisions remained largely constant, however, owing 
to one- off effects in other provisions in the energy and automotive sectors.
Internal financing in 2017 remained at the high level seen in the last few years. External financing, 
meanwhile, expanded strongly, not least due to the additional liabilities to affiliated companies. 
Moreover, it is worth noting that enterprises also raised their liabilities to banks considerably for 
the first time again after the subdued activity of the preceding years. These developments were 
also linked to a rise in the enterprises’ need for financing for their ongoing efforts to expand by 
acquiring other long- term equity investments. Thus, the long- term trend persisted of enterprises 
increasing the share of financial assets on their balance sheets, thereby reducing tangible assets.
With the continued favourable, albeit less dynamic, underlying economic environment, the prof -
itability of non- financial enterprises in 2018 is likely to have remained advantageous. Neverthe -
less, a similarly high level of sales growth to that of 2017 is not to be expected given the more 
subdued growth dynamic on the demand side and the group accounts available for the current 
year.Deutsche Bundesbank

Underlying trends
Germany’s economic boom continued apace in 
2017 – driven, amongst other things, by buoy -
ant foreign demand. Investment in machinery 
and equipment also gained considerable mo -
mentum. Together with the ongoing brisk pri -
vate consumption and the prevailing high level 
of construction investment, this contributed to 
real gross domestic product expanding more 
strongly than in the preceding year, at 2.5%. 
The rate of growth was thus again higher than 
that of potential output. This resulted in the 
positive output gap from the previous year 
widening even further, and the utilisation rate of macroeconomic capacities rose to a high 
level. Against the backdrop of this vigorous 
global activity, however, headwinds came in 
the shape of price increases for industrial raw 
materials and intermediate goods. Wage 
growth per employee was also slightly higher 
in the corporate sector than in the previous 
year, even though it remained moderate when 
measured in terms of the increasing domestic 
bottlenecks on the supply side of the labour 
market. On balance, the extremely favourable 
economic environment enabled enterprises to 
augment both their sales and their profitability 
considerably.1 At 4.8%, pre- tax sales returns 
achieved their highest level since the peak fig -
ure in 2007. After comparatively moderate 
rates in previous years, sales growth in the re -
porting year also stood within the range of val -
ues seen during the expansion phase prior to 
the start of the Great Recession of 2008-09.2
The equity ratio of non- financial enterprises 
continued to rise moderately in 2017 in almost 
all major sectors of the economy. The trend of 
increasing the own funds position of retained 
profits likely reflects the efforts of enterprises to 
expand their future scope for decision-  making 
and to ensure stable distributions even in years 
of low profitability. In the reporting year – as in 
the year before – the rise in own funds was 
below the historical average, despite the ex -
tremely favourable level of profitability and 
comparatively low adjustments to occupational 
pensions, suggesting that enterprises’ capital Extremely

1 The analysis for 2017 is based on some 21,000 financial 
statements, which were roughly extrapolated based on the 
evaluation of aggregate sales data from the company 
register. For details on the current procedure, see Deutsche 
Bundesbank, Financial statements statistics with broader 
sectoral coverage and a new basis of extrapolation, 
Monthly Report, December 2011, pp. 32-33.
2 One- off effects relating to the new accounting rules 
under the German Accounting Directive Implementation 
Act ( Bilanzrichtlinie-  Umsetzungsgesetz  – BilRUG) had an 
impact on the way sales were reported in the financial 
statements for the 2016 financial year, with the result that 
sales growth was marginally higher than without the new 
rules. In the reporting year, this only affected those enter -
prises whose financial year starts during rather than at the 
beginning of the year. See Deutsche Bundesbank, German 
enterprises’ profitability and financing in 2016, Monthly

bases are gradually approaching saturation.3 
With regard to the size of the enterprises, 
smaller and medium- sized enterprises con -
tinued to expand their equity ratios, falling only 
two percentage points behind those of large 
enterprises, whose equity ratios, meanwhile, 
appear to have stabilised, remaining essentially 
unchanged since 2014. This could be con -
nected to a certain extent to the sharp rise in 
long- term provisions in recent years, which be -
came necessary for large enterprises in particu -
lar.4
The average discount rate for the valuation of 
long- term provisions such as post- employment 
benefit obligations fell by 0.3 percentage point 
in 2017 compared to the end of the previous 
year on account of the multi- year smoothing 
mechanism. While the longer- term interest rate 
was up slightly in 2017 in line with the zero-  
coupon euro swap curve, which forms the 
basis for the discount rate, the interest rate 
level of 2007, which fell out of the ten- year 
average, was well above that of 2017. In 2016, 
the average discount rate rose for the first time 
since the changes that took place under the 
Act to Modernise Accounting Law ( Bilanz -
rechtsmodernisierungsgesetz  – BilMoG) in 
2009, because legislators had extended the 
reference period for calculating the average 
discount rate from seven to ten years.5 As ex -
pected, the increase in pension provisions, in -
cluding assets which are offset against pension 
obligations, was again higher in 2017 than in 
the previous year, while still remaining below 
the figures for the years 2012 to 2015. For the 
current year, the need for adjustment due to 
the discount rate is likely to be larger than in 
the reporting year given the marked decrease 
in the discount rate this year so far.
In 2017, the inflow of funds to non- financial 
enterprises grew significantly, while internal 
finan cing remained largely constant thanks to 
the injection of external funds. A key factor in 
this was the expansion of liabilities to affiliated 
companies which, given the funding volumes, 
likely also involved foreign financing subsidiar -ies to a substantial degree. It is worth noting 
that the enterprises again also incurred signifi -
cantly more liabilities to banks, especially with 
short- term maturities, following the subdued 
developments of the preceding years. Enter -
prises used the increased inflow of funds pri -
marily to acquire new long- term equity invest -
ments, the amount of which returned to the 
2014 and 2015 levels after the dip in 2016. In 
addition to the formation of financial assets, 
enterprises also stepped up their formation of 
non- financial assets. Construction projects that 
had been started but not completed – which 
are recorded under inventories – played a sig -
nificant role in this regard.
The total number of corporate insolvencies fell 
in 2017 for the eighth year in succession, reach -
ing an all- time low since the new Bankruptcy 
Act was passed in 1999. The number of cases 
has therefore almost halved compared to the 
last peak in 2003. Besides the favourable finan -
cing and debt restructuring conditions, the fact 
that enterprises have a sound capital base and 
a stable cash flow is likely to have been a factor 
here.6 While there was no further drop in the 
number of defaulting enterprises in the manu -
facturing sector, insolvencies were down in all 
other economic sectors in 2017. The decline in 
the construction sector, in transportation and 
storage and in hotel and restaurant services 
was especially pronounced, though looking at 
the economy as a whole, these sectors still 
have a comparatively high insolvency rate. The Further interest-

decline in the other services sectors levelled 
out, however.
Sales and income
At slightly over 5%, the rise in sales reported by 
non- financial enterprises in 2017 represented 
the strongest rise to occur during the current 
upturn since 2011. However, sales growth had 
been exceptionally high that year owing to 
catch- up effects during the economic recovery 
that followed the 2008-09 recession. Never -
theless, even during the expansion phase that 
preceded the Great Recession, only 2006 ex -
perienced higher sales growth. In the reporting 
year, the increases in sales revenues are likely to 
have been attributable to volume and price ef -
fects in equal measure, as prices for goods and 
services rose roughly half as much as sales. For 
example, domestic prices of manufactured 
goods went up by 2.7% and foreign trade 
prices climbed moderately by 1.7% compared 
to 2016. In the reporting year, the growth in 
volume is likely to have been more or less as 
high as in the preceding year, when it rose 
against the backdrop of price concessions by 
enterprises on domestic and foreign sales mar -
kets.
A broad- based upswing characterised the re -
porting year, which was reflected in positive 
sales growth across all sectors of the economy. 
Import prices rose moderately by 2.1%, mean -
ing that the sectors that are more heavily inte -
grated into international value chains also saw 
their sales rise. In manufacturing, for instance, 
the metal- working industry grew especially 
strongly. The large- scale price increases for in -
dustrial metals are likely to have played an im -
portant role in this context.7 Sales in inter -
national wholesale trade (excluding motor ve -
hicles) also rose sharply following relatively 
sluggish growth the year before. Moreover, Strongest sales

non- financial corporations in the business ser -
vices sector also managed to exceed marginally 
the high level of sales growth from the previ -
ous year. By contrast, motor vehicle sales were 
up only moderately after increasing strongly 
one year earlier. However, this below- average 
growth in sales of motor vehicles is probably to 
be explained by sector- specific causes, espe -
cially the emissions scandal.
With regard to enterprises’ other income, in -
come from other long- term equity investments, 
which was just over one-  fifth higher in the 
report ing year, continued the upward trend 
that has persisted since around the start of the current upturn. As a result, the return expect -
ations, which were linked to the increased 
activity  in the acquisition of participating inter -
ests in previous years, are likely to have been 
met at least in part. By contrast, non- financial 
corporations’ interest income, like the average 
rate of interest paid on their assets, has re -
mained at more or less the same low level since 
2013. Furthermore, other operating income re -
corded another marked decline, which was 
somewhat smaller than the preceding year,

The total expenditure of non- financial corpor -
ations experienced 5% growth in the reporting 
year, which was almost as steep as the increase 
in total income. The growth in the largest item, 
cost of materials, was especially strong at 6%, 
after having virtually stagnated since 2012. 
Appar  ently, the buoyant demand on the sales 
markets meant that, in 2017, enterprises were 
not anxious to offset the effects of the prices 
for raw materials and intermediate goods, 
which had risen for the first time in a long 
while, on their cost of materials by reducing their input volumes. For example, the steep rise 
in industrial metal prices prompted a significant 
increase in the cost of materials in the metal-  
working industry. The cost of materials rose 
almost  as steeply in the business services sec -
tor, the chemicals industry and the food indus -
try. Volume effects are likely to have prevailed 
in the food industry in particular, as the raw 
material prices for food and beverages fell

hand, the cost of materials rose comparatively 
moderately in the motor vehicle trade.
The second largest expenditure item, personnel 
expenses, saw a growth rate of 4½%, which 
was somewhat higher than the average of 
recent  years. The sharp rise in employment is 
likely to have played a key role given the mod -
erate wage dynamics. The relatively high in -
creases in employment in the information and 
communication sector and in the business ser -
vices sector thus led to above- average growth 
in personnel expenses. Moreover, the further 
reduction in the discount rate for long- term 
provisions probably also contributed slightly to this rise. Only some enterprises report the 
interest-  related increase in pension liabilities 
under personnel expenses, while others record 
it under interest expenditure, meaning that the 
negative effect of provisions was felt in both 
accounts in the reporting year. In the case of 
personnel expenses, however, this effect had 
only a limited impact on the growth rate due to 
the relatively large size of the other items under 
this cost heading. By contrast, the decrease in 
the reference interest rate and the steep rise in 
liabilities resulted in a fairly sharp increase of 
8½% in the relatively small “interest expend -
iture” cost item.Clear growth in

The relatively weak growth in other expenses in 
the year under review was also attributable to 
trailing effects from the changes brought about 
by the German Accounting Directive Imple -
mentation Act to the detriment of other oper -
ating expenses and in favour of cost of mater -
ials. In addition, the recording of excise taxes 
on manufacture of food products and bever -
ages and tobacco products was scrapped on 
account of the German Accounting Directive

Owing to a heightened level of business activ -
ity, enterprises’ pre- tax returns on sales im -

est figure since 2007 – the peak of the previous 
upswing. In view of the burden from the con -
tinued decrease in the discount rate, the profit -
ability of non- financial enterprises without the 
effect of these provisions is likely to have risen 
somewhat more strongly in the reporting year. 
Excluding transport equipment, pre- tax returns 
on sales climbed from 4.7% in 2016 to 4.9% in 
the reporting year. Even without the contribu -
tion from transport equipment, the similarly 
high and slightly rising return indicates that, at 
the very least, the impact of car manufacturers’ 
financial burdens from the emissions scandal 
on the profitability of non- financial enterprises 
in Germany was limited. However, based on 
the information available, it is difficult to quan -
tify the spillover effects from potential value 
added losses experienced in this sector.
Sources and uses of funds
In 2017, the volume of funds raised by enter -
prises was up by around one- quarter, the main 
reason being the considerable jump in external 
financing. The significant build- up of liabilities 
and the simultaneous increase in capital injec -
tions was also linked to the renewed brisk 
acqui sition of enterprises’ other long- term 
equity investments. In this context, short- term 
and long- term liabilities were accumulated in 
equal measure. By contrast, internal financing 
remained at the high level seen in the preced -
ing years. Owing to one- off effects, enterprises 
in 2017 formed virtually no new provisions on 
balance. In statistical terms, this was offset by 
the increase in funds stemming from the cap -
ital injection from profits and contributions to 
the capital of non- corporations.
As in the previous two years, enterprises used 
around 60% of their funds for expenditure on 
non- financial asset formation. The increase in 
gross tangible fixed assets was relatively sharp 
in 2017. This was, however, also due to higher 
depreciation and a substantial rise in intangible 
assets in the chemical and pharmaceutical Low growth in

sector  , which was probably linked to corporate 
acquisitions. The significant change in inventor -
ies was mainly attributable to the construction 
sector, where unfinished buildings not yet 
recorded  as sales resulted in a very high volume 
of inventories being reported compared with 
other sectors.
In the reporting year, the acquisition of finan -
cial assets accounted for a larger share of the 
use of funds than in previous years. After a 
decline   in the previous year, the acquisition of 
other long- term equity investments in 2017 re- 
attained the high level of 2014 and 2015. This 
was essentially down to large enterprises in the 
manufacture of transport equipment. Com -
pared with the depressed level one year earlier, 
transport equipment manufacturers tripled 
their acquisition of other long- term equity in -
vestments, setting a new all- time high. Com -
panies in the energy sector likewise expanded 
their equity investment considerably on the 
year. However, compared with previous years, 
the increase of liquid funds in the form of cash 
slowed markedly, suggesting a sufficient level 
of liquidity as a result of the precautionary 
measures taken over the past few years.
Balance sheet developments
In line with the vigorous sales growth, total 
assets continued to rise at a somewhat higher 
rate in 2017. This was supported by enterprises’ 
continuous efforts to expand, which, in add -
ition to an increase in long- term equity invest -
ments, was accompanied by a major boost in 
both short and long- term financial assets and 
liabilities to affiliated companies. In this con -
text, another sharp increase in trade payables 
and receivables was observed. The marked 
growth in payments received on account of 
orders was almost exclusively attributable to 
the construction sector, with these payments 
likely to be linked to the high level of inventor -
ies in this sector.Highly dynamic

Following the subdued developments of the 
preceding years, enterprises in 2017 stepped 
up their liabilities to credit institutions. This was 
probably related to the increased need for ex -
ternal financing for the high level of activity in 
the acquisition of other long- term equity in -
vestments. However, the share of obligations 
to the banking sector in total liabilities re -
mained stable. Moreover, enterprises entered 
mainly into short- term liabilities to credit insti -
tutions, indicating that those funds were pri -
marily needed for bridging purposes. In add -
ition, the trend increase in acquiring funds 
through corporate bonds continued.9The persistently low level of interest rates again 
facilitated a marked increase in pension provi -
sions in 2017. In the previous year, a temporary 
decline in pension provisions was recorded in 
the balance sheet as the reference period for 
calculating the discount rate had been ex -
tended and because the assets which were off -
set against pension liabilities had gone up on 
balance. Since the introduction of the Act to 
Modernise Accounting Law in 2009, enter -
prises can reduce the pension provisions they 
report by setting aside own assets for occupa -
tional pension schemes and offsetting these 
against total pension obligations. Given that 
enterprises have increasingly made use of this 
option ever since, the growth in pension provi -
sions in the balance sheet has been significantly 
weaker than that in “unnetted” – i.e. where 
there is no offsetting – pension obligations.
Provisions as a whole remained unchanged as 
the increase in pension obligations was bal -
anced out by a decrease in other provisions. 
This was due, for the most part, to the re-  
pricing of provisions for nuclear energy waste 
disposal in accordance with the statutory re -
organisation of the financial responsibility 
shared by central government and enterprises 
for disposing of radioactive waste. The other 
provisions of the automotive industry were per -
ceptibly lower, one of the reasons for this prob -
ably being the payments already made in con -
nection with the diesel scandal. Given that the 
net decline in provisions was relatively low con -
sidering the volume of payments made, auto -
motive groups appear to have built up new 
provisions as well.
Although the increase in non- financial invest -
ment was significant in 2017, it continued, as in 
previous years, to fall short of total asset 
growth. Besides the expansion in intangible Significant

9 The fact that the share of bonds in total assets remains 
relatively low is, amongst other things, due to bonds often 
being issued via foreign financing entities and that intra-  
group funding is, in this case, recorded under obligations 
to affiliated enterprises. The actual volume of funding gen -

Net assets, fi  nancial position and results of operations of 
listed German non- fi  nancial groups in 2017
2017 was a very successful business year for 
German groups. The profi  tability of the 
around 230 German non- fi  nancial groups 
listed in the Prime Standard segment im-
proved considerably again compared with 
the previous year. For example, the return 
on sales rose by 1.7 percentage points to 
8.4% – the highest level since the start of 
the survey in 2007. More than half of these 
groups recorded an increase in this ratio. 
Groups specialising in the industrial sector, 
in particular, raised their return on sales 
substantially to 8.0%, thereby reducing the 
gap vis- à- vis groups in the services sector 
noticeably, where profi  tability rose to 9.5%.
Compared with the enterprises included in 
the separate fi  nancial statement statistics, 
German groups are more dependent on 
global demand given their international 
focus. According to the annual reports, the 
groups participated in the lively economic 
growth with a strong increase in sales both 
in the advanced and the emerging market 
economies in 2017. Meanwhile, the appre-
ciation of the euro had a slightly dampen-
ing effect, which results from sales gener-
ated by subsidiaries reporting in foreign cur-
rency being translated into euros.1 Overall, 
aggregate sales rose by 5.2% on the year. 
Groups in the industrial sector, including in 
particular the automotive sector, benefi  ted 
from the exceptionally positive conditions 
on the sales markets and reported above- 
average growth (+5.5%).
The increase in sales was accompanied by 
even stronger growth in earnings. Operat-
ing profi  t before depreciation and amortisa-
tion (EBITDA) and operating profi  t (EBIT) 
grew by 14.5% and 33.2% respectively, 
rates not seen since the end of the most 
recent recession in 2010. Most of this devel-opment is attributable to the groups in the 
industrial sector. Volkswagen AG, in par-
ticular, benefi  ted from market- related cost 
savings and reduced provisioning in con-
nection with the emissions scandal totalling 
around €4.5 billion. Moreover, the need for 
write- downs fell signifi  cantly in the energy 
sector as compared with the previous year.
German groups’ assets saw fairly moderate 
growth as compared to previous years, at 
just under 1.4%. This was mainly the result 
of slight increases in cash and cash equiva-
lents, trade receivables and fi  xed assets.
On the fi  nancing side, the maturities on 
fi  nancial  liabilities were longer, while their 
total volume was slightly lower. In 2017, 
asset gains were increasingly funded from 
own funds. As a result, the aggregate 
equity ratio rose markedly by 3.2 percent-
age points to 31.6%. This was mainly due 
to the retention of substantially higher net 
income, with motor vehicle manufacturers 
in particular recording strong growth. In 
addition, capital increases helped lift the 
equity ratio.2
Since German enterprises make commit-
ments to occupational pension schemes 
more frequently than fi  rms in other Euro-
pean countries, pension provisions have a 
key role to play in developments in liabil-
ities. Pension- related valuation changes 
have a heightened impact on the equity 
ratio through the substitution of debt and

equity.3 According to international account-
ing standards, pension claims are dis-
counted to their present value using a plain 
interest rate as at the closing date. At the 
end of 2017, the discount rate for 15- year 
maturities had risen by around 0.2 percent-
age point to just over 1.9% as compared 
with the previous year.4 This was a large 
factor in the drop in pension provisions by 
around €20 billion.5
Gains from fair value changes in cash fl  ow 
hedges reported by several large groups 
also had a positive impact on the level of 
equity. By contrast, currency translation dif-

assets, this was attributable to the steady accu -
mulation of tangible fixed assets and the sig -
nificant stocking up of inventories in the con -
struction sector. By contrast, as in the previous 
year, the information and communication sec -
tor saw a sharp decline induced by write-  
downs. Mirroring the share of non- financial 
assets, financial assets grew proportionally in 
the reporting year. The trend towards a higher 
share of long-  term receivables and away from 
short- term receivables persisted, while cash 
holdings waned somewhat.
Trends for 2018
Given the continued favourable, albeit less 
dynamic , underlying economic environment, 
non- financial enterprises are likely to have 
further  expanded their business activity in 
2018. However, a similarly high level of sales 
growth to that of 2017 is not to be expected 
against the backdrop of a more subdued growth dynamic on the demand side, with ex -
ports and private consumption particularly 
affected . In addition, temporary one- off effects 
in the automotive industry in connection with 
the introduction of a new EU- wide standard for 
measuring exhaust emissions may have had a 
dampening impact of sorts on enterprises’ 
overall earnings in the current year. With regard 
to enterprises’ profitability, the rising cost of 
materials and personnel is likely to have pushed 
down the return on sales. For instance, price 
developments for intermediate goods and raw 
materials – except for the sharp decline in oil 
prices since early October 2018 – continued on 
their upward trajectory in the current year after 
bottoming out in 2016. Personnel expenses, 
too, are likely to have risen markedly in 2018 
amidst greater tension in the labour market, 
higher negotiated wages and an increase in 
payroll employment.

off the book value of equity in 2017.6
More than 60% of all groups increased 
their equity ratio. An analysis by sector 
shows that the equity ratios of both groups 
in the industrial sector and those in the ser-
vices sector rose signifi  cantly. The equity 
base of groups in the industrial sector ex-
cluding the energy sector and without 
motor vehicle manufacturers is meanwhile 
almost on a par with that of the services 
sector.7 In addition, the fi  nancial structure 
of the energy sector recovered noticeably 
following the setback one year earlier. This 
can be attributed to the need for fewer 
write- downs and particularly to extraordin-
ary revenues in connection with the reim-
bursement of nuclear fuel tax.6 In the consolidated balance sheet, this item arith-
metically evens out discrepancies in the foreign cur-
rency translation methods used for asset and liability 
items on foreign subsidiaries’ fi  nancial statements re-
ported in foreign currencies.

ations’ profitability and financing situation 
brings with it a higher degree of uncertainty 
than usual. Changes in the basis of consolida -
tion and the first- time application of new inter -
national accounting standards, in particular, 
limit the comparability of the consolidated 
finan cial statements for 2018 with those for 
2017.10 Nevertheless, there are indications that 
enterprises’ profitability probably continued to 
perform very well in 2018. Although the gross 
return on sales reported in the financial state -
ments of listed non-  financial groups available 
to date declined slightly in the first nine months 
of 2018, it was still at an extremely high level. 
The decline was induced, amongst other 
things, by the topic of diesel engines burdening 
car manufacturers. It is not yet possible to esti -
mate the sales growth of groups as a whole because of additions to and removals from cor -
porate sub- sectors, although individual samples 
indicate that sales grew at a lower rate than in 
the previous year.11Slight drop

11 Special factors affect groups’ current balance sheet pat -
tern. Amongst other things, their capital base diminished 
as a result of a large cross- border acquisition in the agro -
chemical industry and due to the financing needs for the 
business volume in the automotive industry amidst, at the 
same time, a build- up of inventories caused by the delays 
in the emissions certification process. The pronounced de -
cline in the tangible fixed asset ratio in the consolidated 
financial  statements for 2018 is based on accounting pro -
cedures – with potentially temporary effects – in connec -
tion with the intended extensive switch in business activ -
ities and other investments in the energy sector, leading to 
a reclassification of balance sheet items on the assets side.Deutsche Bundesbank

Germany’s international investment 
position : amount, profitability and risks of 
cross- border assets
Germany’s net external assets have been growing more or less continuously since the start of this 
millennium. At the end of 2017, Germany had a balance of €1.8 trillion, making it the world’s 
second- largest net creditor in absolute terms, after Japan. In both its size and structure, the devel -
opment of Germany’s international investment position (i.i.p.) has been shaped by a particular 
dynamic over the past ten years – not least due to the impact of the global financial crisis. One 
prominent factor here is the growing significance of financial corporations, which have super -
seded commercial banks as the most important cross- border creditors. This shift has been accom -
panied by an increasing share of securities claims, replacing (unsecuritised) lending as the instru -
ment of choice for cross- border financing.
The risk/ return profile of Germany’s i.i.p. has repeatedly been at the centre of public debate. A 
variety of metrics can be used to assess this, with the results hinging on the measure chosen, the 
instruments being analysed, and the period taken as the basis for the assessment. However, not 
all aspects of external investment can be modelled using simple metrics.
In order to better place the development of Germany’s i.i.p. in the international context, an esti -
mate is made, as part of which factors are identified that can explain the strong growth in Ger -
many’s net external assets. The econometric analysis should also give an indication of the appro -
priateness of Germany’s i.i.p. in view of the structural conditions, and of how sustainable it is in 
the global context. It is shown that the demographic component plays a prominent role in Ger -
many’s net savings.
Germany’s net external assets essentially represent the counterpart to external liabilities in other 
parts of the world and could thus contribute to external imbalances in principle. However, Ger -
many’s external assets indicate unconditional payment obligations of partner countries to a 
limited extent only. By providing equity capital, Germany in fact helps strengthen international risk 
sharing. Looking ahead, enhanced cross- border equity financing brought about by the realisation 
of the European capital markets union may also further boost Germany’s role in stabilising inter -
national relations. Yet there is little scope for policymakers, beyond setting the framework condi -
tions, to directly influence the investment and savings behaviour of private economic agents and 
thus to actively steer the stock of external assets.Deutsche Bundesbank

International capital links: 
a global phenomenon
Germany’s increased financial linkages with 
other countries is part of a process that can be 
observed in many economies. It reflects the im -
pact of reduced capital controls, the liberalisa -
tion of trade in services, the improvement of 
cross- border payment and settlement systems, 
and significantly lower transaction and com -
munication costs thanks to rapidly advancing 
innovation. The result of all this is that many 
economies nowadays have a significantly 
higher degree of financial openness – as meas -
ured by holdings of external assets and liabil -ities in relation to gross domestic product 
(GDP) – than at the beginning of the millen -
nium. In Germany’s case, the figure came to 
456% of GDP at the end of 2017 – markedly 
higher than in the year 2000 (275% of GDP). 
The country also continued to become more 
integrated into global financial markets after 
the financial crisis, but on closer inspection, the 
individual developments were quite mixed.
The United Kingdom’s cross- border asset links, 
for instance, are shaped by London’s singular 
position as a hub for international capital flows, 
as evidenced by the country’s very high exter -
nal assets and liabilities relative to GDP . Looking 
at the United States, its comparatively pro -
nounced level of net external debt – recently 
amounting to around 40% of GDP – reflects 
the US economy’s particular role in the global 
economy in various ways. Factors include the 
special status of the US dollar in the inter -
national monetary system, the size and liquidity 
of US financial markets, and America’s “safe 
haven” function, which greatly influences the 
willingness of international investors to add US 
debt to their portfolios. For its part, Japan is 
likely to have a greater need to build up a posi -
tive net i.i.p. given that its population is already 
ageing at a noticeable pace. As for China, both 
the net i.i.p. and external assets and liabilities 
have risen in absolute terms, but relative to 
GDP some positions saw a decline compared 
with the end of 2007 owing to the gradual 
opening up of the financial markets and strong 
economic growth for many years.
Another important indicator of a country’s fi -
nancial integration into the global economy is 
external investment as a share of total (finan -
cial) assets. The preference investors give to do -
mestic securities plays a material role here. This 
can be modelled by home bias (see the box on 
pp. 50 f.). A higher propensity for cross- border 
investment and increased financial market inte -
gration globally have two effects for individual 
countries: on the one hand, they are less sensi -
tive to developments at home, but on the 
other, financial disruption in other countries Financial inte -

may potentially spill over to the domestic econ -
omy more rapidly. The higher international 
asset and liability positions overall also increase 
the importance of income effects, which may 
arise due to changes in external assets.1
Development of  
Germany’s i.i.p. since the 
global financial crisis
At the end of 2017, Germany’s external assets 
had reached a value of €8.4 trillion. This means 
that they have risen by 60% since the end of 
2007, the last year before the onset of the 
global financial crisis, and have grown twice as 
strongly as Germany’s total financial assets. 
Germany’s liabilities to the rest of the world 
also increased over this period, but much less 
dynamically than assets. These came to around 
€6.6 trillion at the end of 2017. At almost €1.8 
trillion, Germany’s net external assets now 
come to more than half of GDP . This is almost 
three times the figure ten years ago. The global 
financial crisis and the ensuing European debt 
crisis initially led to what were in some cases 
significant declines in international positions. 
On the whole, however, the trend towards 
greater external integration remained intact, 
meaning that international asset and liability 
positions continued to rise.
The growth in net external assets reflects Ger -
many’s current account surpluses over the last 
ten years. From a macroeconomic perspective, 
a current account surplus always goes hand in 
hand with a build- up of net claims on non-  
residents. In addition to these transaction-  
driven changes, which are recorded in the fi -
nancial account, the stock data of the i.i.p. can 
also be affected by valuation changes owing to 
movements in exchange rates and market 
prices as well as by other adjustments.2
Changes in Germany’s external assets can be 
analysed from a variety of angles.3 This article 
will cover asset categories – the i.i.p. distin -
guishes between direct investment, portfolio investment, other investment, financial deriva -
tives and reserve assets – as well as the various 
sectors.
Use of external assets
Looking at direct investment, claims on non-  
residents rose much more sharply than liabil -
ities, which meant that net external assets in 
this category have more than doubled since 
the end of 2007, coming to €546 billion at the 
end of 2017. Germany’s direct investment was 
split roughly evenly between countries inside 
and outside the euro area at the end of 2017. 
Compared with the period prior to the financial 
crisis, then, there has been a slight shift to -
wards partner countries in the euro area. The 
vast majority of German direct investment took 
the form of equity capital. In relative terms, 
however, intra- group lending has gained in im -
portance over the past ten years. On the liabil -
ities side, around 62% of inward direct invest -
ment in Germany came from euro area coun -
tries at the end of 2017, meaning that this 
share is down slightly on the end of 2007. At 
last count, non- resident enterprises provided 
affiliated enterprises in Germany with around 
43% of this inward direct investment in the 
form of equity capital; this was roughly 9 per -
centage points less than at the end of 2007. On 
the liabilities side, too, the share of intra- group 
lending has risen in recent years. This was 
largely attributable to the higher amount of Germany’s 
external assets 
up sharply in 
recent years

External assets and international fi  nancial market 
integration 
The opening of foreign markets and invest-
ment in foreign assets mean that additional 
gains can be made in effi   ciency and welfare 
that would be unfeasible in a closed econ-
omy. Of course, the extent of a country’s 
fi  nancial integration into the global econ-
omy is not simply refl  ected in the amount 
of its net external asset position. One indi-
cator commonly used for this purpose is the 
preference investors give to domestic secur-
ities, which is referred to as “home bias”.1 
In principle, the concept can be applied to 
all external asset positions. Statistical prob-
lems arise when calculating the home bias 
in direct investments and loans, however, 
because the respective reference variables 
– the value of all enterprises worldwide and 
the volume of credit outstanding world-
wide  – are not available. For this reason, 
the home bias for securities, which is rela-
tively easy to determine, is often used as an 
indicator of a given country’s general fi  nan-
cial integration into the world economy. To 
this end, it is possible to differentiate ac-
cording to shares and investment fund 
shares (equity) on the one hand and debt 
securities on the other.
Provided that the markets are competitive, 
all investors have perfect information and 
that these is an absence of transaction 
costs, the international dispersion of secur-
ities ought to be identical in the portfolios 
of all countries and so correspond to the 
regional structure of the securities out-
standing worldwide.2 Home bias indicates 
the extent to which foreign securities held 
by domestic investors are under- represented 
in terms of their weight in the global port-
folio. It is derived  from the share of foreign 
securities in the portfolio of domestic in-
vestors in relation  to their share in the 
global portfolio:3Home Bias = 1 –Share of foreign securities 
in the domestic portfolio
Share of foreign securities 
in the global portfolio
The ratio normally assumes a value of be-
tween zero and one. If the value is zero, the 
composition of the national securities port-
folio corresponds to that of the global port-
folio. A value of one means that domestic 
investors hold only domestic securities in 
their portfolios.4
Over the past years a decline in home bias 
has been observed in many countries, par-
ticularly for equities. The global fi  nancial cri-
sis temporarily halted this trend, but it has 
since resumed. Thus, the fi  nancial integra-
tion of countries has progressed over time. 
The euro area countries generally have a 
lower home bias than Japan, the United 
States or the United Kingdom, for example. 
Most recently, the level of home bias in the 
case of equities in all the above- mentioned 
economies fell back below the fi  gure at the 
end of 2007. In Germany, the home bias 
ratio at the end of 2017 was 0.43, com-
pared with 0.52 ten years earlier. The devel-
opment in respect of debt securities is 
1 Home bias is usually measured on the basis of the 
assets side of the international investment position. A 
two- country model (e.g. Germany and the rest of the 
world) can be used to show that a positive home bias 
in assets also implies, in principle, a positive home bias 
in liabilities and vice versa. To determine fi  nancial mar-
ket integration, it is therefore suffi   cient to look at one 
side of the balance sheet.

International Capital Markets, Journal of Economic 
Theory, Vol. 8, pp. 500-524.
3 The global portfolio is defi  ned as equities or debt 
securities outstanding worldwide. Securities issued by 
entities domiciled outside the respective country are 
designated as foreign securities.
4 In special cases in which foreign securities are over- 
represented in domestic portfolios as measured by 
their market capitalisation, the home bias may also 
take on negative values.Deutsche Bundesbank

mixed by international standards. The tilt in 
Germany in favour of domestic debt secur-
ities declined even more markedly than it 
did for equities, and the home bias receded 
in the same period from 0.56 to 0.42. This 
is all the more remarkable given that the 
Eurosystem’s expanded asset purchase pro-
gramme, taken in isolation, has led to an 
increase in home bias: through its purchases 
of domestic securities, the Bundesbank has 
continuously built up its holdings of Ger-
man securities since the end of 2014. At the 
end of 2017, the Bundesbank reported in its 
balance sheet a stock of securities totalling 
€512 billion held for monetary policy pur-
poses. This was around €462 billion more 
than the corresponding fi  gure as at the 
2014 balance sheet date. Some of these 
secur ities had previously been in the hands 
of foreign investors, with the result that the 
share of German debt securities held in Ger-
many rose due to these transactions.5 How-
ever, this effect on the German home bias 
was largely offset by portfolio shifts by Ger-
man investors who, in recent years, increas-
ingly added foreign securities to their port-
folios in their search for yield. Overall, the 
German home bias for debt securities was 
therefore almost unchanged between the 
end of 2014 and the end of 2017 (+0.01).
5 The Bundesbank purchased not only German secur-
ities under the expanded asset purchase programme, 
however, but also debt securities issued by inter-
national organisations, e.g. ESM bonds, on a small 
scale.Home bias*

lending from foreign subsidiaries to parent en -
terprises in Germany (reverse flows).4
At the end of 2017, Germany’s cross- border 
portfolio investment recorded a surplus of 
€382 billion on balance. Positive territory was 
entered in 2015, for the first time since the 
mid-1980s. As German government bonds are 
considered to be a safe and liquid investment, 
they are usually held by foreign investors on a 
large scale, which means that German secur -
ities liabilities to non-  residents have tradition -
ally exceeded the corresponding claims.5 Under 
the Eurosystem’s public sector purchase pro -
gramme (PSPP), however, the Bundesbank has 
been buying German debt securities issued by 
the public sector, primarily also from non- resi-
dent holders, since March 2015. This damp -
ened the increase in the stock of German se -
curities held abroad over the entire observation 
period from 2007 and reduced the investment 
stock considerably in the last three years.
Since the end of 2007, developments in Ger -
many’s portfolio investment abroad have been 
dominated by the growing stock of long- term 
debt securities. Demand for securities issued by 
non- euro area countries was substantially 
stronger in this period than it was for long-  
term debt securities from other euro area coun -
tries. In the case of foreign shares, too, invest -ors preferred to add equities issued by enter -
prises domiciled outside the euro area to their 
portfolios. However, a notable portion of the 
increase in the value of foreign shares in resi -
dents’ portfolios since 2007 has been ac -
counted for, on balance, by price gains, even 
though the global financial crisis in 2007 and 
2008 did send share prices sharply lower for a 
time.
The strong demand for shares in foreign invest -
ment funds caused a significant increase in the 
stock of these assets in resident investors’ port -
folios compared with the end of 2007.6 The 
vast majority of the fund shares held by Ger -
man investors abroad are in funds established 
in other euro area countries (around 97%) and Portfolio invest -

4 It is often the case that foreign subsidiaries are set up as 
financing vehicles that issue bonds in the international cap -
ital market and channel the proceeds to their domestic par -
ent enterprises in the form of loans.
5 Upon publication of the i.i.p. data for 2017, a methodo -
logical change was made retroactively for the debt secur -
ities on the liabilities side going back to the final quarter of 
2015. While German debt securities held abroad had previ -
ously been cumulated from the balance of payments trans -
action data, non- residents’ holdings are now determined 
using stock data from the Bundesbank’s securities statistics. 
This has resulted in a higher stock of liabilities in this class 
of securities beginning with the fourth quarter of 2015. 
The new calculation method is consistent with the ECB’s 
guidelines. It also offers the advantage of bringing the 
results  of the i.i.p. more closely into line with those of the 
national financial accounts.

marketed in Germany. Fund companies in Lux -
embourg, Ireland and France in particular are 
key providers.
Overall, developments in portfolio investment 
abroad over the past few years reflect the inter -
est in geographical diversification in the Ger -
man portfolio (see also the box on pp. 50 f.). In 
view of the low interest rate environment, the 
search for yield probably also played a material 
role.
In the case of other investment, which includes 
both loans and trade credits (where these do 
not constitute direct investment) as well as 
bank deposits and other investments, the in -
crease on the assets side contrasted with dis -
tinctly higher positions on the liabilities side. 
The net claims on non- residents recorded 
under this position haven risen by a total of 
€84 billion to €691 billion since 2007.
The Bundesbank’s reserve assets have likewise 
made a positive contribution to the net i.i.p. 
over the years; this contribution has experi -
enced a certain degree of fluctuation mainly 
due to valuation adjustments. Financial deriva -
tives have been reported for monetary financial 
institutions (MFIs) since the end of 2010 and 
also for other sectors since the end of 2012. 
They have virtually no impact on the net pos -
ition since they extended both sides of the bal -
ance sheet to roughly the same extent.
Sectors as cross- border actors
Looking at the net international investment 
positions of economic sectors reveals that, in 
the past few years, a large proportion of the 
increasing net external assets was accounted 
for by enterprises and households. At the end 
of 2017, this sector had a positive net i.i.p. of 
€1,939 billion; this was €1,273 billion higher 
than at the end of 2007. More than two- thirds 
of these net assets were held in securities at 
the end of 2017, and around one- quarter was 
attributable to direct investment. The relative importance of portfolio investment in enter -
prises’ net external assets has thus grown con -
siderably over the last ten years. This is primar -
ily due to the increasing role played by financial 
intermediaries such as funds and insurers in 
asset management. These predominantly count 
as “financial corporations excluding monetary 
financial institutions (MFIs)”, which have been 
reported separately since 2012 and which hold 
the vast majority of the net external assets of 
the enterprises and households sector (2017: 
96%).
The net external assets of MFIs (excluding the 
Bundesbank) have shrunk markedly. Develop -
ments in the wake of the financial crisis were a 
decisive factor here, with commercial banks 
providing each other with fewer cross- border 
funds. Other contributors were a general in -
crease in risk aversion in some cases and the 
need to keep balance sheets in alignment with 
higher capital requirements. In the countries hit 
hardest by the crisis, institutions looked more 
to central banks than the interbank markets as 
a source of liquidity.
Accordingly, the Bundesbank’s TARGET2 claims 
on the European Central Bank (ECB), which 
arose from the redistribution of central bank 
money within the Eurosystem, climbed sharply 
during the European debt crisis up until mid-
2012 and –  after an interim decline  – have 
been rising again strongly since the start of 
2015. The current increase is primarily down 
to the Eurosystem’s expanded asset purchase 
programme (APP), as a large number of the 
purchases are being settled via the financial 
centre of Germany, causing central bank money 
to flow into Germany.7 Given the mounting

7 Since the beginning of 2015, the APP has been steadily 
increasing Germany’s TARGET2 claims. Accordingly, the ex -
ternal liabilities of MFIs rose as well. See Deutsche Bundes -

position has also grown markedly since 2007. 
However, there were rising gross liabilities to 
go with the mounting gross claims. Besides de -
posits of foreign central banks and monetary 
authorities, this is partly explained by high li -
abilities stemming from the issuance of euro 
banknotes, which make up nearly half of Ger -
man claims relating to cashless payments via 
TARGET2.8
One item which has been declining over the 
past few years is the general government exter -
nal deficit. It has been gradually shrinking since 
the end of 2014 and stood at €874 billion at 
the end of 2017. The main reason for this was 
the Bundesbank’s large- scale purchases of do -
mestic government debt securities from the 
stocks held by non- residents. There were also 
fewer of these securities in circulation owing to 
falling government debt.9Profitability of German 
external  assets
(Total) return
German investors are sometimes accused of in -
vesting their money inefficiently and thus incor -
rectly. This theory is linked to the return on Ger -
man investment abroad, which is sometimes 
felt to be low.10 A comparison with the return 
on foreign investment in Germany can be used 
as a criterion to judge the legitimacy of this as -
sessment. Alternatively, the average return on 
the total financial assets of German households 
could also be used, or common stock or bond 
indices.11
The return on German investment abroad can 
be determined by presenting a given year’s in -
vestment income, as reported in the current ac -
count, relative to the asset value at the end of 
the preceding year. To calculate the total re -
turn, valuation effects also have to be factored 
in; these can stem from changes in market 
prices and exchange rates.12 It is shown that

11 As external assets are compiled using highly aggregated 
statistics, the calculated returns are averaged in multiple 
ways across instruments, sectors and the time period, and 
therefore any comparison with annual portfolio returns of 
individual investors is severely limited. The same applies to 
the subsequent risk analysis.
12 In the literature, valuation effects are often calculated as 
the difference between the change in the reported external 
assets and the transaction data from the financial account. 
However, this approach is imprecise and can result in con -
siderable deviations, for example due to differing data 
sources being used when compiling the i.i.p. and the bal -
ance of payments. The Bundesbank publishes the detailed 
i.i.p. reconciliation account, giving data on transactions, 
valuation effects  and other adjustments, in Statistical Sup -
plement 3 to the Monthly Report. The data are available

dependent on the asset class in question, but 
also on the period under analysis. As a (geo -
metric) average of the years 2008 to 2017, 
direct  investment generated the highest total 
return (5.2%). This was followed by debt secur -
ities (4.7%), shares and investment fund shares 
(4.5%), and other investment and reserve 
assets (2.2%).13 Shares and investment fund 
shares underperformed debt securities due to 
the impact of the global financial crisis and the 
European debt crisis, which temporarily had a 
distinctly adverse effect on corporate profits 
and stock market performance.14 The average 
total return across all asset classes came to 
3.7% between 2008 and 2017; this was thus 
slightly higher than the return that foreign in -
vestors generated on their German investments 
(3.3%).15 By way of comparison, German 
households recorded an average nominal re -
turn on their total financial assets in the speci -
fied period of just 3.0%. Besides income from 
securities investment, this figure particularly in -
cludes interest income from time deposits and 
transferable deposits and is therefore lower 
than the average annual return of 4.0% that 
investors with a German bond portfolio could 
have achieved.16 However, returns on bonds 
over the period in question were shaped by 
strong price gains brought about by the enor -
mous, and unforeseen, decline in interest rates. 
An investment fund share based on the Ger -man CDAX stock index would have provided 
an average annual return of 5.4%.17

13 A comparison across asset classes only makes sense if 
the total return is used. Unlike with direct investment, re -
invested earnings from shares are not recorded as invest -
ment income in the current account, but are shown as 
valuation effects in the i.i.p. As a result, the return system -
atically understates the actual investment income from se -
curities holdings.
14 In the period between 2012 and 2017, when the peaks 
of the aforementioned crises had passed, German investors 
generated an average annual return of 8.2% on foreign 
shares and investment fund shares, which was significantly 
more than the return on direct investment (5.2%), invest -
ment in foreign debt securities (5.1%) or loans (1.3%).
15 Financial derivatives are excluded from this calculation, 
since they are by nature very heterogeneous and are an 
asset that is difficult to interpret (e.g. swap transactions). 
Moreover, they do not generate investment income. In -
cluding valuation effects for financial derivatives, the aver -
age total return for the period from 2008 to 2017 would 
be 2.9%. Separate data for financial derivatives are only 
available from 2010 onwards, however.

the last ten years, for example, German shares 
have recorded the highest gains. If the different 
maturity and risk profiles are taken into ac -
count, however, the discrepancies are not ex -
ceptional, and German investment abroad cer -
tainly does not underperform comparable in -
vestments at home.18 In any case, any ex post 
analysis of investment income needs to be in -
terpreted with caution, since the uncertainty

can naturally no longer be taken into account   
in retrospect.
In the above calculations, the high percentage 
of German gross external assets attributable to 
the German TARGET2 position of the Bundes -
bank –  which counts towards other invest -
ment – acts to dampen the return on German 
external assets (see the box on p. 57). At €907 
billion, TARGET2 claims at the end of 2017 
made up just under 11% of Germany’s gross 
external assets.19 In this context, it is important 
to note that the high German TARGET2 pos -
ition is not a result of the Bundesbank’s invest -
ment behaviour. Assuming a given level of ex -
ternal portfolio investment, it is solely attribut -
able to the decisions taken by economic agents 
resident in Germany to keep their financial 
assets in a domestic account rather than to in -
vest them elsewhere in the euro area.20 Fur-
thermore, on balance, the accumulation of 
German TARGET2 claims was arguably, for the 
most part, not at the expense of higher yield -
ing investment abroad. In particular, the ac -
counting entries offsetting the increases in Ger -
man TARGET2 claims under the APP were to a 
large extent made under the other investment 
heading and have – if viewed in isolation – led 
to an “extension” of Germany’s external pos -
ition.Risks concerning Germany’s 
international investment 
position 
Income and valuation risk
Another key criterion for the appropriate in -
vestment of Germany’s external assets, along -
side profitability, is the risk arising from foreign 
investment by German economic agents. As 
with asset returns, a distinction can be made 
between income risk and valuation risk. To aid 
comparability across instruments, both of these 
risk aspects need to be viewed relative to the 
total return. A commonly used measure to take 
account of the variation in returns is the Sharpe 
ratio, which shows the average return on an 
asset or portfolio in relation to the standard de -
viation of the return.21 It makes sense to do so, 
since assets with a higher return typically also 
entail a higher level of risk, i.e. a greater disper -
sion of income streams. Taking this reduced 
predictability on board makes it easier to com -
pare the profitability of different types of in -
vestment. That said, adjusting the return using 
the historical standard deviation provides no 
more than a rough estimate for two reasons. 
First, the historical standard deviation does not 
necessarily reflect an asset’s ex ante risk. And

18 The idea that German external assets could simply be 
reallocated into domestic investments fails to recognise the 
mechanics of accounting balances. German external assets 
can only be scaled back, i.e. sold to non- residents, to the 
extent that the latter hold assets in Germany and are will -
ing to part with them. Such a (hypothetical) reallocation 
would presumably entail severe price adjustments. Further -
more, it would only be possible to reduce net external 
assets by running current account deficits or sustaining 
asset losses. Assuming an unchanged level of saving, this 
would require the build- up of a corresponding (real) capital 
stock in Germany through an increase in fixed asset forma -
tion.
19 By the end of November this year, they had grown by a 
further €34 billion to €941 billion.
20 Economic agents resident in Germany also include, for 
example, the German subsidiaries of banks from third 
countries which sold assets to the Eurosystem under the 
APP .
21 The numerator in the Sharpe ratio is the difference be -
tween the actual rate of return and the return on a risk- free 
investment. This is set to zero in the following and there -
fore ignored. There is quite a strong case for simplifying the 
formula in this manner, given the low interest rate environ -
ment over the past years.Deutsche Bundesbank

The remuneration of TARGET2 balances
The remuneration of TARGET2 balances in 
the Eurosystem is linked to the main refi  -
nancing rate, which was lowered to zero in 
March 2016. The Bundesbank accordingly 
shows no interest income from this item in 
its Annual Report for 2017, which also had 
an impact on the return on German exter-
nal assets. With regard to the cross- border 
income fl  ows from monetary policy oper-
ations, however, it would be overly simplis-
tic to calculate the remuneration solely on 
the basis of the investment income shown 
in the current account and the stock data in 
the international investment position. The 
income and expenses of the Eurosystem 
national  central banks stemming from mon-
etary policy operations are pooled at the 
end of the fi  nancial year as monetary in-
come of the Eurosystem and allocated to 
the national central banks according to the 
capital key.1 The differences resulting from 
this distribution compared with the original 
income balances (which may lead to an in-
crease or decrease in the profi  t of the re-
spective national central bank) are recorded 
in the balance of payments as secondary 
income, meaning they are not formally clas-
sifi  ed as investment income.
In this context it is useful to keep in mind 
that, seen from an economic angle, all the 
balance sheet items of the national central 
banks and the ECB that result from monet-
ary policy operations and are subject to 
risk- sharing “belong” to the Eurosystem 
and should therefore be considered in con-
solidated terms. Against this backdrop, it is 
irrele vant which Eurosystem central bank 
conducts monetary policy operations or 
where within the Eurosystem the central 
bank money that has been created is trans-
ferred. For this reason, the intra- Eurosystem 
positions arising from the allocation of cen-tral bank money within the Eurosystem are 
not the key reference variable regarding 
whether or not national central banks ultim-
ately participate in the Eurosystem’s income 
and expenses from monetary policy oper-
ations. This holds true regardless of the 
amount of any interest paid on these pos-
itions. Only the total income and expenses 
generated in the Eurosystem as well as the 
capital key used for distribution are of rele-
vance. Thus, the Bundesbank ultimately 
participates in the income from the refi  nan-
cing operations of the Banca d’Italia or the 
Banque de France, for example, just as 
much as it does in the income from its own 
refi  nancing operations.2
1 In accordance with Article 32.4 of the ESCB Statute, 
income and risks stemming from monetary policy re-
fi  nan cing operations, provided they materialise, are 
shared among the Eurosystem national central banks 
in proportion to the prevailing ECB capital key shares. 
The same also applies to monetary policy asset pur-
chase programmes. Risks and income resulting from 
the covered bonds purchased under the Eurosystem 
programmes CBPP and CBPP2 as well as from the gov-
ernment bonds purchased under the PSPP , on the 
other hand, are borne or are collected, respectively, by 
the individual national central banks holding these 
bonds.
2 The (negative interest- bearing) deposits by credit in-
stitutions and other domestic and foreign depositors 
increased signifi  cantly on account of the APP and the 
liquidity fl  owing from abroad via TARGET2. In the 2017 
fi  nancial year, these played a major part in the Bundes-
bank’s net interest income amounting to just over €4 
billion. The ratio of deposits by credit institutions on 
the Bundesbank’s balance sheet to the total stock 
recorded  on the consolidated balance sheet of the 
Euro system stood at around 33%, which was well 
above the Bundesbank’s capital share of 25.6%. The 
disproportionately high interest income was offset by 
the allocation of the monetary income within the 
Euro system, resulting in a net expense of around €400 
million for the Bundesbank.Deutsche Bundesbank

the standard deviation measured is also influ -
enced to a large extent by the period over 
which it is observed. Second, while the Sharpe 
ratio takes into account investment income 
volatility, it makes no allowances for investors’ 
attitudes to risk, which can vary not only from 
one investor to the next, but also over time.
Measured in terms of the Sharpe ratio, direct 
investment was yet again the best- performing 
form of German investment abroad in the 
period from 2008 to 2017 (Sharpe ratio 1.5). 
Significantly lower values were recorded for 
debt securities (1.1) and other investment (1.0). 
Investment in shares and investment fund 
shares, meanwhile, recorded the worst Sharpe 
ratio of all, at just 0.4, as a result of temporary 
price falls and highly volatile stock prices. How -
ever, the poor performance of this asset class is 
solely attributable to its showing in the first 
four years of the observation period. If this 
period is shortened to the years since 2012, 
shares and investment fund shares register a 
Sharpe ratio of 4.7, making them by far the 
best- performing asset class.
Latent risks
Not all the risks associated with a country’s 
i.i.p. manifest themselves as investment income 
volatility or observable valuation adjustments.22 
This becomes evident when one considers po -
tential balance of payments crises, which often 
come as a result of extensive divestment by for -
eign investors and are characterised by acute 
funding problems among domestic economic 
agents. Having a positive net external position 
when a crisis strikes does not provide blanket 
protection against possible upheavals in gross 
external liabilities, even if a country can gener -
ally be said to be less vulnerable. Cash inflows 
from abroad can just as easily dry up for indus -
trial countries, as the global financial crisis and 
the European debt crisis amply demonstrated. 
How far Germany might also be exposed to 
these risks largely depends on the composition 
of the country’s international liabilities. Key fac -tors in this regard include, in particular, equity 
capital versus debt capital, maturities, and the 
share of liabilities in foreign currency.
Foreign direct investment (FDI), which accounts 
for 21% of German external liabilities, usually 
entails only a low amount of risk from the per -
spective of the host country, since the return 
risk lies with the foreign investor and FDI is usu -
ally made in connection with long- term loca -
tion decisions that are unlikely to be revised in 
the short term. German shares and investment 
fund shares held by non- resident investors con -
stitute a further 11% of German external liabil -
ities. Here, too, the return risk lies with the for -
eign creditors. Furthermore, as equity instru -
ments are non- callable, they count as a long-  
term form of investment. Falling earnings 
prospects or a less favourable risk assessment 
often lead to price corrections, which can im -
pede the affected enterprises’ ability to borrow 
and may also have spillover effects on other 
sectors of the economy. That said, the risks of 
adverse price movements on the stock markets 
and the threat of speculative mispricing are not 
directly related to the proportion of foreign 
shareholders. On the contrary, a wide disper -
sion and international diversification of domes -
tic equities will, if anything, tend to smoothen 
price movements and reduce the impact of 
price corrections on the domestic economy.
One- quarter of German assets in foreign own -
ership are long- term debt securities. Within this 
position, just under 60% are government 
bonds, which also play an important role as a 
form of investment for reserve assets. Here 
again, Germany’s status as a safe haven under -
scores the long- term perspective taken by for -
eign creditors. Bearing this in mind, if shocks 
originating outside Germany hit the global 
economy, this position will tend to reflect, if Return and risk 
profile of assets

consideration

22 On the liabilities side of the i.i.p. there is even what ap -
pears, at first, to be a paradoxical phenomenon, namely 
that a fall in prices as a result of unfavourable develop -
ments in the domestic economy or a decline in the credit 
quality of domestic debtors drives down the market value

anything, counter- cyclical behaviour on the 
part of investors; i.e. the greater the tension in 
global financial markets, the stronger the de -
mand for German government bonds.23 The 
most likely source of risk on the liabilities side 
of Germany’s i.i.p. is under the other invest -
ment heading, the bulk of which is made up of 
currency, deposits and short- term loans. These 
account for around one- third of German exter -
nal liabilities.24 The main debtors in this asset 
class are MFIs and the Bundesbank. Accepting 
short- term deposits is part of credit institutions’ 
core business, and the associated risks are 
monitored as part of routine internal risk con -
trol and banking supervision operations. The 
Bundesbank’s external liabilities are essentially 
made up of liabilities related to the allocation 
of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem, the 
deposits of other central banks within the 
framework of central bank services, and the 
counterpart of special drawing rights allocated 
by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
These positions are not a source of specific risk 
for the Bundesbank in the form of a sudden 
withdrawal of capital by foreign creditors.
One particular risk aspect for a country’s exter -
nal liabilities that is not always apparent in 
retrospect concerns the effects of unexpected 
exchange rate movements.25 Foreign currency 
liabilities can become a significant financial bur -
den if their equivalent value in domestic cur -
rency rises as a result of a currency depreci -
ation. In Germany, foreign currency liabilities 
account for 17% of total external liabilities and 
thus play a rather minor role in macroeconomic 
terms. They also include negative valuations of 
financial derivatives used to hedge foreign ex -
change risks, which means they do not involve 
any risks of their own.26
While risk analysis on the liabilities side of the 
i.i.p. generally focuses on the difficulties a 
country might experience in servicing its own 
payment obligations, on the assets side, it 
looks at the potential threat of severe asset 
losses which are not necessarily reflected in the 
current valuation. This is a situation which can notably arise if assets are poorly diversified and 
there are high international exposures to indi -
vidual debtors.
Over 40% of German external assets at the end 
of 2017 were held vis- à- vis other euro area 
countries,27 with Luxembourg, the Netherlands 
and France ranking as the most important 
countries in this regard. However, from Ger -
many’s perspective, these countries were also 
the most important lenders from the euro 
area.28 Outside the euro area, German invest -
ors held the bulk of their assets in the United 
Kingdom and the United States (around 10% in 
each case). Overall, German assets appear to 
be fairly well diversified around the world.
The Bundesbank’s TARGET2 claims are held vis- 
à- vis the ECB. Losses can arise to the Bundes -
bank from the TARGET2 system if a national 
central bank does not fully meet its payment 
obligations vis- à- vis the ECB. In this case, the 
Bundesbank would be indirectly affected by 
this loss in its capacity as a shareholder of the 
ECB. The size of Germany’s TARGET2 balance 
would be immaterial in this context.

world.

German external assets in an 
international context
German external assets as 
a mirror image of foreign 
liabilities 
The question of the sustainability of a high level 
of net external assets can be answered not only 
from the point of view of the underlying value 
of the assets and potential losses to the cred -
itor country. Another aspect to be considered is 
that the national external positions – to the ex -
tent that they are properly recorded statistic -
ally – offset each other worldwide. It follows 
that the external liabilities of individual coun -
tries can only arise if external assets are built up 
in another part of the world. This interaction 
could be interpreted to mean that the causes 
of a high level of external liabilities may not lie 
solely with the debtor countries, but that coun -
tries with persistent current account surpluses 
and a correspondingly substantial stock of ex -
ternal assets may also contribute to the build-  
up of unsustainable international investment 
positions in countries with lasting current ac -
count deficits.Net external assets in line with 
fundamentals
One major criterion for examining the robust -
ness of this rationale is the extent to which dis -
torted economic policy incentives or market 
constraints are responsible for the build- up of a 
high level of external assets. Where the net 
i.i.p. can be put down to fundamental factors 
that are not politically driven and free market 
processes, however, such criticism is not war -
ranted.
The IMF developed the External Balance As -
sessment (EBA) as a methodology for determin -
ing equilibrium current account balances. As a 
country’s net i.i.p. essentially corresponds to its 
cumulative current account balances in the 
past, this approach is also suited to examining 
the long- term relationship between the i.i.p. 
and key fundamentals driving a country’s sav -
ing and investment decisions (see the box on 
pp. 61ff.). An “equilibrium” i.i.p. can be deter -
mined by using desirable values, or at least val -
ues that are outside political influence, as the 
variables. Deviations of the actual value from 
the value determined in this way should – as -
suming the model specifications are correct – 
lead to adjustments sooner or later, because

An explanation of the international investment position 
using macroeconomic variables
The analysis presented in this box is based 
on the external balance assessment (EBA) 
methodology of the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF),1 which is the approach nor-
mally used to estimate current account 
ratios – defi  ned as the current account bal-
ance relative to gross domestic product 
(GDP). To estimate the international invest-
ment position – likewise relative to GDP – 
the exogenous variables are adapted such 
that they can be used to explain a stock 
variable (the net international investment 
position) rather than a fl  ow variable (the 
current account balance).
The panel coeffi   cients and estimates identi-
fi  ed for the international investment pos-
itions of individual countries ultimately 
refl  ect  the average of the countries ana-
lysed over the observation period. There-
fore, they should be interpreted not as nor-
mative measures but more as insights into 
the forces driving external economic rela-
tions and an indication of country- specifi  c 
idiosyncrasies (in the form of fi  xed country 
effects or characteristics unique to a par-
ticular country).
The Bundesbank analysis presented here 
used annual data from a total of 21 ad-
vanced economies and 10 emerging market 
economies over the 1999 to 2016 period. 
Unless stated otherwise, this analysis always 
uses differences to the global average (or, 
as a proxy, to the weighted average of 
the countries sampled). This way, it can be 
ensured  that developments common to all 
the countries do not impact on the esti-
mated international investment position. 
Specifi  cally, the following variables are in-
cluded in the analysis.2Net international investment position as 
a percentage of GDP:
The net international investment position as 
a percentage of GDP (iip_gdp) is defi  ned 
as  the response variable. Normalisation 
through GDP allows comparisons to be 
made across countries. Since international 
investment positions of individual countries 
have to be balanced globally in the aggre-
gate, this variable is not defi  ned as the dif-
ference to the global average.3
Net general government debt relative to 
GDP:
Net general government debt4 relative to 
GDP (gdebt_gdp) – with the sign reversed – 
represents government fi  nancial assets and 
thus stands for the (negative) contribution 
of public fi  nances to national fi  nancial 
assets.
Per capita income:
Per capita income (gdp_cap) describes an 
economy’s evolutionary status.5 On the one 
1 See IMF (2013), External Balance Assessment (EBA) 
Methodology: Technical Background. This method-
ology is being enhanced and refi  ned on an ongoing 
basis; see: http:// www.imf.org/ external/ np/ res/ eba/ 
data.htm
2 Data on international investment positions of individ-
ual countries are taken from the IMF’s Balance of Pay-
ments Statistics, whilst fi  gures for government debt 
levels, GDP and consumer prices are from the IMF’s 
World Economic Outlook database. The detailed 
breakdown by population age group is sourced from 
the United Nations’ World Population Prospects. The 
World Bank’s World Development Indicators contain 
data on national energy imports and research and 
develop ment expenditure. The Chinn- Ito index 
(http://web.pdx.edu/~ito/ kaopen_2015.dta) was used 
to select  countries with open capital accounts.
3 Since the estimation uses international investment 
positions relative to GDP and the sample does not 
cover all the countries, the variable’s annual average is 
normally different from null. This is taken into account 
by using time- specifi  c fi  xed effects.
4 Net debt includes both the gross debt and fi  nancial 
assets of general government.
5 The baseline specifi  cation is based on nominal per 
capita income in US dollars. An alternative estimate 
uses per capita income in purchasing power parities.Deutsche Bundesbank

hand, the relative scarcity of capital in 
catching- up economies and the prospects 
of them achieving higher future income 
levels (in conjunction with intertemporal 
consumption smoothing) suggest that 
these countries will register net infl  ows of 
capital. On the other hand, less developed 
countries have limited access to global cap-
ital markets, particularly when it comes to 
raising debt abroad.6 This situation is for-
cing many emerging market economies to 
promote their development by embracing 
an export strategy and building up a stock 
of external assets (e.g. in the form of re-
serve assets) as a kind of backstop.7 Con-
versely, the intertemporal consumption 
smoothing argument would imply that ad-
vanced economies tend to operate more as 
net creditors. That said, “rich” economies 
are generally better placed to run a nega-
tive international investment position on ac-
count of their superior creditworthiness. 
From a theoretical perspective, it is there-
fore not possible to make a general state-
ment on the relationship between the inter-
national investment position and per capita 
income.
Percentage of older people in the 
population :
A relatively high percentage of the popula-
tion who are no longer employed (meas-
ured here as the percentage of people over 
the age of 64, pop_old) necessitates a 
higher level of savings in earlier years which 
can be tapped in old age. Unlike in the case 
of the current account, what matters for 
external assets is not the pace at which the 
population is ageing but the current share 
of older people, which ought to be mir-
rored by a suitably sized capital stock.
Market capitalisation:
The importance of the national capital mar-
ket, as measured by the market capitalisa-
tion of listed companies relative to GDP (market_gdp), is interpreted in the EBA 
methodology as indicating the extent to 
which companies have access to the capital 
market. A high level of market capitalisa-
tion, then, is thought to ease investment in 
a country. Given that this also results in cap-
ital being attracted from abroad, the impact 
on a country’s international investment 
position is generally expected to be nega-
tive.
Research and development expenditure 
as a percentage of GDP:
Expenditure on research and development 
as a percentage of GDP (r&d_gdp) is used 
as a proxy for the importance of intangible 
assets.8 As far as the international invest-
ment position is concerned, intangible 
assets can be regarded as a substitute for 
external fi  nancial assets which can likewise 
generate investment income from abroad.9 
6 Another phenomenon worth considering in this con-
text is the Lucas paradox, which describes the observa-
tion of net fl  ows of capital out of the emerging market 
economies in the direction of advanced economies; 
see R. Lucas (1990), Why Doesn’t Capital Flow from 
Rich to Poor Countries?, American Economic Review 
80, pp. 92-96. This paradox unravels to a degree when 
other determinants such as capital market perform-
ance are controlled for. See S. Herrmann and J. Klein-
ert (2014), Lucas paradox and allocation puzzle – is the 
euro area different?, Deutsche Bundesbank Discussion 
Paper, No 06/ 2014.
7 To capture this argument by different means, the 
signifi  cance of a dummy variable for fi  xed exchange 
rate regimes is also tested.
8 From a theoretical perspective, stock data such as 
the number of existing patents would be a more suit-
able determinant of the international investment pos-
ition, but no comparable data on patents are available 
for a broad group of countries. Patents fi  led by resi-
dents are strongly overrepresented in the databases of 
the European Patent Offi   ce and the United States Pa-
tents and Trademarks Offi   ce. Patents are not recorded 
at the global level.
9 More on this topic can be found in the debate sur-
rounding the “dark matter” in the US external position; 
see R.  Hausmann and F.  Sturzenegger (2007), The 
missing dark matter in the wealth of nations and the 
implications for global imbalances, Economic Policy 51, 
pp. 470-518.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
December 2018

This variable should therefore be inputted 
into the regression with a negative sign.10
Net energy imports as a percentage of 
a country’s energy consumption:
In the same way, commodity resources are 
another source of income for the future 
and can therefore be regarded as an alter-
native to fi  nancial assets. If domestic energy 
resources are scarce, net energy imports 
will account for a large percentage of the 
energy a country consumes (energy_imp)11 
and can be expected to be offset by a 
higher level of external fi  nancial assets in an 
external equilibrium. The direct impact of 
high energy imports on the current account 
– and thus also on the international invest-
ment position over the long run – is nega-
tive, however, which means that the actual 
relationship a priori is indeterminate.12
Share of equity- based assets relative to 
the share of equity- based liabilities:
The fi  nal variable which might have a bear-
ing on the accumulation of external assets 
is the population’s relative risk appetite, 
which is driven by two factors. First, the 
desire  to build up precautionary savings, 
which will probably mainly be an issue 
when risk aversion levels are high. Second, 
comparatively risky forms of investment can 
also generate higher rates of return than 
risk- free assets over the long run, however. 
The share of equity- based assets relative to 
the share of equity- based liabilities (equ_
ass_liab) shows the extent to which a coun-
try acts as a provider of risk capital for the 
rest of the world. The more this is the case, 
the less likely it will be that the country in 
question is reliant on accumulating a large 
nominal stock of external assets, and that 
precautionary considerations will be a mo-
tivating factor for that country in the inter-
national context.The panel estimate is performed with fi  xed 
country and time effects. A Breusch- Pagan 
Lagrange multiplier test rejects the null hy-
pothesis of random country effects. Fixed 
time effects account for the fact that the 
average of national external assets ratios 
can be different from null and can vary over 
time. They capture global shocks that affect 
all the countries in the sample in equal 
measure. The variance- covariance matrix is

estimator.13
The left- hand column of the table on p. 64 
shows the estimation results for a broad 
group of countries, while the right- hand 
column confi  nes the estimation to a sub- 
sample of countries which had open capital 
accounts as per the IMF classifi  cation 
10 However, the literature also posits the rising per-
centage of intangible assets as one possible reason for 
the increased propensity of enterprises to fund their 
operations internally through retained earnings, be-
cause it acts as a constraint on external fi  nancing. This 
would tend to imply that there is a positive relationship 
between fi  nancial and intangible assets. See A. Falato 
et al. (2013), Rising Intangible Capital, Shrinking Debt 
Capacity, and the US Corporate Savings Glut, Federal

11 A country’s energy imports and total energy con-
sumption are measured in crude oil equivalents. As a 
result, the ratio remains unaffected by price fl  uctu-
ations and, being a structural variable, will generally 
move at only a gradual pace.
12 In the determination of equilibrium current account 
balances, the energy balance, measured in crude oil 
equivalents, is inputted in the estimation results of the 
above- mentioned Bundesbank analysis as a negative 
variable. As part of its EBA exercises, the IMF deter-
mines a temporariness measure of the energy endow-
ments of countries that are net exporters of oil and 
gas. The rationale here is that even countries which 
currently have substantial stocks of natural energy re-
sources need to provide for a future in which these 
resources can no longer be expected to generate rev-
enue. In this case, the temporariness measure has a 
positive sign consistent with the current account and 
the build- up of external assets. See IMF (2013), op. cit.

throughout the observation period.14 This 
allows for the fact that the external position 
of countries with capital controls might be 
distorted.
Where it was possible to postulate a clear 
relationship a priori, the variables observed 
are included in the estimations with the ex-
pected sign and are statistically signifi  cant 
for the most part. The government debt- to- 
GDP ratio impacts negatively on a country’s 
external assets, while an economy with a 
high percentage of older people in the 
population tends to have above average 
levels of external assets. The negative rela-
tionship between per capita income and ex-
ternal assets proved to be statistically highly 
signifi  cant and extremely robust across the 
various model specifi  cations. This suggests 
that better access to global capital markets 
and higher borrower creditworthiness levels 
on average make a difference. It is striking to note the strong body of evidence sup-
porting the hypothesis that countries which 
import a large percentage of their primary 
energy consumption have a high level of 
external fi  nancial assets to compensate for 
the relative scarcity of commodities. Intel-
lectual property –  proxied by expenditure 
on research and development  – also ap-
pears to be a substitute for fi  nancial assets, 
but this relationship is only signifi  cant for 
the broad group of countries. If the estima-
tion is confi  ned to the sub- sample of econ-
omies with open capital accounts, the esti-
mated coeffi   cient retains its negative sign, 
but it is no longer signifi  cantly different 
from null. The picture is much the same for 
the structural composition of external 
assets, which refl  ects the role a country 
plays as a global provider of risk capital and, 
by implication, the propensity of domestic 
economic agents to take on risk. The latter 
two variables do, however, also improve 
the accuracy of the estimation in the sub- 
sample of countries (measured in terms of 
the adjusted R2). This specifi  cation is also 
used in the section of the main article dis-
cussing the level of German external assets 
determined by the fundamentals and the 
contributions made by individual variables.

and liability position. Since defining desirable 
values as the determinants used for the pur -
poses of this assessment is controversial and 
ultimately only shifts the problem of calculating 
an equilibrium i.i.p. to another level, the ap -
proach presented here dispenses with such a 
normative analysis and instead seeks only to 
explain national cross- border positions to en -
able a better understanding of the underlying 
drivers. It is also important in this respect for all 
the variables to each be placed in relation to 
the average for the rest of the world, as glob -
ally uniform trends should not normally lead to 
shifts in national external positions.
One of the key variables in this context is a 
country’s demographic situation. A relatively 
high proportion of older persons who are no 
longer employed justifies higher savings in pre -
vious years which can then be drawn on in old 
age. In the international context, this is accom -
panied by a positive net i.i.p. A classic example 
of a determinant which can exert a strong in -
fluence on a country’s i.i.p. (positive analysis) 
without necessarily justifying it (normative an -
alysis) is the level of public debt less general 
government’s financial assets. This net debt 
represents the (negative) contribution of public 
finances to national financial assets. An econo -
my’s evolutionary status plays, a priori, an am -
bivalent role. On the one hand, rich countries 
will generally be in a better position to provide 
capital abroad, and investments in catching- up 
economies promise higher returns in the me -
dium term due to their relative lack of capital. 
On the other hand, advanced economies often 
provide higher certainty for investments and 
have better access to global capital markets. 
Other factors incorporated into the estimation 
are the role of a country – discussed in more 
detail below – as an international provider of 
risk capital, the research  intensity that can be 
attributed to a country, and its reliance on 
commodity imports.
The estimate found that for the year 2017 Ger -
man net external assets amounted to 48% of 
GDP ,29 compared with an actual value of 54%. Germany’s external assets, then, were some -
what higher than the figure derived from the 
fundamentals and panel regressions. At the 
same time, however, this estimate confirms the 
hypothesis that the demographic component 
plays an important role for the high level of 
German net saving (and thus for the build- up 
of external assets). Germany’s already com -
paratively old population would – if viewed in 
isolation – even explain net external assets of 
more than 100% of GDP .30 The United Nations’ 
population forecast portends not a noticeable 
reduction of German external assets but further 
saving over the next 20 years.31
Taken together, all the remaining components 
had a dampening effect, overall, on Germany’s 
i.i.p. Particularly the comparatively high per 
capita income in Germany had a negative im -
pact. Here, unhindered access to global capital 
markets as well as Germany’s high credit qual -
ity and reputation as a creditor tipped the bal -
ance and appear to have outweighed the lower … on the

returns on domestic capital investments com -
pared to emerging market economies.
Previous years also saw differences between 
Germany’s actual international investment pos -
itions and the figures estimated by the model. 
These are likely to be at least partly attributable 
to the valuation effects not (directly) captured 
by the estimation model. That said, the in -
crease in Germany’s i.i.p. since the temporary 
decline in 2008 is captured fairly well by the 
model on the whole, even if its evolution did 
differ significantly from the projected values at 
times, particularly in the crisis periods. Since 
2012, however, the differences in absolute 
terms have been rather minor.32
However, as mentioned above, this does not 
necessarily mean that the current level of Ger -
many’s i.i.p. is warranted in the sense of a gen -
eral equilibrium model. The method applied 
here aims to identify the importance of key de -
terminants. It is not suitable for determining 
normative requirements.
International risk sharing
Alongside the size and the appropriateness of 
Germany’s external assets, another important 
aspect for Germany’s role in the context of 
international investment positions is the ques -
tion of the distribution of risks between debtor 
countries and Germany. As outlined above, the 
foreign counterparties are not subject to any 
unconditional payment obligations as long as 
Germany’s external assets have the character 
of equity capital, i.e. are made in the form of 
direct investment or invested in shares. Assum -
ing this is the case, performance- related divi -
dends or sale proceeds are the sole potential 
source of financial return flows. As for debt 
capital instruments, the shorter the agreed 
term, the riskier they will tend to be for foreign 
debtors. Viewed from this particular angle, 
then, money market instruments and a large 
proportion of originated loans, in particular, 
count as short- term instruments and are thus comparatively risky for the debtor. A glance at 
the structure of German gross external assets 
outlined at the beginning of this article shows 
that at the end of 2017 just over 36% of Ger -
many’s external assets was invested as equity 
capital. Of this, 23 percentage points were ac -
counted for by FDI, which is considered to be 
particularly robust to temporary deteriorations 
in the economic environment on account of 
the strategic interests it represents for the in -
vestors.33 Shares and investment fund shares 
accounted for 13% of Germany’s gross exter -
nal assets.34
Long- term debt securities accounted for a fur -
ther 22% of German financial assets abroad. 
The remainder was primarily attributable to 
other investment (34%).35 This category in -
cludes, in particular, loans and trade credits, 
which are considered to be short- term items, 
and deposits with MFIs.36
The Bundesbank’s TARGET2 claims on the ECB, 
which are also included under other invest -
ment, account for around one- third of this 
asset class. The offsetting item of the partner 
countries should, however, be assessed differ -
ently from short- term liabilities to private cred -
itors, as it is not exposed to rollover risk.
Overall, then, only around half of German 
claims on non-  residents at the end of 2017 Estimates can

 TARGET2 claims
32 The increase in the estimated i.i.p. in those years was 
mainly due to the reduction of government debt, which 
bucked the global trend.
33 In terms of risk sharing, direct investment loans should 
be assessed in much the same way as equity capital, since 
the group parent will only insist on the servicing of an in -
tragroup payment obligation if the subsidiary is actually 
able to pay it. If its subsidiary were at risk of becoming in -
solvent, the parent would itself be affected via the value of 
its equity investment.
34 Investment fund shares can be based on both shares 
and bonds. However, in the external assets they are nor -
mally counted together with shares under a single heading.
35 The volume of foreign money market instruments in 
German portfolios (less than 1%) and the foreign reserve 
assets of the Bundesbank (2%) carry little weight. Financial 
derivatives reported with a positive value on the assets side 
make up a further 5%.
36 One exception here is equity that is not considered to 
be direct investment or securities, such as shares in a 
GmbH. Similarly, pension entitlements are recorded under 
other investment, but are more long- term in nature.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
December 2018

consisted of debt instruments with uncondi -
tional payment obligations on the part of the 
counterparty. In the international context, the 
provision of equity capital, in particular, tends 
to help stabilise potential external imbalances, 
because it constitutes financial resources whose 
return flows are linked to the economic per -
formance and financial resilience of the partner 
country. The realisation of the European capital 
markets union is likely to further facilitate pri -
vate sector risk sharing within the euro area, in 
particular because it will also strengthen cross- 
border equity financing.
Conclusion
Recent years have seen Germany’s net external 
assets rise to the equivalent of around 54% of 
GDP at the end of 2017, primarily on the back 
of sustained current account surpluses. This 
largely reflects the demographic situation in 
Germany, where older people account for an above- average percentage of the population. 
The return on Germany’s external assets over 
the past few years has been shaped by the low 
interest rate environment around the world, 
with the individual asset classes recording sig -
nificant differences in returns, which depended  
in part on the period over which they were re -
corded. The risks associated with Germany’s 
i.i.p. appear to be limited in aggregate terms, 
even if asset losses arising from valuation 
changes as a result of market price or exchange 
rate effects cannot be ruled out and individual 
economic risks cannot, in any case, be deduced 
from the i.i.p. Germany’s net external assets 
essen tially represent the counterpart to exter -
nal liabilities elsewhere in the world and could 
thus contribute to external imbalances in prin -
ciple. However, Germany’s external assets 
imply unconditional payment obligations to no 
more than a limited degree. By providing equity 
capital, Germany in fact helps strengthen inter -
national risk sharing and contributes to eco -
nomic stabilisation in the partner countries.Provision of

nal stabilityDeutsche Bundesbank
