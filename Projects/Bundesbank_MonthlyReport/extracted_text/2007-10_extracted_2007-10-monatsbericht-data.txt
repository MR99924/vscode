Industry
Industrial activity picked up markedly again in
the third quarter. Seasonally and calendar-day
adjusted output grew by 13/C254% in August,
compared with an increase of just1/C254% at the
beginning of the quarter. The volatile pattern
of growth is due primarily to the shift in the
dates of holidays. On an average of July and
August, industrial output was 11/C252%u po n
the second-quarter level, when growth, at
1/C252%, was rather subdued on the whole. In
sectoral terms, the recent growth in output
was broadly based, with declines in output
being recorded by the manufacturers of food
products and passenger cars. After adjust-
ment for calendar effects, year-on-year indus-
trial output was up by just over 6% in Au-
gust.
There was also stronger demand for industrial
goods in August. The volume of orders, for
example, was up 11/C254% on July after adjust-
ment for seasonal variations. The average of
the two-month period of July and August
was not quite 11/C252% down on the level of the
previous quarter, which had been marked by
an exceptional number of large orders in
June. By contrast, a comparison of July and
August with April and May, which better re-
flects the underlying trend, shows an increase
of3/C254%. A similar result emerges when the
data are adjusted for the exceptional large
orders. Thus, the flow of orders continued on
an upward course, albeit no longer as buoy-
antly as in the first two quarters of the year.

6orders grew more sharply, at 1%, than the
volume of orders from domestic customers,
which rose by just under1/C252%. Manufacturers
of intermediate goods and capital goods
benefited particularly from the ordering activ-
ity, whereas manufacturers of consumer
goods recorded a decline in demand.
The value of exports of goods rose signifi-
cantly in August. Compared with July, it was
3% up in seasonally adjusted terms. In July
and August, exports were 2% up on the aver-
age of the second quarter, in which they
showed only a slight rise. The value of import-
ed goods went up even more sharply, increas-
ing by a seasonally adjusted 51/C252% in August.
On an average of the two-month period of
July and August, the value of imported goods
was 3% up on the second quarter. After ad-
justment for price increases, foreign trade
flows also expanded relatively sharply in the
period under review.
Construction
Construction output rose considerably on the
month in August. Seasonally adjusted con-
struction activity went up by 2%, after having
increased by just under 1% in July. In the con-
struction industry, too, the monthly rates of
change at the beginning of the third quarter
are likely to have been influenced by the shift
in holiday dates. Output in July and August,
taken together, was up1/C252% on the quarter.
Above-average growth, at 1%, was recorded
in general construction during this period.
Civil engineering, however, remained at its
second-quarter level.Economic conditions in Germany*

7Demand for construction in July, the most re-
cent month for which figures are available,showed a clear recovery on the weak level inJune, with a rise of 3
3/C254% on the second quar-
ter. There was exceptionally strong growth(10
1/C254%) in industrial demand for construction
work, in particular, whereas orders for hous-ing construction declined by 1
1/C254%. The pub-
lic sector did not place as many orders as inthe second quarter either.
Economy as a wholeAccording to the indicators available so far,
activity in the economy as a whole increaseddiscernibly in the third quarter after the ef-fects of the VAT increase on private consump-tion and on housing construction had signifi-cantly dampened growth in the first half ofthe year. These effects are likely to haveabated in the third quarter with the resultthat the cyclical expansionary forces began tohave a greater influence again. According toestimates, the economy grew at a more rapidrate in the third quarter than on an averageof the first half of the year. Increased stimulifrom the domestic market played a role inthis context. Given subdued traditional retailsales, private consumption is likely to havepicked up noticeably mainly on account ofthe substantial growth in the motor vehicletrade. Furthermore, it is anticipated that boththe upward trend in the demand for machin-ery and equipment will remain stable andthat construction investment will rise. Exportswere also on a clear upward course in thethird quarter. Imports also showed a sharp in-crease. The high level of imports may havebeen used, not least, to restock the inventor-
ies.
Labour marketThe favourable underlying trend in the labour
market continued in August. According to ini-tial estimates by the Federal Statistical Office,the seasonally adjusted number of persons inemployment rose by 34,000 to 39.81 million.This is equivalent to a year-on-year increaseof 637,000. The positive trend in employmentsubject to social security contributions alsocontinued with a marked increase again inJuly, namely by 53,000, compared with 6,000in June. By contrast, the scale of government-assisted forms of employment remained virtu-ally unchanged.
There was a further decline in the official un-
employment figure in September. The sea-sonally adjusted number of persons officiallyregistered as unemployed stood at 3.69 mil-lion persons in total. This was 50,000 fewerthan in the previous month. The year-on-yeardecrease was 694,000. After adjustment forseasonal variations, the unemployment ratewas 8.8%, compared with 10.5% in Septem-ber 2006. This improvement was due primar-ily to the cyclical rise in employment. Further-more, the demographically induced decline inthe supply of labour also eased the burden onthe labour market.
PricesPrices in the international commodity markets
went up again in September following a tem-porary easing in August. On a monthly aver-

8age, the spot quotation for a barrel of Brent
North Sea oil reached a new record high at
US$763/C254. As this report went to press, the
market price stood at US$841/C252. The sharp rise
in prices also has to be seen against the back-
drop of the declining stocks in the USA and
production stoppages owing to the tropical
hurricanes and the heightened tensions along
the Turkish-Iraqi border. Given that the for-
ward quotations did not rise as sharply as the
spot prices, the forward discounts have ex-
panded. The discount on six-month contracts
was US$21/C254. On long-term contracts, the fig-
ure was US$63/C254.
German import prices declined perceptibly by
a seasonally adjusted 1.3% on the month in
August, which was due mainly to the tempor-
arily lower market prices for crude oil and the
appreciation of the euro. Nevertheless, do-
mestic inflationary pressures at the industrial
producer level continued. This applies, in par-
ticular, to food industry prices. On the whole,
industrial producer prices (excluding energy)
increased by 2.7% on the year.
Consumer prices in September were clearly
up on the month. The cost of both energy
and food products went up again. Although
there were lower prices in the case of season-
al food products, these were masked by price
rises, especially for dairy products. Consumers
had to pay more for industrial goods as well.
On the whole, consumer price inflation (CPI)
was up 2.4% on the year, compared with
+1.9% in August. According to the Harmon-
ised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the in-
crease was 2.7%, compared with +2.0% in
August.Public finances1
Autumn notification outturns and
general government debt
Under the European budgetary surveillance
procedure, revised figures for the general
government deficit and debt level were trans-
mitted to the European Commission at the
end of September. The deficit ratio for 2006
calculated by the Federal Statistical Office
was revised downwards by 0.1 percentage
point compared with the figure in the spring
notification to 1.6%. By contrast, the Federal
Ministry of Finance’s estimate of the deficit
for the current year was, at 0.1% of GDP , sig-
nificantly below the figure transmitted at the
end of March (1.2%). The debt level at the
end of 2006 – calculated by the Bundesbank
– was revised upwards by just over 311/C252bil-
lion to 31.568 trillion in the light of updated
data from central and local government.
However, the debt-to-GDP ratio was 0.4 per-
centage point lower at 67.5% as a result of
the considerably higher nominal GDP that
was meanwhile recorded. This is equivalent
to a decline of 0.3 percentage point com-
pared with the end of 2005.
The debt level as defined in the Maastricht
Treaty continued to rise up to mid-2007,
reaching 31.587 trillion. However, the ratio of
debt to GDP of the four preceding quarters

appears in the Monthly Report, the emphasis is on recent
outturns. The quarterly Monthly Reports (published in
February, May, August and November), by contrast, con-

trends during the preceding quarter. For detailed statistic-

9decreased further to 67% due to the strong
growth in nominal GDP . The debt ratio couldfall even more sharply in the second half ofthe year, not least because a reduction in themoney market assets of central governmentand its off-budget special funds, which weretopped up significantly compared with theend of last year, could have a dampening ef-fect on the development of gross debt.
Local government financesAccording to recently published cash statistics
data, in the second quarter of 2007 local gov-ernment budgets recorded a surplus of justover 33 billion, which was considerably high-
er than during the same period of last year(31 billion). The main reason for this was that,
although last year’s figures contained windfallgains from the sale of Dresden’s municipalhousing company ( 31 billion), revenue in-
creased noticeably (+7% or + 32
1/C252billion).
Tax receipts again rose more strongly(+13
1/C252%o r 32 billion), with significant
growth in local business tax (+14%) and, inparticular, income tax (+22%), which in theprevious quarter had fallen slightly. The sharpincrease in general-purpose grants depend-ent on state government tax receipts and instate government transfers earmarked for in-vestment, which has been evident since thebeginning of this year, continued (+15
1/C252%
overall).
Expenditure increased by 11/C252%( + 31/C252billion)
on the year. The decline in personnel expend-iture accelerated (-2
1/C252%) and spending on so-
cial benefits increased only slightly (+1%),with payments for accommodation costs forrecipients of unemployment benefit II virtually
unchanged. By contrast, not least other oper-ating expenditure (+4%) rose sharply. Themarked growth in fixed investment, whichwas also supported in the first quarter by theunusually mild weather conditions, continuedat a subdued pace (+7%).
Against the backdrop of sharp rises in tax rev-
enue, marked increases in state governmenttransfers and subdued growth in expenditureon personnel and job seekers, local govern-ment is likely to generate a higher surplus in2007 than last year ( 33 billion). However, the
development of short-term cash advancessuggests that many municipalities are stillencountering difficulties in balancing theircurrent budgets. Despite the high local gov-ernment financial surplus recorded in the€b n

a total of 31/C252billion compared with the end
of the first quarter (to a current total of just
over 329 billion). The increase was concen-
trated on the federal states of North Rhine-
Westphalia and Hesse, but there were also
notable increases in the average cash ad-
vance per capita in the local governments of
Saxony-Anhalt and Lower Saxony, although
on an aggregated level local government
budget surpluses were also recorded in each
of these federal states.
Securities markets
Bond market
In August, the issue volume in the German
bond market was down on the previous
month with gross sales amounting to 393.5
billion (July: 3109.9 billion). In view of in-
creased redemptions and taking account of
changes in issuers’ holdings of their own
bonds and notes, the volume of domestic
debt securities outstanding fell by 332.6 bil-
lion on balance. In July, debt securities worth
31.3 billion net had been issued. In August,
foreign debt securities totalling 38.1 billion
(net) were placed in the German market.
The public sector reduced its capital market
debt by 318.0 billion in line with high gross
redemptions. The outstanding amount of
Federal debt securities fell by 318.7 billion.
On balance, central government redeemed
above all five-year Federal notes (Bobls)
(320.3 billion). To a lesser extent, 30-year Fed-
eral bonds (Bunds), two-year Federal Treasurynotes (Sch/C228tze) and Treasury discount paper
(Bubills) worth 30.7 billion, 30.6 billion and
30.5 billion respectively were also redeemed.
In the longer-term maturity segment, how-
ever, net sales of ten-year Bunds amounted
to33.5 billion. The outstanding amount of
debt securities issued by state governments
increased slightly by 30.7 billion net.
Credit institutions reduced their capital mar-
ket debt by 313.9 billion. This was likewise
attributable to high redemptions and repur-
chases. As a result, there was a drop in the
amount of other bank debt securities out-
standing by 39.1 billion and of debt securities
issued by specialised credit institutions by
33.9 billion. However, mortgage Pfandbriefe
were also redeemed to a lesser extent ( 30.9
billion).
In August, domestic enterprises redeemed
own debt securities with a net value of 30.7
billion. In doing so, they focused exclusively
on commercial paper ( 31.3 billion).
In August, foreign investors were the sole
purchasers of domestic debt securities, top-
ping up their German bond portfolios by
316.7 billion. By contrast, German non-banks
and credit institutions sold debt securities for
339.4 billion and 31.8 billion respectively.
Overall, they sold only German paper and, to
a lesser extent, invested capital in foreign
bonds.

11the German equity market, two-thirds of
which was attributable to listed instruments.
Foreign equities worth 33.6 billion were sold
by German investors. On the buyers’ side,
German credit institutions and non-banks
sold equity instruments worth 34.9 billion
and34.2 billion respectively. They sold both
domestic and foreign shares. By contrast, for-
eign investors added German equities worth
35.8 billion to their portfolios, exclusively in
the form of portfolio investment.
Mutual fund shares
In August, domestic investment funds record-
ed an outflow of 35.1 billion. Especially
domestic mutual funds open to the general
public repurchased their own shares in the
amount of 35.3 billion net. However, foreign
mutual fund shares worth 32.1 billion net
were also redeemed.
In the case of mutual funds open to the gen-
eral public, outflows of funds in the wake of
the tensions on the European and US money
markets affected mainly money market funds
(32.7 billion) but also equity-based funds
(31.6 billion) and bond-based funds ( 31.1 bil-
lion). Mixed funds on the other hand raised
30.2 billion. Mutual fund shares were re-
turned mainly by German non-banks ( 36.0
billion). Credit institutions were also active on
the sellers’ side, albeit to a much lesser extent
(31.5 billion).Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus – in unadjusted terms – of 39.1 billion in
August. The result was thus 34.4 billion
down on the level of the previous month.
This can be attributed to a smaller trade sur-
plus and a larger deficit on invisible current
transactions, which comprise services, in-
come and current transfers.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the foreign trade sur-
plus in August went down by 33.8 billion on
the month to 314.1 billion. After adjustment
for seasonal and calendar variations, it de-
creased by 311/C254billion to 3151/C254billion. This is
attributable to strong growth in the nominal
imports of goods (51/C252%), which was notice-Sales and purchases

12ably greater than the expansion in exports
(3%). Import turnover for July and August to-
gether was 3% higher than the second-
quarter average after seasonal adjustment
whereas earnings from exports increased by
2%.
Compared with July, the deficit on invisible
current transactions increased in August by
31.3 billion to 34.4 billion. This was due to
the increase in the deficit on services to 34.6
billion compared with a deficit of 33.1 billion
in the previous month. By contrast, net re-
ceipts from cross-border income increased by
30.1 billion to 33.0 billion. The deficit on cur-
rent transfers sank by the same amount to
32.8 billion.
Cross-border portfolio investment again re-
corded net capital imports in August. At
321.0 billion, these were around twice as
high as in July. This can be attributed to great-
er investment by non-residents in German se-
curities ( 322.8 billion following 310.6 billion
in July). They invested primarily in German
debt securities ( 316.7 billion) concentrating
mainly on bonds and notes ( 310.7 billion)
and money market paper ( 36.0 billion). They
also purchased shares ( 35.8 billion) after sell-
ing these in the previous month ( 38.0 billion).
However, German investors’ portfolio invest-
ment abroad was moderate ( 31.8 billion). On
the one hand, they purchased foreign debt
securities ( 38.1 billion) investing in money
market paper ( 36.0 billion) and bonds ( 32.1
billion). On the other hand, they sold shares
(34.2 billion) and mutual fund shares ( 32.1
billion). Outside the field of portfolio invest-
ment, financial derivatives transactions gener-Major items of the balance

Direct investment resulted in net capital ex-

with 36.5 billion in July. German enterprises
provided their foreign branches with add-itional funds of 37.8 billion. This took the
form of intra-group credits ( 33.0 billion) as
well as reinvested earnings ( 32.5 billion) and
equity capital ( 32.3 billion). Foreign enter-

loans to their subsidiaries resident in Germanyand reinvested earnings.
Non-banks’ transactions in other statistically
recorded investment, which comprises finan-cial and trade credits as well as bank depositsand other assets, recorded inflows of funds of36.6 billion. This was due to activities of gen-
eral government which led to capital importsof312.0 billion. Bank deposits abroad de-creased and short-term loans were taken up
in broadly equal proportions. However, enter-prises and households recorded outflows ofcapital ( 35.4 billion) mainly as a result of the
repayment of short-term financial liabilitiesand the building-up of bank balances abroad.
Partly as a counterpart to the non-banks’
transactions detailed above, the net externalassets of the German banking system in-creased by 315.1 billion on balance. The ex-

15Globalisation and
monetary policyRecently, the significance of the glob-
alisation process for monetary policy
has come increasingly under the spot-
light. There are two issues at play here:
the influence of global factors on price
developments – and thus on the mon-
etary policy target – as well as the im-
plications of globalisation for the
transmission of monetary policy.
This article provides an overview of the
current status of the debate. It comes
to the conclusion that the globalisa-
tion process neither lessens the need
for a stability-oriented monetary policy
nor fundamentally calls into question
the ability of an independent central
bank to guarantee price stability over
the medium term. However, it may be
assumed that the growing interlin-
kages between the goods and financial
markets have altered the price dynam-
ics and the monetary transmission pro-
cess. The relative strength of the po-
tential changes and thus their net im-
pact on the monetary policy data set
are very difficult to quantify, though.
Increasing globalisation ultimately
raises the degree of uncertainty with
which monetary policy decisions are
taken. This concern is addressed by
means of a broad analysis of economic
indicators.

16Significance of globalisation for central
banks
The phenomenon of globalisation and its so-
cial, political and economic dimensions have
attracted a lot of attention in the past few
years. This article addresses the implications
of globalisation for price developments and
monetary policy.1The main task of the Euro-
system as well as of most other central banks
is to maintain price stability. From a monetary
policy perspective, therefore, the question of
whether and how globalisation affects the
fulfilment of this task is a core issue. There
are two aspects of particular interest here.
First, it must be examined whether and in
what form, if at all, globalisation affects
macroeconomic price developments. In this
connection, there are many who claim, for in-
stance, that greater world economic integra-
tion has dampened inflation rates in the de-
veloped world. Second, it must be examined
whether globalisation – as some observers
have asserted – has altered the channels of
influence of monetary policy measures. Any
evidence of such changes must accordingly
be taken into account in the monetary policy
analysis and the decision-making process.
Globalisation – definition and key
variables
In economic terms, globalisation denotes the
process of a progressively greater internation-
al division of labour, as a consequence of
which goods, financial and labour markets,
once primarily national in their scope, are be-
coming increasingly integrated.2To pin downthe term, reference is often made to the
worldwide integration of markets, the inter-
nationalisation of production, the integration
of economic activities or the increasing mu-
tual interdependency of the world’s econ-
omies. The extent to which a national econ-
omy or economic zone is exposed to the
globalisation process can accordingly be
measured using indicators such as the degree
of financial and trade openness of the coun-
try concerned.

17and services divided by gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP) – has risen distinctly in many coun-
tries over the past few decades. This process
already surged visibly in the 1970s and has
been doing so again with renewed vigour
since the mid-1990s. The recent trend has
been spurred, in particular, by falling commu-
nication and transport costs as well as the
opening up of the markets in China, India
and central and eastern Europe.
Financial integration has grown at an even
more visibly accelerated pace. In many coun-
tries, including Germany, both cross-border
portfolio investment and foreign direct invest-
ment (FDI) have skyrocketed since the begin-
ning of the 1990s. Accordingly, these coun-
tries’ degree of financial openness – defined
as the sum of external assets and liabilities
divided by GDP – has increased much more
sharply than the degree of trade openness
since the beginning of the 1990s.
Technological progress, especially in informa-
tion and communications technology, the
opening up of markets in many countries and
the deregulation of the product and labour
markets as well as of the financial sector,
have all been drivers of the increasing division
of labour in the world economy. These devel-
opments, which also affect the conditions
under which monetary policy operates, are,
however, not detached from the degree of
international integration and the extent of
international competition. Consequently, any
attempt to empirically estimate globalisation’s
isolated contribution to changes in national
price formation processes or monetary policytransmission is fraught with considerable un-
certainty.
The significance of globalisation for the
worldwide decline in inflation rates
In parallel with the acceleration of globalisa-
tion since the beginning of the 1990s, a dis-
tinct decline in inflation rates has also been
recorded. This trend first appeared in the de-
veloped world. The emerging market econ-
omies (EMEs) then followed suit, with a cer-
tain time lag. The variability of inflation rates
declined at the same time. It is largely agreed
that the main reason for this positive trend
lies in the greater orientation and focusing of
monetary policy towards safeguarding price
stability. The institutional foundations wereAs a percentage of GDP

18created by giving more and more central
banks independence, legally enshrining the
goal of price stability and adopting a variety
of transparency-enhancing measures, such as
introducing quantitative targets. Some obser-
vers, however, also emphasise the fact that
globalisation has fostered the process of dis-
inflation, thus alleviating the work of central
banks.3
Possible channels of influence
In principle, there are various ways in which
globalisation may have contributed to lower
rates of inflation. A possible channel could be
that globalisation itself has strengthened the
monetary authorities’ orientation towards
price stability. In that vein, there are several
theoretical arguments in support of the con-tention that central banks’ awareness of the
need for price stability increases in line with
the degree of openness, for instance, be-
cause greater capital mobility enhances the
incentive for monetary policy discipline.4
However, it must also be noted that the disin-
flation process had begun not only in Ger-
many but also in other European countries as
well as the United States as early as the be-
ginning of the 1980s, ie long before the most
recent acceleration of the pace of globalisa-
tion.5
Another line of argument asserts that con-
sumer price developments in the industrial
countries have been dampened by the avail-
ability of cheap imports of finished goods
from Asia as well as central and eastern Eur-
ope in two ways: directly, through the effect
that falling import prices for these products
has on domestic prices (import price channel),
and indirectly, through greater pressure on
the prices and wages in those sectors of the
domestic economy which are particularly ex-
posed to foreign competition (competition
channel).
What is correct here is that many of the
goods contained in the consumer price index
are tradable goods whose prices are increas-Year-on-year change

19ingly being set on international markets.6The
consequence of this is that market develop-ments, even in geographically distant coun-tries, can be felt by domestic consumers (andthe domestic producers of these goods). Theimpact of globalisation, however, can funda-mentally be double-edged, ie it can dampenas well as increase prices. The recent rise inthe consumer prices for milk products in Ger-many, reflecting a tighter supply situation andgrowing demand in international markets, isa topical example of globalisation’s possibleprice-increasing effects. This example clearlyshows that the overall effect of greater mar-ket integration on consumer prices in the in-dustrial countries is initially indeterminate. Forinstance, over the past few years, the pricesof many manufactured goods have risen onlyvery weakly or even fallen, probably also as aconsequence of the growing internationaldivision of labour. However, strong global de-mand for raw materials has driven up prices,especially energy prices, and this develop-ment is also associated with the fast pace ofgrowth of major EMEs, such as China.
Generally, the rapid industrialisation of rela-
tively energy-inefficient EMEs means that theprices of certain non-renewable resources willprobably tend to rise faster than on average.This effect of globalisation on prices in the in-Year-on-year change

This box examines the relationship between the openness of 
sele cted se ctors of the manufa cturin g in dustry (relative to 
the avera ge degree of openness of all the se ctors consi dere d) 
and se ctoral inﬂ  ationary pressure (relative to the avera ge 
rate of inﬂ  ation of the se ctors consi dere d) in Germany. The 
sectoral perspe ctive complements the a ggregate perspe c-
tive an d can foster greater un derstan ding of the relation-
ship between globalisation an d pri ce developments. Sectoral 
data can be use d, in parti cular, to check the vali dity of the 
argument that the in crease d supply of ﬁ  nishe d goo ds from 
abroa d has ha d a dampenin g effe ct on the pri ces of domesti c-
ally manufa cture d competin g pro ducts. This “ global compe-
tition hypothesis” implies a ne gative correlation between 
the (relative) degree of globalisation of a se ctor an d se ctor-
spe ciﬁ c inﬂ ationary pressures.1 However, this does not mean 
that varyin g intensities in the pa ce of globalisation are the 
only or the main reason for diver ging se ctoral pri ce develop-
ments. Different pro ductivity tren ds – whi ch can themselves 
however be the result of varyin g degrees of openness – are 
also likely to play a si gniﬁ cant role. Sectoral differen ces in 
the capital an d commo dities intensity of pro duction can also 
have a si gniﬁ cant impa ct on relative pri ces.
In or der to test the global competition hypothesis, the tren ds 
in the pro ducer pri ces of sele cted se ctors of the German 
manufa cturin g in dustry are compare d with the respe ctive 
industry-spe ciﬁ c signiﬁ cance of imports. The latter is deter-
mine d as a share of real imports2 in the net output of ea ch 
sector. The un derlyin g monthly data in the representation 
for the perio d from 197 6 to April 2007 relate to ten consoli-
date d se ctors of the manufa cturin g in dustry. Consoli dation 
became ne cessary followin g the chan geover in 1995 from 
the GP3 1989 to the GP 2002, whi ch resulte d in the fun da-
mental re classiﬁ  cation of the manufa cturin g in dustry’s se c-
tors. Some cate gories of goo ds were assi gned to new se c-

make up aroun d 75 % of the manufa cturin g in dustry. All of

manufa cturin g in dustry compile d by the Fe deral Statisti cal 
Ofﬁ ce; these data were seasonally a djuste d prior to bein g

The se ctoral developments in both pri ces an d forei gn tra de 
links are compare d with the wei ghte d avera ge of all the 
manufa cturin g in dustry se ctors consi dere d here (see chart 
on pa ge 21). A hi gh correlation between developments in 
the relative si gniﬁ cance of imports an d the relative pri ce 
tren d over time is apparent for the followin g se ctors: foo d

indicate an expe cted ne gative correlation an d the black 
dots in dicate an unexpe cted positive correlation between 
international e conomi c inte gration an d pri ce developments. 
Overall, the ne gative in dicators are pre dominant. This means 
that an in crease in the share of imports normally lea ds to a 
decline in relative inﬂ  ationary pressures. If the se ctors with 
only a weak correlation are also taken into consi deration, 
then two further e conomi c se ctors with ne gative in dicators 
(paper an d metal pro ducts) an d two with positive in dicators 
(chemi cal pro ducts an d motor vehi cles) are a dded. Stron g 
positive correlations are apparent only in the foo d pro d-
ucts an d the ru bber an d plasti c pro ducts se ctors. However, 
when assessin g those se ctors with a positive correlation, 
spe cial fa ctors shoul d also be taken into consi deration. For 
example, in the past, foo d pri ces were inﬂ  uen ced by the EU 
agricultural market re gulation to a greater extent than they 
are to day. In the chemi cals in dustry, the downwar d pressure 
on pri ces owin g to in creasin g competition is likely, at times, 
to have been o bscure d by oil pri ce chan ges. On the whole, 
it can therefore be seen that the pri ce tren d was generally 
more mo derate in se ctors with relatively stron ger growth in 
import penetration.

22dustrial countries counteracts the price-
dampening influence of cheap imports of fin-
ished goods from low-cost countries, which
shows once again that the overall effect on
domestic prices is not definite a priori .
In principle, the influence of such external
price movements on the rate of change in do-
mestic prices is, in many cases, merely tem-
porary. In a regime of flexible exchange rates,
the trend rate of inflation ultimately hinges
on the increase in the general price level sup-
ported by the central bank. If the central
bank is pursuing a clearly defined goal of
price stability, it will counteract downward or
upward pressure on the overall inflation rate
resulting from changes in relative prices by
pursuing a correspondingly expansionary or
restrictive monetary policy. Both external anddomestic price impulses will then ultimately
be reflected merely in changes in relative
prices but not in the overall price trend.
In the adjustment stages, (temporary) effects
on consumer prices may very well occur in
these cases, too. Thus, for instance, the se-
quence of negative price shocks, especially oil
price shocks, since 1999 has caused actual in-
flation rates in the euro area to overshoot the
price stability target and inflation expect-
ations time and again (see chart on page 23).
In addition, the knowledge that, over the me-
dium to long term, the rate of change of the
general price level is determined by monetary
policy does not mean that monetary policy
makers can afford to ignore globalisation’s in-
fluence on price formation. On the contrary:
any influence on the determinants of the
price formation process is highly relevant to a
stability-oriented monetary policy.
Existing empirical evidence
Empirical studies largely find that globalisa-
tion has slightly dampened worldwide infla-
tion. For instance, a 2006 OECD study esti-
mates that the direct effect of cheaper im-
ports of finished goods from China and other
dynamic Asian countries has been to reduce
inflation in the euro area by an average of 0.3
percentage point per year in the 2000 to
2005 period and 0.1 percentage point per
year in the United States (1996 to 2005).7An

to -0.2 percentage point (in the 1995 to 2004
period).8In some cases, however, these stud-
ies are subject to the caveat that they derive
the price effects of the greater international
division of labour from unit values and their
trends, which are not directly comparable
with standard price indices.
The aforementioned figures, in addition,
overstate the actual effects because they fail
to take account of the (counterbalancing) ef-
fects of globalisation on commodity prices.
The OECD study therefore attempts to quan-
tify globalisation’s contribution to recent
commodity price trends, too. It finds that the
fast growth of the non-OECD countries could
have increased real oil prices by between
20% and 40% in the 2000 to 2005 period
(relative to a scenario in which the non-OECD
countries’ share in world trade and global
GDP is kept constant). This assessment leads
the authors to adjust the inflation-dampening
effect of falling import prices for non-
commodities by a “commodity factor”
which, for example for Germany, would be in
an average range of 0.05 to 0.15 percentage
point per year.
Taking into account the price-increasing and
price-dampening effects of globalisation cal-
culated in this manner, the OECD study con-
cludes that the net effect on consumer prices
for OECD countries could have ranged from 0
to -0.25 percentage point per year (for the1995 to 2005 period). An IMF study reaches
very similar conclusions. It also finds that the
impact of unexpected import price changes
(which deviate from the longer-term trend) is
potentially quite perceptible at the beginning,
but diminishes relatively quickly over time.9

24ship between price developments and do-
mestic economic activity (the “Phillips
curve”). The short-term trade-off between
the inflation rate and economic activity –
measured in terms of the (cyclical) unemploy-
ment rate or the output gap – has recently
flattened distinctly in many countries, includ-
ing Germany and the euro area. As the above
chart indicates, the Phillips curve was almost
vertical in Germany in the 1970s but becameincreasingly flatter in the 1980s and 1990s.
Since the mid-1990s, the relationship seems
to be virtually horizontal.
This weakening of the Phillips curve relation-
ship may have been influenced by the process
of globalisation. Free foreign trade means
that buyers are no longer dependent on a do-
mestic supply of goods. In a regime with free
movement of capital, the value of imports
can also exceed that of exports (and vice
versa). This weakens the link between domes-
tic demand and domestic output and reduces
the influence which the domestic output gap
has on the rate of inflation. At the same time,
increased openness makes prices more vul-
nerable to changes in capacity utilisation in
the rest of the world.10
In addition, growing competitive pressure
owing to low-cost countries may have weak-
ened the link between prices and production
costs and/or between costs and the output
gap. Stiffer competition may have forced
companies in industrial countries to reduce
their margins in order to offset rising costs be-
cause they were unable to effect any price in-
creases. However, this is more likely to be a
temporary rather than a lasting effect. In prin-
ciple, the impact of reduced market power
on the Phillips curve relationship should be
limited to the period of falling profit margins.
Once they have fallen to a sufficiently low
level – in an extreme case, to zero – com-Phillips curve for Germany

on increased costs, which will cause prices tobe more flexible and the Phillips curves tosteepen again.
11In addition, on average,
margins have increased – not decreased –over the past few years.
12
In addition, globalisation may have alsoweakened the link between production costsand capacity utilisation. Companies’ im-proved opportunities for relocating jobs tolow-cost countries is likely in general to havehad a moderating effect on the wage de-mands of the domestic labour force, thusweakening the link between the domestic la-bour market situation and wage develop-ments. Another factor which may havewatered down the impact of activity shifts onunit labour costs is the greater internationalmobility of labour, which has led to immigra-tion by workers from low-cost countries.
The greater opening up of labour markets, as
well as immigration, may not only havecaused the Phillips curve to flatten but couldalso have had a positive impact on industrialcountries’ potential output. The efficiencygains associated with the greater internation-al division of labour and the intensification ofcompetition are likely to be having a similareffect.
13An increase in potential output
would lead to a downward shift of the Phillipscurve, which may possibly be very difficult todistinguish empirically from a flattening ofthe curve. However, in order to harness thesepositive effects successfully, firms and work-ers in the economies concerned have to bewilling to undertake a process of structuralchange and adjustment.
14On the whole, however, it must also be notedthat, in many countries, the period of acceler-ating globalisation saw a simultaneous in-crease in the orientation of monetary policytowards monetary stability. The concomitantstronger anchoring of inflation expectationshas probably reduced the cyclical variability ofinflation rates and their sensitivity to shocks.
15
An empirically observable flattening of thePhillips curve is therefore not necessarily at-tributable to the increasing division of labourin the world economy.
Empirical evidenceThe theory that globalisation has made prices
less dependent on the domestic output gapyet at the same time more vulnerable tochanges in capacity utilisation in the rest ofthe world has recently been subjected to em-pirical review from various quarters. A BISstudy finds that, for 16 selected OECD coun-tries, on the whole, the global output gapmakes a significant contribution to explaining
11See J Boeckx (2006), Globalisation and Monetary Pol-
icy, Economic Review, September 2006, National Bank of
Belgium.
12Thus, the GDP deflator to unit labour cost ratio, a
standard macroeconomic measure of the overall profit
margin, has widened distinctly in the past few years.
13In addition, the globalisation-related improvement in
the terms of trade is likely to increase the industrial coun-
tries’ potential output and reduce the non-accelerating
inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). See K Rogoff
(2006), Impact of Globalization on Monetary Policy, Jack-
son Hole 2006 Symposium Proceedings, Federal Reserve
Bank of Kansas City.
14The process whereby Germany’s potential output has
been adjusting to the changed environment is described
in the article “Advances in strengthening the economy’s
growth potential” in this Monthly Report on pages 35-45.
15This is because, in the (extended) Phillips curve model,
the inflation rate is dependent not only on capacity util-
isation but also on expectations. If a central bank suc-
ceeds in firmly anchoring inflation expectations at a low
level, this dampens, in isolation, the extent of shock-
induced deviations from the longer-term price trend.Production

of domestic variables on price movements.16
By contrast, Ihrig et al (2007), using a some-
what different specification for the estimation
equation, find no evidence of any such devel-
opments.17Gadzinski and Hoffmann (2007)
study the influence of trade integration on
the slope of the Phillips curve in the G7 coun-
tries using a non-linear model in which the
slope is time-varying and depends on the de-
gree of openness. Although the results of this
study bear out the imputed negative correl-
ation between openness and the slope of the
Phillips curve, it is impossible to identify a sig-
nificant positive impact of the global output
gap.18
A fundamental problem afflicting this analysis
and similar analyses is that the estimated Phil-lips curves do not capture any real structural
relationships. Consequently, an observed flat-
tening of the Phillips curve in a country can
reflect not only a “real” change in the struc-
tural relationship between the output gap
and the price trend but also, for instance, a
change in the behaviour of monetary policy
makers (with all other structures remaining
unaltered) which has loosened the empirical
link between the output gap and price devel-
opments.19In order to gauge the significance
of the increased stability orientation of mon-
etary policy and the associated stabilisation of
inflation expectations in relation to the influ-
ence of globalisation, the IMF study includes
measures of trade openness and monetary
policy credibility in the estimation equation.20
The estimation results indicate that greater
openness and the increased stability orienta-
tion of monetary policy are each roughly
50% responsible for the fall in the slope of
the Phillips curve.Monthly averages

27Globalisation, monetary policy and finan-
cial markets
Up to now, this article has focused on the im-
pact of growing trade linkages on price devel-
opments in the industrial countries. The in-
creasing integration of capital markets is an-
other key aspect of globalisation. As men-
tioned earlier, the financial openness of many
economies has increased even more strongly
than their degree of trade openness over the
past few years. Growing stocks of cross-
border financial assets have brought with
them greater potential for extensive and (pos-
sibly) volatile capital movements.Globalisation and capital market rates
These developments may have far-reaching
implications for both financial stability and
monetary policy. Risks to financial stability
can arise, for instance, from the existence of
persistent imbalances in trade and capital
flows as well as from the increased danger of
contagion effects.21The degree to which fi-
nancial market globalisation has changed the
extent and manner in which monetary policy
measures can take effect requires examin-
ation from a monetary policy perspective. The
key question in this respect is whether grow-
ing financial market integration – as some ob-
servers fear – has impaired or even complete-
ly undermined monetary policy makers’ influ-Monthly averages

28International linkage of interest rates and the national term structure
This box will firstly examine the co-movement of
the yields on ten-year German and US government
bonds. The existence of international linkages be-
tween interest rates is based on the theoretical con-
cept of uncovered interest parity (UIP).1In order to
take into account the risk aversion among investors
observed in practice, a risk premium is added to the
UIP for the purposes of empirical testing. If both
the expected exchange rate changes and the risk
premium are stationary, this implies the existence
of a cointegration relationship between the two
long-term interest rates.
As a rule, studies on German-US interest rate link-
ages that start before 1985 cannot prove the exis-
tence of a cointegration relationship.2An analysis
of the total estimation period available (1974 to
2007) confirms this finding. However, if the estima-
tion period begins at a later date, from the mid-
1980s the Johansen test statistic provides the first
indications of a stable long-term relationship; from
1990 onwards, ie the period of dynamic financial
market globalisation, it is possible to speak of a
stable cointegration relationship, which also con-
tinues to exist with slight variations in estimation
periods and lag lengths.
An analysis of the adjustment coefficients and the
impulse-response functions within the framework
of a bivariate vector error correction model (VECM)
confirms the overall picture painted by earlier stu-
dies, namely that the German long-term interest
rate is characterised by a high dependency on the
US interest rate.4Thus the question arises – particu-larly from a European perspective – as to the re-
maining significance of domestic determinants for
the level of long-term interest rates.
Therefore, in a second step, the respective national
short-term interest rates (measured in terms of the
three-month interest rates) are included in the ana-
lysis.5A link between national interest rates of dif-
ferent maturities can be derived from the expecta-
tions hypothesis of the term structure (EHT), which
assumes an arbitrage relationship between short-
term and long-term interest rates.6According to
this method, the long-term interest rate is the aver-
age of the current and the expected future short-
term interest rates. A risk premium which is as-
sumed to be stationary is also added to this equa-
tion for the purposes of empirical testing. In order
to test the influence of domestic factors (as pre-
dicted by the EHT) while at the same time taking
account of the international co-movement of inter-
est rates, a VECM is estimated whose variables are
the two long-term interest rates as well as the
three-month interest rates for the USA and Ger-
many/the euro area.7With a lag length of three (as
required by the Akaike Information Criterion), the
Johansen cointegration test at the 10% level pro-
duces the three theoretically expected cointegra-
tion vectors which result from the UIP between the
two markets and the EHT for the US market and the
German/European market. The expected constraints
on the relationships between the differing interest
rates are also not rejected empirically (LR test statis-
tic: 3.58; p-value: 0.31).
The analysis of the adjustment to the long-term
equilibrium shows that the VEC system is driven by
a long-term trend which is determined by the US
short-term interest rate.8The chart on page 29 de-
picts the reaction of the long-term domestic inter-
est rate to relevant shocks in the individual vari-
ables. An impulse in US short-term interest rates in-
duces a permanent effect on German/European
long-term interest rate yields, while the effect of a
shock in the US long-term interest rate is only tran-
sitory. A shock in the German/European short-term
interest rates brings about a significant impulse
lasting over four months. Even taking into account
the international co-movement of interest rates,
the short-term domestic interest rate thus has a sig-
nificant influence on the capital market rate.

29ence on national capital market rates. This
issue is of particular interest because capitalmarket rates are one of the main channelsthrough which monetary policy makers canexert an influence on decisions in the realeconomy and therefore also on price develop-ments.
The apparent breakdown in the conventional
relationship between the fed funds targetrate and the long-term US capital marketrates during the latest period of interest ratehikes is a recent addition to the debate. Asthe chart on page 26 shows, the increase inthe fed funds target rate of 4.25 percentagepoints from June 2004 to June 2006 initiallydid not have any visible impact on the long-term interest rate, which even fell by around
3/C254percentage point up until June 2005. The
stark contrast between this pattern and thehitherto prevailing positive relationship be-tween short-term and long-term interestrates led then-Federal Reserve chairman, AlanGreenspan, to speak of a “conundrum”.

Against the background of the exceptionallyhigh inflows of capital into the United States,it seemed appropriate to examine the greaterinfluence of external factors on US capitalmarket rates as a possible explanation fortheir unusually low level. The theory that thelevel of long-term (real) interest rates in glob-alised financial markets is increasingly beingdetermined by global factors also offers anexplanation as to why long-term interestrates have fallen not only in the United StatesPer-

30over the past few years but in other parts of
the world as well (see chart on page 27).
Some observers believe that this sustained
decline is due to a surplus of available world-
wide savings in excess of worldwide demand
for funds, also known as the “global saving
glut”.23Other factors are also being discussed
in this context, such as the increase in monet-
ary policy and real stability (“the Great Mod-
eration”) and a decrease in risk aversion that
has lasted for many years.24
Empirical evidence
Empirical studies confirm the significance of
global factors for the level of long-term real
interest rates. However, this is not necessarily
a new phenomenon, but was already demon-
strated to have been true for the 1958 to
1989 period, ie prior to the latest surge of
globalisation.25The high degree of synchron-
isation between movements in the long-term
nominal interest rates of key industrial coun-
tries, however, is much more recent. US and
German capital market rates have converged
significantly since the beginning of the 1990s
and are very highly correlated at the current
end.26
However, the high correlation between
movements in national interest rates does not
necessarily imply that central banks no longer
have any influence on capital market rates.
Rather, the greater co-movement of long-
term interest rates could also reflect a more
frequent occurrence of global shocks – ie af-
fecting countries equally – as well as similar
monetary policy reactions to these shocks.
The question of whether the influence ofmonetary policy stimuli on national long-term
interest rates has diminished significantly
therefore needs to be studied separately. Sim-
ple correlation analyses indicate that, in the
euro area and selected OECD countries, the
link between long-term nominal interest rates
and short-term interest rates has loosened re-
cently.27However, this result does not consti-
tute any clear-cut evidence that monetary
policy has lost influence, but might instead
also reflect more stable inflation expectations
against the background of increased monet-
ary policy credibility. Simply looking at
changes in actual short-term interest rates is
insufficient to examine the influence of
changes in key interest rates on long-term
interest rates insofar as it disregards the po-
tential impact of changes in expectations
about the future path of money market inter-
est rates (“the expectations component”) on
capital market rates. Studies which focus on
the impact of unexpected changes in short-
term interest rates or of “monetary policy

Conclusions – consequences for monetary
policy decision-making
Although increasing trade and financial open-
ness neither impair an independent central
bank’s ability to fundamentally safeguard
medium-term price stability, nor relieve it of
its obligation to be stability-oriented, the
globalisation process presents monetary pol-
icy with a series of challenges. Firstly, central
banks must expect the growing interlinkages
between national economies to also involve
more major shifts in relative prices in future,
yet there is considerable uncertainty a priori
surrounding the sign and the extent of the ef-
fects. For instance, experience over the past
few years has shown that the international-
isation of markets can generate not only
price-dampening but also price-increasing ef-
fects.
Given well-anchored inflation expectations,
the efficient monetary policy reaction to such
relative price shocks would be to tolerate
their first-round effects and to change the
direction of monetary policy only if signs of
second-round effects appear or if the price
movements prove to be persistent, thus jeop-ardising the central bank’s stability objective.
Such a strategy has also been successfully ap-
plied by the Eurosystem in the past few years.
In this context, it is important that the central
bank reacts symmetrically to negative and
positive price shocks. After all, if it were only
to tolerate the first-round effects of negative
(inflation-raising) price shocks but loosen
interest rate policy immediately at the first
sign of positive (inflation-dampening) shocks,
the resultant monetary policy would, on aver-
age, be too expansionary.
Moreover, the above considerations have
shown that globalisation may well have less-
ened the influence of national cyclical swings
on general price movements. An advantage
of such a loosening would be that inflation
rates would react less strongly to demand
shocks and policy errors (for instance, owing
to a flawed assessment of the output gap).
However, at the same time, it would make it
more difficult for monetary policy makers to
influence price developments via the trad-
itional (goods) demand channel. Although
the same factors which weaken the (struc-
tural) link between price developments and
the output gap may be expected to also
dampen the effects of supply-side price
shocks on consumer prices, it could be more
difficult to realign the inflation rate once in-
flation expectations have begun to diverge
from the definition of price stability. To that
extent, the potential weakening of the link
between price developments and domestic
economic activity provides a further reason
for a forward-looking monetary policy which
is also oriented towards the stabilisation of in-
flation expectations. This is all the more so as28This is demonstrated, for instance, by the studies pub-
lished by M Ehrmann et al (2005), Stocks, Bonds, Money
Markets and Exchange Rates, ECB Working Paper No
452, and C Brand et al (2006), The Impact of ECB Monet-

32the empirically observed diminished sensitivity
of inflation to cyclical fluctuations – as men-
tioned earlier – may at least partly be precisely
the result of a stability-oriented policy. If this
is the case, a lagged monetary policy reaction
to risks to price stability, motivated by the
supposedly high real economic costs of redu-
cing inflation owing to what is assumed to be
a flatter Phillips curve relationship, would
jeopardise the foundations of its own success
and contribute to the destabilisation of infla-
tion expectations.
It has hitherto not been possible to demon-
strate unequivocally that measures of the
global output gap have a significant influence
on the (shorter-term) price developments in
the euro area and other key industrial coun-
tries. However, even if this were the case, it
should still be borne in mind that estimates of
global potential output and the global output
gap are fraught with even greater uncertainty
than estimates of national output gaps. Con-
sequently, the usefulness of such measures
for gauging future inflationary pressures is
likely to be rather limited in practice.
Finally, the possibility that the international in-
tegration of capital markets has diminished
the influence of monetary policy on long-
term market interest rates cannot be ruled
out. This does not mean, however, that mon-
etary policy has fundamentally become inef-
fective. For one thing, it can be assumed that
the level of longer-term interest rates will
continue to depend not only on global factors
but also on the private sector’s expectations
about the future direction of monetary policy
and future inflation. Transparency, communi-cation and monetary policy credibility take on
a position of decisive importance here. For
another, mainstream open economy models
state that, as capital mobility increases,
changes in interest rates trigger sharper ex-
change rate changes and that the impact of
these exchange rate movements on domestic
prices more than offset the diminishing op-
portunities to influence interest rates. On bal-
ance, globalisation might thus weaken some
transmission channels while reinforcing
others.
The empirical evidence available for the euro
area does not clearly answer the question of
whether and how globalisation has actually
altered the transmission channels of monet-
ary policy impulses. On the one hand, this re-
sult may mean that the greater degree of
openness has so far not been of any major
significance for monetary policy transmission.
On the other hand, it may also be attributable
to the fact that these are relatively new devel-
opments whose impact cannot yet be pinned
down empirically, or that these developments
have hitherto been eclipsed by other factors,
such as the change of monetary regime with
the introduction of the euro, which has had
an even greater influence on structural rela-
tionships.
All in all, therefore, the globalisation process
is heightening the already considerable level
of data, parameter and model uncertainty
under which monetary policy decisions need
to be taken. One important consequence is
surely that the database as well as the
methods and models of analysis used need to
be constantly reviewed and continuously im-Considerable

35Advances in strength-
ening the economy’s
growth potentialFollowing a prolonged period of stag-
nation in growth and persistently high
unemployment, the German economy
is now on quite a stable upswing.
Stronger investment activity and the
turnaround in the labour market
which began in 2006 are not just cyclic-
al but are, at the same time, a reflec-
tion of structural adjustments which
also promise higher growth in the me-
dium term. The restructuring efforts in
the business sector have likewise
played a part in this, as have moderate
wage policy, greater flexibility in the
deployment of labour and the reorien-
tation of labour market policy.
This article takes this development as a
starting point for reassessing the earl-
ier estimates of the German economy’s
potential output. At present, potential
output growth may be estimated at
between 11/C252% and 13/C254% annually and,
therefore, around1/C254percentage point
higher than in the preceding period.
This means that the German economy
has made up some ground again in the
intensified competition among pro-
duction locations. However, strength-
ening the sources of growth must
remain an integral part of the econom-
ic policy reform agenda, especially
since the recently identifiable improve-
ment was preceded by a protracted
process of deceleration.

36Upswing marked by special structural
features and economic policy reforms
The German economy is currently in quite a
stable upswing. At first, the economic recov-
ery was being sustained almost exclusively by
extremely dynamic exports, before business
investment started to form the second pillar
of the cyclical upturn in mid-2004. The basis
for growth strengthened and broadened in
the past year, as private consumption and
housing construction, which are quantitatively
important components of domestic demand,
turned positive. When observing its course,
the ongoing upswing matches the pattern
typically seen in Germany. However, in terms
of the underlying momentum and the dur-
ation of the recovery period hitherto, it is
marked partially by a sluggishness that may
be classified as exceptional by historical stand-
ards. Apart from last year’s anticipatory ef-
fects, which were generated by the increase
in the standard rate of VAT and the abolition
of the grant to homebuyers, the propensity of
households to spend has remained quite
subdued given that the economic upturn has
already lasted four years now,1and the under-
lying trend in housing construction is still
weak, too.
The retarding elements in the cyclical devel-
opment point to after-effects of reunification
and deeper-lying problems of the German
economy. Following the fall of the Iron Cur-
tain, it not only had to accomplish the trans-
formation of the economic system in eastern
Germany but also had to hold its ground in
the competition for products and production
locations which has become increasinglyfierce in view of the rapid catching-up pro-
cess pursued by transition countries and
emerging market economies. The abrupt and
often pressing challenges that also accom-
panied the reunification process in economic
terms tied up energies and resources during
the 1990s and, moreover, obscured the view
of the adverse implications stemming from
the, overall, too hesitant adjustment of the
German economy’s structure to the changed
global economic setting.
The economic performance of the 1990s,
which had begun promisingly with the unifi-
cation boom, was ultimately disappointing.
Already in the second half of that decade,
Germany was mostly ranked at the bottom of
the growth table of countries which now
constitute the euro area. Afterwards, with
the bursting of the “New Economy” bubble
and the occurrence of adverse shocks, the
German economy experienced a stagnation
which lasted three years. During that period,
numerous full-time jobs subject to social
security contributions were lost. In particular,
the large hard core of unemployment and the
overstrained social security schemes became
a persistent burden on the economy and soci-
ety. The necessity of making adjustments in
the areas of economic, social and wage policy
was becoming ever more apparent.
The unfavourable price competitiveness pos-
ition in which German enterprises found
themselves in the mid-1990s had to be cor-
rected partly under the conditions of the

37monetary union by the arduous adjustment
process of a moderate wage and price devel-
opment.2The fairly long period of marked
wage moderation began at that time. This
strategy helped to restore Germany’s dimin-
ished attractiveness as a location for invest-
ment and production.3Furthermore, in order
to cut production costs, firms used the oppor-
tunity of offshoring labour-intensive stages of
the production chain, which initially intensi-
fied the problems in the labour market.4At
the peak of the economic crisis in 2003, the
Federal Government of the time introduced
first reform steps as part of its Agenda 2010
and what is known as “Hartz legislation” in
order to modernise outdated labour market
structures and to lower the high employment
threshold of economic growth.
Potential output path and labour market
It seems appropriate to make a connection
between the strong expansion in the total
number of hours worked observable since
early 2006, especially in the business sector,
and the wage and economic policy efforts to
break up the hardened structures on the la-
bour market. When calculating the growth
potential, however, the cyclical revival has to
be separated analytically from the structural
improvement. Moreover, the positive overall
effect on potential output is not confined
solely to labour since interactions exist be-
tween labour market developments and fixed
capital formation.5In addition, a major part
of technological progress is embodied in
capital, which means that, through fixed in-
vestment, the degree of the economy’s mod-ernity is also likely to have benefited from the
improved interaction of labour and capital.
Above all, the “promote and push” principle
of the Agenda 2010, the introduction of a
means-tested basic allowance for persons
able to work, and the strengthening of the
risk insurance nature of unemployment bene-
fit were important guidelines and measures
of the reform agenda that has been imple-
mented by economic policymakers since
2003. Furthermore, the correction of gener-
ous early retirement schemes and the gradual
raising of the statutory retirement age have
removed the previous reduction in the labour
supply. Since they have also contributed to
the financial stabilisation of the social security
systems, leeway was created for a lowering
of the high tax wedge, which, owing to the
reduced additional burden of taxation, has
had a positive influence on the supply of and
demand for labour. “Mini-jobs” and “midi-
jobs” as well as a flexible use of temporary
employment have simplified (re-)entry into
the labour market. In this way, some propor-
tion of the inactive part of the working-age
population is also likely to have been encour-
aged to take up employment. In terms of
negotiated pay policy, it was important that

38the recent corrections in the wage structure
and increased degrees of freedom for enter-
prises have established a sound basis for the
effectiveness of the reform measures. This
applies, not least, to working time schedules.
The flexibility granted, together with longer
working hours in some cases, has directly en-
larged the potential deployment of labour
and has improved its time availability, which is
now also counteracting the risk of a potential
shortage of specialised labour. Indirectly, the
improved working hour arrangements
allowed a higher utilisation of fixed capital.
Furthermore, longer working hours have
undoubtedly also alleviated the problem of
nominal wage rigidity and preserved the pur-
chasing power of labour income.
Since the reform measures, as a whole, can
be used either to increase the willingness to
take up a job and thus reduce the length of
time spent in unemployment or in the in-
active part of the labour force or to make a
higher labour input attractive for enterprises,
positive effects on potential output in terms
of a positive level shift may be expected. This
applies even when taking into account the
fact that, from a macroeconomic perspective,
the statistically measured average labour
productivity is being dampened by (re-)inte-
grating persons from so-called problem
groups into the labour market. A similar
short-term effect is that the pressure to
rationalise, which is reflected by an acceler-
ated capital deepening, has now become less
of an acute issue and that there has been a
clear shift in investment motives towards the
enlargement of capacities. All in all, in the
past few years it has been possible to increaseemployment intensity without impairing the
actual basic conditions for economic growth.
In reality, however, the adjustment to the
new, higher trend path of total output will
also take place as a function of cyclical influ-
ences over a longer period of time, which
means that temporarily stronger growth rates
may be expected for the convergence period.
This is also the case because experience
shows that room for manoeuvre which has
been created is exploited only gradually.
Disaggregated estimation of potential
output on the basis of production theory
The potential output of an economy cannot
be determined exactly. The uncertainty is
increased further if the estimation – as in the
present case – relates to a period of adjust-
ment to a setting of broadened economic
flexibility, in particular to new labour market
structures, which has not yet been com-
pleted. The effectiveness of the reform meas-
ures to make the labour market more flexible
can be assessed only provisionally at present,
especially as no reliable findings concerning
the sustainability of the effects are available.
In economic analysis, numerous measures
and procedures are applied in order to esti-
mate the potential output of an economy.6
Technically speaking, it is obtained by extract-
ing the trend component from real gross
domestic product (GDP). Against this back-
ground, it seems self-evident to use statistical

39filtering techniques that generally adjust the
time series for those (stylised) fluctuationswhich, owing to their frequency, are generallyto be ascribed to the business cycle, the sea-sonal pattern or an irregular component. Incontrast to these purely statistical techniques,methods based on production theory are ap-plied as an alternative. At their core is thetheoretical construct of an aggregated pro-duction function with several input factors.Even though this approach can, in practice,hardly work without smoothing the basic ser-ies needed, it is to be seen as an advantagethat the potential output can be traced backto major economic determinants. This prop-erty is especially important in the present con-text, as the direct effects of the structural re-forms can be integrated into the estimationof the potential output through the trendcomponent of hours worked. Furthermore,the interactions between labour, on the onehand, and productivity and fixed capital for-mation, on the other, can – at least in part –also be considered.
In general, however, the foundation in pro-
duction theory does not fit every economicsector equally. From a conceptual point ofview, it is fundamentally appropriate for thesector of market-oriented production enter-prises. In the case of public and private ser-vice providers, however, the necessary pre-conditions for a production function ap-proach are effectively not met because thissector is predominantly characterised by non-market production, which is statisticallymeasured by input developments to a largeextent. In addition, real estate and healthcareare treated separately in the analysis owing tothe specific properties of the economic devel-
opment of each subcomponent as comparedwith the respective main sector.
At the centre of the disaggregated approach
to potential output estimation is the businesssector excluding real estate, which comprisesthe production sector, trade, transportationand communication, hotels and restaurantsas well as commercial service providers (ac-cordingly, excluding real estate), and whichproduces about two-thirds of the Germaneconomy’s output (valued at basic prices).Using simplified assumptions regarding thefactor substitutionality, the output of thiscore segment is generated by the two pri-mary factors of production, which are labourand capital, with the production functionshowing constant returns to scale and auto-

40nomous technological progress being per-
mitted through total factor productivity (TFP).
Labour services are measured by the sector’s
amount of hours worked, while capital ser-
vices are approximated by the sector’s capital
stock (excluding residential buildings). The
potential output growth of the business sec-
tor (excluding real estate) is obtained by
smoothing the rates of change of the factors
of production as well as TFP and linking them
via Solow’s growth accounting equation. For
an estimation of the medium to long-term
growth prospects, perfect competition in the
goods and factor markets is assumed, making
it possible to use the sectoral labour income
share as a weighting factor for determining
the growth contributions.In the branches of the business sector under
consideration, fixed capital formation has
picked up perceptibly over the past three
years in the wake of the renewed strong
demand for machinery and equipment as
well as for commercial buildings, with the
latter showing something of a time lag. In
purely arithmetical terms, the contribution of
the business sector’s capital stock to the
total-economy potential output growth may
amount to, on average, just over1/C254percent-
age point in this and the coming year, which
is a noticeable increase compared with the
first half of the decade. According to the
estimate, the TFP contribution will go down
somewhat from the relatively high level of
the preceding year. The dampening effect of
the labour input which has persisted for sev-
eral years seems to be fading away at the
current juncture. Given the steadily negative
contributions, which have been lowering
potential output growth by up to1/C254percent-
age point annually since 1991, this finding is
something conspicuously new in the eco-
nomic development of Germany as a whole.
The production of the real estate sector,
which yields just over one-tenth of GDP , is
modelled by means of a fixed-proportions
production function, with the stock of dwell-
ings serving as the determining factor of pro-
duction. The long-lasting adjustment crisis,
which corrected the exaggerations in housing
construction in the aftermath of German
reunification, as well as the unfavourable
demographic outlook have left visible marks
of a slowdown in the capital accumulation of
this sector. Not least owing to the typically
long service life of residential buildings, this1991 = 100, log scale

41will limit the growth outlook of the real estate
sector in the longer term.
In the area of public and private services,
which contribute just over one-fifth toGerman GDP , the assumption of a traditionalproduction function is conceptionally unsuit-able for the reasons cited. Nevertheless, thevalue added generated by public and privateservice providers is generally likely to be sub-ject to both permanent and temporary influ-ences. Besides its intensity, however, the tran-sitory component of this sector differs fromthe cycles in the business sector mainly inthat it reflects politically initiated or controlledadjustment processes rather than market-driven cyclical movements. According to thestructure of the national accounts, the eco-nomic sector of public and private serviceproviders – apart from quantitatively subor-dinate household services – comprises foursub-segments, whose shares of value addedare similar in size.
Owing to its growth dynamics, healthcare as-
sumes a special position and is therefore dealtwith separately in the estimation of potentialoutput. Until 2003, this subsector was ex-panding very sharply, which – leaving asideeconomic policy mismanagement – is gener-ally linked to the fact that, first, demand forhealthcare services increases more than pro-portionately with rising income and, second,advances in medical technology also promotea relatively strong growth in services in thisarea from the supply side. The healthcarereform, which entered into force on 1 January2004, dampened the steep trend with a viewto curbing the cost explosion in the socialsecurity systems; however, this should not
place in doubt the intrinsic dynamics of thistypical growth market in the longer term.Given the demographic outlook, the demandfor healthcare products is more likely to growin importance, and medical and pharmaceut-ical progress remains desirable.
7
In the estimation procedure, the growth pos-sibilities of the healthcare sector are set at thetrend rate of the business sector plus a mark-up rate which takes account of the fact thatdemand for healthcare services tends to in-crease more than proportionately with risingincome. At roughly 1 percentage point, themark-up is comparatively low in this and thefollowing year. The supply of public and pri-vate services excluding healthcare is approxi-mated by the developments in employmentin these sectors. The constraints of budgetconsolidation have had to be taken into ac-count regarding the trend in public spendingin recent years. Among private service pro-viders, flexibility measures in the area ofservices to households are having a positiveimpact, but these are quantitatively of minorsignificance relative to the macroeconomicissue in question.
Finally, account has to be taken of a residual
component, which makes up roughly one-tenth of GDP (at market prices). This com-ponent contains economic sectors such asagriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing,which are not modelled separately owing totheir minor quantitative importance for the

a wedge between the sum of the gross value

prices and GDP at market prices.9
Estimation results and interpretation
According to the estimates, the potential out-
put of the whole economy is likely to expand
this year and in the coming year by about
11/C252%t o13/C254% respectively, compared with
potential output growth of no more than
around 11/C254%t o11/C252% annually between
2003 and 2006. At the current juncture, it is
thus tending to move back towards rates that
characterised the German growth trend in
the second half of the 1990s. The improve-
ment should thus also be seen as part of a
return to normal. While, at the start of this
decade, the market-based sectors as well as
public and private services contributed to the
flattening of the trend path of output, the
current strengthening of potential output
growth stems primarily from the business
sector. Real estate is showing an exceptional
development with a continuing decrease in
contributions to potential output growth. On
the whole, the public and private services
sector is providing no new impulses for the
aggregate supply.
In order to estimate the direct effect of the la-
bour market reforms on potential output
growth, the trend path of hours worked in
the business sector was adjusted from 2003
onwards so that, despite the extremely strongrecovery characterising the actual develop-
ment of this variable since 2006, no major
elements of tension are signalled at the cur-
rent juncture. In this and the coming year, this
is undoubtedly a realistic assumption for the
German labour market as a whole. The trend
path without this “constraint” is considered
in comparison, which, in the context of the
potential output estimation, corresponds to
the hypothetical case of a scenario without
labour market reforms. With regard to the
direct effect, it should also be taken into ac-
count that the more favourable trend in
hours worked is likely to be accompanied by
a weaker development in aggregate product-
ivity. The sharp rise in the number of “mini-
jobs” and “midi-jobs” mainly in 2003-04 and
the ensuing rise in temporary work, which
has been used mostly for jobs with a low and
medium skills profile, allow the assumption
that lower-skilled workers benefit to a consid-
erable extent from greater flexibility in the la-
bour market. Even if the TFP contribution
therefore turns out to be somewhat weak-
er,10the net effect on potential output should
8In the national accounts, taxes on products are produc-
tion and import taxes that are payable per unit of a good
or service produced or transacted (for example, sales tax,
insurance tax, real property transfer tax). The subsidies
payable per unit of a good or service produced or trans-
acted are deducted from this.
9In terms of production theory, the net taxes on prod-
ucts should not be able to have an effect on the potential
output of an economy. The value added by all the eco-
nomic sectors at basic prices would thus be the suitable
reference for measuring the production potential. In
practice, however, the estimations of potential output
are generally based on GDP at market prices, which
means that, for reasons of comparability, an average con-
tribution of the net taxes on products enters into the esti-
mation of the growth potential.
10These are changes to the average hourly productivity
which are due to shifts in the employment structure.
Productivity effects that are based on an adjustment of
the capital deepening, on the other hand, do not come

the indirect effect on potential outputthrough fixed capital formation is based onthe consideration that, in a growth equilib-rium, the additional persons in employmentare supplied with capital according to theirlabour efficiency and the optimal factor inputcombination, with adjustment measures ofthis kind typically being time-lagged andpartial.
Owing to the direct and indirect effects of the
labour market reforms, the potential outputof the German economy is estimated to growthis year and in the coming year by just under
1/C255percentage point more than in the hypo-
thetical scenario without increased labourmarket flexibility. On account of the adjust-ment process towards an equilibrium withlow structural unemployment, potential out-
put growth is currently showing annual ratesabove the 1
1/C252% mark again. In this context,
the indirect interactions via fixed capital for-mation are becoming increasingly important.In the period between 2004 and 2006, bycontrast, the direct effect was most effectiveand helped to stabilise potential outputgrowth at annual rates of between 1
1/C254% and
11/C252%.
In spite of the strengthening of the supply-
side forces of growth, the dynamic upturn,which is currently characterising the Germaneconomy, is mainly of a cyclical nature. Theoutput gap, which was still above 2% of pro-duction capacity in 2005, was reduced byover 1 percentage point last year. The declinehas continued so far this year.

44German economy is likely to be within the
corridor of normal utilisation at present, al-
though – from a sectoral point of view –
there are still discernable substantial differ-
ences in the degree of capacity utilisation. In
view of the cyclical position that has now
been reached, there is still a good outlook for
the upswing. This is all the more the case as
the medium-term growth prospects have also
brightened owing to the fact that the trend ismore favourable again. This should be espe-
cially helpful for the development of private
propensity to consume, which has been sub-
dued for a number of years.
Following the weakening during the lengthy
period of stagnation there are now clear signs
of a regeneration of potential output growth
in Germany. This is revealed not only by a
higher trend rate. It is just as noteworthy that
the medium-term path of economic activity
has also improved in quality, meaning that
the strengthening of the growth process is
stemming from the business sector by means
of an increased level of fixed capital forma-
tion and structurally higher labour input. By
contrast, the need for adjustment in real es-
tate has still had a dampening effect. Added
to this were the consolidation and restructur-
ing requirements in the government sector,
which, in turn, nevertheless constituted a
major precondition for structural improve-
ments in the business sector.
The documented procyclical reaction of po-
tential output is not the outcome of purely
statistical filtering techniques, which, by con-
struction, regularly produce such results at
the end of the sample. Rather, it can be ex-
plained economically by the reduction of
structural shortcomings in the labour market.
Seen in this light, the labour market reforms
implemented since 2003 have been a major
step in the right direction. As a necessary sup-
plement, it has bolstered wage policy which
has geared more strongly towards raising em-
ployment and improving the attractiveness of
domestic production sites. In their current
stage, however, these reforms are not suffi-%

A trendrate of 2% annually, which should by nomeans be regarded as too ambitious in themedium term, is currently not in sight despitea positive development in actual output. Thisrequires staying power in reform policy. Anextended pause in reform or even a watering-down of the measures already implementedwould again jeopardise the ground strenu-

Inparticular, the fundamental character ofunemployment insurance as risk insuranceshould be retained and the incentives fortaking up employment should be furtherstrengthened.

47Reform of German
budgetary rulesGovernment debt in Germany has
steadily increased over recent decades.
The debt ceiling of 60% of GDP estab-
lished for euro-area countries has also
been clearly exceeded for some years
now. Owing to the ageing of society,
the pay-as-you-go social security sys-
tems will place an additional burden
on future generations. It is therefore
widely recognised that a reform of
the national budgetary rules is neces-
sary in order to curb government debt.
There are several different possible ap-
proaches to achieving this. With the
adoption of the European Stability and
Growth Pact, which provides an im-
portant basis for euro-area monetary
policy, a first step was taken in favour
of attaining a structural budget pos-
ition that is at least close to balance.
The impact of cyclical fluctuations can
still be cushioned by the automatic sta-
bilisers and the pact also allows more
room for manoeuvre in exceptional cir-
cumstances. In order to strengthen the
binding effect of the established limits,
clear and comprehensible regulations
in both the federal constitution and
those of the individual states appear to
be equally as important as transparent
short and medium-term budget plans
and explanations of deviations from
the plan. Infringements could then be
easily identified and, as a result,
promptly corrected.

48The development of government debt
Government debt has increased significantly
since the Federal Republic of Germany was
founded. Starting from a level equivalent to
310 billion in 1950, it had risen to 364 billion
by 1970. However, growth in gross domestic
product (GDP) was somewhat stronger still,
meaning that the debt-to-GDP ratio de-
creased slightly overall to just under 18%. In
the years that followed, however, the debt
ratio increased markedly. At the end of 1985,
central, state and local government liabilities
already amounted to nearly 3390 billion, al-
most 40% of GDP . This ratio remained virtual-
ly unchanged until the end of the 1980s,
after which it experienced a sharp increase in
the wake of the unification of Germany. The
reference value of 60%, which was intro-
duced in 1992 in connection with the negoti-
ations regarding European monetary union,
was exceeded for the first time in 1998 (ac-
cording to current data). The debt level then
continued to increase steadily above this
threshold with an interruption in 2000 and
2001, when the ample proceeds from the
sale of UMTS licences were used to redeem
part of the debt. Large government deficits in
the years that followed caused the debt ratio
to rise to almost 68% by 2005. In 2006, des-
pite very strong growth in nominal GDP and a
marked decrease in the deficit ratio, there
was only a very limited reduction in the debt
ratio and the debt level increased to almost
31,570 billion.
Debt evolution varied considerably on the
various levels of government. Up until the
early 1970s, local government liabilities rosesignificantly faster than those of central gov-
ernment, almost reaching the same level.
Subsequently, debt growth accelerated – pri-
marily in central government but also signifi-
cantly in the federal states – while the devel-
opment in local government was distinctly
more subdued overall. The rate of increase di-
verged widely across the individual states. At
320,300, the debt level per capita in Bremen
at the end of last year was six-and-a-half
times as high as in Bavaria (including the local
government level). However, just over three-
fifths of government liabilities are currently
attributable to the central government
budget (including its subsidiary budgets),
thus increasing central government’s share by
20 percentage points compared with 1973.As % of GDP

49Both past experience and politico-economic
rationale (see box on page 50) suggest that in
political praxis government debt is frequently
incurred on a scale that is later considered ex-
cessive. A particularly important factor in this
regard is the fact that future burdens result-
ing from the incurrence of liabilities are often
not fully reflected in calculations, thus placing
an excessive strain on future generations of
tax payers. In the run-up to elections, for in-
stance, there is an additional incentive to sat-
isfy the wishes of certain vested interest
groups through increased borrowing. In this
respect, establishing budgetary rules in ad-
vance can counteract the tendency towards
credit financing. Introducing such budgetary
rules can therefore be justified in a similar
way to the transfer of monetary policy re-
sponsibility to an independent central bank.
Existing rules to curb borrowing
The German Basic Law of 1949 already con-
tained a rule for curbing central government
borrowing, which was largely based on its
forerunner in the Weimar Imperial Constitu-
tion. Article 115 of the Basic Law originally
only permitted borrowing “in cases of excep-
tional need and, as a rule, only for expend-
iture having a productive purpose”. The latter
was to be understood as costs that would ef-
fectively finance themselves through higher
central government revenue in the following
years. Borrowing was thus always object-
based. However, this provision was some-
times interpreted much more loosely than the
legislators intended, not least by stretching
the definition of “exceptional need”.1A standard borrowing limit linked to invest-
ment expenditure was then introduced in the
late 1960s with the reform of the fiscal con-
stitution. In addition, the management of
macroeconomic activity based on Keynesian
ideas was included as one of the constitution-
al objectives. Thereafter, the requirements for
maintaining the macroeconomic equilibrium
were to be taken into account in the budget
pursuant to Article 109 (2) of the Basic Law.
Success in overcoming an economic slow-
down in the second half of the 1960s was a
contributory factor in the legislators’ decision
when amending the Basic Law to allow the
borrowing limit to be exceeded if this is ne-
cessary in order to avert a disruption of theDM bn € bn

50Possible justifications for and necessary limits of government borrowing
Fundamentally the attainment of a fair balance of
intergenerational burden-sharing can be seen as a
justification for government borrowing. The argu-
ment behind this is that future generations will also
benefit from a part of today’s government spend-
ing and, therefore, should also contribute to its
financing. In line with this argument, a policy which
promotes growth and thus implies a deliberate ex-
pansion of economic output in the future could be
used to justify the transfer of financial burdens to
future generations. However, measures with posi-
tive growth effects cannot be reliably identified or
their effects quantified.
The argument that government assets will be
passed on to future generations has similar founda-
tions. According to this idea, incurring debt in order
to increase assets can be justified if the debt service
can be offset against a corresponding benefit accru-
ing from the stock of government assets accumu-
lated. However, depreciation must also be sub-
tracted from the value of the assets, so that net
investment must be the variable that sets the ceiling
for government borrowing. But it must be ques-
tioned whether the future generations obliged to
service these debts really will be able to draw the
benefit from these assets as is envisaged today. It
must also be remembered that government pur-
chases of non-financial assets tied to a specific use
may not be easily resellable and that their opera-
tion may involve significant costs. In the case of
financial assets it must be taken into account that
the loan portfolio, for example, often contains pro-
motional components and can only be sold at corre-
sponding discounts. Finally, it should be noted that
intergenerational burden-sharing is also subject to
significant – countervailing – influences from other
areas of the government budget (eg pay-as-you-go
statutory social security systems).
Whilst the arguments mentioned above aim to
justify structural borrowing, in the case of cyclically
induced borrowing the debt is only incurred tem-
porarily. In principle, it seems sensible not to offset
cyclical fluctuations in revenue and expenditure by
taking short-term countermeasures which may am-
plify the cyclical swings and distort allocation. This
makes it possible to cushion the cyclical fluctuationsby allowing government budgets to correspond-
ingly grow and contract. In the case of a symmetric
business cycle, the upward and downward influ-
ences on public finances largely cancel each other
out on average, so that the debt level ultimately
remains constant. While allowing the automatic
stabilisers to take effect is generally supported, ac-
tively managing the economy using targeted meas-
ures to stabilise the macroeconomic development is
often viewed more sceptically. Not least owing to
the long lags between the occurrence of a distur-
bance, its diagnosis, the adoption of countermeas-
ures and the effect of such measures, there is
significant doubt as to whether it is possible to
macro-manage the economy using active measures.
Furthermore, it has been shown that expansionary
impulses are generally more popular than making
cuts during an upturn, which is likely to have con-
tributed to the structural expansion of government
debt in the past.
Furthermore, specific exceptional circumstances
may justify borrowing. For example, major natural
disasters may impose strains on public finances, the
short-term correction of which requires tax rates to
be significantly increased on a temporary basis. In
order to avoid this and the associated macroeco-
nomic distortions, the prefinancing of special ex-
penditure burdens and the spread of the funding
over several years by temporarily incurring debt
seems justifiable in such a situation.
Essentially, however, the negative effects of high
government debt and the resulting interest rate
burden are always to be borne in mind. For exam-
ple, a very high level of debt servicing resulting
from debt accumulated in the past could raise
doubts as to whether the government is still able to
fulfil its tasks. The fear of future tax increases could
significantly inhibit the propensity to invest and
consume. In the event of spiralling government
debt, the capital market will demand risk premiums
(sometimes very abruptly) for government borrow-
ing, thus increasing budgetary strains. In extreme
cases, monetary policymakers may be pressurised to
ease the debt service burden by permitting higher
inflation. Monetary stability and economic growth
would then both be seriously endangered.

51macroeconomic equilibrium. In boom phases
in which there is a threat of strong price in-
creases, the rule established in Article 109 (2)
of the Basic Law should actually help to re-
duce government debt, thus preventing the
situation from snowballing. However, the
marked acceleration in the debt ratio growth
of central, state and local government since
the 1970s, which – as illustrated in the adja-
cent chart – was not accompanied by a rise in
total assets and thus led to an almost con-
tinuous decrease in net assets, suggests that
the introduction of this borrowing limit did
not have the desired dampening effect (see
the box on the shortcomings of Article 115 of
the Basic Law on pages 52 and 53).
In addition to the requirements of the Basic
Law, government budgets in Germany must
also meet European fiscal rules. With the
signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 in
preparation for monetary union, upper limits
were defined for the participating countries’
general government deficit and debt levels. A
reference value of 60% was agreed upon for
the debt-to-GDP ratio; should this be ex-
ceeded, it must be brought back towards the
reference value at a satisfactory pace. The
deficit, which is primarily calculated in ac-
cordance with the specifications of the na-
tional accounts, may not amount to more
than 3% of GDP . If a euro-area country ex-
ceeds the deficit limit for several years run-
ning, the Council of Finance Ministers may
impose a fine of up to 0.5% of GDP . In 1997,
the European Stability and Growth Pact set
down the aim of attaining over the course of
the business cycle budgetary positions which
were close to balance or in surplus, not leastin order to ensure a sufficient safety margin
below the 3% deficit limit. Given the moder-
ate trend growth and the strains that will be
placed on future budgets owing to the age-
ing of the population, Germany’s express aim
is to achieve a structurally balanced budget.2
The debate on redefining the central
government borrowing limit
Experience over the past decades has shown
that rules restricting government borrowing
should be as clear and transparent as possible
in order to restrict opportunities to circum-
vent them and to make monitoring compli-
ance easier. The rules should state that theAs % of GDP

52Deutsche BundesbankShortcomings of Article 115 of the Basic Law
The sharp increase in central government debt since
the constitutional framework of the German public
finance system was reformed at the end of the 1960s
has been facilitated by the definition of the borrow-
ing rule. Article 115 (1) second sentence of the Basic
Law (Grundgesetz) specifies the investment expendi-
ture envisaged in the budget plan as the net borrow-
ing limit. This limit was only enshrined in law follow-
ing the request of the Federal Constitutional Court
from 1989. While the judges evidently had a stricter
delimitation in mind, the definition in use at the time
was selected as the standard. Thus the current bor-
rowing limit is usually determined by the budget esti-
mates for total expenditure on construction invest-
ment, acquisitions of tangible fixed assets and partici-
pating interests, loans, utilised underwriting commit-
ments as well as investment grants to the public and
private sector (the main categories 7 and 8 in the bud-
get classification table).
An assessment of the impact of the aforementioned
expenditure on government assets shows that deci-
sions regarding central government’s financial invest-
ments are generally not made on the basis of maximis-
ing returns. For example, participating interests in de-
velopment aid associations generate almost no finan-
cial returns and loans which are often granted for
promotional purposes generally only lead to repay-
ments that are significantly lower than the cost of
financing. In the case of utilised underwriting com-
mitments, a decline in the share of sovereign debtors
appears to suggest that it is increasingly uncertain
whether repayments can be expected at all. The
growth in government assets, at least, clearly lags be-
hind expenditure. Investment grants to enterprises
cause a rise in value outside the general government
sector. Investment subsidies for public entities, such as
Deutsche Bahn (principal railways operator), raise
government assets only slightly, if at all, owing to the
limited market returns of the national rail infrastruc-
ture.
Another critical point is the fact that neither the de-
preciation of central government’s stock of tangible
fixed assets, which, while not recorded in the camera-listic accounting system currently used in the public
sector, is ascertainable from the national accounts,
nor the proceeds from asset sales are deducted in or-
der to determine the borrowing limit. Hence such pro-
ceeds need not be used to repay old debt but are
available to finance current expenditure. This creates
an opening to circumvent the intention of the bor-
rowing cap laid down in Article 115 of the Basic Law.
Central government’s recent extensive asset sales indi-
cate that this opening is exploited to a considerable
extent.
The exemption clause of Article 115 (1) of the Basic
Law has also contributed greatly to the provision’s
fundamental ineffectiveness. It allows almost unlim-
ited overshooting of the borrowing limit if this is
deemed necessary to avert a disruption of the macro-
economic equilibrium. In its ruling from 1989, the Fed-
eral Constitutional Court demanded specific justifica-
tions for these cases. It said that evidence of a serious
and prolonged disruption of the macroeconomic
equilibrium, which is generally regarded as unstable,
would have to exist and the additional borrowing
– and hence the amount chosen – would have to be
appropriate for stabilisation purposes. However, over
the period from 2002 to 2004 alone the exemption
clause was invoked four times without this notably
improving the development of the German economy
or the labour market. Against this background the
Federal Constitutional Court, in its judgement from
July 2007 on the 2004 Federal budget, declared the
existing borrowing limit to be broadly ineffective
overall. The majority of the judges felt that they could
rule out neither the existence of a disruption of the
macroeconomic equilibrium that merits action nor the
suitability of central government measures to avert
such a disruption. While the credit financing of an ac-
celerated tax cut could still be regarded as an active
measure in the 2004 regular budget, simply maintain-
ing this course was reason enough for the court to
approve the supplementary budget with a planned
overshooting of the borrowing limit by a total of
518 billion.

53An additional cause for concern is that, pursuant to
section 18 (3) of the Federal Budgetary Regulation(Bundeshaushaltsordnung) , borrowing authorisations
that have not yet been used remain valid until at leastthe end of the following financial year and, in thebudget implementation process, are often used firstto pre-empt their expiry. In 2004 the reserve of resi-dual borrowing authorisations which had accumu-lated over the previous years was further topped upby invoking the exemption clause. The extensive useof these borrowing authorisations (approximately 39
billion) in the course of implementing the 2005 Fed-eral budget meant that it was unnecessary to re-invoke the exemption clause so as to avert a disrup-tion of the macroeconomic equilibrium. This was pos-sible because the constitutional limit for central gov-ernment borrowing relates explicitly to the budgetadoption stage. If funding gaps occur when imple-menting the budget as a result of revenue shortfallsor unforeseen expenditure arising from benefitsbased on a legal entitlement, these can be plugged byusing residual borrowing authorisations without hav-ing to submit a supplementary budget which wouldrequire justifications for overshooting the borrowinglimit. Such a buffer of residual borrowing authorisa-tions means that policymakers can evade consolida-tion pressure by deliberately overstating revenue andunderstating expenditure on benefits. The leewayavailable, without violating the budgetary principlesof completeness and truthfulness enshrined in Article110 of the Basic Law, is considerable.
To date the Federal Constitutional Court has never de-
tected a violation of the borrowing limits in a Federalbudget. However, effective sanctions against a viola-tion do not appear possible either. By the time a rul-ing by the Federal Constitutional Court has been pro-mulgated, the budget in question has long beenadopted and the implementation can no longer bestopped. Public interest usually focuses on more cur-rent issues, meaning that the possible political falloutis likely to remain limited. The court can, admittedly,tighten the standards for future budgets. If the oppo-sition parties are confident that they will gain powerthen the incentive for such a procedure is limited,however. Thus in the past, parliamentary motions
against budgetary acts have occasionally beendropped following a change of government.
Another severe shortcoming of Article 115 of the Basic
Law is the second paragraph which revokes the borrow-ing limits for special Federal funds without qualifica-tion. This paragraph was originally intended to provideenterprises that are managed in this form with a rela-tively large degree of freedom. In the case of DeutscheBundespost (Federal post office), the debts were laterassigned to its successor enterprises. By contrast,Deutsche Bahn’s liabilities of almost 340 billion were
transferred to the Federal Railways Fund in the mid-1990s and taken over by central government in 1999. Inaddition, at the beginning of the 1990s, the “GermanUnity” Fund and the Treuhand agency were establishedto provide the necessary financial resources for the in-jection of start-up funds into state and local govern-ment in eastern Germany and for the privatisation ofGDR state-owned enterprises, mainly by means of debtfinancing. In 1995 the Treuhand agency, which wasrecorded outside the general government sector, waslikewise integrated into a special Federal fund – theRedemption Fund for Inherited Liabilities – with debtstotalling over 3100 billion with the intention to repay
the debt from the Federal budget within one genera-tion. In mid-1999 central government took on joint re-sponsibility for these liabilities and they thus becamecentral government debt. The liabilities from the “Ger-man Unity” Fund, which were to be partly serviced bythe state governments, were also integrated into cen-tral government debt from 2005 (with an exceptionclause for possible remaining debt) as part of the re-form of the state government revenue-sharing scheme.In 2007 central government also took on the debtsfrom the ERP Special Fund. These actions were not re-garded as central government borrowing under thecurrent budgetary rules. The possibility of circumvent-ing borrowing limits by forming special funds or – as isthe case of the ERP Special Fund – by integrating boththe debts and the realisable assets into the Federal bud-get reduces the pressure to consolidate but only for alimited time. However, the consequence of this is last-ingly higher debt levels.

54overshooting of limits must be reversed in
order to prevent an undesirable lasting in-
crease in debt levels and strategic behaviour
in the budget process. Rule-based adjustment
mechanisms that aid in reducing deficits and
debt could also be helpful in this context. In
order to prevent the budgetary rules from for-
cing policymakers to act procyclically and to
ensure that they have some radius of action
in particularly turbulent times, permitting a
limited margin of debt incurrence in certain
situations would seem advisable. Transparent
and meaningful short and medium-term
budget plans as well as statements of ac-
count regarding deviations from said plans
are of particular importance both as a basis
for parliamentary decisions and in providing
the general public with information.
A tightening of the borrowing limit set in Art-
icle 115 of the Basic Law, whereby only in-
vestment expenditure that leads to a net in-
crease in government assets would be taken
into account when determining maximum
permissible net borrowing, is currently being
considered with a view to curbing the long-
term accumulation of central government
debt.3Proceeds from asset sales and the de-
preciation of tangible fixed assets would thus
need to be deducted and rises in the market
value of the stock of government assets
might have to be added. In addition, at least
investment grants made to non-government
entities as well as the utilisation of underwrit-
ing commitments and the granting of loans
that have an important promotional element
would have to be excluded. The acquisition
of equity stakes would be fully countable as
investment only if a normal market rate of re-turn was expected. Such a definition would
exclude a large part of past investment ex-
penditure.
If the investment expenditure of 324.3 billion
contained in the draft federal budget for
2008 is adjusted, in a simplified way, for par-
ticipating interests ( 30.8 billion), loans to
other entities (primarily development aid,
31.7 billion in total), the utilisation of under-
writing commitments ( 31.1 billion) and grants
to other entities (especially enterprises and
foreign entities, 38.3 billion in total), just over
312 billion remain. If the proceeds from asset
sales ( 31.5 billion in loan repayments and
310.8 billion in privatisation proceeds) are
then also deducted, there is no scope left at
all to run a budget deficit. If, following a strict
interpretation of the net investment concept,
the total is additionally adjusted for the de-
preciation of central government’s tangible
fixed assets – which, according to the latest
national accounts figures, will amount to
around 35 billion – a surplus of the same
magnitude would actually be required in
order to prevent a further deterioration in the
central government asset position (see the
chart on page 55 for the fiscal year 2006).
Sizeable depreciation of tangible fixed assets
acquired using investment transfers to other
levels of government would likewise have to
be subtracted.
The introduction of a stricter, basically
investment-oriented deficit limit would be a
significant step forward and should lead to

55noticeably sounder public finances. At the
same time, it should be borne in mind thatthe definitions are debatable and that notleast the changes in the value of the assetstocks are likely to be controversial. Thus, aborrowing limit based on the concept of netinvestment would only partially fulfil the cri-teria of transparency and clarity. There is rea-son to fear that the provisions would be inter-preted to suit the situation and would be dif-ficult for the general public to understand.
By contrast, gearing national fiscal rules to
the European Stability and Growth Pact, fromwhich the Federal Government derived itsaim of a zero structural deficit for Germany’sgeneral government budget, would offermore clarity. This objective could be enshrinedin the German Basic Law, thus explicitly re-inforcing the European agreement, whichwas designed to ensure monetary stability,and allowing Germany to set an importantexample in this respect. This could also be away of increasing the propensity of the statesto adapt their borrowing limits in a similarfashion.
In view of the European regulations, the task
of calculating the fiscal balance under the na-tional budgetary rules could also be based ona definition close to that used in the nationalaccounts. Under this definition, transactionsinvolving government financial assets (eg thegranting of loans or the sale of participatinginterests) are disregarded when calculatingthe deficit. Privatisation proceeds, which haveoften been used to bridge budget gaps in thepast years, thus masking the true fiscal pos-ition, would no longer be counted towardsthe current financing resources. Moreover,
aligning budgetary definitions with the na-tional accounts would also be advantageousin that international standards (ESA 95) haveto be observed when booking a transactionthat does not affect the deficit and this obser-vance is critically monitored by the StatisticalOffice of the European Communities (Euro-stat). Adopting such a quasi-national ac-counts definition could ensure that conflictswith the European fiscal rules are avoidedeven after a possible changeover to a budgetsystem based on commercial accounting.

56Borrowing above the established limit could
be generally permissible in the event of a nat-
ural disaster or serious crisis. A significantly
greater degree of approval could be made a
legal requirement for these cases. This would
obviate the need for an exact definition of
such contingencies.
A reform of the budgetary rules should in-
clude the aim of closing loopholes or possibil-
ities of circumventing the rules. Thus even
under a quasi-national accounts definition,
there is some discretionary latitude, eg by re-
placing direct grants with credit-financed pro-
motional loans, which in the end place a bur-
den on future budgets. It would have to be
examined whether these count as subsidies
and, where appropriate, they would have to
be booked as having an impact on the deficit.Another possible ploy to circumvent the rule
could be hiving expenditure off from the
budgets. To prevent the formation of off-
budget special funds which are authorised to
run up deficits, these funds would need to
have similarly strict limits. If structural deficits
were prohibited, greater use could be made
of public-private partnerships for financing
government infrastructure, which would, in
the end, come close to the kind of
investment-oriented deficit limit described
above. Under such agreements, private com-
panies take over the financing and running of
a government entity for an agreed period of
time in exchange for receiving fees and
charges. If this entity is returned to the gov-
ernment after the agreement expires, the
fees and charges include interest payments
and principal repayments as well as purchases
of services. The transaction thus shares simi-
larities with a loan. When concluding such
agreements, it must therefore be carefully
considered whether they will place too great
a burden on future budgets. Limits might
have to be set for the overall volume.5In gen-
eral, however, such agreements could help to
restrict the budgetary burden in the longer
term as they may only be concluded if the
cost-efficiency check pursuant to section 7 of
the Federal Budgetary Regulations shows that
they have cost advantages over a budget-
financed investment project. A crucial re-
quirement in this case, too, is transparent re-
porting which provides parliament and the€b n

57general public with an accurate picture of the
cost burdens entailed.
Regardless of whether the aim is to achieve a
balanced budget or to peg borrowing to netinvestment, it would appear sensible to allowthe automatic stabilisers to take effect. Thisimplies that the budgetary rules would needto be based on cyclically adjusted variables,preferably calculated by a standardised pro-cedure with minimal discretionary leeway. Inaddition, the strong fluctuations in revenuefrom profit-related taxes should be taken intoaccount – likewise using a standardised ap-proach. In some cases, these fluctuationshave no direct relationship with the macro-economic reference variables and are there-fore not classified as cyclically induced in thestandard procedure currently in use. It shouldbe noted that the underlying projection ofthe trend component is generally subject toex post revisions as the assessment of the fu-
ture development required for calculating atrend is inherently subject to uncertainty. If,for instance, the increase in potential outputis overestimated (as has often been the casein medium-term financial plans over the pastfew decades), low economic growth is initial-ly wrongly interpreted as a cyclical problem,when in fact it is a structural issue.
The budgetary rules must first be observed
during the budget preparation process. Oncethe budget is implemented, however, devi-ations from the plans can occur for a varietyof reasons. These may be strategically motiv-ated if, for example, revenue is deliberatelyoverestimated or expenditure underestimatedin order to ensure that the budget plan com-plies with the fiscal rules. But they may also
be due to “genuine” forecasting errors as, inparticular, the estimation of tax revenue andthe assessment of the macroeconomic situ-ation are fraught with all manner of uncer-tainties. Where smaller tolerance thresholdsare exceeded, borrowing in contravention ofthe rules would have to be combined withadjustment measures within the frameworkof a supplementary budget which should en-sure timely compliance with the rule (eg inthe next fiscal year) and possibly also repay-ment of the debt resulting from the under-budgeting. This could be particularly useful inreducing incentives for making unrealisticbudget estimates. For individual volatile cat-egories, it might be expedient to stagger thiscompulsory correction rather than requiring acorrection of deviations from the budget planin the very next fiscal year. This would be con-ceivable, for instance, with respect to the taxrevenue level adjusted for the cyclical and ex-ceptional fluctuations in profit-related taxes.The rules could include a mandatory path forreducing both positive and negative devi-ations, which would tend to lead to a shock-absorbing fiscal stance (see also the annex onpages 63 to 68).
In the case of unbiased plans and forecasts,
missed targets should generally balancethemselves out over a longer period of timeand should not result in any systematicgrowth in debt. At the same time, thereshould be continuous reporting on the debtdevelopment and the factors behind it, notleast in order to minimise the incentives forstrategic misbudgeting by increasing trans-parency. Another possibility would be to

58make repayment of the accumulated debt
compulsory when a given ceiling is overshot.
A longer period of time could be allowed for
this.
Should the budgetary rules initially allow in-
debtedness owing to errors in assessing the
macroeconomic development or other un-
anticipated developments, they would need
to be linked with more stringent require-
ments – possibly involving institutional
changes – for budget planning and monitor-
ing as well as the underlying forecasts. Trans-
parent and comprehensible short and
medium-term budget plans and regular pub-
lic evaluations of budget implementation and
deviations from plan are particularly import-
ant in this respect.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of the
rules, the procedures for monitoring compli-
ance with the borrowing limit should be
made more stringent. Stipulations ensuring
sufficient corrections in the event that the
rules are breached are also required. Parlia-
ment should then examine the extent to
which the draft budgets and the medium-
term budget plans comply with the stipula-
tions in that sufficient concrete and possibly
rule-bound countermeasures have been an-
nounced or are already being implemented.6
Revision of borrowing limits for state
government
A similar tightening of borrowing limits to
that described for central government would
also seem logical for state government, espe-cially as the implicit debt guarantees among
central and state government could be pro-
viding an additional borrowing incentive. In
the city-states, the debt per capita even ex-
ceeds that of central government, while in
many non-city states the increase over the
past few years likewise gives cause for con-
cern given the massive civil servant pension
costs which are foreseeable for the future.
Even if the market alternative mentioned in
the discussion on curbing borrowing levels
(which is seemingly not currently being pur-
sued further in this reform) were to be imple-
mented – according to which the state gov-
ernment implicit debt guarantees would be
dissolved in favour of capital market deter-
rents to pursuing an unsound fiscal policy in
the form of higher interest rates and credit
rationing (see the box on pages 60 and 61) –
a tightening of the budgetary rules for state
government seems warranted. However,
given their very different starting positions
(see the chart on page 59), it is currently un-
clear whether the federal states will willingly
commit to an ambitious constitutional provi-
sion. In particular, the high debt burden of
certain states and, in some cases, ongoing
deficits make the acceptance of tougher
regulations more difficult. Therefore, it has
been suggested that central government take
on all state government debt coupled with a
reweighting of turnover tax shares in order to
offset the extra costs to central government.
However, following the Federal Constitution-
al Court’s most recent ruling on the budget

59situation in Berlin, which expressly under-
scored the states’ own responsibility, thisseems problematic. Federal states with a highlevel of debt would thus be able to pass theblame for past fiscal policy mistakes on to theother states and their current consolidationefforts might also flag at the prospect of sucha move. A less radical approach would be aone-off transfer of part of the old debt at theend of a past reference year to central gov-ernment along with the amount of turnovertax shares required for the correspondinginterest payments in the context of tighteningthe rules.
Cyclical effects should be taken into account
with respect to budgetary rules for state gov-ernment, too. This could be achieved alongthe lines of the rules for central governmentdiscussed above. Alternatively, central gov-
ernment could shoulder the effects of cyclicalfluctuations in their entirety by guaranteeingthe states tax revenue amounting to a certainshare of trend-GDP .
7However, the concrete
implementation of this would involve numer-ous practical problems. Moreover, it wouldhave to be ensured that sufficient importanceis placed on regional economic developmentso that there is an incentive for nurturing theregional economies. If such a system were im-plemented, the state government budgetswould be largely shielded from cyclical effectsand it would not be necessary to take them€ per capita

60Deuts che Bun desbankThe disciplinin g effe ct of ﬁ  nan cial markets on government budgetary poli cy
Fis cal deﬁ cits are, as a general rule, ﬁ  nan ced by borrow-
ing on the capital markets. The creditworthiness of sover-
eign borrowers is reﬂ  ected in the re quire d interest rates. If 
market parti cipants have dou bts a bout whether the debt 
will be servi ced pun ctually, owin g to what they per ceive 
to be an in creasin gly pro blemati c ﬁ scal development, they 
will re quire hi gher interest rates for new government debt. 
Increasin g risk premiums make credit ﬁ nan cing less attra c-
tive an d can thus contri bute to limitin g it (“market disci-
pline”). This aspe ct also has a bearin g on the discussion on 
reformin g the budgetary rules in Germany an d avoi ding 
federal states experien cing budgetary har dship.
A prere quisite for the fun ctionin g of market discipline, 
however, is that investors re quire state-spe ciﬁ c premiums 
on issue d debt instruments, as they will assess the default 
risk, in parti cular, of heavily in debted federal states as bein g 
higher than for states with a soun d ﬁ nan cial poli cy an d a 
low level of debt. At present, this is not really the case. 
While a hi gher per capita  debt does ten d to be asso ciate d 
with a hi gher bon d return (see the tren d line in the a djacent 
chart), the differen ce is fairly small.1 The ratin g agen cies 
estimate the current creditworthiness of the fe deral states 
to be at least goo d. The fa ct that investors do not re quire 
signiﬁ cant risk premiums, despite the in depen den ce of the 
federal states‘ budgetary poli cy (Arti cle 109 (1) of the Basi c 
Law) an d, in some cases, a hi gh debt level an d no strin gent 
borrowin g limit in the state government constitution, may 
ultimately be due to the fa ct that, given the constitutional 
rules, they assume that the central government an d the 
federation of states will provi de bail-out payments. This is 
supporte d by past assistan ce given to states that have foun d 
themselves in “a cute budgetary har dship”, even thou gh in 
200 6 the Fe deral Constitutional Court un ders core d the in di-

The national fe deral stru cture therefore nee ds credible 
arran gements for limitin g lia bility if the ﬁ  nan cial markets 
are to exert the re quire d disciplinin g effe ct. These coul d 
relate either to the whole or just part of the debt. The

61debt situations. Overall, the at least partial a bolition of the 
inter governmental assistan ce s cheme woul d mean that 
even fe deral states with better budgetary positions may 
also in cur hi gher ﬁ  nan cing costs (owin g to the a bolition of 
central government lia bility, banks ’ obligation to back risk

Nevertheless, ﬁ  nan cial markets are likely to deman d sig-
niﬁ cant risk premiums only if investors a ctually expe ct 
per cepti ble losses if a fe deral state defaults. The non- bail-
out commitment woul d therefore have to be credible. The 
credibility can be questione d in two respe cts. Firstly, despite 
regulations to the contrary, investors coul d expe ct that in 
an emer gen cy central government an d the other fe deral 
states woul d want to avoi d the politi cal costs of insolven cy 
an d woul d therefore be prepare d to pay the debt. How-
ever, this politi cal in centive coul d be limite d by means of 
suita ble insolven cy le gislation, as exists, for example, for 
local government in the U SA.  Secon dly, investors mi ght 
hope that general government woul d help out if hi gh 
ma croe conomi c costs were expe cted (“too big to fail”). 
A fe deral state ’s default coul d lea d to ﬁ  nan cial market 
insta bility an d make it far more difﬁ cult for other govern-
ment authorities to borrow. This coul d be countera cted by 
ensurin g that creditors are involve d to a limite d extent in 
budgetary har dship events pre ceding a possi ble insolven cy. 
Overall, the credibility of the ex clusion of lia bility coul d also 
be in crease d by intro ducing suita ble insolven cy le gislation 
that provi des for burden-sharin g between creditors an d 
debtors in the event of a debt servi ce default an d ensures 
that the fe deral state continues to exist an d to carry out its 
constitutional tasks.
International experien ce in dicates that market discipline 
can be implemente d in fe deral states.5 Lo cal government 
insolven cy in, for example, the U SA is at the same time rare. 
In the cases that have o ccurre d, the insolven cy law re gu-
late d the sharin g of the burden between the creditors an d 
the debtor, who ha d to pass this onto its taxpayers, an d ensure d the continue d existen ce of the lo cal government. 
However, most U S states com bine market discipline with 
budgetary rules. In many states, there are effe ctive borrow-
ing limits at a lo cal level, too.6 Empiri cal evi den ce shows that 
the a djustment rea ction to ne gative ﬁ  scal sho cks depen ds 
on the stri ctness of the relevant budget institutions.7 Hen ce 
it is un clear to what extent the low num ber of insolven cies 
an d cases of credit rationin g of central, state an d local gov-
ernment is attri buta ble to market discipline.
Against this backdrop, it is questiona ble whether, even 
given a credible ex clusion of lia bility, the ﬁ  nan cial mar-
ket rea ctions are lar ge enou gh to ensure soun d pu blic 
ﬁ nan ces an d, if ne cessary, inﬂ  uen ce short-termist polit ical
behaviour, without a supplementary ﬁ  scal framework of 
budgetary rules. To the extent that the steep growth in 
indebtedness of the German fe deral states is attri buta ble 
to the in centive to shift the debt burden to the fe deration 
of states by claimin g budgetary har dship, an ex clusion of 
liability may prevent this. However, the literature shows a 
wide ran ge of explanatory approa ches for the rise in debt.8
A sharp in crease can also be o bserve d in the debt ratio of 
central government, whi ch in view of the s cale if its debt, 
is effe ctively su bject to an ex clusion of lia bility despite the 
obligation of the fe deral states to assist it. This in dicates 
that ﬁ  nan cial markets only rea ct si gniﬁ cantly enou gh to 
inﬂ uen ce politi cal behaviour when there are very hi gh lev-
els of debt. Empiri cal stu dies show that the risk premium 
is initially low an d in creases more stron gly with in creas-
ing levels of debt.9 If per cepti ble interest rate rises o ccur, 
stron ger a djustments are re quire d to avert insolven cy than 
is the case with prior ti ght borrowin g limits. This impairs 
the ma croe conomi c development an d shifts burdens to the 
generations then affe cted.
On balan ce, therefore, it seems worthwhile to consi der 
arran gements to stren gthen ﬁ  nan cial market discipline for 
the fe deral states by, say, involvin g creditors more in the 
event of budgetary har dship. However, preventive budget-
ary rules – as are use d not only in the U SA but also in the 
European E conomi c an d Monetary Union – are in dispens-
able.

62specifically into account in the budgetary
rules.
If the budgetary rules were tightened, it
would seem necessary to give the individual
federal states more flexibility elsewhere as
part of the reform of the fiscal constitution.
Their income, which is derived primarily from
tax receipts, is determined to a large extent
by national legislation and is largely levelled
out by means of the state government
revenue-sharing scheme. Possibilities for
rapid adjustment on the expenditure side re-
main limited – even after the transfer of legis-
lative responsibility for state government civil
servants’ salaries to the states as part of the
first stage of the reform of the federal struc-
ture. Particular thought could be given to
allowing states to levy limited multipliers on
taxes accruing to them or on income taxes in
order to increase their financial flexibility. The
extra revenue this would raise should then
have to be only partly recognised in the state
government revenue-sharing scheme. Also to
allow room for individual states’ preferences
regarding the extent of public spending, they
should be granted greater flexibility to adjust
their revenue.
Concluding remarks
Developments over the past decades have
demonstrated that the borrowing limits in
Germany are insufficient. As future gener-
ations will face additional burdens, not least
in view of the pay-as-you-go social security
systems and the ageing of society, it would
seem appropriate to minimise any furtherburden ensuing from the incurrence of gov-
ernment debt. This could be achieved via the
requirement of a structurally balanced
budget. In addition, this would avoid any
conflict with the European fiscal rules, which
have already set this aim for Germany. The al-
ternative of pegging borrowing to net invest-
ment could also be conducive to attaining
this objective in principle. However, it seems
that this could have some disadvantages, par-
ticularly with regard to the desired transpar-
ency and clarity of the rules, and could also
conflict with European requirements.
Alongside permitting borrowing in the event
of a natural disaster or serious crisis, the cyc-
lical effects on public finances, in particular,
should be duly taken into account. Automatic
cyclical fluctuations in the fiscal balance, in-
cluding temporary swings in profit-related
taxes, could be tolerated as deficits run up
during downturns and surpluses generated
during upturns tend to balance each other
out. At the end of the cycle, the debt level
should not have risen. Much the same applies
to deficits and surpluses resulting from in-
accurate projections, particularly regarding
the macroeconomic development and the
level of tax revenue. Institutional safeguards
should be put in place to ensure that projec-
tions of the course of macroeconomic devel-
opment and the evolution of the individual
government budgets are as unbiased as pos-
sible and that there is a regular comprehen-
sive analysis of the budgetary outturns. If a
sustained expansion of government debt
levels owing to inaccurate projections is immi-
nent, corrective measures should be imple-
mented as promptly as possible.Flexibility for

Budgetary rules and forecasting
uncertainty
Budgetary developments fraught with
uncertainty
When framing budgetary rules, it should be borne
in mind that both the course of macroeconomic
development, on which the budget estimates are
based, and other influencing factors are fraught
with considerable uncertainty. For this reason, de-
viations from the budgeted figures regularly occur
in the course of implementing the budget – irre-
spective of any additional fiscal policy decisions
that may have been taken in the meantime. This is
due to the fact that tax receipts, in particular, are
crucially affected by the macroeconomic develop-
ment, the effects of changes in legislation as well
as behavioural adjustments and special factors,
which may be difficult to forecast. Estimation
errors may also occur in the other budget items
and lead to deviations from the targeted figures.
Such errors may be classified as cyclical or as tem-
porary for reasons other than cyclical ones, or as
affecting the trend component. Moreover, the as-
sessment of the cyclical impact in a given year may
change retrospectively as a result of new macro-
economic data or expectations. Quantifying cyclic-al influences becomes relevant when budgetary
rules – as under discussion at present – specify cyc-
lically adjusted target values, say, for the general
government deficits, and cyclically induced devi-
ations are to be expressly permitted.
Especially in view of the estimation uncertainties, it
is important to decide how to deal with deviations
from target that occur when the budget is imple-
mented. In this connection, it should be noted that
the forecasting errors do not necessarily cancel
each other out over time and that (in the event of
regularly overoptimistic expectations) they can ulti-
mately lead to a sustained build-up of debt, even
though the budgetary rules have (formally) been
observed when setting up the budget.
Deviations from the planned central
government budget since the introduction of
medium-term financial planning
The fact that inaccurate projections in the budget
plans play a considerable role can be seen by ana-
lysing past deviations from the planned Federal
budget. When looking at the fiscal balance, it is
apparent that, up to the mid-1990s, it mostly
turned out to be more positive than estimated,
whereas negative deviations have predominatedPresenting budget plans and outturns trans-
parently is an important prerequisite for en-
abling parliaments and the general public to
monitor them effectively and ensuring the
observance of budgetary rules. Having clear
rules is another precondition for facilitating
the rapid identification of infringements,which could, if necessary, be corrected using
rule-bound mechanisms specified ex ante.
Overall, the revision of the budgetary rules as
part of the second stage of the reform of the
federal structure presents an opportunity to
take an important step towards long-term fis-
cal sustainability in Germany.Transparent

64since then (see chart above). Such deviations may
have been due not only to inaccurate projections
in the narrower sense, say, owing to uncertainties
with regard to the macroeconomic development
or the effects of earlier legislative changes, but
also to measures deliberately deviating from the
budget during its implementation (concerning pro-
ceeds from asset disposals, for example).
An analysis of the inaccurate projections and their
relevance to budgetary developments – much like
that recently undertaken by the German Council
of Economic Experts8– is conducted below. The
study focuses on tax receipts, since the related de-
viations from target are likely to be due in large
part to estimation errors in the narrower sense.9
Deviations in the other budget items are excluded.
It turns out that the deviations from target for the
fiscal balance and the tax receipts are positivelycorrelated. Over the period as a whole, the devi-
ations from target in the fiscal balance are, how-
ever, slightly positive (underestimation), whereas
they are, in sum, negative for tax receipts (overesti-
mation). The revisions of the nominal GDP growth
rates were also negative on average, although
downward revisions of GDP growth rates and of
the fiscal balance and/or tax receipts do not always
coincide. This suggests that there are other keyAs a percentage of GDP

period 1995-2005 and uses the GDP forecast published
in its annual reports for each of the years under consider-
ation for the real-time calculation of the cyclical influ-
ence.
9Here, too, there are exceptions, however. For example,
in December 2003, the parliamentary mediation commit-
tee of the two houses of the German parliament agreed
on a final version of various tax law amendments (includ-
ing the elimination of various subsidies) which deviated
from the appropriations in the 2004 Federal budget.

65causes of deviations besides the uncertainty re-
garding macroeconomic developments as meas-ured by GDP .
In order to adjust the fiscal balance for cyclical
effects, for the sake of simplicity, only tax receiptsare treated below as being cyclically susceptible.
10
More precisely, it is assumed that, given a 1% devi-ation of real GDP from its trend, tax receipts, too,will deviate by 1% from their normal medium-term level. The trend and cyclical components ofGDP are estimated using the Hodrick-Prescott filter(smoothing parameter l=100), which is applied to
the Federal government’s data and projection fromthe Financial Report available.
11A comparison of
the cyclically adjusted tax receipts (year t) with acurrent view shows the estimation of the trendwas largely overoptimistic when the budget wasprepared (year t-1). This was only partly recognisedat the budget outturn stage (year t+1), however(see chart on page 64).
Making allowance for estimation errors in the
budgetary rules
Forecasts of the macroeconomic development (in-
cluding for the medium term) and of the volatiletax receipts are a major component of budgetaryrules based on the trend development. To avoiddebts building up systemically as a result ofinaccurate estimations, relevant developmentsshould be analysed on a regular basis. Further-more, thought has to be given to whether com-pensatory measures might have to be taken. Eco-nomic experience suggests that the stringency ofsuch compensatory measures should be tailored tothe amount of discretionary scope available to pol-icymakers in making the estimates.To enhance transparency, first, the cyclical fiscal
balances could be determined after the budgetoutturn and shown separately, for example. Inaddition, the erratic deviations of the very volatileprofit-related taxes from their normal level, whichinvolve large temporary deviations, could also beestimated and incorporated. A standardisedmethod, like that used for cyclical adjustment,should be used for this (see chart on page 66 for arough estimate).
12If the cyclical effects on the gov-
ernment budget and the related estimation errorsare symmetric, these balances should offset eachother over time. However, studies undertakenfrom a current view show that, in the past, the sizeof the cyclical deficits was, on average, overstatedat the budget outturn owing to the regularly over-optimistic medium-term expectations for themacroeconomic development.
10Not only tax receipts but also labour market-related
expenditure by the Federal government, in particular, is
subject to certain cyclical fluctuations. The impact of cyc-
lical fluctuations is likely to be distinctly lower following
the recent reforms, however, since the central govern-
ment grant to the Federal Employment Agency, which
finances the very cyclically sensitive unemployment bene-
fit I, has been stabilised.
11The Bundesbank otherwise uses an analytically more
sophisticated disaggregated cyclical adjustment proced-
ure for analysing budgetary developments, see Deutsche
Bundesbank, A disaggregated framework for analysing
public finances: Germany’s fiscal track record between
2000 and 2005, Monthly Report, March 2006, pages 61-
76. The aggregated method used here has the advantage
of being more consistent with the approach taken by the
EU budgetary surveillance procedure. To estimate the
GDP trend, GDP has to be projected for a number of
years beyond the estimation year. The Federal Govern-
ment’s spring medium-term forecasts are an obvious op-
tion for this purpose. The related estimation error tends
to be overstated in the process, however, since it is not
until November that the target values of the Federal
budget are set on the basis of an updated forecast.
12Even under the legal status quo, revenue from profit-
related taxes fluctuates markedly more sharply than can
be explained by developments in the economy as a
whole. These fluctuations are therefore not usually cap-
tured by the cyclical adjustment procedure and are not
considered below. The temporary influences on profit-
related taxes have to be distinguished from the estima-
tion errors, even though they are a major cause of fore-
casting errors.

DEUTSCHE
BUNDESBANK
EUROSYSTEM
Monthly Report

66In addition, the estimation errors regarding cyclic-
ally adjusted tax receipts13determined at the
budget outturn could be shown separately. An-
other factor that could be included is that, given
no change in policy, revisions of the estimation of
the cyclically adjusted revenue level for an individ-
ual year are likely in most cases to continue to hold
for the future (baseline effect). In order to avoid
sharp, erratic fluctuations in budgetary policy fol-
lowing unexpected trend developments, the re-duction in the cyclically adjusted deficit or surplus
implied by this baseline effect could be prescribed
not directly but successively over a medium-term
period. It would then likewise be possible to cap-
ture the further differential amounts in the balance
from the ensuing fiscal years that occur during the
reduction period. Besides this, any growing residue
from the aforementioned estimation errors of the
economic situation could then also be taken into
consideration.
Furthermore, an upper limit could be set for debts
due to estimation errors for which there would
have to be medium-term fixed minimum repay-
ments if this limit is exceeded. Congruently, credit
balances should be usable in the budget only
above a defined ceiling. Setting an upper limit for
debts which accumulate owing to estimation
errors would, in particular, counter incentives for
systematic inaccurate projections. By simultan-
eously limiting the use of possible credit balances,
a certain corridor could be created within which
both positive and negative estimation errors can
be tolerated even though the actual budget ceiling
would be breached ex post as a result.
Model calculation for the Federal budget
Simulations based on Federal budgets, economic
projections and deviations from target for the
period 1970 to 2006 can retrospectively illustrate
the pattern of debts and/or credit balances which
would have resulted from (estimated) cyclical ef-
fects and estimation errors of cyclically adjusted
tax receipts (see chart on page 67). Taking 1970 as
a starting point, the cyclical deficits and the cyclic-
ally adjusted differentials in the tax receipts result-€b n

the subsequent year (t +1) using the data and pro-
jections available at that point in time and shown

sumption, by way of an example, that the estima-
tion errors regarding cyclically adjusted tax receipts
that were detected at the budget outturn are
reduced in three equal steps (baseline effect).
The simulation shows that debts build up over the
reporting period as a result of the cyclical deficits
calculated in real time. Debts due to estimationerrors regarding cyclically adjusted tax receipts
occur mainly in the last ten years. In this context,
the medium-term rise in the “cyclical debts” is the
outcome of the fact that, in the model calculation,
the cyclical deficits were typically overestimated at
the budget outturn owing to comparatively opti-
mistic expectations regarding the future macroeco-
nomic development. The estimation errors regard-
ing cyclically adjusted tax receipts were simultan-
eously underestimated at this point in time. The
cumulative deficits resulting from the real-time an-
alysis totalled almost 3125 billion (just under 51/C252%
of GDP) in 2006.

69TARGET2 – the new
payment system for
EuropeOn 19 November 2007, the new
TARGET2 system for settling urgent
payment orders in real time will come
into operation. In so doing, it will
replace the current TARGET system,
which for the eight years since the
start of the European monetary union
has made it possible to transfer euro
balances between accounts held at
European central banks in a matter of
minutes. This has been instrumental in
laying the basis for a single European
money market. The Bundesbank’s
RTGSplussystem, which represents the
German component of the TARGET sys-
tem, will cease to operate after the
close of business on 16 November 2007
and be superseded by the new system.
Around 150 RTGSplusparticipants are
currently preparing for the transition
from the “old” RTGSplus-TARGET envir-
onment to TARGET2. Following on from
past Bundesbank monthly reports al-
ready focused on RTGSplusand recent
developments in the area of individual
payments (September 2005), the fol-
lowing article describes the most
important elements which make up
TARGET2 and its advantages for the
European financial market. The article
is particularly effective in illustrating
the considerable importance of this
new TARGET generation to the Bun-
desbank, the German banking industry
and those involved in the business of
securities settlement in Germany.

70Importance of TARGET in individual
payments in euro
Handling more than 350,000 transactions
every day with a value of 32.4 trillion, the
TARGET1system, operated by the European
System of Central Banks (ESCB), is of para-
mount importance to the European financial
infrastructure. Using TARGET it is possible to
transfer balances held at a central bank to an-
other account in Europe at great speed. Not
least owing to the large volume of transac-
tions involved and the wide range of central-
ised functions it offers, TARGET has acquired
great systemic relevance.
– TARGET is used for the purposes of set-
tling Eurosystem monetary policy oper-
ations, supplying market participants with
central bank money and absorbing excess
central bank liquidity.
– The trading of central bank balances be-
tween banks, also known as money mar-
ket activity, is also settled using TARGET.
– Other, privately operated settlement sys-
tems, for example in the area of foreign
currency payments and securities trading,
settle their transactions via bank accounts
held at the central banks and likewise use
TARGET to achieve this.
– Bank customers can also use TARGET for
the settlement of domestic or European
credit transfers that need to be settled as
speedily as possible owing to their special
urgency. In addition, banks frequently use
TARGET to settle payments arising fromtheir correspondent banking activity in
non-European countries.
Accordingly, security plays a major role in
connection with payments settlement. This

central bank money.
With an annual volume growth of 9% and a
corresponding value growth of 35%, TARGET
has developed very positively over the past
five years. In the area of “individual pay-
ments”, TARGET enjoys approximately a 90%
share of the European market in terms of
value and a market share in excess of 60% in
terms of volume. Most of the remaining
share is handled by the EURO1 system oper-
ated by the Euro Banking Association. In
terms of international standing, TARGET
ranks alongside the Federal Reserve Bank’s
Fedwire system, the private US dollar clearing
system CHIPS2and the global foreign ex-
change settlement system CLS3as one of the
world’s largest individual payment systems.
The Deutsche Bundesbank and TARGET
The Bundesbank’s official mandate enshrined
in section 3 of the Bundesbank Act since
1957 stipulates that the Bundesbank has to
arrange for the execution of domestic and
cross-border payments. The Bundesbank ful-
fils this function inter alia by operating its
own payment systems. With RTGSplusthe
Bundesbank operates an innovative Real
Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system.
RTGSplusalso functions as the national
TARGET component. TARGET comprises
16 national RTGS systems together with the
ECB payment mechanism (EPM). The individ-
ual national components are connected with
one another via technical interlinking. The im-
portance of the German TARGET componentis reflected in the fact that approximately
45% of all domestic and cross-border
TARGET payments are settled using RTGSplus.
Measured in terms of volume, the share is
just under 30%.
Transition from TARGET to TARGET2
As early as October 2002, the Governing
Council of the ECB adopted the main prin-
ciples for the next generation of the TARGET
system. Accordingly, individual EU central
banks were allowed to decide for themselves
whether to continue operating their own
real-time gross settlement system or to take
advantage of the Single Shared Platform
(SSP). All Eurosystem NCBs – including those
of Malta and Cyprus, which will join the Euro-
system on 1 January 2008 – have since opted
to use the new SSP .
In addition, the central banks of Denmark, Es-
tonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland will also
be joining TARGET2. The remaining EU coun-
tries are not expected to take advantage of
the SSP until they join the euro area. How-
ever, banks in these countries can participate
in TARGET2 by means of remote access via a
participating TARGET2 central bank.
In order to reduce migration risk, participat-
ing countries will link up with TARGET2 on a
gradual basis, migrating in three different
windows on 19 November 2007, 18 February
2008 and 19 May 2008. Germany will switch
to TARGET2 with the first group of countries.

73use liquidity management features. Available
liquidity is to be used as efficiently as possibleas the demands on liquidity managementhave steadily multiplied in recent years. Forexample, the CLS system requires “pay-ins”of central bank money to be injected preciselyto the minute. Equally, in times of scarceliquidity in the money market, possibly as aresult of sudden changes in market partici-pant behaviour triggered by a crisis of confi-dence, it is very important to make particular-ly efficient use of the liquidity that is available.With RTGS
plusthe Bundesbank had already
implemented a system that incorporatedbenchmark-setting liquidity managementelements. TARGET2 will retain several of theessential basic elements already familiar tousers of RTGS
plus.
– Liquidity-saving elements ensure an opti-
mised supply of liquidity during paymentprocessing. This means that in addition toaccount balances and intraday facilities,use is made of “offsetting payments” ascover for processing payments. In the caseof submitted payments, for example, thesystem examines whether paymentsplaced in a queue by the beneficiary mayalso be used as cover and excecuted atthe same time. Moreover, all participants’“queues” are continuously optimised.
– By setting limits, a direct participant can
restrict the amount of liquidity he uses for“normal” (non-priority) payments toother participants. A bilateral limit enablesthe direct participant to control his use ofliquidity for the settlement of “normal”payments vis-/C224-vis another direct partici-pant. A multilateral limit can be used to
the same effect vis-/C224-vis those participantsto whom he did not apply a bilateral limit.Limits result in a high degree of transpar-ency and ensure early finality in paymentprocessing. They also enable participantsto submit payments early without runningthe risk of unlimited unilateral outflows ofliquidity. Furthermore, they provide bilat-eral partners with an incentive to submittheir own payments early. By means ofsuch offsetting, payments can be exe-cuted in finality with little recourse toliquidity and channelled to the recipient asearly in the day as possible. This contrib-utes to the optimal deployment of liquid-ity and has a positive effect on financialstability.
– Like RTGS
plus, TARGET2 rigorously em-
bodies the tenet that a high degree ofefficiency is best achieved if participantsare responsible for managing their ownliquidity. To this end, participants are givena variety of “tools” for liquidity manage-ment. One such tool is transparency withregard to incoming payments that are stillparked in queues. This assists participantsin planning the management of their ownliquidity positions. Furthermore, partici-pants have the opportunity – as in thecase of RTGS
plus– to manage the process-
ing situation interactively to suit theirchanging needs. For example, they canadjust limits or rearrange the order of pay-ments waiting in a queue.Use of tried and

74TARGET2 will also offer a number of function-
al improvements to performance with regard
to liquidity management.
– The ability to assign priorities and utilise
liquidity reserves allows direct participants
to manage their payment flows in line
with their own individual needs. TARGET2
offers three different classes of priority.
These are: “highly urgent”, “urgent” and
“normal”. “Highly urgent” payments (eg
for CLS and securities settlement) as well
as “urgent” payments (eg those for time-
critical interbank payments) have priority
access to liquidity. What is more, liquidity
for these kinds of payment can be re-
served so as to guarantee immediate
settlement in every case.
– In future, TARGET2 participants will also
have the option of combining various ac-
counts – including those held at different
central banks – to form an account group
for the purpose of consolidated informa-
tion or central processing (“virtual ac-
count”, “aggregated liquidity”). In the
case of a virtual account, the available
liquidity of all members of an account
group will be aggregated in a liquidity
pool during the business day. Each ac-
count holder within the group will there-
fore have the possibility of making pay-
ments through his own account up to the
total level of intraday liquidity available to
the account group. In the case of the con-
solidated information option, only consoli-
dated information will be offered to the
account group. Processing will still be

75carried out exclusively at the individual
account level.
Participants will be aided in their liquidity
management by an Information and Control
Module (ICM) which enables them, for in-
stance, to view their current liquidity position,
payments status or ingoing and outgoing
queues as well as to carry out control oper-
ations at any given time.
The centralised European TARGET2 platform
will eliminate the fragmentation of current
flows in individual payment transactions in
euro and euro-denominated liquidity hold-
ings. The associated improvement in the util-
isation of offsetting payment flows should
further boost the effectiveness of liquidity-
saving features. In addition, in contingency
situations, which past experience has shown
to be accompanied by a liquidity shortage,
the liquidity-saving model can mitigate nega-
tive effects. Participants greatly benefit from
the improved information content which re-
sults from the merging of separate liquidity
flows in Europe into just one technical sys-
tem. Another positive aspect is that in future,
limits to the active management of liquidity
outflows can be defined individually for each
direct TARGET2 participant, not just in nation-
al terms but also on a Europe-wide basis.
Interface reduction and settlement by
ancillary systems
The settlement of cash leg transactions (eg
securities and foreign exchange operations as
well as retail payments) coming throughother (ancillary) systems is being increasingly
effected in “safe” central bank money. For
this reason, in recent years there has also
been an increase in the interdependencies be-
tween these ancillary systems and TARGET.
As a general rule, the participants in such an-
cillary systems are required to hold an ac-
count with the central bank responsible for
that system within the national RTGS frame-
work in order to initiate cash settlement.
Hence, at a European level, a highly complex
entity has evolved within which the multiple
interlinked RTGS systems maintained by the
various NCBs are in turn connected with a
number of ancillary systems for the purpose
of cash settlement. The individual interfaces
and procedures involved differ in shape and
form. At present, more than 50 ancillary sys-
tems use TARGET to carry out their cash
settlements.
TARGET2 will greatly simplify the complex
structure described above. One reason is the
reduced number of interfaces. In future, all
ancillary systems will be able to conduct
settlement directly in the SSP using central
bank money. As a matter of principle, settle-
ment can be executed using any central bank
account belonging to the TARGET2 SSP . This
will also make it much easier for banks to use
remote access to link up with securities and
retail payment systems elsewhere in Europe
while opening up new business opportunities
for the ancillary systems themselves. Conse-
quently, TARGET2 will make a significant con-
tribution to the closer integration of Euro-
pean financial markets.Enhanced

76The following elements are further proof of
the improved processing offered by TARGET2.
– In future, ancillary systems can take ad-
vantage of standardised access and clear-
ing procedures. In this context, the Ancil-
lary System Interface (ASI) will offer a spe-
cial range of services featuring additional
functions tailored to meet the require-
ments of ancillary systems. Banks will
therefore be informed in advance (for ex-
ample, 30 minutes prior to actual clearing)
about the balances to be settled in
TARGET2, for instance in the case of
multilateral settlement processes, where
transactions need to be booked on several
different participant accounts at the same
time. This will have the effect of reducing
settlement risk.
– The better liquidity efficiency offered by
the common platform will also have a
positive impact on the settlement by ancil-
lary systems.
– TARGET2 will allow for night-time secur-
ities settlement. In some countries – in-
cluding Germany – the lion’s share of
securities transactions is already being
processed during the night without any
repercussions on standard payment trans-
actions.
However, in terms of risk factors, the new op-
tions available for the settlement by ancillary
systems warrant close monitoring by the
Eurosystem. It is precisely for this reason that
the Eurosystem has sought and publicised in-
formation on the settlement times involved inancillary systems as well as on their depend-
ence on other ancillary systems. This will in-
crease transparency for market participants
and reduce the risk of conflicting demands
for access to the liquidity that will be centrally
maintained in the platform. What is more,
adequate contingency provisions on both
sides will have a vital role to play, precisely in
the event of interaction with other systems,
as any serious disruption, particularly at critic-
al periods, might have a resoundingly adverse
impact on the European – and possibly even
the international – financial markets.
Improved business continuity
The current TARGET environment, with its de-
centralised structure and large number of
participating national RTGS systems, can give
rise to operational risks. These can be offset
by applying the appropriate contingency
measures. Owing to the interconnected na-
ture of the system, however, these risks will
be inclined to affect other TARGET compon-
ents as well. The SSP will eradicate such de-
pendencies. Nevertheless, to ensure that this
works there must be a guarantee of high SSP
availability as in future any such disruptions
will have a direct effect on all TARGET2 par-
ticipants. Another reason behind this need
for a high level of business continuity is that
in future TARGET2 will be reopened for the
overnight processing of securities transac-
tions as early as 90 minutes after the close of
the last business day, primarily for the night-
time processing of securities transactions.Additional

77The TARGET2 system is therefore based on a
two-region model where, in the event of a re-
gional disaster, each region is equipped to
take over full live operation within a short
period of time. Within each region two separ-
ately located operational sites are available to
guarantee uninterrupted operation if local
problems arise. Should it be necessary to re-
locate operations from one region to the
other, time-critical payments, for instance,
CLS liquidity “pay-ins”, can be handled by
using a special standby contingency module.
TARGET2 will also place greater importance
on the contingency measures which partici-
pants are required to apply. Participants who
are major players on account of the scale of
their business are particularly affected by the
future requirement to prove that they have
access to a substitute facility at a second loca-
tion. This regulation is not least a reflection of
the increasingly exacting standards applying
to payment systems supervision. In order to
allow enough time for internal adjustments,
however, the rules will not take effect until
the second half of 2010. If a participant’s in-
ternal IT application suffers a system failure,
he has the further option of using the Infor-
mation and Control Module to make targeted
liquidity transfers to other participants or
generate payments for settlement within cer-
tain ancillary systems.
TARGET2 pricing scheme
TARGET2 will not distinguish between domes-
tic and cross-border payments. In future, the
common pricing scheme shown on page 78will apply to “core services”. This approach
pursues two particular objectives. Firstly, it
should guarantee broad access to the system,
ie small institutions should also be able to
participate directly in TARGET2. Secondly, the
pricing scheme should be attractive to major
players who process a high volume of urgent
customer payments (known also as “com-
mercial” payments) and who account for a
very large share of the current TARGET trans-
actions. The significance of this participant
group is underscored by the fact that, for ex-
ample, in Germany the 10 biggest RTGSplus
participants account for about 65% of all
transactions in RTGSplusin terms of both vol-
ume and value. The processing of commercial
payments in the secure TARGET environment
will contribute to financial stability in the euro
area and make better use of the system whileTARGET2 pricing scheme

Impact of TARGET2 on Bundesbank
To comply with the principle of decentralisa-
tion enshrined in the EU Treaty and to guar-
antee that their services are tailored as closely
to customers needs as possible, the partici-
pating central banks will continue to be re-
sponsible for all operational aspects with re-
gard to their customers despite the technical-
ly centralised nature of the TARGET2 system.
Furthermore, from a legal perspective, the
TARGET2 system will retain its multiple-layer
structure, meaning that each central bank
will be regarded as a separate system oper-
ator. Consequently, in Germany the relation-
ship between a participant and the Bundes-
bank will be governed by German law and
will be regulated by the TARGET2 conditions
of the Bundesbank. The German system will
be called TARGET2-Bundesbank (TARGET2-
BBk).
To avoid competitive distortions in Europe
and to provide a standardised service level,
the Eurosystem also agreed that national
regulations should be harmonised as far as
possible. Exceptions are possible only in situ-
ations where a difference in national law
makes this absolutely necessary. This ap-
proach will make it possible to retain the tried
and tested system of participation under the
national law of the respective countries and
at the same time take into account the
requirements of European integration.In the autumn of 2003 the Bundesbank and
the central banks of France and Italy submit-
ted a joint proposal to develop and operate a
TARGET2 platform, which was then adopted
by the Governing Council of the ECB in De-
cember 2004. In designing and developing
the TARGET2 payment system, the Bundes-
bank drew on its experience gained in setting
up and operating RTGSplusand further en-
hanced the main features of the system to
reflect the requirements of European market
participants. Moreover, together with Banca
d’Italia the Bundesbank will have primary
responsiblity for SSP operations while some
specific modules used mainly by central
banks (eg Datawarehouse) will be offered by
the Banque de France as a supplementary ser-
vice. TARGET2 presents a first-time opportun-
ity to realise a service centre concept within
the ESCB. It will capitalise on the expertise,
resources and technical infrastructure that are
already to be found in national central banks
by applying these to generate a common
range of services for the ESCB where previ-
ously these would have been provided indi-
vidually by each and every central bank.
At present about 190 institutions participate
in the German RTGSplusTARGET component
on a direct basis. Numbered among these are
banks and central banks from Slovenia, Cy-
prus and Malta, which prior to TARGET2 had,
for reasons of cost, been against creating
their own euro-based RTGS systems and in-
stead decided to use an existing RTGS system.
All in all, by the end of 2006 approximately
1,000 European financial institutions had
made use of TARGET as direct participants.National

79There will be no great change in substance
from the forms of participation offered by thecurrent RTGS
plusand TARGET concepts. How-
ever, since TARGET2 has standardised tech-nical access across Europe, it enables multi-national banks, in particular, which still par-ticipate in several different TARGET compon-ents in various countries to focus their TAR-GET2 access on a single country and thusconsolidate the settlement of their payments.
Being able to concentrate the majority of
business activities in one RTGS account willalso greatly simplify the task of liquidity man-agement. Once access has been consolidatedin one main office, a number of foreign banksubsidiaries are likely to stop participating dir-ectly via TARGET2-BBk. Direct RTGS
pluspar-
ticipants from Slovenia and Cyprus will alsoparticipate in future in TARGET2 directly viatheir respective central banks.
In total, about 150 direct TARGET2-BBk par-
ticipants are expected to take part in thelaunch.
Measured in terms of the total figure of al-
most 2,300 institutions in Germany, this lowlevel of direct participation in RTGS
plusmight
come as a surprise. However, it is importantto remember in this context that a majority ofsavings banks and credit cooperatives alreadychoose to participate in RTGS
plusonly on an
indirect basis – ie via the relevant Landesbankor regional institution of credit cooperatives –in order to benefit from internal network syn-ergies. Affiliated institutions take regular ad-vantage of the direct access that is availableto them through their parent company.Generally speaking, it cannot be ruled out
that indirect forms of access to TARGET2 mayalso gain in appeal for other institutions inthe wake of rising price pressures, increasedconsolidation and further outsourcing. Fre-quently the actual implementation costs arenot the only significant factor. A role is alsoplayed by the administrative burden which isassociated with direct participation andwhich involves the ongoing monitoring andcontrol of business activities inside the sys-tem. In the final analysis, however, the deci-sion to participate or not depends on the fun-damental, long-term strategy position ofeach institution. What remains important forthe Bundesbank is that the design, technol-ogy and pricing of TARGET2 should not pre-vent smaller institutions from directly partici-pating in this payments system. The harmon-isation and stronger European integrationthat TARGET2 will induce are likely to lead toa sharp increase in competition for the cus-tom of German and other European banksthat are interested only in indirect access tothe system as well as for correspondent bank-ing services sought by institutions domiciledoutside Europe.
The harmonisation within the Eurosystem
that is bound to accompany TARGET2 will, inthe medium term, oblige the Bundesbank toundergo some structural adjustments as well.As the situation stands at present, around220 German credit institutions use the Bun-desbank’s Customer Access Mechanism(CAM) to participate indirectly in RTGS
plus.

80after which such “residual” payments will
have to be settled using the TARGET2 SSP .
Apart from the cost factor, the main explan-
ation for this was the realisation that full en-
joyment of the advantages which Europe-
wide harmonisation aims to achieve will be
possible only if all payment transactions are
processed in their entirety by the SSP .
Initial use of platform limited to payments
The TARGET2 SSP comprises several modules.
Among the “core services” to be used by all
central banks are the payments module, in-
cluding the management of TARGET2 ac-
counts and the ICM. In addition to this, indi-
vidual central banks can make use of optional
components, such as a module for supple-mentary central bank account management,
for calculating minimum reserve requirements
and for handling the marginal lending facility
and the deposit facility. Central banks which
do not use these modules perform the corres-
ponding functions using their own applica-
tions outside the SSP . In the interest of distrib-
uting the burden and for reasons of migration
safety, the Bundesbank has, for the time
being, decided in favour of this option. As a
result, the Bundesbank will remove the par-
ticipants’ liquidity from the SSP and return it
to their home account management system
shortly after the close of the business day at
18.00 – as in the case of RTGSplustoday. Fol-
lowing a close-of-day processing period that
will be very short compared with the time ex-
pended today, participants will be required to

81by no later than 19.30 as some ancillary sys-
tems – in particular, securities settlement sys-
tems – will need to access TARGET2 accounts
in the course of night-time processing.
In the medium to long term virtually all of the
central banks are likely to heed a marked
trend within the ESCB towards using optional
modules, thus accommodating a strong pref-
erence on the part of the banking business
for this approach and cost-effectiveness con-
siderations.
Securities settlement via TARGET2
Approximately 80% of all securities transac-
tions are now settled overnight by the Ger-
man central securities depository, Clearstream
Banking Frankfurt AG (Clearstream). For rea-
sons of efficiency and security the model is
based on the use of central bank money,
which participants make available on the
evening prior to the value date by reserving it
in the respective accounts at the Bundesbank.
To this end they can make use of any unused
minimum reserves as well as the entire pool
of unpledged collateral held by the Bundes-
bank. Utilising the statutorily guaranteed
amounts that are reserved by the Bundes-
bank, Clearstream is able to settle its secur-
ities transactions securely and with immediate
finality during the night. In the early hours of
the value date the amounts to be credited
and debited as a result of this settlement pro-
cess are transferred within the Bundesbank’s
system of accounts, and the reservation is
simultaneously lifted. Consequently, partici-
pants are given unlimited access to liquidityagain before the opening of TARGET. Shortly
after the launch of TARGET2 Clearstream will
likely use only the new TARGET2 functions
along with the participants’ TARGET2 ac-
counts for this procedure. Foreign Clear-
stream participants will no longer need to
hold an account with the Bundesbank and
will instead be able to use the TARGET2 ac-
count that is maintained by their own nation-
al central bank. In the course of 2008, Clear-
stream same-day settlement as well as the
German derivatives exchange, Eurex Clearing
and the European energy exchange, Euro-
pean Commodity Clearing AG (ECC) will like-
wise switch to TARGET2 accounts for the pur-
pose of financial settlement. Until such time,
the respective settlement processes will be
handled using the Bundesbank’s home ac-
count system, as is currently the case.
As a consequence of the interdependencies
which exist between securities settlement
and payments transactions, the question of li-
quidity is becoming more and more import-
ant. In order to guarantee even greater effi-
ciency in the area of securities settlement, to
equip the banks with a more flexible and ro-
bust system of liquidity management and to
provide a further liquidity saving option, the
Bundesbank will offer a self-collateralisation
procedure from the fourth quarter of 2007.
Should there be insufficient liquidity for set-
tling certain purchase transactions during
Clearsteam’s night-time processing, this pro-
cedure offers banks the possibility of auto-
matically borrowing on the strength of the se-
curities underpinning the transactions in ac-
cordance with the general rules governing
intra-day refinancing at the central bank. InCash settlement

82such an event the Bundesbank makes the
corresponding shortfall in liquidity – less hair-
cuts – available to the participants.
Further consolidation of infrastructure
probable
With TARGET2 the Eurosystem will make a
major contribution to supporting the Euro-
pean financial infrastructure, especially in the
form of enhanced euro liquidity at the Euro-
pean level and improved links with other
settlement and clearing systems. This will
make the settlement of transactions in central
bank money much more efficient. Nonethe-
less, it is foreseeable that TARGET2 will be
just the starting point of a medium to long-
term process of development. The specific
demands of market players in an increasingly
interlinked European financial arena and the
cost benefits that can be achieved in the
Eurosystem by using common systems all
bear witness to this fact. In this connection,
the central banks of the Eurosystem are at
present discussing, for example, the merits of
setting up a joint system for managing collat-
eral for monetary policy operations, to be
known as Collateral Central Bank Manage-
ment. In addition to this, the Eurosystem is
currently working in close collaboration with
market participants and CSDs to produce a
set of user requirements for the TARGET2-
Securities system. TARGET2-Securities (T2S)
takes the concept behind TARGET2 and ap-plies it to securities settlement using central
bank money. Designed to provide a single,
central platform for integrating both central
bank money and securities transactions, it
would greatly harmonise European securities
settlement and offer an efficient and secure
means of settling transactions in central bank
money while contributing to the integration
of the European capital market. By contrast,
securities settlement as it is practised today in
Europe is still highly fragmented, translating
into relatively high costs for cross-border
transactions. With T2S, the Eurosystem does
not intend to create a European CSD. Rather,
the safe custody of securities and the services
associated with this should remain in the
hands of national CSDs.
The Governing Council of the ECB has al-
ready decided that, conditional on its imple-
mentation, TARGET2-Securities will be made
available on the SSP as an additional service.
Among other things this will achieve cost syn-
ergies while also exploiting a benchmark-
setting strategy for contingency provisions
and allowing participants to enjoy the func-
tional benefits offered by, say, liquidity man-
agement as well as by harmonised interfaces
(for example, in the shape of the ICM). The
Governing Council of the ECB is expected to
decide on the final implementation of the
project in the first six months of 2008, once
the user requirements have been finalised
and a public consultation has taken place.Integrated
