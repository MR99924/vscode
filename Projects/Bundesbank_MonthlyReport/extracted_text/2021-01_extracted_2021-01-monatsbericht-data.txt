Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Real gross domestic product (GDP) is likely to 
have roughly stagnated in the final quarter of 
last year. The higher infection rates and consid -
erable tightening of measures introduced again 
in stages to contain the pandemic put a brake 
on the German economy’s catch- up momen -
tum. Nevertheless, the greater restrictions are 
unlikely to have led to a major setback. This is 
because some sectors of the economy not dir -
ectly affected by the measures continued to 
recover  . Industry is particularly noteworthy in 
this context. According to figures available up 
to November, output rose sharply here on the 
back of a dynamic pick-  up in demand. Con -
struction also recorded a steep rise, however. 
In addition, retail sales grew considerably up to 
November. This counterbalanced the losses 
likely to have been incurred as a result of the 
mandatory closing of bricks- and- mortar retail 
stores in mid-  December. According to the ifo 
business climate index, corporate sentiment 
brightened in December despite the increasing 
headwinds whipped up by the pandemic.1 Ser-
vice providers (excluding trade) even reported 
an improved assessment of the situation over -
all, although operations in particularly contact- 
intensive sectors such as the hotel and restaur -
ant sector were still severely restricted. These 
encouraging signals regarding the resilience of 
the German economy suggest that the restric -
tions extended and tightened even further at 
the beginning of the new year may well not 
prove to be too much of a setback for the eco -
nomic recovery. Positive impetus is also being 
provided by an improvement in prospects for 
foreign business, in part due to the trade agree -
ment reached between the EU and the United 
Kingdom. If, however, the infection rates do 
not diminish significantly and the current 
restric tions on economic activity persist for a 
longer period or continue to be tightened even further, the economy might still be faced with 
a distinct setback.
The pandemic also left a deep mark on German 
economic output in 2020 as a whole. Accord -
ing to preliminary calculations by the Federal 
Statistical Office, real GDP fell by 5.0% 
(calendar- adjusted: 5.3%) on the year. The de -
cline almost reached the magnitude of that 
recorded  in 2009, when economic output fell 
by 5.7% in the wake of the global financial and 
economic crisis. Unlike then, owing to the pan -
demic a particularly strong decline in activity 
was seen in contact- intensive services, such as 
the hotel and restaurant sector or some parts 
of bricks-  and- mortar trade. Industry likewise 
took a major hit, however. Only a few areas, 
such as construction or online trading, were 
able to increase their value added. The expend -
iture side of GDP shows a similar pattern. In 
contrast to 2009, private consumption also 
underwent a massive decline, alongside ex -
ports and investment in machinery and equip -
ment. Only construction investment and gov -
ernment consumption experienced growth in 
this crisis year dominated by the pandemic.
Industry
Industrial output continued to rise markedly in 
November 2020, increasing by a seasonally 
adjusted  1¼% on the month. On an average of 
November and October, it overshot the aver -
age of the third quarter by 5¾%. Output in the 
automotive sector posted particularly sharp 
growth.2 The production of capital goods was Despite worsen -

December onwards is probably only reflected here to a 
small extent as, according to the ifo Institute, most of the 
responses to the survey had already been submitted be -
forehand.
2 According to data provided by the Association of the 
Automotive Industry (VDA), the number of passenger cars 
produced declined significantly in December in seasonally 
adjusted terms, but was still markedly above the average 
level of the third quarter.Deutsche Bundesbank

up substantially overall (+7¼%) and intermedi -
ate goods saw a rise of a similarly high level. By 
contrast, the output of consumer goods de -
clined (-1¼%). Despite edging up further, in -
dustrial output was still almost 3% lower in 
Novem ber than the pre- crisis level of the final 
quarter of 2019. Producers of capital goods 
showed the largest shortfall, but consumer 
goods production was also still significantly 
lower. By contrast, the production of inter -
mediate goods exceeded pre- crisis levels.
Industrial orders continued their steep upward 
movement in November 2020, rising by 2¼% 
on October in seasonally adjusted terms. On an 
average of November and October, the inflow 
of orders was up by as much as 7% on the 
average of the third quarter. Demand for Ger -
man industrial products now thus clearly ex -
ceeded the pre- crisis level of the final quarter 
of 2019. Orders for intermediate goods rose 
especially  sharply compared with the third 
quarter (+9¾%), but orders for capital goods 
were also substantially higher (+6%), with sig -
nificantly more demand for computer, elec -
tronic and optical products, in particular. Orders 
received by the automotive sector were damp -
ened in November but remained above the 
pre- crisis level. There was a relatively small in -
crease in demand for consumer goods (+1¾%). 
In a regional breakdown, incoming orders from 
Germany and abroad grew at similar rates. The 
inflow of orders from non- euro area countries 
was particularly high but demand from the 
euro area also rose steeply.
Nominal industrial turnover increased markedly 
in November 2020, like industrial output, rising 
by 1¼% on the month. Taking November and 
October together, it was 5% higher than the 
third- quarter level. In line with developments in 
industrial output, substantial growth in capital 
goods and intermediate goods was recorded. 
By contrast, sales of consumer goods were 
slightly lower. Broken down by region, there 
was a somewhat stronger rise in export sales 
than sales to domestic customers compared 
with the third quarter. This was due to high Industrial orders

sales growth outside the euro area. Nominal 
exports of goods were also substantially higher 
in seasonally  adjusted terms, with a month- on- 
month rise of 2¼% in November. On an aver -
age of November and October, they were up 
on the third quarter by as much as 4½%. Nom -
inal imports of goods grew more strongly than 
exports in November, rising by 4¾% on the 
month. Taking November and October to -
gether, in a comparison with the third quarter, 
growth was only slightly higher than that seen 
for exports, however. Nominal imports were 
down on pre- crisis levels by a slightly smaller 
degree than exports (-1½% and -4%) towards 
the end of the period under review. In real 
terms, imports in November were even back to 
significantly exceeding their pre- crisis level. 
Unlike   in the nominal calculation, the sharp 
decline  in energy prices compared with the 
pre- crisis period did not have a dampening 
effect .
Construction
According to the information available to date, 
the construction sector has remained largely 
unaffected by the second wave of the corona -
virus pandemic and the measures taken to con -
tain it. Construction output even posted a dis -
tinct month- on- month increase in seasonally 
adjusted terms (+1¼%) in November. On an 
average of November and October, it was up 
substantially on the third quarter (+4½%). Out -
put in the main construction sector rose more 
moderately than in the finishing trades, where 
the data are prone to revision. The latter had 
still seen a distinct decline in the third quarter. 
The order situation in the main construction 
sector is likewise still favourable, with new 
orders in October up sharply on the quarter 
(+3¾%). The reach of the order books, as 
measured by the ifo Institute, remained at a 
high level in December. According to the ifo 
Institute , equipment utilisation continued to 
rise at the end of the year and the assessment 
of the business situation improved.Labour market
The labour market remained remarkably stable 
despite the renewed tightening of measures to 
combat the pandemic. There were more regis -
trations for short- time work in November and 
December, with 1.3 million employees subject 
to social security contributions affected when 
taking the two months together. However, this 
corresponds to only a fraction of the notifica -
tions filed last spring. The current notifications 
are mainly limited to the hotel and restaurant 
area and parts of the retail sector affected by 
enforced closures. According to provisional fig -
ures provided by the Federal Employment 
Agency, which currently extend to October, the 
number of workers actually in short- time work 
schemes has fallen to 2.0 million. This number 
is likely to have risen only slightly in the last two 
months of 2020. As a rule, not all employees 
registered for short- time work are actually 
transferred to short- time working arrange -
ments at a later date. Furthermore, short- time 
work was probably scaled back further in other 
sectors of the economy.
Registered unemployment declined distinctly in 
December, as it had done in the two preceding 
months. The official unemployment figure was 
37,000 lower than in the previous month after 
seasonal adjustment and the unemployment 
rate remained unchanged at 6.1% due to 
rounding. This implies a continuation of the 
positive trend despite the partial lockdown 
from the beginning of November. The further 
tightening of contact restrictions from mid-  
December onwards is not yet reflected here, 
however, as the cut- off date for the December 
data had already passed. Up until this point, as 
was the case in October and November, un -
employment had declined, especially in the 
category  of SGB III job seekers (those receiving 
unemployment benefits under the statutory 
unemployment insurance scheme), which is 
more conditioned by economic activity than 
unemployment under category SGB II, where 
persons receive basic social benefits.Construction

Although employment stabilised quickly fol -
lowing the decline in the second quarter, the 
recovery thereafter can be regarded as ex -
tremely small following a downward revision of 
the data by the Federal Statistical Office. Total 
employment no longer showed any improve -
ment at all in November. According to initial es -
timates by the Federal Statistical Office for 
2020 as a whole, this is likely to be no different 
in December. Nevertheless, the number of em -
ployees continued to rise slightly, while self-  
employment declined significantly in line with 
the trend that has been evident for some time 
now. The leading employment indicators were 
mixed recently, reflecting the current high level 
of uncertainty. While the Ifo employment bar -
ometer fell clearly, the labour market barom -
eter of the Institute for Employment Research 
(IAB) showed a slight improvement. The num -
ber of vacancies also continued to increase. At 
the current juncture, employment is not ex -
pected to decline considerably despite the 
stricter lockdown.
Prices
The past few weeks have seen an acceleration 
in the upward movement for crude oil prices, 
which had begun in November. This was mainly 
due to positive news on vaccination research 
and the OPEC+ decision for an only gradual ex -
pansion of production volumes in 2021. Up to 
the start of January, prices had risen by 25% 
compared with November, which is almost 
one- fifth below the level of a year ago. As this 
report went to press, the price of a barrel of 
Brent crude oil stood at US$56. Crude oil 
futures  were trading at considerable discounts. 
The discount on crude oil futures was US$1 for 
deliveries six months ahead and US$2½ for de -
liveries 12 months ahead.
Import prices rose markedly in November 
overall , mainly as a result of the steep hike in 
energy prices. By contrast, other imported 
goods cost scarcely more than in the previous 
month. Domestic industrial sales prices were also up markedly. The rise in energy prices was 
much the same as that for other goods. As in 
the previous month, prices at the import level 
were just under 4% down on the year and 
domestic   industrial sales prices were 0.5% 
lower.
On the basis of preliminary data, consumer 
prices rose slightly in December for the first 
time since the spring in seasonally adjusted 
terms. This was mainly due to distinctly higher 
energy prices. Services also became slightly 
more expensive. By contrast, food was cheaper 
than in the previous month. Prices for industrial 
goods excluding energy likewise declined as a 
result of high discounts on clothing. The price 
collection was unaffected by the mandatory 
closures of further businesses and services from 
mid- December to contain the spread of the 
virus, as it was largely complete when this 
entered into force. The Harmonised Index of 
Consumer Prices (HICP) was still down by 0.7% 
on the year.3 Excluding energy and food, it is 
likely to have remained 0.1% below the previ -
ous year’s level. If clothing and travel are also 
excluded, the rate rose slightly to +0.4%.
Averaged across 2020, headline inflation is 
likely to have declined from +1.4% to +0.4% 
owing to the collapse in crude oil prices and 
the temporary reduction in VAT rates.4 Exclud -
ing energy and food, the corresponding rate 
was probably +0.7%, after likewise standing at 
+1.4% in 2019. Inflation is likely to be clearly 
positive again in January 2021. From the begin -
ning of the year, CO 2 emission permits are 
being allocated for the consumption of refined  
petroleum products and gas. In addition, VAT 
rates have been raised again. However, there is 
uncertainty as to whether the impact of 
changed tax rates can be fully reflected in the 
price statistics given the ongoing closure of 
businesses.Employment

Public finances
Local government finances
Local government budgets (core budgets and 
off- budget entities) ended the third quarter of 
2020 with a deficit of just under €5½ billion. In 
the same quarter of the previous year, they had 
registered only a small deficit. Revenue de -
clined by 2½% (-€2 billion), chiefly owing to 
tax revenue (-9%, or €2½ billion). Here, rev -
enue from shares in income tax fell somewhat 
more sharply than net receipts from local busi -
ness tax. Although receipts from fees fell dis -
tinctly by 7½%, the decline was half of that 
seen in the second quarter of 2020 when more 
local amenities had been closed. Transfers from 
state governments rose significantly by 4½%, 
although large- scale general purpose grants 
had already been brought forward to the previ -
ous quarter in North Rhine-  Westphalia. The in -
crease might be due to the passing on of cen -
tral government funds intended to ease the 
pandemic- related burdens of local public trans -
port enterprises. Central government had trans -
ferred €2½ billion to state governments for this 
purpose.
Expenditure rose significantly overall by 5% 
(+€3½ billion). At 3½%, growth in the large ex -
penditure item personnel costs distinctly out -
paced the 1% increase in remuneration for sal -
aried employees. Spending on social benefits 
also rose by 3½%. Accommodation costs for 
those receiving unemployment benefit II went 
up only slightly more strongly, although the eli -
gibility criteria had been eased. Other operat -
ing expenditure declined moderately, with re -
strictions on local amenities likely to have 
played a role here. By contrast, grants to non- 
government entities, probably also including 
local public transport enterprises, recorded 
large growth (+9%, or €½ billion). Despite the 
coronavirus crisis, fixed asset formation con -
tinued to expand strongly (+13%, or €1 billion), 
with sharper growth originating from pur -
chases of land and equipment than from con -
struction investment. Developments in the off- budget entities in North Rhine-  Westphalia had 
a noticeable impact here.
In the first three quarters of 2020 combined, 
local government budgets recorded a very 
large deficit of €15 billion. Their budgets had 
practically been balanced in the same period a 
year earlier. In the final quarter of 2020, central 
government and state governments paid a 
one- off sum of €11 billion to compensate local 
governments for shortfalls in local business tax 
arising from the coronavirus pandemic. The 
amount was based on the expected shortfalls 
compared with the tax estimate in autumn 
2019. Moreover, in the fourth quarter, central 
government assumed an additional quarter of 
the accommodation costs for recipients of un -
employment benefit II with retroactive effect 
from the start of 2020 (permanent annual relief 
of approximately €3½ billion). Together with 
these payments, the local government budget

of 2020 could have been largely offset in the 
final quarter.
Overall, central government and state govern -
ments largely shielded local governments from 
the burdens caused by the coronavirus crisis in 
2020. This year, the effects of the crisis will 
probably continue to put strain on regular local 
government receipts. In the absence of special 
adjustments, state government transfers from 
the municipal revenue- sharing scheme, for in -
stance, would be much smaller than antici -
pated before the crisis. Moreover, the tax esti -
mate for 2021, too, indicated large revenue 
shortfalls for local governments as a result of 
the crisis. However, central government does 
not plan to provide further compensation for 
local government tax shortfalls, and there is 
limited scope for budget adjustments at the 
local level. As a result, state governments – in 
line with their fundamental responsibility – will 
be required to step in. The crisis is making it 
clear that local government finances are in 
need of reform. Substantial adjustments ap -
pear advisable in order to ensure stable and 
crisis- proof financing.5
Over the course of the third quarter of 2020, 
local government debt rose by €1½ billion to 
reach €139 billion (including liabilities to the 
public sector). This indicates that most of the 
quarterly deficit was covered using reserves. 
Credit market debt rose by €1 billion to just 
under €98 billion. The volume of cash advances 
increased by just over €½ billion. It thus grew 
to over €38½ billion, after having declined for 
several years until the end of 2019. North 
Rhine-  Westphalia and Lower Saxony made par -
ticular contributions to this rise. By contrast, 
cash advances were repaid in the majority of 
the non- city states in the quarter under review. 
On balance, local governments in Bavaria, in 
particular, largely paid back the cash advances 
taken up in the second quarter of 2020.Securities markets
Bond market
In November 2020, issuance in the German 
bond market stood at €120.0 billion in gross 
terms (previous month: €128.8 billion). After 
deducting redemptions, which were signifi -
cantly lower than in the previous month, and 
taking account of changes in issuers’ holdings 
of their own debt securities, the outstanding 
volume of domestic bonds grew by €26.6 bil -
lion. By contrast, the outstanding amount of 
foreign debt securities in Germany decreased 
by €5.2 billion. The funds raised from sales of 
domestic and foreign debt securities in the 
German  market therefore amounted to €21.3 
billion.
The public sector issued bonds totalling €27.1 
billion net in the reporting month. Ultimately, 
this was chiefly attributable to central govern -
ment (€20.3 billion). Above all, it issued 
five-year Federal notes (Bobls: €15.6 billion) as 
well as two-year Federal Treasury notes 
(Schätze: €4.5 billion) and ten-year Federal 
bonds (Bunds: €3.4 billion). By contrast, central 
government redeemed Treasury discount paper 
(Bubills) in net terms (€3.6 billion). State and 
local government issued bonds worth €6.7 bil -
lion net.
German enterprises increased their capital mar -
ket debt by €0.5 billion net in the reporting 
month. Insurance companies were the chief 
issuers  of bonds, on balance, but other finan -
cial intermediaries were also active in the 
market . The majority of the bonds issued had 
maturities of more than one year. By contrast, 
non-financial corporations redeemed their own 
bonds.
The outstanding volume of debt securities

ance, primarily debt securities issued by special -
ised credit institutions (€1.3 billion) and mort -
gage Pfandbriefe (€1.2 billion) were redeemed. 
This contrasted with net issuance of other bank 
debt securities that can be structured flexibly 
worth €2.4 billion.
Among the various investor groups, the Bun -
desbank was the main buyer in November on 
balance, acquiring debt securities in the net 
amount of €27.7 billion – for the most part 
under the Eurosystem’s asset purchase pro -
grammes. Domestic credit institutions and do -
mestic non-banks increased their holdings of 
bonds by €1.5 billion and €1.1 billion, respect -
ively. While banks primarily purchased foreign 
securities, non-banks’ focus was on domestic 
securities. Foreign investors disposed of Ger -
man debt securities totalling €8.9 billion net.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed €0.2 billion worth of new shares in the 
German equity market (October: €1.1 billion). 
The outstanding volume of foreign shares in 
the German market rose by €9.6 billion over 
the same period. Domestic non-banks and do -
mestic credit institutions were, on balance, the 
main purchasers of equities (€8.1 billion and 
€1.9 billion, respectively), while foreign invest -
ors marginally reduced their equity exposure in 
Germany (€0.2 billion).
Mutual funds
In November, domestic mutual funds sold 
shares totalling €7.5 billion net in the market 
(previous month: €11.7 billion). In net terms, 
fresh funds were injected in almost equal meas -
ure into retail funds and specialised funds 
reserved  for institutional investors (€3.8 billion 
and €3.7 billion, respectively). Among the vari -
ous asset classes, mixed securities-based funds 
(€4.1 billion) and equity funds (€4.0 billion) 
attracted  the most inflows. By contrast, bond funds redeemed their own shares to the tune 
of €2.0 billion net. Foreign mutual funds placed 
shares worth €7.6 billion in the German market 
in the reporting month. On balance, domestic 
non-banks were virtually the sole purchasers, 
adding a net €14.4 billion worth of mutual 
fund shares to their portfolios. Foreign invest -
ors acquired German mutual fund shares for 
€0.9 billion net, while domestic credit institu -
tions sold shares for €0.1 billion net.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €21.3 billion in November 2020, down €1.6 
billion from the previous month’s level. This 
was primarily attributable to a decrease in the 
goods account surplus. The surplus in invisible

as well as primary and secondary income, ex -

In November, the surplus in the goods account 
fell by €1.8 billion on the month to €18.5 bil -
lion, with imports of goods recording a sharper 
increase than exports.
The surplus on invisible current transactions 
went up slightly by €0.2 billion in November to 
€2.7 billion, as the increasing balances of the 
services account and in primary income more 
than offset the larger deficit in the secondary 
income account. In the services account, the 
deficit of €0.4 billion recorded in October 
turned into a surplus of €1.9 billion, chiefly 
owing to the reduction in expenditure linked to 
pandemic- related lower travel spending by resi -
dents. Receipts also declined overall, albeit less 
sharply, with lower receipts from financial ser -
vices and travel having a dampening effect in 
particular. Net receipts on primary income went 
up by €1.0 billion to €8.2 billion, with a decline 
in dividend payments to non- residents on port -
folio investment playing a major role. The def -
icit in the secondary income account widened 
by €3.2 billion to stand at €7.5 billion. This was 
mainly the result of higher general government 
payments to the EU budget in connection with 
financing related to gross national income.
In November 2020, there was growing confi -
dence in the international capital markets that 
the approval of the first vaccines against SARS- 
CoV- 2 would allow the economy to normalise 
in 2021. In addition, the ultimately clear out -
come of the US presidential election reduced 
political uncertainty. It was against this back -
drop that Germany’s cross- border portfolio in -
vestment recorded net capital exports of €19.5 
billion (after €75.2 billion in October). Domestic 
investors purchased foreign securities worth 
€11.1 billion. They purchased shares (€8.7 bil -
lion) and mutual fund shares (€7.6 billion), 
while offloading bonds (€3.4 billion) and 
money market paper (€1.8 billion). Foreign in -
vestors divested themselves of German secur -
ities once more, albeit to a lesser extent (€8.4

The slowdown in euro area productivity 
growth
Economic growth and prosperity are largely determined by developments in labour productivity. 
It is therefore unsurprising that the long- observed slackening of productivity gains in many 
advanced economies has come to the fore of the economic policy debate. In the euro area, too, 
productivity growth has slowed markedly over the past 20 years, albeit with some pronounced 
differences between Member States.
On the one hand, the steep economic losses induced by the global financial and economic crisis 
and the subsequent sovereign debt crisis likely affected productivity growth not only in the short 
term. Beyond this, however, there are also clear signs of structural influences. Growth in total fac -
tor productivity – a key driver of labour productivity – had already declined in large swathes of 
the euro area prior to the onset of the global financial crisis. This can be attributed, amongst 
other things, to a decline in entrepreneurial innovation and adoption activities in some sectors of 
the economy and decreasing allocative efficiency. Continued demographic change is likely to 
have contributed to this. Other possible explanatory factors include the institutional and regula -
tory frameworks in place. The relative loss of importance of the industrial sector, which was 
accompanied by a shift in labour input to economic sectors with comparatively low productivity 
growth, also slowed overall output growth. Increased productivity gains in some service sectors 
were unable to offset this.
The ageing of the population and reduced labour force growth could continue to dampen labour 
productivity growth in the future. At present, it is difficult to assess what impact the coronavirus 
pandemic will have on productivity developments. The macroeconomic turmoil triggered by the 
pandemic is likely to weigh on future labour productivity growth. The extent to which the excep -
tional challenges presented by the current crisis will lead to a wave of innovation that counter -
acts such burdens remains to be seen.Deutsche Bundesbank

Labour productivity develop -
ments in the euro area and 
the Member States
Recently, the focus has mainly been on current 
economic developments on account of the 
coronavirus pandemic. However, the long-  
observed trend of slowing labour productivity 
growth in a great number of advanced econ -
omies remains a core economic policy issue. 
Labour productivity, defined as the ratio of out -
put to labour input, is a key measure of eco -
nomic efficiency.1 Trend developments in la -
bour productivity are an indicator of econ -
omies’ growth potential. Owing to its close link 
to per capita income, labour productivity is 
often also interpreted as a measure of prosper -
ity.
The output measure typically used for the cal -
culation of labour productivity is the price-  
adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) or real 
value added, while labour input is determined based on the number of hours worked or the 
number of persons employed. The number of 
hours worked is considered to be the more 
precise measure of labour input, as both trend 
changes in average hours worked as well as 
temporary reductions in hours worked or ab -
sences are taken into account.
For the euro area as a whole, a marked slow -
down in productivity growth can be observed 
between 1999 and 2019, irrespective of the la -
bour input measure used. Greater differences 
between the two metrics become apparent 
during the global financial and economic crisis 
as well as the subsequent sovereign debt crisis. 
Between 2008 and 2012, the number of hours 
worked fell more sharply than the number of 
persons employed.2 Growth of output per hour 
during this period was accordingly markedly 
higher than that of output per person em -
ployed.
A look at the euro area as a whole conceals 
what are, in some instances, considerable vari -
ations between the Member States. For in -
stance, labour productivity in Estonia, Ireland, 
Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Slovenia in -
creased significantly more strongly on average 
between 1999 and 2019 than the euro area 
average. While the above- average rise in labour 
productivity in central and eastern European 
Member States is to be viewed against the 
backdrop of the ongoing convergence process, 
the statistical data on labour productivity in Ire -
land over the past few years have been strongly 
influenced by the recording of multinational 
enterprises’ business activities.3 By contrast, la -
bour productivity in the five largest euro area 
countries increased much more moderately. 
While labour productivity growth in Germany, 
France and the Netherlands rose on average by 
about 1% per year, the development of prod -Productivity as

uctivity was considerably lower in Spain. In Italy, 
labour productivity growth virtually stagnated.
Looking at individual sub- periods, productivity 
growth before the global financial and eco -
nomic crisis was larger in most euro area coun -
tries than in later years. In the pre- crisis period, 
labour productivity expanded particularly 
strongly in the Baltic States. Productivity gains 
in Italy and Spain, by contrast, were strikingly 
small.
In the wake of both the global financial and 
economic crisis and the subsequent sovereign 
debt crisis, productivity growth in most euro area countries collapsed. In several euro area 
countries, labour productivity even declined. 
Spain represents an exception in this respect. 
As a result of the disproportionately large re -
duction in labour input, hourly labour product -
ivity growth there increased more than fivefold 
during the crisis period.4

a notable exception, with GDP rising at an 
above- average rate during the recovery period, 
whilst employment growth remained subdued. 
In the other countries hit hard by the crisis, 
however, productivity gains remained clearly 
below the euro area average. Labour product -
ivity increased only marginally in Italy and con -
tinued to decline in Greece despite a certain 
degree of economic recovery.
At present, it is difficult to assess how the cur -
rent coronavirus pandemic will affect trend la -
bour productivity growth. At the current end of 
the data, the reduction of labour input during 
the crisis, coupled with simultaneous efforts to 
maintain employment, result in significant dif -
ferences between the development of the 
growth rates of output per hour and output 
per person employed. Alongside these short-  
term effects, however, longer- term impacts are 
to be expected (for more on this, see the box 
on pp. 36 f.).
The flattening of productivity growth between 
1999 and 2019 was observed in several eco -
nomic sectors.5 It was particularly pronounced 
in manufacturing, especially in Germany and 
France. The manufacturing sector had previ -
ously been characterised by above- average 
productivity gains, which also had a marked 
impact on average productivity growth owing 
to the importance of this sector. A similarly 
strong slowdown was observed in the commu -
nication and information sectors. However, 
productivity growth here, as in manufacturing, 
was still above average over the period under 
review.
In other services sectors, by contrast, product -
ivity growth was rather subdued over the 
whole observation period. This was particularly 
true for the provision of professional, scientific,

many and Spain. In wholesale and retail trade, 
transportation and storage, and accommoda -
tion and food service activities, too, euro area 
labour productivity increased only slowly for 
the most part following the introduction of the 
single currency. In the construction sector, 
productivity was subject to what were, in some 
cases, considerable fluctuations. In Italy and 
France, it outright collapsed between 2008 
and 2012. Between 2013 and 2019, output in 
the affected countries recovered perceptibly, 
but productivity growth remained subdued. In 
Spain, by contrast, the sharp contraction in 
construction output during the crisis was 
accompanied  by an even greater reduction in 
the use of mostly low- productivity workers, 
resulting  in a significant increase in average 
labour  productivity growth. Productivity has 
since fallen once again somewhat.7
A comparison with other advanced economies 
shows that subdued productivity developments 
since 2013 are not a specific feature of the euro 
area. In the United States, average growth of 
output per hour was only around one- third of 
its pre- crisis average; in the United Kingdom, it 
stood at only one- fifth. Productivity growth 
also decelerated markedly in Canada and 
Japan. Meanwhile, the decline in the euro area 
was comparatively moderate; hourly productiv -
ity growth here between 2013 and 2019 did 
not differ markedly from that in other ad -
vanced economies. By contrast, hourly prod -
uctivity growth in the euro area had been 
below average before the onset of the financial 
crisis.
Both cyclical and structural factors may provide 
possible explanations for the subdued product -
ivity dynamics. It is conceivable that severe re -
cessions, as seen during the global financial 
and economic crisis and the subsequent sover -
eign debt crisis, could affect productivity gains 
in the longer term by weakening the develop -
ment and adoption of innovations, or disrupt 
the allocation of production factors (see also the box on pp. 28 f.).8 However, data for the 
past four decades show that the slowdown in 
productivity growth started prior to the global 
financial and economic crisis, at least in the 
four largest euro area countries. This finding 
contradicts a purely cyclical explanation of de -
clining productivity growth and also points to 
structural causes.

6 It should, however, be borne in mind that measuring 
labour  productivity in the services sector sometimes 
presents a challenge, for instance, when taking into 
account  quality improvements.
7 A clear shift away from building construction, which has 
declined particularly sharply, towards civil engineering, 
where per capita value added is just over 40% higher, also 
contributed to the considerable increase in labour product -

capital intensity, which is defined as the ratio of 
the capital stock to labour input, and total fac -
tor productivity (TFP).9 The TFP contribution is 
measured as a residual. It captures the part of 
productivity growth that cannot be attributed 
to changes in the factor inputs, serving as a 
yardstick for the increased efficiency of produc -
tion processes.10 The long- term development of 
TFP is sometimes also seen as an indicator of 
disembodied technological progress. In the 
short term, though, it is difficult to make such 
an interpretation. Even in the case of severe 
economic downturns, decreases in techno -
logical progress can, if at all, only be regarded 
to a very limited extent as a plausible explan -ation for calculated TFP declines. Furthermore, 
due to its residual character, the contribution of 
TFP can also pick up other influences on labour 
productivity. Against this background, there is 
good reason to interpret TFP more broadly and 
to view it as a metric of production efficiency.11
According to the growth accounting exercise, 
TFP growth in the four largest euro area econ -
omies has lost significant momentum over the 
past 45 years. An examination of individual 
subperiods shows that the average TFP devel -
opment between 1999 and 2019 was consider -
ably burdened by the crisis years between 2008 
and 2012. In Germany and France, however, 
the TFP growth rate also remained under its 
average of the pre- crisis period in the subse -
quent recovery phase. In Italy, TFP growth pro -
vided no stimulus even prior to the outbreak of 
the global financial crisis, whilst in Spain, TFP 
even decelerated. Recently, however, TFP has 
risen in Spain in particular. Nevertheless, ac -
cording to the calculations, production effi -
ciency overall has also been lower in Italy and 
Spain in the past 20 years than before the turn 
of the millennium. Although the declining TFP 
growth rates in the four largest euro area coun -
tries heavily influence the development of the 
euro area as a whole simply by virtue of their 
aggregate economic output, a similar pattern 
can also be identified in a host of other euro 
area economies.12

area countries were far lower in the period fol -

9 The growth accounting approach is based on several 
assump tions. For instance, it is typically assumed that the 
relationship between output and the effective factor input 
can be depicted using a Cobb Douglas production function 
with constant returns to scale. Furthermore, it is assumed 
for the sake of simplicity that perfect competition exists in 
the goods and factor markets. See also Solow (1957).
10 See also Comin (2008).
11 See Hulten (2001).
12 A fall in TFP growth was also apparent in this period in 
Austria, the Netherlands and Belgium. Together with the 
four largest euro area countries, these countries account 
for approximately 90% of economic output in the euro area.Deutsche Bundesbank

years. Subdued investment and increased la -
bour input were key factors in this develop -
ment.13 Between 2013 and 2019, the growth 
contributions of capital intensity contracted 
once more.
Standard growth accounting provides initial in -
formation about the main driving forces behind 
the slowdown in productivity growth. How -
ever, the results cannot be interpreted without 
acknowledging certain caveats. This applies in 
particular to the TFP contributions. Due to their 
residual character, they can be biased if the ac -
tual factor inputs are not accurately measured. 
Thus far, for example, neither changes in the 
quality of the factor labour or fluctuations in 
the degree of utilisation of labour and capital 
have been taken into account.14 However, fur -
ther analyses that control for these important 
factors confirm the finding of decreasing TFP 
growth, at least for the period since the estab -
lishment of monetary union (see also the box 
on pp.22 ff.).15
Moreover, traditional growth accounting typic -
ally does not take into account the fact that 
technological progress can be embodied and, 
for example, only be released through invest -
ment in new equipment. This applies to a large 
extent to information and communication 
technologies.16 The contribution of capital-  
embodied technological progress to labour 
productivity growth can be determined with a 
model- based analysis. Here, too, the larger 
euro area economies display declining growth 
rates. This supports the hypothesis of a struc -
turally driven slowdown in productivity growth 
(see also the box on pp. 25ff.).
Determinants of total factor 
productivity at the corporate 
level
With regard to the importance of total factor 
productivity for labour productivity, the ques -
tion arises as to the underlying explanatory fac -
tors for the slowdown in TFP growth in large parts of the euro area. A key determinant of 
the overall TFP path is the development of TFP 
at the enterprise level,17 which is a function of 
enterprises’ power to innovate and adopt new 
technologies. The former measures an enter -
prise’s ability to develop new products and pro -
cesses, while the latter assesses how well en -
terprises are able to integrate new technology 
into their production processes. Enterprises’ in -
novation and adoption abilities have recently 
become a focal point.18
Own analyses of corporate data selected from 
a group of euro area countries19 suggest that 
the previously above- average TFP growth of 
highly productive enterprises in the manufac -
turing sector slowed significantly (for more de -
tails, see the box on pp. 28 f.). By contrast, the 
innovative power of service providers with the 
highest TFP level even seems to have increased 
over time, in spite of burdens resulting from 
the global financial crisis and the subsequent 
sovereign debt crisis. Thus, although there is no 
evidence of a general lack of innovation at the 
enterprise level, there are indications of a shift 
in innovation toward services.TFP measure -

13 See also Deutsche Bundesbank (2016). The temporary 
increase in the contribution of capital intensity to hourly 
labour  productivity growth in Italy and Spain during the 
global financial and economic crisis and the subsequent 
sovereign debt crisis was the arithmetical effect of the con -
siderable decline in labour input during this period.
14 For example, actual labour input may differ between 
employed persons working the same number of hours on 
account of their training, professional experience and other 
individual characteristics. For more information on quality 
adjustments to the factor labour and the difficulties en -
tailed, see, inter alia: OECD (2001).
15 Further measurement problems arise in the price adjust -
ment of inputs and outputs as well as the recording of 
capital  input, particularly in the case of intangible goods 
(see OECD (2001) and Deutsche Bundesbank (2002)). The 
assumptions of constant returns to scale and perfect com -
petition are also gross simplifications (see Hulten (2001, 
2010)).

Measuring total factor productivity in the euro area
Total factor productivity (TFP) captures the 
fraction of output that cannot be explained 
by the amount of production factors. It is 
thus a key indicator for the effi   ciency of 
production processes.1 However, TFP is not 
directly observable and, therefore, has to be 
estimated. A common approach is to cap-
ture TFP developments by decomposing 
output growth into the contributions of the 
primary production factors, i.e. labour and 
capital, as well as a residual component.2 
The latter, also known as the Solow re-
sidual, is interpreted as a measure of TFP 
growth.
One key challenge for the determination of 
TFP developments lies in precise measure-
ment of the used production factors.3 For 
example, idle assets or not fully utilised em-
ployees can cause an overestimation of fac-
tor inputs and thereby an underestimation 
of TFP growth. As the rate of capacity util-
isation is typically procyclical, this might 
particularly bias the measurement of TFP in 
boom and bust phases.
By incorporating an indicator for the degree 
of capacity utilisation, it is possible to better 
account for the actual use of production 
factors and, as a result, to measure TFP 
growth more accurately.4 One such indica-
tor can be found in the European Commis-
sion’s business and consumer surveys.5
Not least in order to make full use of the 
available information, the growth decom-
positions are conducted at the sectoral 
level.6 The Solow residual in each economic 
sector is calculated as the difference be-
tween the growth rate of price- adjusted 
gross value added and the growth rates of 
capital and (quality- adjusted) labour input 
weighted by the respective production elas-ticities.7 The Solow residuals are then re-
gressed in a panel on the percentage 
change in the economic sectors’ average 
rates of capacity utilisation and sector- 
specifi  c indicator variables.8 Utilisation- 
adjusted TFP growth of an economic sector 
1 See Comin (2008).
2 See Solow (1957). The decomposition is based on a 
Cobb- Douglas production function with constant re-
turns to scale, which characterises output as a function 
of the capital and labour inputs (weighted by the pro-
duction elasticities) as well as TFP . Assuming perfect 
competition on the factor and product markets, cost 
minimisation by fi  rms implies that the production fac-
tors are remunerated according to their marginal prod-
ucts. The production elasticity of labour can therefore 
be determined by the ratio of the wage bill to gross 
value added, while the elasticity of capital is equal 
to  one minus the elasticity of labour. See Deutsche 
Bundes bank (2012) and Hulten (2010).
3 This is only one possible bias. Distortions in the 
measurement of TFP can also result, inter alia, from 
disregarding factor- embodied technological progress 
or imperfect competition. See Hulten (2001, 2010) and 
Baqaee and Farhi (2020).
4 See Comin et al. (2020).
5 For the big euro area countries, quarterly data on the 
degree of capacity utilisation are available from the 
fi  rst quarter of 1985 onwards for the manufacturing 
sector and from the third quarter of 2011 onwards for 
the services sectors (Italy from the third quarter of 
2010 onwards). See European Commission (2020).
6 The data were taken from the EU KLEMS database 
(https://euklems.eu/).
7 In the EU KLEMS data, labour input is weighted, 
inter alia, by the average educational attainment and 
age of the persons employed in the respective eco-
nomic sector in order to incorporate the characteristics 
of the production factor. Capital services are based on 
the capital stock weighted by the user cost of capital. 
See EU KLEMS (2019). In order to account for the dy-
namics of the production elasticities, these are calcu-
lated as the average of the current and previous year.
8 The methodology follows the approach outlined by 
Basu et al. (2006) for the United States. Comin et al. 
(2020) use a similar approach to determine TFP meas-
ures for selected euro area countries. For the years 
prior to 2011 (for Italy prior to 2010), the capacity 
measures for the services sectors are extended back-
wards by using the growth rate of average capacity 
utilisation in the manufacturing sector (see Comin et 
al. (2020)). Due to a lack of data availability, the aver-
age capacity utilisation for the manufacturing sector is 
also used for the construction, trade as well as energy 
and water supply sectors. Survey data from the ifo 
Institute  and the National Institute of Statistics and 
Economic Studies (Institut national de la statistique et 
des études économiques) are used for the German and 
French construction sectors, respectively.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

is then computed as the difference be-
tween the Solow residual and the estimated 
impact of changes in capacity utilisation.9
Since changes in capacity utilisation can, in 
turn, be triggered by exogenous changes 
in TFP , an instrumental variables approach 
is  used for the estimation. The approach 
requires  variables that are correlated with 
capacity utilisation, but not with TFP 
growth. The following structural shock ser-
ies that were obtained in separate analyses 
prove suitable: an international oil price 
shock, an international fi  nancial market 
shock and macroeconomic uncertainty 
shocks.10 Finally, aggregate TFP growth is 
derived by aggregating the adjusted TFP 
growth rates of the various economic sec-
tors, weighted by gross value added 
shares.11
The calculations were performed for each 
of the four major Member States using data 
for 19 economic sectors.12 To account for 
differences in the effect of capacity utilisa-
tion across different areas of the economy, 
the economic sectors were divided into 
three groups (durable manufacturing, non- 
durable manufacturing, and other eco-
nomic sectors, in particular services). The panel estimations were conducted separ-
ately for each group.
While the time series of the unadjusted and 
adjusted TFP measures show similar trends, 
they can differ signifi  cantly in the short 
term. This is especially true for the years 
during the global fi  nancial and economic 
crisis. Whilst, according to the standard 
Solow  decomposition, TFP contracts sharply 
in most countries during this period, the 
adjusted  measure shows no or only a com-
paratively moderate decline.13 Temporary 
9 Capacity utilisation is only taken into account if the 
estimated coeffi   cient is signifi  cant at the 90% level.
10 The oil price shock is calculated on the basis of 
movements in the Brent oil price (see Basu et al. 
(2006)). The uncertainty shocks stem from structural 
macroeconomic models (see Jurado et al. (2015) and 
Meinen and Röhe (2017)). The fi  nancial market shock 
is based on the indicator introduced by Gilchrist and 
Zakrajšek (2012) for the non- predictable component of 
risk premia on US corporate bonds. Statistical tests cer-
tify that the instruments are suffi   ciently correlated with 
the capacity utilisation of the sectors provided in the 
surveys.
11 See Hulten (1978).
12 The estimation period spans from 1997 to 2017 
(Spain: 1997 to 2016). The models comprise sections 
D- E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M- N, R- S of the Statistical classifi  ca-
tion of economic activities in the European Community 
(NACE) as well as NACE divisions C10- C12, C13- C15,

tor.

With regard to enterprises’ ability to adopt new 
technologies, there have been indications of a 
growing discrepancy between the TFP growth 
of highly productive enterprises and that of 
other enterprises since the global financial and 
economic crisis. The manufacturing sector is 
showing a similar development, although the 
differences between the groups of enterprises 
are noticeably smaller than those seen for ser -
vices. Overall, the empirical analysis thus pro -
vides a differentiated picture of the reasons be -
hind a flattening- out of TFP growth.
A decline in an enterprise’s capacity for innov -
ation and technology adoption can have a var -
iety of causes. In addition to cyclical influences 
–  in the form of severe recessions, for ex -
ample – these include structural impediments 
such as a lack of quality in the institutional en -
vironment,20 rigidities in the labour and prod -
uct markets,21 an increasing market concentra -
tion22 or a lack of availability of (specific) human 
capital.23 Thus, the considerable economic tur -moil in the wake of the global financial and 
economic crisis and the subsequent sovereign 
debt crisis are just one possible cause of the 
slowdown in innovation capabilities and diffu -
sion in the euro area countries. For example, 
there are also indications in the euro area of a 
clear need for reform in the institutional and 
regulatory frameworks, in some cases.24 Added 
to this is the skills mismatch observed in the 
euro area labour market,25 which is likely to be -
come increasingly important in view of the on -
going demographic change (see also the re -
marks on pp. 33 ff.).Signs of enter -

tors can therefore often be explained by 
changes in capacity utilisation and, conse-
quently, do not represent effi   ciency de-
clines.
Over the longer term, the estimations con-
fi  rm the fi  ndings from macroeconomic 
growth decompositions which are based 
on aggregate data (see also the remarks on 
pp. 19 ff.). In Germany, a slowdown in TFP 
growth is apparent following the global 
fi  nan cial and economic crisis, whilst in 
France, TFP even stagnated. The picture is 
somewhat different for Italy and Spain. Fol-
lowing a continuous decline over most of 
the observation period, TFP improved for 
the fi  rst time in these countries before the 
onset of the current economic downturn.

Capital- embodied technological progress and its importance 
for labour productivity: a DSGE analysis
Not least in view of the role played by infor-
mation and communication technology 
(ICT), a range of studies has emphasised the 
importance of capital- embodied techno-
logical progress for the economy as a 
whole.1 This specifi  c form of technological 
change requires capital investment to be-
come effective, and it impacts labour prod-
uctivity, inter alia, by improving the quality 
of the capital stock.2 Investment by fi  rms in 
new, more powerful computer equipment 
is commonly cited as an example of capital- 
embodied technological progress enhan-
cing productivity. Standard growth account-
ing approaches, which are based solely on 
disembodied technological progress, ignore 
these relationships.3
Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium 
(DSGE) models4 are one way to grasp the 
macroeconomic role of capital- embodied 
technological progress.5 This framework 
can also be used to estimate its contribu-
tion to trend labour productivity growth.6
To illustrate the approach, this box analyses 
labour productivity growth in the three larg-
est euro area countries and the United 
States based on a DSGE model with differ-
ent types of capital. In order to evaluate the 
extent to which capital- embodied techno-
logical progress specifi  cally in the fi  eld of ICT 
contributes to labour productivity growth, 
we divide the capital stock (excluding struc-
tures) into two types of capital: ICT capital, 
which comprises information and commu-
nication technology plus software and data-
bases, and other assets (non- ICT capital).7
In the model, the total contribution of 
capital- embodied technological change is 
equal to the weighted sum of the techno-
logical progress associated with each of 
these types of capital.8 Capital- specifi  c tech-
nological progress can be measured by the 
development of the ratio of consumption goods prices to investment goods prices.9 
The idea here is that investment- specifi  c 
innov ations will lower the price of invest-
ment goods relative to that of consumption 
goods.10 The resulting increase in demand 
for investment goods is ultimately what en-
ables technological progress to have its 
productivity- enhancing effect. However, 
the importance of capital- embodied tech-
nological progress of a specifi  c capital type 
for labour productivity growth is also deter-
mined by its relative weight in the produc-
tion process. Assuming a Cobb- Douglas 
production function with constant returns 
1 See, inter alia, Solow (1960), Greenwood et al. 
(1997), Hercowitz (1998), Cooper et al. (1999) and 
Greenwood and Jovanovic (2001).
2 The terms “capital- embodied technological pro-
gress” and “investment- specifi  c technological pro-
gress” are therefore often used interchangeably in the 
literature.
3 See Solow (1957).
4 A typical feature of this model class is the way it 
seeks to explain macroeconomic relationships and de-
velopments based on the individual optimal decisions 
of rational economic agents. More specifi  cally, it as-
sumes that economic agents do not make any system-
atic errors when forming their expectations and that 
they make optimum use of all the information avail-
able to them. In this sense, they behave “rationally”. 
This model framework is presented in detail, inter alia, 
in Christiano et al. (2018).
5 See, inter alia, Justiniano et al. (2011), Schmitt- Grohé 
and Uribe (2012) and Díaz and Franjo (2016).
6 See, inter alia, Greenwood et al. (1997), Bakhshi and 
Larsen (2005) and Rodríguez- López and Torres (2012).
7 The analysis for the three euro area countries is 
based on data from the EU KLEMS database on the 
capital stock, depreciation rates, the labour income 
share and labour productivity. These data are available 
over the period 1999 to 2017. For the United States, 
meanwhile, the relevant data are sourced from the US 
Bureau of Economic Analysis (national income and 
product accounts and fi  xed assets accounts) and the 
US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
8 The assumption here is that exogenous capital- 
embodied technological progress can be described by 
a stochastic trend. See also Schmitt- Grohé and Uribe 
(2011).
9 The model assumes that there is a linear relationship 
between the relative price and capital- embodied tech-
nological progress. Empirical evidence suggesting that 
such a relationship exists can be found, inter alia, in 
Schmitt- Grohé and Uribe (2011).

to scale, the weight is given by the ratio of 
the respective capital income to total labour 
income.11,12 This allows both technological 
progress and its relative importance for 
aggregate  productivity to be derived in a 
model- consistent manner from macroeco-
nomic data. In traditional growth account-
ing approaches, by contrast, the contribu-
tion of (disembodied) technological pro-
gress to labour productivity growth is typic-
ally measured as a residual. This might lead 
to considerable mismeasurement of tech-
nological progress (see also the box on 
pp. 22 ff.).13
However, the approach outlined above re-
lies on a number of simplifying assump-
tions. These include, in addition to the basic 
principles of the standard neoclassical 
model, the assumption of a closed econ-
omy and of labour being a homogenous 
production factor.14,15 The model further-
more presumes that there is a direct inverse 
relationship between capital- embodied 
technological progress and the respective 
relative price of ICT and non- ICT investment 
goods. This requires that the prices of in-
vestment goods are accurately captured in 
the offi   cial statistics.16
11 One particular feature of the model specifi  cation 
chosen here is the assumption of time- varying produc-
tion elasticities. Therefore, unlike in the prototypical 
approach, there is no need to confi  ne the analysis to 
an assessment of long- term equilibria (where it is 
standard practice to assume constant parameters as 
production elasticities that are calibrated to average 
values). Instead, changes in capital and labour income 
shares can be taken into account. In the above DSGE 
approach, exogenous stochastic shocks are assumed 
to capture the time- varying production elasticities. See 
Young (2004), Ríos- Rull and Santaeulàlia- Llopis (2010) 
and Lansing (2015).
12 See Eden and Gaggl (2018).
13 See also Greenwood and Krusell (2007).
14 For a critical discussion of these assumptions, see, 
inter alia, Chen and Wemy (2015).
15 The impact of capital goods imports on investment- 
specifi  c technological progress is discussed, inter alia, 
in Cavallo and Landry (2010).
16 In this regard, the literature notes that in the fi  eld 
of ICT especially, insuffi   cient attention has been given 
to adjustments for changes in quality, which can lead 
to a mismeasurement of technological progress. See, 
inter alia, Byrne et al. (2017).Contributions of capital-embodied

The role of factor allocation 
and business dynamism in the 
development of total factor 
productivity
In addition to within- firm dynamics, the distri -
bution of production factors, such as labour 
and capital, across enterprises plays an import -
ant role in aggregate productivity growth. The 
reallocation of production factors from rela -
tively low- productivity enterprises to high-  
productivity enterprises is a key driver of aggre -
gate TFP growth.26 By contrast, systematic mis -
allocations reduce aggregate production effi -
ciency.
A comparison of the marginal revenue prod -
ucts of capital and labour across enterprises 
within an industry provides an important indi -
cation of whether production factors have 
been misallocated. The marginal revenue prod -
uct shows how revenue would change if an en -
terprise raised its factor input marginally. Diver -ging marginal revenue products within an in -
dustry suggest that value added can be pushed 
up by decreasing (increasing) the input of pro -
duction factors in enterprises with a relatively 
low (high) marginal revenue product. In case of 
an efficient allocation, the marginal revenue 
products of enterprises in an industry should be 
similar to each other.27
Corporate data provide an opportunity to 
examine the development of marginal revenue 
products. For the euro area, however, limited 
data availability across countries and sectors TFP growth also

factor allocation

enterprises

that the contributions of capital- embodied 
progress in ICT to aggregate labour prod-
uctivity growth turned out to be smaller in 
all countries under observation during the 
post- crisis period compared to the time be-
fore the global fi  nancial and economic cri-
sis. In this context, it is noteworthy that ICT- 
specifi  c technological progress had a com-
paratively low relative weight for labour 
productivity over the entire observation 
period.17 This suggests that the at times 
fairly large ICT- specifi  c growth contributions 
to labour productivity, particularly in the 
1999-2007 sub- period, can be attributed to 
exceptionally strong growth rates of capital- 
embodied technological progress. This is 
particularly the case for the United States.18
Non- ICT- specifi  c technological progress 
evolved in a similar way over time, its con-
tribution to labour productivity growth like-
wise decreasing markedly and even chan-
ging signs in part in recent years.Taken as a whole, all countries considered 
saw the growth contributions of capital- 
embodied technological progress decline 
in the post- crisis period relative to the pre-
ceding era. This outcome is consistent with 
the fi  nding that TFP dynamics have been 
receding , as outlined by traditional growth 
accounting exercises (see the remarks on 
this topic on pp. 19 ff.).19
17 Average ICT capital income shares range between 
2% (Italy) and 5% (United States) over the total obser-
vation period. By contrast, capital income shares for 
non- ICT assets vary from 10% in the United States to 
19% in France.
18 The United States records signifi  cantly higher con-
tributions of ICT- specifi  c technological progress to la-
bour productivity growth than the three euro area 
countries over all periods under observation. This fi  nd-
ing is consistent with the results of other empirical 
studies. See, inter alia, van Ark et al. (2003) and Cette 
et al. (2015).

26 See, inter alia, Foster et al. (2001, 2006), Bartelsman et 
al. (2013) and Restuccia and Rogerson (2017).
27 In macroeconomic models, the marginal revenue prod -
ucts of enterprises in an industry are, under certain assump-
tions, identical in a first- best scenario. These models assume , 
in particular, identical production functions of the Cobb-  
Douglas type as well as perfect price adjustments to 
changes in demand. See Hsieh and Klenow (2009) and

Developments in innovation activity and productivity 
growth in Europe
In recent years, the advanced economies 
have seen a marked decline in productivity 
growth. “Techno- pessimists” attribute this 
to a slowdown in technological progress, 
i.e. a general low level of innovation.1 From 
the point of view of “techno- optimists”, 
however, technological progress is generally 
still intact. In their opinion, weak productiv-
ity growth is more a result of mismeasure-
ment, allocation ineffi   ciencies, and a re-
duced diffusion of innovation.2
The question of the extent to which weak 
productivity growth in Europe stems more 
from a low level of innovation or more from 
reduced diffusion can be investigated using 
a dataset covering enterprises from six euro 
area countries (Belgium, France, Germany, 
Italy, Portugal and Spain); this data can be 
used to calculate growth rates in total fac-tor productivity (TFP) for each enterprise 
and each year.3 The fi  ndings are inconsist-
ent: while TFP growth among highly pro-
ductive enterprises4 – interpreted here as a 
measure of innovative power  – actually 
appears  to have increased recently in the 
services sector, it declined in the manufac-
turing sector. According to the calculations, 
productivity growth among the leading en-
terprises in the high- technology segments 
of the manufacturing sector in particular 
– such as pharmaceuticals, mechanical en-
gineering and IT hardware – has fallen dis-
tinctly over time.5 One reason for this may 
have been waning business dynamics (as 
measured by rates of market entry and 
exit). At the very least, this is suggested by 
the relatively high and sharply increasing 
average age of the leading enterprises in 
1 See Gordon (2016) and Bloom et al. (2020a).
2 See Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014), van Ark (2016) 
and OECD (2015).
3 The analysis is based on the iBACH database (micro 
Bank for the Accounts of Companies Harmonized) pro-
cessed by the ECB and expanded to include data from 
the Orbis database (Bureau van Dijk). This database 
contains annual balance sheet data from a multitude 
of non- fi  nancial enterprises from the six aforemen-
tioned countries. The database provides information 
on a considerable portion of the relevant enterprises in 
France, Italy, Portugal, Spain and, to a limited extent, in 
Belgium. Germany is represented only by a compara-
tively small number of large enterprises, which are in-
cluded in the Orbis database. Annual and enterprise- 
specifi  c TFP levels and growth rates were calculated 
using an estimated production function. The dataset 
covers the period from 2005 to 2017 as well as the fol-
lowing NACE sections: C (excluding C12 and C19), F, 
G, H (excluding H51), I, J, L, M (excluding M75) and N 
(excluding N78 and N82).
4 For each year, the most productive enterprises are 
defi  ned as the 5% of enterprises with the highest TFP 
level in a given industry (NACE level 4) in that year.
5 The segments of the manufacturing sector are div-
ided into those with relatively intensive usage of high 
technology and those with comparatively limited 
usage of high technology on the basis of the corres-
ponding Eurostat classifi  cation. The group of high- 
technology industries includes NACE divisions C20, 
C21, C26, and C27 to C30.Average annual TFP growth rates

this subgroup.6 On the whole, however, the 
enterprise data provide no indication of a 
general low level of innovation.7
With regard to TFP growth among less pro-
ductive enterprises,8 which comprise the 
majority of enterprises in every sector, the 
fi  ndings are similarly complex. In this case, 
too, the TFP growth of enterprises in the 
manufacturing sector appears to have 
declined  noticeably. By contrast, TFP growth 
in the services sector stagnated despite 
heightened innovation activity among the 
leading enterprises. As a result, the gap in 
productivity between highly productive and 
less productive service providers widened 
considerably, which may be interpreted as a 
sign of a reduced diffusion of technology.9
There are a number of possible explan-
ations for the decline in technology diffu-
sion observed in some sectors. For instance, 
the nature of technological progress over 
recent years, often characterised by the use 
of digital technologies and intangible cap-
ital, may have made it more diffi   cult to 
close productivity gaps.10 In addition, a 
general rise in market power – not neces-
sarily induced by technology  – may have 
reduced  incentives to adapt technologies or 
innovate.11 In Europe, however, there is very 
little evidence to suggest a broadly based 
increase in market concentration and mar-
ket power.12 Ultimately, even if there are in-
centives to adapt innovations, it is likely 
that, in many cases, enterprises simply lack 
the corresponding complementary resources 
required to do so (such as well- trained and 
skilled workers or a specifi  c infrastructure).13
In summary, the results of the enterprise 
data analysis suggest that there are multifa-
ceted reasons for weak macroeconomic 
productivity. They do not provide any indi-
cation of a general low level of innovation. 
The fi  ndings suggest that the leading, highly productive enterprises should be given suf-
fi  cient scope to develop their growth po-
tential, at least to the extent that this does 
not excessively subdue their incentives to 
innovate or third parties’ incentives to imi-
tate. Less successful competitors should not 
be prevented from exiting the market and 
the subsequent reallocation of resources 
should not be obstructed. Such an ap-
proach would most likely boost macro-
economic productivity growth.
6 In the subgroup of industries that utilise high tech-
nology less intensively, the average age of enterprises 
at the technology frontier (known as “frontier fi  rms”) 
rose by just over 1 year from 14 years (in the period 
from 2006 to 2007) to around 15¼ years (in the 
period from 2013 to 2017). For industries characterised 
by greater usage of high technology, this fi  gure rose by 
around 5½ years to just under 19 years during the 
same period.
7 Here, it also cannot be ruled out that, especially 
during  phases of cyclical upturn and downturn, TFP 
growth is captured only imprecisely (for more informa-
tion, see the box entitled “Measuring total factor prod-
uctivity in the euro area”).
8 In this context, the productivity growth of this group 
is approximated based on the TFP growth of the enter-
prise with the median TFP level in each year and each 
industry (NACE level 4).
9 A number of studies have reached similar overall 
conclusions for the services sector in particular. See 
Andrews et al. (2015, 2019), Lotti and Sette (2019), 
Cette et al. (2018) and Decker et al. (2016).
10 In this vein, it is argued that the rising use of digital 
technologies and intangible capital, which is often as-
sociated with high fi  xed costs and network effects, 
also leads to increasing economies of scale. See Haskel 
and Westlake (2018), Aghion et al. (2020) and De 
Ridder  (2020). Such economies of scale cannot be rep-
licated at will. Increasing economies of scale could also 
result in “superstar effects” (see Autor et al. (2020)): 
especially in less mature sectors, market leaders may 
use economies of scale to capture large market shares 
within very short periods of time, thus leading to rising 
market concentration and market power. This may 
reduce  the incentives to invest in innovation and 
adapting technologies, which would ultimately have a 
dampening effect on productivity growth. See Aghion 
et al. (2020), De Ridder (2020) and Le Mouel and 
Schiersch (2020).
11 For example, multiple studies suggest a broadly 
based increase in market power for the United States 
in particular over the past few years. See De Loecker et 
al. (2020).
12 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2017), OECD (2018) 
and Gutierrez and Philippon (2020).
13 In particular, there may be a lack of suffi   cient 
human capital (see Berlingieri et al. (2020)). This 
applies  especially with regard to digital technologies 
that require employees with relevant IT skills in order 
to be utilised successfully. See Autor et al. (2003) and 
OECD (2016).Deutsche Bundesbank

complicates this analysis.28 Nonetheless, by 
using a panel model with indicator variables for 
industries, countries and years, it is possible to 
estimate how the dispersion of marginal rev -
enue products has changed on average across 
economic industries.29 The estimated coeffi -
cients of the annual indicators reflect how the 
dispersion has changed on average across all 
industries and countries over time. They show 
that the dispersion of marginal revenue prod -
ucts has increased since the mid- 2000s, and 
that this rise accelerated again slightly at the 
end of the estimation horizon.30 Moreover, this 
fairly continuous development suggests that 
these are not purely cyclical phenomena. Ra -
ther, allocation efficiency within euro area in -
dustries appears to have deteriorated structur -
ally, which is likely to have contributed to the 
slowdown in euro area productivity growth.31
Changes in business dynamism are one pos -
sible explanation for the declining allocation ef -
ficiency between enterprises. For instance, a number of studies stress the importance of en -
terprise births and deaths for reallocation pro -
cesses and productivity growth.32 Schumpete -
rian growth models, in which the entry of 
young innovative firms into the market in -
creases the degree of competition and the 
pressure for competitors to innovate, thus lead -
ing to the exit of less profitable producers (“cre -
ative destruction”), also indicate a link between 
business dynamism and productivity growth.33
Owing in particular to the limited availability of 
data, a panel model is estimated to answer the 
question of how business dynamism has de -
veloped in the euro area.34 Country- specific 
sectoral market entry and exit rates are re -
gressed on a constant and indicator variables

28 Data on marginal revenue products are taken from the 
CompNet database ( www.comp-net.org ). An enterprise’s 
marginal revenue product is calculated as a product of the 
production elasticity of labour or capital and the ratio of 
revenue to labour or capital input, assuming a Cobb-  
Douglas production function and perfect competition. The 
dispersion is calculated as the standard deviation of the 
marginal revenue products across enterprises within an in -
dustry, with these being normalised at the industry level 
(see Kehrig (2011)).
29 The estimates include data from eleven euro area coun -
tries and 57 industries for the years 2000 to 2015. The 
latter  belong to the following NACE sections: “manufactur -
ing” (C), “construction” (F), “wholesale and retail trade; re -
pair of motor vehicles and motorcycles” (G), “accommoda -
tion and food service activities” (I), “information and com -
munication” (J), “transportation and storage” (H), “real es -
tate activities” (L), “professional, scientific and technical 
activities” and “administrative and support service activ -
ities” (M- N). The data situation varies considerably across 
countries. For example, only data for NACE section C are 
available for Germany. See CompNet (2020).
30 It should be noted that estimation uncertainty is higher 
due to a smaller number of observations for the dispersion 
of the marginal revenue product of capital.
31 The finding is consistent with indications that misalloca -
tions have increased in southern European countries (Gopi -
nath et al. (2017)) and selected OECD countries (Corrado et 
al. (2019)). When interpreting the results, it should be 
borne in mind that an aggregate analysis may mask poten -
tial differences between countries.

of sectoral data on enterprise births and deaths provides an

for countries, years and sectors.35,36 The 
changes in the annual enterprise birth and 
death rates in the euro area are then derived 
from the estimated coefficients of the time in -
dicators.37 The data cover 19 euro area coun -
tries, each with nine economic sectors,38 for 
the years 1999 to 2017.
There are signs that business dynamism in the 
euro area has undergone a slowing trend. 
However, developments have not been steady 
and the estimates are subject to considerable 
uncertainty. The development between 2013 
and 2017 is particularly striking. Despite the 
broad- based economic upturn over this period, 
the rates of enterprise births and deaths de -
clined markedly. As the economic situation was 
favourable overall, one would normally have 
expected a rise in enterprise births.39 A possible 
explanation for this development is the similarly 
unusual marked decline in the market exit rate. 
If fewer firms exit the market, this can impede 
the entry of potential candidates, as competi -
tion for sales markets and scarce production 
factors is then greater.40 The question therefore 
arises as to whether the extended policy meas -
ures implemented during this period were 
beneficial to established enterprises in particu -
lar and could have thus dampened business 
dynamism.
Structural change as a possible 
cause of flattening productivity

the workforce working in economic sectors 
with comparatively low productivity growth in -
creases on account of consumer preferences.41 
This curbs overall productivity growth even 
without changes in productivity or its growth 
rate in individual enterprises or sectors.42 The 
significance of this reallocation effect can be il -
lustrated by breaking down productivity growth 
into three sub-  components. A “reallocation 
level effect” captures the contribution to ag -
gregate productivity growth that results from a 
shift in labour input between sectors with dif -
ferent productivity levels. A “reallocation 
growth effect” measures the impact of a shift 
in working hours between sectors with differ -
ent productivity growth rates. In addition, there 
is an “intrasectoral effect”, which is calculated 
as the weighted sum of productivity growth in 
the economic sectors under consideration and 
which reflects, amongst other things, sector-  
specific TFP growth.43 When viewed in isol -
ation, the reallocation growth effect causes ag -
gregate hourly productivity to rise when labour input increases (decreases) in areas with posi -
tive (negative) productivity growth. The reallo -
cation level effect makes a positive contribution 
to labour productivity growth if hours worked 
are increased (reduced) in sectors with a com -
paratively high (low) hourly productivity relative 
to aggregate labour productivity.44 Conse -
quently, factor reallocation across economic 
activities can help to increase aggregate labour Contributions to labour productivity growth in selected euro area countries*

42 See Baumol (1967) and Baumol et al. (1985).
43 The literature contains various methods of decompos -
ing labour productivity growth in this manner. In order to 
avoid distortions that may arise when adding chained vol -
ume data, the “generalised exactly additive decompos -
ition” (GEAD) method was used to break down hourly 
productivity. A detailed description of the method can be 
found in Tang and Wang (2004) and Dumagan (2013).
44 In the context of this kind of labour productivity decom -
position, some simplifying assumptions are typically made, 
including the fact that no differences in the quality of the 
labour input are taken into account.Deutsche Bundesbank

productivity even if sectoral productivity growth 
is stagnant.45
A corresponding decomposition for the four 
largest euro area economies shows that, on 
average, productivity growth over the years 
1999 to 2019 was driven mainly by the intra -
sectoral effect.46 Nevertheless, reallocation ef -
fects in countries where the intrasectoral effect 
is relatively small can have a noticeable impact 
on aggregate productivity growth. However, it 
can be seen that the direction of impact of the 
two reallocation effects is often divergent. For 
instance, the reallocation level effect was 
mostly positive on average across all of the sec -
tors under consideration (labour input shifted 
on average to sectors with above- average 
productivity), while the reallocation growth ef -
fect was negative (labour input shifted on aver -
age to sectors with below- average productivity 
growth).47 The latter was mainly driven by the 
relative loss of importance of the industrial sec -
tor. The negative impact of the reallocation 
growth effect was particularly strong in the 
pre- crisis period from 1999 to 2007. Neverthe -
less, in France, Italy and Spain a productivity-  
dampening effect –  albeit only marginal at 
times – caused by shifts in the number of hours 
worked to economic sectors with compara -
tively weak productivity growth can also be 
seen in the economic recovery period from 
2013 to 2019.
The impact of demographic 
change
Demographic change is another structural fac -
tor with a potential impact on labour product -
ivity. The progressive ageing of the population 
can dampen productivity growth in a number 
of ways. First, there are indications that individ -
ual productivity varies across age groups and 
tends to decline at an older age.48 There is also 
growing evidence that societal ageing reduces 
innovation and technology adoption.49Decomposition

45 Alongside changes in labour input, sectoral relative 
price changes can also influence the contributions of re -
allocation effects in the GEAD decomposition. Although 
these price effects can be isolated by modifying the GEAD 
method, this comes at the cost of giving up an isolated 
assess ment of the two reallocation effects; see Diewert 
(2015). It is evident, however, that the price effects have a 
negligible impact on the results of the analysis carried out 
here.
46 Only the following NACE sections are considered here: 
A (agriculture, forestry and fishing), B- E, F, G- I, J, K, M- N 
and R-  S (arts, entertainment and recreation and other ser -
vice activities). The reasons for this selection include the 
partial absence of market prices in public services data and, 
with regard to the aim of measuring efficiency, a distorting 
effect in the case of real estate activities. In the case of the 
latter, total rents from real estate including the use of 
owner- occupied dwellings are recorded. See also Institute 
for the World Economy (2017).
47 In the four euro area countries considered in the analy -
sis, the positive reallocation level effect between 1999 and 
2019 is due, in particular, to a relative increase in labour 
input in “professional, scientific and technical activities” 
and “administrative and support service activities” (NACE 
sections M and N). Although these areas showed below-  
average productivity growth over the period under review, 
their level of productivity was above average.
48 See Feyrer (2007), Jones (2010), Aiyar et al. (2016) and 
Maestas et al. (2016).
49 Empirical studies suggest that an ageing population 
negatively affects the number of patent applications (Aksoy 
et al. (2019)), enterprise births (Ouimet and Zarutskie 
(2014)) and the ability to adopt new technologies (Wein -
berg (2004) and Skirbekk (2004)).Deutsche Bundesbank

Furthermore, it is conceivable that societal age -
ing, as a result of declining growth of the la -
bour force and rising life expectancy, may also 
influence TFP growth through its impact on 
market dynamics. A dynamic general equilib -
rium model with overlapping generations as 
well as endogenous market entry and exit of 
enterprises demonstrates this.50 In this model, 
ageing reduces fluctuations in the number of 
enterprises.51 This is due, in particular, to the 
savings decisions prompted by higher life ex -
pectancy, which depress the real interest rate.52 
As a result, incumbent enterprises find it easier 
to refinance their fixed assets, with the result 
that fewer enterprises close. This creates a competitive disadvantage for potential market 
entry candidates, which is reflected in a decline 
in the birth rate of enterprises in the long term. 
Business dynamism, however, is an important 
driver of TFP growth. The model framework 
also illustrates that societal ageing can dampen 
labour productivity growth over time, even 
without having a direct impact on TFP .53
In order to empirically examine the impact of 
demographic change on productivity growth in 
the euro area, a vector autoregressive model 
with a panel structure is estimated. In this 
model, important macroeconomic variables for 
a number of Member States are regressed on 
their own lagged values and exogenous vari -
ables. The dependent variables comprise year-  
on- year labour productivity growth, the saving 
and investment ratio, the short- term real inter -
est rate and the inflation rate. The exogenous 
variables are demographic indicators: the 
shares of the population that are categorised 
as young (below 20), middle aged (aged 20 to 
64) and elderly (aged 65 and above).54 Because 
of the data’s cross- sectional dimension, the 
model can also take advantage of variations in 
the ageing process across Member States to 
identify the effect of demographic changes on 
endogenous variables. The panel model com -

51 This finding is consistent with studies that see ageing as

United States. See Pugsley and Sahin (2019), Hopenhayn et 
al. (2018) and Karahan et al. (2019).
52 See also Carvalho et al. (2016) as well as Kara and von 
Thadden (2016).
53 For example, although a higher life expectancy leads to 
a clear rise in capital intensity – assuming a prototypical 
production function – its growth rate declines steadily over 
time, which is reflected in a slowdown in labour productiv -
ity growth.

between the share of the population classed as young and

As demographic variables typically only change 
slowly over time, the analysis focuses on long- 
term relationships, which can be derived from 
the estimated coefficients of the panel model.56 
This analysis suggests that an increase in the 
share of the elderly population – with a concur -
rent fall in the young and middle- aged popula -
tion shares – is likely to have dampened labour 
productivity growth in the euro area countries. 
Between 2007 and 2017, for example, the 
share of the population aged over 65 in the 
euro area increased by around 2.5 percentage 
points. According to the estimation, overall 
productivity growth in the euro area would 
have been around 0.8 percentage point higher 
during this period if the age structure had re -
mained unchanged.
United Nations projections suggest that the 
percentage of the euro area population aged 
over 65 years will rise even more sharply in the 
future. Between 2017 and 2030, their share is 
expected to increase from around 20% to more 
than 25%. According to the estimates, this 
would depress euro area productivity growth 
by a total of 1.4 percentage points over this 
period. On average, this corresponds to a de -
cline of just over 0.1 percentage point per year. The picture is similar for the euro area’s four 
major economies. However, productivity 
growth in Italy and Spain would, in fact, de -
cline somewhat more sharply, as the ageing 
process is forecasted to be more rapid there. 
When interpreting the projections, it should, 
however, be noted, that the estimation results 
(as well as the population forecasts) are subject 
to uncertainty. Moreover, no account is taken 
of potential factors that could counteract the 
adverse effects of ageing. And finally, the cal -
culations are based on the simplifying assump -
tion that changes in the age structure have the 
same impact on productivity trends in all the 
countries included in the analysis.
Conclusion and outlook
Growth in labour productivity in the euro area 
has slowed significantly over the past 20 years.

Possible impact of the coronavirus pandemic on 
productivity  growth in the euro area
In the light of the current severe economic 
crisis and its specifi  c nature, the question 
arises as to the implications for euro area 
productivity growth. In the short term, both 
the pandemic- induced constraints on pro-
duction and also its recovery are having a 
direct impact on labour productivity. In this 
context, it is of signifi  cance that govern-
ments’ efforts are currently aimed at safe-
guarding as many jobs as possible. One 
instrum ent in this respect is government- 
assisted short- time work. As a consequence, 
output per person employed in the euro 
area initially fell signifi  cantly before recover-
ing again.
The development of output per hour 
worked was more remarkable. It rose 
sharply at times, as it already had done in 
some countries during the global fi  nancial and economic crisis. Compositional effects 
are likely to have played a role in this, as 
the containment measures mainly affected 
sectors  with below- average labour prod-
uctivity. This probably obscured possible 
productivity- reducing effects caused by ab-
rupt, pandemic- related changes in working 
methods, such as the switch to telework-
ing.1 The temporary closure of child daycare 
facilities and schools presumably has also 
affected not only labour supply but also 
labour  productivity.2
Beyond these short- term impacts, longer- 
term effects need to be taken into account. 
For example, despite the massive economic 
and monetary policy interventions, invest-
ment activity suffered signifi  cantly, also 
owing to the temporarily steep rise in un-
certainty.3 If the decline in investment is not 
compensated for suffi   ciently fast, it is likely 
to weigh on enterprises’ innovation per-
formance and technology adoption, and 
therefore hamper productivity growth. Be-
yond this, reduced investment activity im-
pedes labour productivity via its negative 
impact on capital intensity. These factors 
may possibly be countered by productivity 
increases induced by the pandemic. The cri-
sis forced enterprises and employees to try 
new ways of working. Some of the lessons 
learned could also be useful in the future.4 
Examples include more fl  exible working 
models and virtual conference formats. In 
general, there are signs of a boost to digi-
talisation.
1 See Bloom et al. (2015) and Bloom (2020).
2 In addition, there may possibly be longer- term impli-
cations for productivity as a result of a deterioration in 
the quality of school education. See also Fuchs- 
Schündeln et al. (2020).

growth rates of total factor productivity. Ana -
lyses of the underlying driving forces point to 
cyclical influences as well as, in particular, struc -
tural factors. For some sectors of the economy, 
there are indications to suggest that enter -
prises’ ability to innovate and adopt may have 
diminished. Moreover, inefficiencies in the allo -
cation of production factors appear increas -
ingly to have contributed to the slowdown in 
productivity growth. Alongside the institutional 
and regulatory framework, demographic 
change is another possible structural factor. As 
a society ages, enterprises’ ability to innovate 
and adopt may be impaired. The decline in la -
bour force growth and the increase in life ex -
pectancy can also affect business dynamics 
and, via this channel, also impede aggregate 
TFP growth. An empirical analysis for the euro area suggests that demographic change has in -
deed dampened productivity growth.
The continued ageing of the euro area’s popu -
lation could continue to dampen productivity 
growth in the future. Moreover, the observed 
slowdown in the pace of reforms in the euro 
area suggests that economic policy will not 
provide any decisive stimulus for productivity 
growth. At present, it is difficult to assess what 
impact the coronavirus pandemic will have on 
developments in productivity. The macroeco -
nomic turmoil triggered by the pandemic is 
likely to weigh on future labour productivity 
growth. The extent to which this can be coun -
teracted by a wave of innovation in response to 
the exceptional challenges presented by the 
crisis remains to be seen.OutlookWithout extensive government assistance, 
many enterprises would probably have had 
to exit from the market owing to the mas-
sive slump in some sectors. Even the assis-
tance measures will probably not be able to 
entirely prevent this in the longer term. This, 
too, may infl  uence productivity growth. If 
mainly low- productivity enterprises or eco-
nomic sectors are affected by closures, this 
may have a positive impact on average 
productivity.5 However, if the freed- up pro-
duction factors are not, or only insuffi   -
ciently, absorbed, this will weigh on macro-
economic developments. Moreover, market 
concentration may increase, with poten-
tially adverse effects on competition and 
productivity gains.
To sum up, the pandemic may infl  uence 
future  productivity growth via multiple 
channels. Although the severe macroeco-
nomic disruptions are likely to weigh on productivity growth, the overall effect is dif-
fi  cult to gauge. Specifi  cally, it remains to be 
seen to what extent a crisis- induced boost 
to innovation –  in the form of increased 
digitalisation, for example – will impact on 
future productivity growth.

Methodology and analytical options for 
the expanded statistics on banking groups’ 
securities holdings
The statistics on holdings of securities by reporting banking groups were expanded in 2018. For 
the first time, they provide a granular insight into the risk structure of the securities held by 
significant  banking groups in their own portfolios. Thus, risk concentrations can be identified at 
an early stage. All 113 significant banking groups in the euro area directly supervised by the 
European  Central Bank (ECB) – 21 of which are domiciled in Germany – report their own holdings 
of securities held domestically and abroad as well as additional risk- related attributes.
Together, the 21 significant German banking groups hold securities (debt securities, equities, 
investment fund shares) with a market value of €610 billion in their own portfolios (as at Septem -
ber 2020). The majority of these are long- term debt securities (85%). A large portion of the total 
portfolio of securities (74%) is held by group entities domiciled in Germany.
The regional breakdown shows that the country risk of the securities held by significant German 
banking groups is broadly diversified across the issuers’ countries of domicile. Those issuers are 
roughly split into thirds between Germany (36%), other European Union (EU) countries (37%) and 
countries outside the EU (27%).
The 21 significant German banking groups predominantly hold unencumbered securities, which 
are securities that can be sold or used for other purposes, such as central bank refinancing, at 
any time without restrictions. The quality of the own holdings of securities, measured by the 
probability  of default of the issuer, is largely equivalent to investment grade.
During the COVID-  19 pandemic, the share of short- term debt securities and securities with a 
lower risk weight held by significant German banking groups has increased perceptibly.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The expanded statistics on holdings of secur -
ities by reporting banking groups (referred to as 
“banking group statistics” in the remainder of 
this article) for the first time capture the global 
own holdings of securities of significant bank -
ing groups as well as additional information on 
risk- related attributes of those holdings. This 
article begins by outlining the statistical meth -
odology for collecting the data. The results are 
then presented in three sections: an analysis of 
the global own holdings of securities of signifi -
cant German banking groups,1 an evaluation of 
the risk exposure of these holdings, and a de -
scription of how both aspects evolved as the 
COVID-  19 pandemic began.
Data collected and purpose 
of the expanded banking 
group statistics
The banking group statistics capture the global 
own holdings of securities of significant bank -
ing groups on a security- by- security basis. To 
this end, the respective head of the group 
reports  information on the securities held by 
group entities in their own portfolios (debt 
secur ities, equities and investment fund 
shares).2 Thus, the focus is on the banking 
group as a single unit comprising the head of 
the group as well as all of its domestic and for -
eign subsidiaries and branches. The Bundes -
bank collects information from all significant 
banking groups domiciled in Germany on a 
monthly basis. These data constitute Germa -
ny’s contribution to the ESCB’s Securities Hold -
ings Statistics Database (SHSDB) for the euro 
area.
The banking group statistics, introduced in 
Decem ber 2013, were expanded in September 
2018 in terms of both the number of reporting 
agents and the information to be reported.3 
Since September 2018, all banking groups dir -
ectly supervised by the ECB – currently 113 in 
the euro area (of which 21 are domiciled in Germany) – have been subject to reporting re -
quirements for the banking group statistics. 
The actual reporting population is reviewed an -
nually by the Governing Council of the ECB and 
adjusted if necessary.4 The relevant criteria for 
being assigned “significant” status include size, 
economic importance, level of cross- border 
activ ities, and whether direct financial support 
has been provided by the European Stability 
Mechanism (ESM) or the European Financial 
Stability Facility (EFSF).5
In addition, the statistics now also collect risk- 
related attributes so as to better capture the 
importance of banking groups and their stabil -
ity for the financial sector and the real econ -
omy. Another reason behind this is that the 
areas of financial stability, monetary policy, risk Risk- related 
information for 
each security is 
available in the

information  on 
securities – for 
an array of uses
1 In this article, the term “significant German banking 
groups” corresponds to the banking groups domiciled in 
Germany which have been classified as significant by the 
ECB and are therefore subject to its direct supervision.
2 A banking group within the meaning of these statistics 
comprises the head of the group, i.e. a credit institution or 
a financial holding company, as well as all associated finan -
cial subsidiaries and branches which do not constitute in -
surance corporations. The basis of consolidation was deter -
mined in line with prudential supervisory regulations (see 
Directive 2006/ 48/ EC). The reported data are broken down 
by the individual group members, with each legally inde -
pendent financial subsidiary presented individually with its 
country of domicile, and with legally dependent branches 
grouped by country of domicile.
3 The legal basis for the collection of banking group statis -
tics is Regulation (EU) 2016/ 1384 of the European Central 
Bank of 2 August 2016 amending Regulation (EU) No 1011/ 
2012 (ECB/ 2012/ 24) concerning statistics on holdings of 
secur ities (ECB/ 2016/ 22), published in the Official Journal 
of the European Union (OJ, L 222, p. 85) on 17 August 
2016.
4 The ECB provides the current list of significant euro 
area  banking groups on its website: https://www.
bankingsupervision.europa.eu/banking/list/who/html/
index.en.html
5 To qualify as significant, banks must fulfil at least one of 
these criteria:
 –the total value of its assets exceeds €30 billion;
 –economic importance for the specific country or the EU 
economy as a whole;
 –the total value of its assets exceeds €5 billion and the 
ratio of its cross- border assets/ liabilities in more than one 
other participating Member State to its total assets/  
liabilities  is above 20%;
 –it has requested or received funding from the European 
Stability Mechanism or the European Financial Stability 
Facility.
A supervised bank can also be considered significant if it is 
one of the three most significant banks established in a 
particular country.Deutsche Bundesbank

management and banking supervision needed 
more information for the following tasks:
– expansion/ enhancement of the pool of data 
for stress tests;
– early warning indicators;
– study of the transmission mechanism of 
monetary policy;
– portfolio analysis of securities holdings;
– identification of risks in the financial system 
and of significant cross- border risk concen -
trations;
– business model analysis.
These issues could not be fully covered by the 
attributes collected in the original banking 
group statistics, as only holding amounts were 
collected prior to the expansion.
Using the international securities identification 
number (ISIN), reference data on the individual 
securities are added from the Centralised Secur -
ities Database (CSDB)6 and do not have to be 
reported by the reporting agent.7
In line with the new user requirements, the 
attributes  shown in the adjacent overview, which 
focus on assessing the risk of the issuer or the 
security, were introduced as of September 
2018.8The original

statistics
The 21 significant banking groups domiciled in 
Germany which are required to report to the 
banking group statistics hold securities with a 
combined total market value9 of €610 billion in 
their global own portfolios.10 Of this amount, 
€450 billion (74% of the total volume) is held 
by group entities domiciled in Germany. This 
means that the share of securities held by sig -
nificant banking groups in Germany equates to roughly 34% of the own holdings of securities 
of all financial institutions domiciled in Ger -
many.11
Data from the banking group statistics can be 
used to analyse the own holdings of securities 
of significant German banking groups at a 
more granular level and to divide them into dif -
ferent categories. With the methodology used 
to collect data for the banking group statistics, 
it is possible to determine the countries in 
which significant banking groups hold individ -
ual securities. In total, the significant German 
banking groups hold securities worth €160 bil -
lion (26% of the total volume) in their group 
entities domiciled outside Germany. The largest 
shares are held in the United Kingdom, the 
United States, Luxembourg, Poland and Singa -
pore. The remaining own holdings of securities 
are spread across 31 other countries. By captur -
ing securities held abroad, the banking group 
statistics thus provide a global picture of the 
groups’ own holdings of securities.
The securities held in the group- wide own 
portfolio can also be broken down by instru -
ment class using the CSDB. Measured in terms 
of the total volume, significant German bank -
ing groups predominantly hold long- term debt 
securities (85%). By contrast, short- term debt 
securities (6%), equities (6%) and investment 
fund shares (3%) make up a comparatively 
small share.

this allows for a more up- to- date evaluation. The banking 
group statistics also provide information on the carrying 
amount and nominal value. Portfolios can be broken down 
into banking book and trading book holdings.
10 At the time this report went to press, quality- assured 
data from September 2020 were available, so this is chosen 
as the reference period below.
11 The volume of securities held in Germany in the own 
portfolios of all financial institutions domiciled in Germany 
comes to a market value of around €1,321 billion. This in -
formation can be obtained from the sectoral statistics of 
the Securities Holdings Statistics, for which all banks domi -
ciled in Germany report their own holdings of securities 
held in Germany to the Bundesbank. For an overview of 
the sectoral statistics of the Securities Holdings Statistics, 
see Deutsche Bundesbank (2015).Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

A breakdown of the own holdings of securities 
by issuer sector shows that 38% of the volume 
of securities held were issued by general gov -
ernment.12 The remaining 62% are spread 
across deposit- taking corporations (36%), finan -
cial corporations13 (excluding deposit- taking 
corporations) (20%), and non- financial corpor -
ations (5%).
When analysing the country risk of the own 
holdings of securities, one relevant factor is the 
regional distribution of the issuers’ countries of 
domicile. The group- wide own holdings of 
secur ities were split roughly into thirds be -
tween issuers domiciled in Germany (36%), in 
other EU countries14 (37%) and in countries 
outside the EU (27%) – see the chart on p. 50. 
Besides Germany itself, the issuers’ countries of 
domicile accounting for the largest shares are 
the United States (10%), France (6%), Luxem -
bourg (6%) and the United Kingdom (5%).
Microprudential and macroprudential risk an -
alysis raises the question of whether significant 
German banking groups hold different secur -
ities portfolios in Germany and in their group 
entities domiciled outside Germany. It is evi -
dent that there are, in particular, differences in 
the regional distribution of issuers of the secur -
ities held. For instance, significant German 
banking groups predominantly hold securities 
from issuers  domiciled in Germany (45%) or in 
the other EU countries (39%) in group entities 
domiciled in Germany. By contrast, group entities 
domiciled outside Germany mainly hold secur -
ities from issuers located in countries outside 
the EU (59%).
In each case, long- term debt securities make 
up the lion’s share of the securities held in the 
group entities domiciled both inside and out -
side Germany.
The significant banking groups domiciled in 
Germany predominantly hold long- term debt 
securities in their own portfolios and largely 
hold these securities in Germany. Using SHSDB 
data on all significant banking groups in the euro area (113 banking groups), it is possible to 
determine the volumes of German banking 
groups in proportion to significant banking 
groups in the rest of the euro area. Overall, all 
significant banking groups in the euro area 
have own holdings of securities with a total 
market value of €4,533 billion.15 The significant 
French banking groups account for the largest 
share, at 29%. The significant banking groups 
domiciled in Germany have the fourth largest Own holdings of

12 The 38% government share is divided into central gov -
ernment (25%), state government (11%), local government 
(1%) and social security funds (less than 1%). This subdiv -
ision corresponds to the general government sector (S.13) 
of ESA 2010.
13 The financial corporations sector (S.12) comprises cor -
porations and quasi- corporations principally engaged in 
financial  intermediation and/ or auxiliary financial activities.
14 This includes securities issued by EU Member States and 
enterprises based in the respective EU countries, as well as 
issuance by European institutions (e.g. the European Invest -
ment Bank and the European Commission).

share, at around 13%, after Spain (17%) and 
Italy (17%).
A comparison between significant German 
banking groups and all significant banking 
groups in the euro area reveals that, at 36%, 
German banking groups hold fewer securities 
from issuers located in their home country than 
the euro area average of all banking groups 
(48%). There is a clear difference between the 
four countries with the largest own holdings of 
securities (France, Italy, Spain and Germany) 
when it comes to whether there is a preference 
for securities issued in their home country. Sig -
nificant German banks hold a comparatively 
large share of securities not issued in their 
home country (64%). By contrast, in the case 
of significant banking groups in Spain and Italy, 
the share of own holdings of home- issued 
secur ities is higher – at 62% and 69% respect -
ively – than the euro area average of 48%. Fur -
thermore, as a proportion of their total own 
holdings, significant Italian banking groups hold a smaller share of securities from issuers 
outside their home country than the euro area 
overall, at 31% compared with 52%.
Selected risk attributes 
covered by the banking 
group statistics
As well as allowing for analysis of global own 
holdings, the expanded banking group statis -
tics –  augmented to incorporate risk- related 
attributes  in 2018 – permit an evaluation of the 
risk embedded in banking groups’ own port -
folios. This broad range of risk- related informa -
tion is reported monthly by the banking groups 
in addition to the holding amounts and is of 
relevance for microprudential and macropru -
dential issues. First, enhanced data on the is -
suer and instrument provide information about 
economic loss events (e.g. an instrument or is -
suer default). The same is true of the perform -
ing status of the instrument, which is used to 
identify distressed assets. Second, the new 
attributes  take into account hypothetical devel -
opments in the economic setting (e.g. the loss 
given default in normal economic times or in 
the event of a crisis), which can be used to 
conduct risk analyses. The risks emanating from 
the issuer of the securities play a crucial role 
here. Taken together, this allows for a compre -
hensive picture of the risk to the banking group 
stemming from its own holdings of securities. 
Wherever possible, the newly added attributes 
closely interlink the reporting requirements 
with the legal bases for banking supervision. A 
selection of the additional attributes are pre -
sented below by way of example.

16 For the purposes of the group statistics, the source of 
encumbrance is defined in line with Annexes XVI and XVII 
to Regulation (EU) No 680/ 2014 (Commission Implement -
ing Regulation (EU) No 680/ 2014 of 16 April 2014 laying 
down implementing technical standards with regard to

preventing it from being freely available at any 
time to the banking group. This is always the 
case if the asset (in the context of the banking 
group statistics, the security) is pledged or lent, 
or is being used to collateralise potential obli -
gations arising from derivatives transactions or 
for the purposes of credit enhancement in bal -
ance sheet or off- balance- sheet transactions. If 
the enterprise runs into crisis, constraints apply 
to the sale of any encumbered securities. By 
looking at the degree to which assets are 
encum bered, it is possible to derive an assess -
ment of the bank’s solvency in the event of 
asset default.
Looking at all own holdings of securities for 
which the source of encumbrance attribute 
was reported by the significant German bank -
ing groups, the majority of these holdings are 
unencumbered (74%).17 The encumbered por -
tion of securities is mainly utilised for central 
bank funding (14%), issuance of covered bonds 
(3%) or for repurchase transactions (2%).
Another important risk- related attribute in the 
banking group statistics is the risk weight.18 The 
size of the risk weight is based on the provi -
sions contained in the Capital Requirements 
Regulation (CRR).19 The risk weight plays a role 
in determining the applicable regulatory capital 
requirements under the CRR, that is to say the amount of own funds that banking groups 
must hold in reserve to back banking business 
subject to credit risk in the banking book. For 
example, in the case of debt securities, issuer 
insolvency gives rise to credit risk. There may be 
a relationship between the risk weight and the 
rating assigned to the issuer by rating agencies. 
There are two different approaches that may 
be applied to calculate the capital required to 
cover credit risk, namely the credit risk stand -
ardised approach (CRSA) and the internal 
ratings- based (IRB) approach.

17 The source of encumbrance attribute does not need to 
be reported when the issuer is part of the same reporting 
group as the holder (prudential consolidation group) or for 
“pure” short positions (i.e. items for which no positive 
amount is held and recorded on the assets side of the bal -
ance sheet). This means that no source of encumbrance 
was reported for €37 billion worth of securities (6% of the 
total volume). The percentages cited are based only on 
those securities for which a source of encumbrance has 
been reported.
18 Risk weight does not need to be reported when the 
issuer  is part of the same reporting group as the holder, nor 
is it required in the case of off- balance- sheet holdings, 
items deducted from capital and “pure” short positions (i.e. 
items for which no positive amount is held and recorded 
on the assets side of the balance sheet).

ment and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential

attached   to the own holdings of securities in 
the banking book of significant German bank -
ing groups.20 More than half of the total vol -
ume of securities held in the banking book 
(54%; €245 billion) have a risk weight of 0%. A 
further 21% have a risk weight of between 0% 
and 20%.
The volume- weighted average of the risk 
weight across all significant banking groups is 
25%. However, it differs widely from group to 
group. Accordingly, there is also variation be -
tween the banking groups in terms of the aver -
age regulatory capital required under the CRR 
for the securities portion of their assets. In sum -
mary, it can be said that, overall, significant 
banking groups domiciled in Germany mostly 
have own holdings of securities with a risk 
weight towards the lower end of the scale.
An additional indicator that may be used to 
analyse risk is the probability of default of the 
issuer.21 This refers to the risk of the issuer prov -
ing unable to meet a claim. In the case of 
secur ities, default risk stems most notably from 
an issuer’s inability to service its bonds, for ex -
ample as a result of liquidity difficulties or bank -
ruptcy.22 Here, the reported probability of 
default  means the forecast probability that the 
issuer of the security will default within a one- 
year horizon. Where the CRSA is used, the probability of default is calculated using exter -
nal ratings; under the IRB approach, the prob -
ability of default is estimated by the banks 
themselves.
For 88% of the own holdings of securities for 
which a probability of default has been re -
ported, the probability of default of the issuer 
is 0.4% or less (see the chart on p. 55). In credit 
assessment terms, this corresponds to an exter -
nal rating of at least BBB-, hence qualifying as 
investment grade.23 76% of the holdings for 
which a default probability has been reported 
have a probability of default of the issuer no 
higher than 0.1% (meaning that they have a 
rating of at least A- in credit assessment terms).

20 The significant German banking groups have €453 bil -

€104 billion in their trading book. For a volume of €53 bil -
lion, no information on the prudential portfolio is available 
as this attribute does not need to be reported for all secur -
ities.
21 The probability of default is estimated according to the 
procedures laid down in the CRR.
22 It is only mandatory to report the probability of default 
attribute if this is required in accordance with the capital 
calculation approach for prudential purposes. In addition, 
the attribute need not be reported when the issuer is part 
of the same reporting group as the holder or for off-  
balance- sheet holdings, items deducted from capital and 
“pure” short positions. Overall, no probability of default 
has been reported for holdings with a market value total -
ling €143 billion (23% of the total volume of own holdings 
of securities). The percentages cited are based only on 
those securities for which a probability of default has been 
reported.
23 When performing credit assessments, the Bundesbank 
identifies two credit quality bands on the basis of the Euro -
system credit assessment framework. The first covers any -
thing up to a forecast probability of default of 0.1%. The 
second band is for forecast probabilities of default be -
tween 0.1% and 0.4%. The first credit quality band encom -
passes credit quality steps 1 and 2 and is equivalent to a 
rating of at least “A-” from Fitch or Standard and Poor’s 
(S&P) or “A3” from Moody’s. The second band comprises 
credit quality step 3 and is equivalent to a rating of “BBB+ 
to BBB-” from Fitch or S&P or “Baa1 to Baa3” from 
Moody’s. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2019) and European 
Central Bank (2015).

teria as the prudential reporting in accordance with Regu -
lation (EU) No 575/ 2013.Deutsche Bundesbank

examining a banking group’s risk exposure.25 
The own holdings of securities held by the sig -
nificant banking groups domiciled in Germany 
were issued almost entirely by issuers who have 
not defaulted. The volume of securities re -
ported as being distressed stands at just €909 
million (0.1% of the total market value).
Information on intra- group issuance, where the 
issuer is part of the same reporting banking 
group as the holder, can be used to examine 
the financial links within the respective banking 
group. Around €80 billion worth (13%) of all 
own holdings of securities held by significant 
banking groups domiciled in Germany were 
issued  by entities in the same group as the 
holder (prudential scope). The majority were 
long- term debt securities (€57 billion) and equi -
ties (€22 billion). This equates to 11% and 64%, 
respectively, of the total volume of securities 
held in that instrument class. As a result, if 
secur ities issued intra- group are excluded when 
looking at the instrument classes held by the 
significant German banking groups, the pro -
portion of the total portfolio accounted for by 
equities shrinks from 6% to 2%, while the per -
centage accounted for by other instrument 
classes sees a slight increase.
Conclusion
The banking group statistics underwent signifi -
cant expansion in 2018. All 113 significant 
banking groups in the euro area directly super -
vised by the ECB – 21 of which are domiciled in 
Germany – report their own holdings of secur -ities held domestically and abroad as well as 
additional risk-  related attributes. This makes it 
possible to break down securities positions in a 
variety of ways – by instrument class, the 
 issuers’ countries of domicile, the group entity 
holding the position and a range of risk attrib -
utes, for instance. The statistics thus open up a 
broad array of new possibilities for granular 
analysis , for example with regard to the risk 
structure of the securities portfolios of signifi -
cant banking groups and the changes that they 
undergo (for example in response to the 
COVID-  19 pandemic).13% of the

25 Since reporting of these attributes is not mandatory for 
all securities, no default status of the issuer and of the in -
strument has been reported for just under 17% of the total 
volume in market value terms (€103 billion). This exemp -
tion from reporting applies where the issuer is part of the 
same reporting group as the holder as well as to off-  
balance- sheet items, “pure” short positions, financial assets 
held for trading, and equities and investment fund shares.Deutsche Bundesbank

Trends in group data in recent times of crisis
The COVID- 19 pandemic has been dominat-
ing social life and real economic activity 
across the globe since the beginning of 
2020. The dynamic evolution of the pan-
demic has led to high volatility in the fi  nan-
cial markets. For instance, up until March 
2020 the DAX stock price index, which 
comprises Germany’s 30 largest public 
limited enterprises, temporarily lost as much 
as 35% of its value compared to year- end 
2019. However, it subsequently rallied 
quickly to recoup large portions of its losses, 
which meant that, by the end of the second 
quarter, it had returned to around 90% of 
its 2019 year- end mark.
The statistics on banking groups can be 
used to take a detailed look at Germany’s 
signifi  cant banking groups.1 Upon the out-
break of the pandemic in early 2020, the market value of the total volume of own 
holdings of debt securities rose. The volume 
of short- term debt securities, in particular, 
more than doubled by July 2020 and even 
continued its rise thereafter. This also re-
fl  ects German banks facing an elevated 
need for liquidity upon the onset of the 
COVID- 19 pandemic.2 On the whole, up 
until September 2020 own holdings of 
short- term debt securities had increased by 
124%. The volume of long- term debt secur-
ities, on the other hand, went back down 
after April 2020.3
A countermovement of own holdings of 
equities and investment fund shares can be 
observed at the beginning of the pandemic. 
From end- 2019 until June 2020, they fell by 
33% and 19%, respectively, even though 
the DAX had recouped large portions of its 
losses in June 2020. In the third quarter of 
2020, too, the volume of equities remained 
at the lower level and, for investment fund 
shares, fell even further.
In respect of the quality, measured in terms 
of risk weights, of own holdings of secur-
ities, a strong increase in the volume of 
secur ities with a 0% risk weight can be 
detected  between end- 2019 and end- 
March 2020. By contrast, the volume of 
secur ities with a high risk weight fell over 
the same period.
1 In order to avoid changing the set of underlying 
data, the evaluations in this chapter refer to those 17 
signifi  cant German banking groups which were con-
tinuously subject to reporting requirements between 
December 2019 and September 2020.

3 Changes in the volume of securities can be caused 
by changes in holdings or prices. The developments 
cited here show the overall effect. Since the banking 
group statistics contain holdings based on individual 
securities, changes in holdings and prices can also be 
identifi  ed separately for each individual security.Own holdings of securities

European Central Bank (2010), The “Centralised Securities Database” in brief, February 2010.A detailed look at the banking group statis-
tics shows that, in March 2020, roughly 
two- thirds of the decline in the volume of 
own holdings of securities with a risk 
weight greater than 50% was caused by a 
fall in the volume of equities and invest-
ment fund shares of this risk weight cat-
egory. The overall result was that the aver-
age risk weight across the entire own hold-
ings of securities of signifi  cant German 
banking groups dropped from a one- time 
fi  gure of 31% to 25% in March 2020 and 
also remained at that new level until Sep-
tember 2020.4
In summary, the composition of the own 
holdings of securities of the signifi  cant 
German  banking groups has changed since 
the outbreak of the COVID- 19 pandemic. In 
autumn 2020, the signifi  cant German bank-
ing groups had, in particular, more short- term 
debt securities in their own holdings and a portfolio with an, on average, lower risk 
weight than as recently as the end of 2019.

The two- tier system for reserve 
remuneration  and its impact on banks 
and financial markets
When operating in a negative interest rate environment, central banks have introduced tiering 
systems for the remuneration of excess liquidity holdings as a monetary policy measure. These 
tiering systems enable central banks to exempt a certain part of commercial banks’ excess liquid -
ity holdings from negative remuneration or to set a slightly more attractive rate of interest on this 
part. By contrast, the non- exempt tier of excess liquidity holdings continues to be remunerated at 
the regular, negative rate. This cuts banks’ interest expenditure on excess liquidity held when the 
tiering system is introduced. In September 2019, the Governing Council of the European Central 
Bank (ECB Governing Council) decided that the euro area, too, should have a tiering system and 
introduced a two- tier system for excess reserve remuneration on 30 October 2019.
The aim of this measure was to support the bank- based transmission of monetary policy. At the 
same time, the ECB Governing Council sought to preserve the positive contribution of negative 
interest rates to the accommodative stance of monetary policy and thus to the continued sus -
tained convergence of inflation to the ECB’s aim. The two- tier system is designed in such a way 
that euro short- term money market rates are not unduly influenced.
The system prompted some banks to increase their central bank balances in order to take full 
advantage of their own exemption allowances. The resulting redistribution of liquidity between 
banks began as soon as the two- tier system was introduced and, to start with, this largely took 
place via the money market. Redistribution could be observed both domestically and within bank -
ing groups as well as across national borders, and it enabled almost all euro area banks to make 
full use of their allowances. Despite significant liquidity redistribution, short- term money market 
rates rose only temporarily and to a very small extent, which was also due to a large volume of 
excess liquidity holdings, which continued to expand over time, still being subject to negative 
remuneration.
In December 2020, euro area excess liquidity holdings stood at €3,352 billion. Between the intro -
duction of the two- tier system in October 2019 and December 2020, euro area banks’ interest 
expenditure on excess liquidity holdings amounted to €8.9 billion, and was thus €4.7 billion 
lower than would have been the case without a tiering system but under otherwise identical con -
ditions. At the same time, the lion’s share of excess liquidity holdings (€2,498 billion at last report) 
continued to be subject to negative remuneration.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
At its monetary policy meeting on 12 Septem -
ber 2019, the ECB Governing Council decided, 
in addition to other monetary policy measures, 
to introduce the two- tier system for reserve 
remu neration (hereinafter referred to as the 
“two- tier system”). Since 30  October 2019, 
banks have no longer been required to pay the 
Eurosystem negative interest on part of their 
excess reserve holdings.1 Thus, for the first 
time, the Eurosystem has set two different 
interest rates for holding excess reserves.
The two- tier system reduces a portion of com -
mercial banks’ interest expenditure on holding 
excess reserves, which had risen as a result of 
the interest rate on the deposit facility being 
lowered by 10 basis points on 18 September 
2019. By introducing the two- tier system, the 
ECB Governing Council sought to support the 
bank- based transmission of monetary policy. 
Literature on this topic suggests that an ex -
ceedingly long- lasting environment of low 
interest rates could, under certain conditions, 
hurt lending by banks,2 meaning that they 
would no longer adequately fulfil their role in 
monetary policy transmission. This would im -
pede the ECB Governing Council’s intended 
objective of monetary policy easing.
The ECB Governing Council took care to design 
the two-  tier system in such a way that euro 
short- term money market rates are not unduly 
influenced. Tiering systems provide incentives 
for the redistribution of liquidity between 
banks: institutions that do not make full use of 
their exemption allowances under a tiering sys -
tem can generate additional interest income by 
borrowing funds at negative interest rates and 
depositing them in their central bank account 
at the zero interest rate. Thus, in principle, the 
additional demand for liquidity from some 
banks that is triggered by a tiering system could 
raise short- term money market rates, which 
may run counter to the central bank’s intended 
monetary policy stance.Around one year after the launch of the two-  
tier system, this article examines whether and 
how this measure has achieved the effect in -
tended by the ECB Governing Council without 
producing undesirable side effects in the money 
market. To this end, the article begins by dis -
cussing the background and motivation behind 
introducing the two- tier system, before exam -
ining the impact that the two- tier system has 
on interest expenditure on excess liquidity hold -
ings3 in the banking sector. It concludes with 
an analysis of the resulting redistribution of 
central bank liquidity via money and other 
finan cial markets.
The two- tier system in a 
monetary policy context
Since the global financial and the European 
debt crises, the Eurosystem has been providing 
banks with significantly more central bank 
liquid ity through non- standard monetary policy 
measures than they need overall.4 This excess 
liquidity is held on banks’ accounts with the 
Euro system. In June 2014, the ECB Governing 
Council lowered the interest rate on the de -
posit facility from 0.0% to -0.1%. Thus, for the 
first time, the Eurosystem charged banks a 
negative rate of interest on excess liquidity 
holdings. Since then, the ECB Governing Coun -
cil has adopted additional non- standard 
liquidity- providing monetary policy measures. 
These non- standard measures have gradually 
raised excess liquidity holdings even more (see 
the chart on p. 61). Together with further inter -
est rate cuts, this has led to an increase in Two- tier system

holdings with the central bank in order to meet their min -
imum reserve requirements. Banks’ reserve holdings are 
subject to fluctuations because current payments and the 
issuance and acceptance of cash by the central bank are 
ultim ately also settled using central bank liquidity.Deutsche Bundesbank

banks’ interest expenditure on excess liquidity 
holdings. The banking system as a whole is 
scarcely able to lower excess liquidity and 
therefore cannot reduce interest expenditure 
stemming from negative remuneration on its 
excess liquid ity holdings in central bank ac -
counts. Transactions between banks only result 
in excess liquidity being redistributed within the 
banking system.5
In pursuit of its price stability objective, the ECB 
Governing Council decided in September 2019 
to adopt an additional, comprehensive pack -
age of measures, lowering the interest rate on 
the deposit facility by 10 basis points to -0.5% 
and also making the interest rate on targeted 
longer- term refinancing operations (TLTRO- III) 
more attractive.6 In addition, the ECB Govern -
ing Council resumed net purchases under the 
asset purchase programme (APP) at a monthly 
pace of €20 billion starting in November 2019. 
The interest rate cut and the further rise in ex -
cess liquidity resulting from this package of 
measures pushed up banks’ interest expend -
iture even further. To address this, the ECB Gov -
erning Council also introduced its two- tier sys -
tem for excess reserve remuneration as a new 
item in its monetary policy toolkit. In an envir -
onment of expanding excess liquidity, the two- 
tier system exempts part of credit institutions’ 
excess liquidity holdings from negative remu -neration at the rate applicable on the deposit 
facility, thereby reducing their interest expend -
iture. Prior to this, other central banks had al -
ready made similar arrangements for the remu -
neration of banks’ excess central bank balances 
in connection with negative policy rates (see 
the box on pp. 64 ff.).
Design of the two- tier system
The tiering system established in the euro area 
on 30 October 2019 introduced two tiers for 
the remuneration of excess reserve holdings. A 
certain amount of excess reserve holdings is 
exempt  from remuneration at the applicable 
deposit  rate, i.e. it is remunerated at 0% in -
stead. This exemption allowance is calculated 
as a multiple of an individual bank’s minimum Two- tier system

reserve requirements.7 The multiplier is the 
same for all institutions. The ECB Governing 
Council stated that it would set the multiplier 
at a level which ensures that euro short- term 
money market rates are not unduly influenced. 
The Eurosystem determines the remuneration 
rate on and the size of the exempt tier on aver -
age over a reserve maintenance period.8 The 
ECB Governing Council set the multiplier at six.
Expectations, impact and role 
in monetary policy
In the euro area, banks play a key role in trans -
mitting monetary policy impulses. They pass on 
changes in the policy rates to the real economy 
by adjusting lending conditions. As a rule, pol -
icy rate cuts should encourage banks to ease 
lending conditions for their customers. In turn, 
this should raise the demand for and granting 
of credit, thereby increasing investment, private 
consumption and, ultimately, the price level. 
With its two- tier system, the ECB Governing 
Council aims to support the bank- based trans -
mission of its monetary policy. In particular, it is 
designed to prevent the costs of borrowing for 
new loans from rising. In a prolonged period of 
low or negative interest rates, non- standard 
monetary policy measures, which generate these high levels of excess liquidity, can have 
such undesirable side effects.
So far, banks have largely refrained from pass -
ing on negative interest rates to their deposit -
ors – households’ deposits, in particular, are 
still largely unaffected.9 As low interest rates 
are becoming increasingly entrenched, banks 
that rely heavily on deposits as a source of 
funding are seeing their interest margins shrink. 
While the average lending rate continues to 
fall, banks are reluctant to lower their interest 
rate on deposits below zero. Interest income 
from lending therefore reacts more elastically 
to changes in interest rates than interest ex - Two- tier system

7 Minimum reserves are compulsory deposits that commer -
cial banks are required to hold with their respective euro 
area central bank and are calculated using the reserve 
base. The reserve base comprises deposits from non- banks 
or banks that are not subject to minimum reserve require -
ments as well as debt securities that have an agreed matur -
ity or notice period of no more than two years. The Euro -
system applies a positive minimum reserve ratio of 1% at 
present to the components included in the reserve base. 
Minimum reserves are remunerated at the weighted aver -
age marginal allotment rate on main refinancing oper -
ations in the corresponding reserve maintenance period.
8 A reserve maintenance period lasts six or seven weeks, 
each starting shortly after the monetary policy meetings of 
the ECB Governing Council. For more information and the

penditure on households’ deposits.10 Viewed in 
isolation, this could worsen banks’ profitability. 
If this decreased profitability has an impact on 
banks’ capital, they could reduce their credit 
supply or charge higher lending rates.11
The exemption allowance is calculated as a 
multiple of the relevant institution’s minimum 
reserve requirements. Minimum reserves cur -
rently comprise 1% of enterprises’ and house -
holds’ deposits subject to reserve requirements. 
They are largely determined by the amount of 
deposits held by households, which is roughly 
three times the amount of deposits held by en -
terprises. It is precisely those banks with pre -
dominantly deposit- based funding that are the 
main lenders to enterprises and households in 
the euro area. This is why banks that are in -
volved in lending to enterprises and house -
holds tend to be the main beneficiaries of the 
two- tier system. If the two- tier system helps 
banks to uphold their credit supply even in the 
low interest rate environment, it fulfils the ECB 
Governing Council’s objective of supporting 
the bank- based transmission of monetary pol -
icy.
So far, there have been no signs either in the 
euro area or Germany of banks restricting their 
credit supply because of the negative remuner -
ation on their excess liquidity holdings. Expan -
sionary monetary policy is supporting eco -
nomic activity and is aimed at meeting the 
price stability objective in the medium term. 
The favourable economic situation prior to the 
coronavirus crisis enabled European banks to 
compensate for narrower interest margins in 
the low interest rate environment, allowed 
them to reduce their loan loss provisions and 
ensured robust credit demand. Consequently, 
banks were able to keep their profitability 
largely stable. Until the onset of the corona -
virus crisis, there were no signs of banks being 
less willing to lend.12 Bundesbank and ECB ana -
lyses confirm that monetary policy continued 
to have a stimulating effect in this environ -
ment.13The interest expenditure that banks have to pay 
for excess liquidity holdings is relatively low 
compared with their other interest-  dependent 
business. From the beginning of the negative 
interest rate policy period to the end of 2019, 
declining interest margins cost banks in Ger -
many around four times as much as interest ex -
penditure on excess liquidity holdings.14 This 
interest expenditure is a side effect of the nega -
tive interest rate policy in combination with 
high levels of excess liquidity holdings resulting 
from other monetary policy measures. Taken in 
isolation, it is a profit- reducing factor that is 
affected  directly by monetary policy. To avoid 
monetary policy potentially having unwanted 
side effects in this area, the two- tier system 
therefore exempts part of banks’ excess liquid -
ity holdings from negative remuneration.
In setting the multiplier, the ECB Governing 
Council calculated the exemption allowances 
such that the short-  term money market rates 
would not be unduly influenced.15 The two- tier 
system encouraged banks to make use of their 
allowances and thus the more favourable level 
of remuneration. In this way, the Eurosystem 
set interest rate incentives for bank transactions 
that result  in a more even distribution of excess 
liquidity in the system. Money markets had a 
key role to play, as this is where banks typically 
trade liquidity. Given that levels of negatively 
remunerated excess liquidity holdings remained 
high, there was indeed no sustained rise in the 
relevant benchmark interest rates for the 
money market.16… no negative

excess liquidity held with the Eurosystem stood at around 
€1,000 billion, and it has risen since then.Deutsche Bundesbank

Tiering systems in other currency areas
Other central banks besides the Eurosystem 
have also cut policy rates, pushing their de-
posit rates into negative territory: these are 
the Bank of Japan (BoJ), Danmarks National-
bank, Sveriges Riksbank and the Swiss 
National  Bank (SNB). Each of these central 
banks has introduced a tiering system in 
one form or another. The ways in which 
these tiering systems differ go beyond re-
muneration and the size and calculation of 
exemption allowances. For example, Sver-
iges Riksbank absorbs a certain amount of excess liquidity, which is otherwise nega-
tively remunerated, by issuing deposit cer-
tifi  cates on a weekly basis. This arrange-
ment is therefore not a tiering system in the 
narrower sense, but it is similar in its effect. 
The systems adopted by the SNB and the 
BoJ, which are outlined below, illustrate 
how differently tiering systems in the nar-
rower sense, too, can be structured and 
calibrated.
The SNB’s tiering system is similar in design 
to that of the Eurosystem. In January 2015, 
the SNB had lowered the interest rate on 
banks’ sight deposits held with the SNB 
from 0% to -0.75% in order to ensure that 
the appreciation of the Swiss franc follow-
ing the discontinuation of the minimum 
EUR/ CHF exchange rate did not lead to an 
inappropriate tightening of monetary con-
ditions.1 When it introduced its negative de-
posit rate, it exempted around two- thirds of 
domestic banks’ deposits from this negative 
interest. The aim of this was to limit the 
negative interest rate burden on banks to 
the minimum deemed necessary by the SNB 
for the implementation of monetary policy 
while still keeping secured short- term 
money market rates close to the policy 
rate.2 The exemption allowance for domes-
tic banks subject to minimum reserve require-
ments was initially equal to 20 times their 
minimum reserve requirements (“multi-
plier”). The SNB deducted the cash holdings 
reported in the last reserve maintenance

period from this.3 In response to the signifi  -
cant increase in total sight deposits, in 
Novem ber 2019 the SNB raised its exemp-
tion allowance to 25 times banks’ minimum 
reserve requirements, before raising it fur-
ther to 30 times the requirements in April 
2020 in response to the coronavirus crisis.4 
In terms of volume, the exemption allow-
ances granted to domestic banks subject to 
minimum reserve requirements comprised 
around four- fi  fths of these banks’ sight de-
posits in November 2020, making the aver-
age interest rate on the banks’ sight de-
posits held with the SNB likely to have been 
just under -0.2% per annum.
Trading in the Swiss franc money market in-
creased signifi  cantly following the introduc-
tion of the tiering system and the subse-
quent increases in the multiplier. The se-
cured short- term money market rate (Swiss 
Average Rate Overnight – SARON) rose and 
temporarily drifted away from the SNB’s 
deposit  rate. This was not desirable from a monetary policy perspective. Since Novem-
ber 2019, the SNB has conducted a number 
of liquidity- providing operations, bringing 
SARON back into line with the SNB policy 
rate.5
3 Since November 2019, there have been two methods 
for calculating the exemption allowance, also referred 
to as the exemption threshold: (i) For domestic banks 
subject to minimum reserve requirements, the moving 
average of their minimum reserve requirements over 
the preceding three years is multiplied by the threshold 
factor and updated on a monthly basis. Previously, the 
calculation of individual banks’ minimum reserve re-
quirements was static. The cash holdings reported in 
the last reserve maintenance period are deducted from 
this. (ii) The SNB sets a fi  xed threshold for all other 
sight deposit account holders. The exemption allow-
ance amounts to at least CHF 10 million for all sight 
deposit account holders. See also Swiss National Bank 
(2019).
4 The SNB took this action to help banks play their key 
role in economic developments. See Swiss National 
Bank (2020).
5 From November 2019 to July 2020 via fi  ne- tuning 
operations in the overnight segment of the repo mar-
ket, and since July 2020 by auctioning one- month 
funds on the repo platform. See Maechler and Moser

In January 2016, the BoJ introduced a tier-
ing system at the same time as it imple-
mented a negative interest rate policy. The 
BoJ’s intention was to prevent an excessive 
decrease in Japanese banks’ earnings stem-
ming from the implementation of negative 
interest rates that could weaken their func-
tion as fi  nancial intermediaries.6 The Japan-
ese tiering system has three tiers. In the fi  rst 
component of the tiering system, the basic 
balance, a portion of the deposits held by 
banks in BoJ accounts is still remunerated at 
a positive rate of 0.1% per annum. The 
amount of this positive interest- bearing 
component for each fi  nancial institution 
corresponds to that institution’s average 
outstanding current account balance at the 
BoJ in 2015. The minimum reserve require-
ment is deducted from this. The fi  rst com-
ponent is therefore fi  xed and amounted to 
just under half of total deposits in Novem-
ber 2020. In the second component of the 
tiering system, the macro add-on balance,7 
a zero interest rate is applied to other de-
posits (also slightly less than half of total 
deposits  in November 2020). The third com-
ponent, the policy-rate balance, only comes 
into play if a fi  nancial institution’s outstand-
ing balance is in excess of the fi  rst two tiers: 
these excess reserves are subject to nega-
tive remuneration at -0.1% per annum. The 
BoJ adjusts the level of the macro add-on 
balance each month in both directions to 
ensure that this negative interest- bearing 
policy- rate balance accounts for a very low 
share of total deposits: in November 2020, 
it only comprised around 7% of deposits. At 
the end of the period under review, the 
combination of the three tiering system 
components produced slightly positive aver-
age remuneration overall for deposits held 
with the BoJ. In Japan, too, the tiering sys-
tem has led to liquidity being redistributed 
via the money market.In November 2020, the BoJ added a further 
component to its tiering system. As a three- 
year measure, it set up a special deposit 
facility  with interest rates specifi  cally for re-
gional banks that meet certain require-
ments, namely an additional 0.1 percentage 
point on each of the three tiering system 
components. The BoJ hopes that this will 
strengthen regional economies and ensure 
fi  nancial system stability.8 For example, the 
specifi  c eligibility conditions for the more 
attractive rate of remuneration promote 
consolidation in the regional banking sec-
tor.
The tiering systems of other central banks 
show how they can differ in terms of struc-
ture and specifi  c objectives. All central 
banks that have introduced negative policy 
rates in recent years have also adopted a 
tiering system in one form or another to re-
duce the potential side effects of the nega-
tive interest rate environment. The Japanese 
tiering system is much more complex and 
appears, more recently, to have been sup-
porting structural policy in addition to pro-

ence confi  rms that a large exempt tier of 
excess liquidity holdings and signifi  cantly 
negative interest rates can temporarily raise 
money market rates.

serve holdings plus the basic balance multiplied by a 
benchmark ratio (expressed as a percentage). It also 
contains other components, such as the amount out-
standing of the BoJ’s provision of credit through the 
loan support programme and its funds- supplying oper-
ation to support fi  nancial institutions in disaster areas. 
In the past, the macro add-on balance used to be 
adjusted  quarterly, but since May 2020 it has been 
adjusted  on a monthly basis via the benchmark ratio. 
The macro add-on balance has risen almost continu-
ously since its introduction in 2016.

Impact on interest expend -
iture in the banking system
When the interest rate on the deposit facility 
was first lowered into negative territory in 
2014, banks in the euro area had to pay just 
under €0.2 billion per year in interest for hold -
ing excess liquidity. In the years that followed, 
rising excess liquidity holdings led to a continu -
ous increase in the interest paid by banks to the 
Eurosystem. In September 2019, their annual -
ised interest expenditure on excess liquidity 
holdings came to €6.8 billion.17 When the ECB 
Governing Council lowered the interest rate on 
the deposit facility by 10 basis points to -0.5% 
in the same month, this expenditure rose to an 
annualised figure of €8.6 billion (see the chart 
above).Introduction of the two- tier 
system
The introduction of the two- tier system at the 
end of October 2019 reduced the absolute an -
nualised interest expenditure on excess liquidity 
holdings of euro area banks to €5.1 billion.18 
This means that the two- tier system reduced 
banks’ annualised interest expenditure by just 
under €3.5 billion and thus lowered their total 
annual burden by €1.7 billion net after adjust -
ment for the interest rate cut implemented 
around the same time. Initially, it thus more 
than offset the impact of the last cut to the de -
posit facility rate (see the chart on p. 68). Adding

tier system to December 2020, the interest 
banks paid on their excess liquidity holdings in 
this period was, in fact, €4.7 billion lower in 
total than it would have been without the two- 
tier system. Around one- quarter of this reduc -
tion was accounted for by banks in Germany.
The most recent figures show an increase in 
the annualised interest expenditure on excess 
liquidity holdings to around €12.5 billion, which 
is due to the significant rise in excess liquidity 
holdings.
Use of the exemption 
allowances 
The impact of the two- tier system is maximised 
when all banks make full use of their individual 
exemption allowances. If the distribution of ex -
cess liquidity holdings had been the same as it 
was before the two-  tier system was intro -
duced, banks would have been able to use only 72% of the available allowances. Excess liquid -
ity holdings are distributed heterogeneously 
both across euro area countries and among 
banks in individual countries.19 For example, 
before the introduction of the two- tier system, 
the German banking system was holding €571 
billion in excess liquidity (around 33% of total 
excess liquidity holdings in the euro area). 
However, given the set multiplier of six, only 
69% of the €221 billion in available allowances 
would have been used in the reserve  mainten -
ance period before the two-tier system was 
launched.
Banks were already using the bulk of their 
allow ances during the introductory phase of 
the two-  tier system in the seventh reserve 
maintenance period of 2019, both in the euro 
area as a whole and in Germany. The banking 
sectors of some euro area countries recorded 
net inflows of liquidity in connection with al -
lowances being used up. On aggregate, the ex -
cess liquidity held by the banking sectors in 
Italy, Greece, Portugal and Slovakia was initially 
lower than the allowances granted. In the first 
reserve maintenance period after the two-  tier 
system was introduced (from 30 October 2019 
to 17 December 2019), banks in the euro area 
were able to use 95% of their allowances as a 
result of liquidity redistribution. One year later, 
in December 2020, this figure had risen to 99% 
(see the chart on p. 69).
Before the introduction of the two- tier system, 
the volume of excess liquidity held in the Ger -
man banking system, particularly by some sav -
ings banks, credit cooperatives and branches of 
foreign banks, was in some cases significantly 
smaller than the allowances granted by the ECB 
Governing Council. These institutions often 
hold liquidity indirectly via their central and par -
ent institutions. In the first reserve maintenance 
period after the two- tier system was launched, 
some savings banks immediately received in -
flows of liquidity, above all from Landesbanken,

The two-tier system and liquidity holding in fi  nance 
associations 
German fi  nance associations in the co-
operative and savings bank sectors are char-
acterised by special liquidity management 
and therefore also by special liquidity move-
ments in the two-tier system. In particular, 
central institutions often assume a liquidity 
distribution function within the fi  nancial 
group and offer central services, such as in-
direct holding of minimum reserves. Exemp-
tions specifi  c to fi  nance associations in the 
supervisory capital and liquidity require-
ments may apply to these arrangements. In 
this context, the introduction of the two-tier 
system triggered special liquidity move-
ments.
Liquidity pooling in accounts with the 
central bank
Prior to the introduction of the two-tier sys-
tem, some cooperatives and savings banks 
did not have large enough balances on 
their accounts with the Bundesbank for 
them to make full use of their exemption 
allow ances. By contrast, their central insti-
tutions did hold suffi   cient excess liquidity 
on their Bundesbank accounts. As an alter-
native to their accounts with the Bundes-
bank, savings banks and cooperative banks 
also hold liquid funds in the form of de-
posits with the central institution of their 
association as part of their intra- group 
liquid ity management – e.g. for settling 
payments. They can transfer balances be-
tween these accounts in order to make best 
use of their allowances in the two- tier sys-
tem. However, they may also generate add-
itional deposits from other sources (e.g. 
borrowing on the money market or liquid-
ating securities).
The central institutions themselves are not 
necessarily dependent on their affi   liated in-stitutions’ deposits to be able to make use 
of exemption allowances. They have suffi   -
cient liquidity from other sources. Neverthe-
less, it is in their interest for their affi   liated 
institutions to hold liquidity with them on 
their current accounts, as intra- group de-
posits with the central institution are given 
preferential treatment in the liquidity cover-
age ratio (LCR) and can therefore improve 
this ratio.1
In some cases, central institutions improved 
the conditions for their affi   liated institutions 
in order to retain these deposits after the 
introduction of the two-tier system. This 
affected  both the conditions for deposits 
held with the central institutions and the 
interest rates for interbank lending.
Under the two-tier system, affi   liated institu-
tions have shifted deposits from their cen-
tral institution accounts to the Bundesbank 
and have also procured additional liquidity 
to make use of their exemption allowances. 
Around three- quarters of the increase in 
central bank balances observed in the fi  rst 
reserve maintenance period following the 
introduction of the two-tier system (30 Octo-
ber 2019 to 17 December 2019) came from 
shifts and around one- quarter from add-
itional borrowing. This additional liquidity is 
1 The LCR defi  nes the minimum stock of high- quality 
liquid assets credit institutions must hold as liquidity 
reserves  in order to cover their net cash outfl  ows 
under a severe 30- day stress scenario. Affi   liated institu-
tions’ deposits are particularly attractive for the central 
institutions of fi  nance associations with regard to the 
LCR if these deposits are treated as operational de-
posits pursuant to Article 27(1) of Commission Dele-
gated Regulation (EU) 2015/ 61 of 10  October 2014 
and are given a reduced outfl  ow factor of 25% (com-
pared with a 100% outfl  ow rate for non- operative 
interbank deposits). However, this is accompanied by 
an equally reduced  infl  ow rate (25% instead of 100%) 
for the associ ation member which provides the de-
posit.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

also largely provided by central institutions 
as the affi   liated institutions are not usually 
active in the money market themselves.
Indirect holding of reserves
Exemption allowances in the two-tier sys-
tem can also be used more effi   ciently within 
fi  nance associations when the affi   liated in-
stitutions use indirect holding of minimum 
reserves2 to pool their allowances at the 
central institution. With indirect holding of 
reserves, the affi   liated institution transfers 
the responsibility for fulfi  lling the minimum 
reserve requirement to the central institu-
tion and thus also its exemption allow ance. 
By combining the management of min-
imum reserves in this way, the association is 
able to use its aggregate exemption allow-
ances without having to shift any liquid ity. 
The central institution can pass on the re-
sulting interest rate advantage to the affi   li-
ated institutions.
The advantages of this procedure for mem-
ber institutions with indirect reserve hold-
ings are that they do not necessarily need 
to have a Bundesbank account, their min-
imum reserve requirements are met by the 
central institution and, in some cases, their 
deposits with the central institution are 
remun erated more attractively. The disad-
vantage is that the institutions may only be 
able to count excess reserves on their cur-
rent accounts with the central institution as 
a 25% weighted infl  ow in their LCR.3 By 
contrast, their balances with the Bundes-
bank in excess of the minimum reserve 
require ment could always be included at a 
rate of 100% as high- quality liquid assets in 
the LCR.
Following the introduction of the two-tier 
system, more individual institutions 
switched from holding minimum reserves 
directly to indirectly than vice versa. It appears  that the benefi  ts of indirect holding 
of minimum reserves outweighed the dis-
advantages it poses for fulfi  lling regulatory 
ratios.
2 However, indirect holding of minimum reserves is 
only possible in the cooperative sector. Landesbanken 
do not perform this intermediary function for savings 
banks.

allowances on average. Credit cooperatives and 
branches of foreign banks tended to be slower 
to increase their liquidity and initially used only 
78% and 80% of their allowances, respectively. 
In the months that followed, the institutions in 
both of these categories used an ever greater 
proportion of their allowances, with utilisation 
of these allowances reaching over 90% one 
year after the launch of the two- tier system (see 
the chart above). Redistribution in the savings 
bank and credit cooperative sectors was strongly 
influenced by liquidity management features 
specific to these sectors, and by regulatory re -
quirements (see the box on pp. 70 f.). Both fac -
tors prevented some of these institutions from 
using up their allowances more quickly.
On the whole, big banks, promotional banks 
and Landesbanken did not need any additional 
liquidity inflows. When the two- tier system was 
introduced, they already had sufficient excess 
liquidity holdings to use more than 99% of 
their allowances.
Aggregated across all institutions domiciled in 
Germany, the unused allowances in the first 
reserve   maintenance period after the two-  tier 
system was introduced came to €14.3 billion, 
which corresponds to 94% utilisation. One year 
later, the respective figures were €2.9 billion 
and 99%.Average remuneration on 
excess  liquidity holdings
By changing the level of remuneration on ex -
cess liquidity holdings, the ECB Governing 
Council is able to directly influence the interest 
expenditure – and thus also the interest mar -
gin – of banks in the euro area. Until the two- 
tier system was introduced, the rate of remu -
neration on excess liquidity holdings was the 
same as the Eurosystem’s interest rate on the 
deposit facility. Prior to the launch of the two- 
tier system, average remuneration stood at 
-0.5% beginning in September 2019, whereas 
once the two- tier system was introduced on 
30 October 2019, average remuneration rose 
from -0.5% to -0.29%. The average interest 
rate was thus higher than before the interest 
rate cut in September 2019, when it stood at 
-0.4% per year. Although the average remuner -
ation on excess liquidity holdings had fallen 
back to -0.37% per year by December 2020 
due to non- standard monetary policy measures 
increasing excess liquidity holdings to over €3 
trillion,20 it remained higher than before the 
interest rate cut.Two- tier system

In the two- tier system, the average remuner -
ation on the excess liquidity holdings of individ -
ual banks varies considerably. For most institu -
tions, average remuneration is either 0% or 
-0.5% (see the chart on p. 72). This is because 
smaller institutions, in particular, remain within 
the scope of their exemption allowance and 
thus do not hold any excess liquidity subject to 
negative remuneration. Other institutions do 
not have an allowance because, for example, 
they do not hold any liabilities subject to min -
imum reserve requirements and therefore do 
not have a minimum reserve requirement from 
which the allowance would be calculated. 
These institutions have to pay negative interest 
from the very first euro of excess liquidity they 
hold.
After most banks had made full use of their al -
lowances, in December 2020 the cut- off inter -
est rate, i.e. the opportunity cost of holding an 
additional euro of excess liquidity, stood at 
-0.5% for just under 70% of banks in the euro 
area.21 In view of this cut- off interest rate, 
undue influence on money market rates is un -
likely. Consequently, the ECB Governing Coun -
cil’s interest rate policy is likely to continue to 
deliver an expansionary stimulus.
Money market rates and 
liquidity  channels
It was intended that the introduction of the 
two- tier system and the liquidity redistribution 
it triggered should not unduly influence short- 
term money market rates, which would there -
fore remain close to the interest rate on the de -
posit facility. For this purpose, it was envisaged 
that a sufficiently large volume of excess liquid -
ity would continue to be remunerated at the 
negative interest rate on the deposit facility. 
The liquidity supply of those banks that made 
full use of their exemption allowances would 
thus sufficiently exceed the liquidity demand of 
banks with unused allowances.When the two- tier system was introduced, 
banks which would already have been able to 
make full use of their allowances at that point 
in time held an additional €1,140 billion in ex -
cess liquidity on top of these allowances. By 
contrast, the hypothetical liquidity demand of 
banks with unused allowances came to €227 
billion in total.22 Consequently, aggregate po -
tential liquidity demand met with such a large 
liquidity supply that, given functioning markets, 
money market rates could be expected to re -
spond only weakly, if at all.… with vari -

Development of short- term 
money market rates
In practice, the two- tier system did indeed have 
barely any impact on money market rates, just 
as the ECB Governing Council had intended. 
This was reflected by the euro short-  term rate 
(€STR),23 which rose only slightly – by around 1 
basis point – up to the end of 2019. Secured 
interest rates such as the STOXX GC Pooling In -
dices and the RepoFunds Rates24 likewise saw 
only minor increases.
Distinguishing between banks with and with -
out unused exemption allowances results in 
slightly higher interest rates on the borrowing 
of banks with unused allowances than on the 
borrowing of banks that would have already 
made full use of their allowances before the 
two- tier system was introduced. Banks with 
unused allowances had a greater interest in ob -
taining liquidity. The higher interest rates in -
curred by these banks in the unsecured money 
market had almost completely receded again 
within a few days.
They remained elevated for somewhat longer 
in the secured money market. This is explained 
by the fact that banks with unused allowances 
made increasing use of securities, which – all other business conditions being equal – lead to 
somewhat higher interest rates than, say, Ger -
man Federal bonds (Bunds) (see the adjacent 
chart). The slightly higher interest rates in the 
secured money market are likely to also be due 
to growth in bilateral transactions.25
Channels of liquidity 
movements 
Such a rapid liquidity redistribution of around 
€200 billion, triggered by an adjustment in the 
monetary policy framework, is unusual. Investi -
gating it can provide information as to the 
state of the banking system and the financial 
markets in the euro area. In this context, the 
observed shift in liquidity is mainly of interest in 
terms of its market channels, magnitude, speed 
and geographical focus. This analysis is princi -
pally confined to the fourth quarter of 2019. 
During this period, liquidity shifts due to the 
two- tier system had largely been concluded 
and the financial markets were not yet experi -
encing the impact of the coronavirus pan -
demic.
In the two-  tier system, banks with unused ex -
emption allowances were interested in obtain -
ing liquidity as long as the rate of interest on 
this was lower than the remuneration rate on 
the allowance. Banks holding excess liquidity 
subject to negative remuneration were ex -
pected to lend some of it, provided that the re -
muneration was higher than the rate of interest Short- term

secured bilateral transactions are not settled centrally. This 
means that the contracting parties are unable to benefit 
from the advantages of a CCP (e.g. offsetting various pos -

somewhat higher interest rates in some cases. Between the

on the deposit facility. These conditions essen -
tially produce three channels for the redistribu -
tion: the money market, the capital market (es -
pecially through the sale of highly liquid 
assets26) and participation in the targeted 
longer- term refinancing operations of the Euro -
system.27
Role of the money market
In order to offset liquidity differences among 
themselves, banks can first shift funds within 
banking groups and close alliances – such as 
the German associations. In this way, banks 
were already able to fill more than one- quarter 
of their unused exemption allowances as soon 
as the two- tier system came into operation. In 
Germany, banks filled roughly one- third of their 
unused allowances through intra-  group shifts 
and shifts within associations (see the adjacent 
chart).28
Banks can borrow not only within their group 
and association but also in the money mar -
ket.29 On the first day of the two- tier system, 
outstanding net borrowing30 by banks with un -
used allowances rose significantly. Large insti -
tutions were thus able to reduce their unused 
allowances by roughly one- third.31 They bor -
rowed around 90% of the additional liquidity 
in the secured money market. By contrast, 
banks that made full use of their allowances 
expanded their lending, thus reducing their net 
borrowing (see the upper chart on p.  76).32 
Non- banks, too, participated in this redistribu -
tion, principally through secured transactions.
When the two- tier system was introduced, the 
short- term money market was an obvious 
oppor tunity for banks to rapidly increase their 
liquid ity holdings. For one thing, the money 
market rates were (and are) well below 0%, i.e. 
the rate of remuneration on the exemption 
allow ance. For another, the short- term liquidity 
coverage of unused allowances introduces 
flexibility because it can be scaled back again at 
any time.Liquidity initially

26 Another possibility would be the sale of other assets 
such as corporate bonds or shares. Here, however, it is as -
sumed that banks chiefly scale back assets that have par -
ticularly low returns. Reducing euro government bonds, in 
particular, would therefore seem purposeful.
27 Above and beyond that, there are yet further channels 
for obtaining liquidity, such as accepting customer de -
posits.
28 An analysis of TARGET2 data confirms this development 
and shows heightened transactions by banks with unused 
allowances at the time the two- tier system started, espe -
cially within banking groups. Money market transactions in 
TARGET2 can be identified by an algorithm, described in 
Arciero et al. (2016) and elsewhere.
29 The money market is that part of the financial market in 
which short- term liquidity (maturity of up to one year) is 
traded.
30 The outstanding net volume of borrowed funds is the 
difference between the outstanding volume of borrowing 
and the outstanding volume of lending.
31 Estimate for MMSR reporting agents taking into ac -
count individual banks’ unused allowances from the sixth 
reserve maintenance period of 2019 and the change in net 
borrowing in the money market between the sixth and sev -
enth reserve maintenance periods of 2019. If net borrow -
ing rises above the theoretically unused allowance for an 
individual bank, it is no longer taken into account. The ag -
gregate also takes into account any decrease in net bor -
rowing. The 48 banks for which MMSR data are available 
represent approximately €63 billion of €227 billion in the -
oretically unused allowances.
32 The MMSR statistics reflect a large part of the money 
market operations of the reporting banks and thus also the 
borrowing of counterparties outside the banking sector. 
For this reason, even some institutions with clear excess 
liquid ity holdings report net borrowing.Deutsche Bundesbank

Additional channels for 
liquidity  inflows
Liquidity can also be generated in the capital 
market, for instance by banks actively selling 
securities or not reinvesting principal payments. 
Banks with unused exemption allowances, in 
particular, have reduced their government 
bond holdings. This was generally remunerative 
in the case of securities with a return below 
0%. In the fourth quarter of 2019, these secur -
ities included the government bonds of several 
euro area countries. Furthermore, the Eurosys -
tem’s resumption of net purchases under its 
asset purchase programmes boosted market 
demand. There are indications that banks 
covered roughly one- quarter of their unused 
allow ances by reducing their own holdings of 
government bonds.33 It was mainly domestic 
government bonds that were sold. There are 
no signs of banks reducing foreign government 
bonds with somewhat lower ratings to a 
greater extent (see the adjacent middle chart). 
In the aggregate, there is no evidence of any 
obvious sales of other securities, such as cor -
porate bonds or shares, or of a disproportion -
ate increase in bond issuance, for banks with 
unused allowances. 34
Another way of obtaining liquidity at a nega -
tive interest rate was provided by participation 
in the Eurosystem’s monetary policy refinan-
cing operations. There are no apparent indica -
tions, however, of banks with unused allow -Additional

allow ances in the sixth reserve maintenance period of 2019 
and the changes in holdings of euro government bonds 
between the third and fourth quarters of 2019. Reductions 
beyond the theoretically unused allowance are not taken 
into account. Any increase in holdings by individual banks 
reduces the aggregate estimated value. The estimate is cal -
culated using the market and nominal values from the se -
curities holdings statistics. The 249 banks for which data 
are available from these statistics account for roughly €93 
billion of €227 billion in theoretically unused allowances.
34 Higher net issuance by banks with unused allowances 
was not observable in the individual balance sheet items 
(IBSI) dataset. Banks could also have obtained liquidity in 
the capital market through bond issuance. However, owing 
to the fact that funds are tied up in bonds for a relatively 
long period of time compared with other alternatives (in 
contrast to short- term central bank liquidity), issuing bonds 
is initially not as attractive for this purpose.Deutsche Bundesbank

ances participating in greater numbers in the 
second TLTRO- III operation in December 2019. 
To fully utilise their allowances, they could have 
borrowed €8 billion in this operation, but they 
used only €4 billion of this amount. Taking 
account  of the repayments of the outstanding 
second series of targeted longer- term refinan -
cing operations (TLTRO- II), the liquidity effect 
for these banks is in fact negative (see the 
lower chart on p. 76). Even so, banks with un -
used allowances made somewhat greater use 
of their bidding opportunities overall than 
those that had already made full use of their 
allow ances.
The allotments of the later TLTRO- III operations, 
which are now also remunerated more attract -
ively, as well as the additional asset purchases 
by the Eurosystem meanwhile caused excess 
liquid  ity to increase further from mid-  March 
2020. As a result, banks probably do not have 
to obtain as much additional liquidity to make 
full use of their still unused allowances.
Cross- border liquidity flows
As already highlighted, for some countries 
liquid ity had to flow in from outside so that the 
banks in those countries could utilise their ex -
emption allowances in full.35 In the first few 
days following the start of the two- tier system, 
banks with unused allowances additionally bor -
rowed roughly €16 billion via the money mar -
kets in other euro area countries. Cross- border 
money market transactions within Europe as a 
percentage of the total volume thus increased 
by just under 2 percentage points to 20%.
These cross- border liquidity shifts were re -
flected not only in an altered distribution of ex -
cess liquidity but also in temporarily lower 
TARGET2 balances.36 On 30  October 2019, 
total TARGET2 claims and liabilities fell by €32 
billion. During the first few weeks of the two- 
tier system, there was a reduction especially in 
the TARGET2 claims of Germany, France, the 
Netherlands and Belgium and a correlated de -cline in these countries’ relative share of excess 
liquidity holdings. By contrast, liquidity flowed 
into the Italian banking system, evidenced in 
particular by a €48 billion decline in Italian 
TARGET2 liabilities37 and a considerable rise in 
excess liquidity held in the Italian banking sys -
tem of €46 billion to €115 billion (see the chart 
above). Following the initial effects of the two- 
tier system, developments in TARGET2 balances

35 As far as liquidity is not created locally, for example 
through Eurosystem refinancing operations.
36 Countries with TARGET2 claims often correspond to 
banking systems that hold a relatively large amount of ex -
cess liquidity. In line with this, a redistribution from coun -
tries with high excess liquidity to countries with relatively 
low excess liquidity is also accompanied by a decline in the 
respective TARGET2 claims and/ or liabilities. This, in turn, 
leads to a decline in total TARGET2 claims and/ or liabil ities.

cess liquidity in the euro area remains exceed -
ingly heterogeneous, too.
Conclusion
The data and facts analysed here suggest, as 
an interim conclusion, that the ECB Governing 
Council has achieved its intended aims with the 
introduction of the two-  tier system. The two-  
tier system is likely to have assisted bank- based 
transmission, for example, through having re -
duced interest expenditure on holding excess 
liquid ity by €4.7 billion up to December 2020. 
As was intended, short-  term money market 
rates have not been unduly influenced. They 
are, in fact, somewhat lower at present than 
when the two- tier system was introduced. 
With regard to money market rates, there is 
therefore no need to charge a negative rate of 
interest on all excess liquidity holdings. At 
€2,498 billion at last report, the vast majority of excess liquidity in the euro area is, at present, 
still subject to the negative interest rate on the 
deposit facility.
The incentives of the two- tier system led to a 
redistribution of liquidity in the banking system, 
resulting in exemption allowances being very 
largely used up. The banks essentially achieved 
this directly after the introduction of the two-  
tier system via the money market, which proved 
to be stable. Banks carried out a large part of 
the redistribution within their banking groups 
and associations. Liquidity shifts also took place 
internationally. Some banks boosted the 
amount of liquidity they held by reducing their 
government bond holdings. Most banks man -
aged to use up their allowances completely 
without recourse to additional Euro system refi -
nancing.With two- tier 
system, ECB 
Governing 
Council has 
achieved its 
aims

associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.

portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI
participations.  7 The German contributions to the Eurosystem's monetary aggregates
should on no account be interpreted as national monetary aggregates and are
therefore not comparable with the erstwhile German money stocks M1, M2 or M3.

the German contribution, the difference between the volume of euro banknotes

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

rity funds are not included.  5 Own funds correspond to the sum of net worth and the
