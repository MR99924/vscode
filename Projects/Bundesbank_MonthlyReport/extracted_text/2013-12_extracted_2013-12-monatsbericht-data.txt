Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Despite a very modest start to the final quarter 
of the year, the German economy is likely to 
see strong growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 
and the first quarter of 2014. Weak industrial 
output in October was due to a “bridge day” 
effect and short- time work in parts of the auto-
motive industry. According to the available 
manufacturing data, motor vehicle output in 
November is likely to have been considerably 
higher. Furthermore, car manufacturers have 
announced that, in light of the strong demand, 
they will keep the plant shutdown period around Christmas as short as possible. This is also consistent with the recent sharp rise in 
short- term output and export expectations for 
German industry, which are surveyed by the Ifo Institute, and the robust demand for intermedi-
ate goods. There is therefore a good chance 
that a clear strengthening of industrial activity 
will augment the buoyant domestic economy, 
which can be seen in the steep rise in the num-ber of permits for housing construction and the remarkably positive consumer sentiment.
Industry
There was a further distinct month- on- month 
decline in seasonally adjusted industrial output in October (-1%). It was also down 1% on the 
average level of output of the third quarter. 
“Bridge day” effects did, however, play a part 
in this. Capital goods production declined by 
3% on the whole, which was due mainly to the 
sharp 5¾% decline in motor vehicle output. 
Short- time work arrangements in two automo-
tive manufacturing plants played an important 
role in this. By contrast, production of inter -
mediate goods expanded by 1%. Consumer 
goods output was down slightly on the previ -
ous quarter’s figure (-½%).The seasonally adjusted level of new orders in 
October was down 2¼% on the month; the strong growth recorded in September was, 
however, due to a particularly sizeable number 
of large- scale orders. The average level of the 
third quarter was undershot by just ¼%. The 
previous sharp rise in domestic orders tailed off considerably (-2%). This contrasted with a pick- 
up in foreign demand (+1%), which was due 
primarily to an increase in the number of orders 
in the intermediate goods and other transport 
equipment sectors. On the whole, the inflow of 
capital goods orders decreased significantly, 
not least owing to the fact that the volume of 
large- scale orders had returned to a normal 
level (-2¼%). By contrast, orders of intermedi -
ate goods grew substantially (+2½%), and con-
sumer goods also recorded a marked rise 
(+1¾%).
Seasonally adjusted sales of German industrial 
goods in October held up at the average level of the previous quarter. The decline in domestic sales (-1%) was offset by a slightly sharper rise in export sales (+1¼%). Sales to non- euro- area 
countries rose significantly after showing a de-cline in the third quarter (+1½%). The slight up-ward trend in the euro area continued (+½%). The seasonally adjusted value of goods exports 
in October increased only marginally on the month (+¼%), but showed marked growth 
compared with the average of the third quarter 
(+1¾%). By contrast, there was a perceptible 
rise in the value of imports in month- on- month 
terms (+3%) as well as compared with the third quarter (+1¾%).
Construction
Seasonally adjusted construction output in Oc-tober recorded an unexpected 3¾% decline on 
the month. By contrast, the utilisation of con -
struction machinery surveyed by the Ifo Insti -
tute held up at its very high September level. Positive outlook

Overall construction output declined by 1¾%, 
which was due to the fact that output in the 
finishing trades was stepped up slightly (+¾%); 
these reports are, however, subject to consider -
able uncertainty as they are highly susceptible 
to revision. Construction output fell by 2¼% 
compared with the third quarter.
New construction orders in September – more 
recent data are unavailable at present  – de -
clined by a seasonally adjusted 2½% on the 
month, which was due to a fall in demand for 
civil engineering work. The decline for the third 
quarter as a whole was not as pronounced 
(-1¼%); civil engineering orders rose by 2¾%, 
whereas building construction orders declined 
by 4¾%.
Labour market
Employment is continuing to expand. The num -
ber of employed persons in Germany went up 
by a seasonally adjusted 24,000 in October and 
thus at a noticeably faster pace than in the pre -
ceding two months. This was up by 250,000, 
or 0.6%, on the same period last year. Employ-
ment subject to social security contributions 
showed a distinct month-  on-  month rise of  
37,000 in seasonally adjusted terms in Septem -
ber. Significant growth was again recorded in 
business-  r elated services (excluding third-  party  
hiring), and this time also in the manufacturing 
sector and in temporary employment. The 
year-  on-  year incr ease across all sectors of the 
German economy amounted to 378,000 em -
ployees or 1.3%. According to the Ifo Institute, 
the willingness of enterprises to recruit new 
staff improved considerably in November.
The official unemployment figure rose again slightly in November by a seasonally adjusted 
10,000. The unemployment rate remained un-
changed at 6.9%. The year-  on-  year unemploy -
ment figure showed an increase of 55,000 per -
sons. By contrast, seasonally adjusted under -

mained at the same level as in the previous 
month.
Prices
The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil rose 
markedly in November, after recording a per -
ceptible decline in the second half of October. 
Taking the average of the month of November, 
it was, nevertheless, down somewhat on the 
previous month’s level. Over the course of De-
cember so far, the oil price has been fluctuating 
around the US$110 mark. As this report went 
to press, the price of a barrel of crude oil stood at US$108¾. The discount on crude oil futures 
stood at US$1 for deliveries six months ahead 
and US$3¼ 12 months ahead.
Seasonally adjusted import prices underwent a 
steep month- on- month decline of 0.5% in Oc-
tober, whereas domestic producer prices fell only marginally on the whole (-0.1%). These 
price declines were due first and foremost to a 
drop in energy prices. Import prices of goods 
excluding energy showed a slight fall, whereas producer prices went up marginally. In year- on- 
year terms, the overall decline in import prices accelerated to 3.0% and to 0.7% in the case of producer prices.
Seasonally adjusted consumer prices rose slightly in November by 0.1% on the month. 
Energy prices fell substantially and food prices 
dropped marginally. This contrasted with a fur -
ther moderate increase in the price of industrial goods. The prices of services and rents went up somewhat more sharply. The year- on- year rate 
of inflation increased to 1.3% as measured by 
the national consumer price index CPI and 
to 1.6% according to the HICP , compared with 1.2% in October in both cases.
The comparatively large deviation between the 
HICP and the CPI inflation rates is explained by 
chain- linking problems in the components of 
accommodation services and package holi -
days.1 In the case of the HICP , index data de -rived using the new method of calculation are 
compared with index data derived using the former calculation method, whereas the CPI was back-  calculated using the new method. 
This is why the annual HICP inflation rates have been biased upwards since January 2013, albeit 
to a varying extent. The bias in November, at 0.6 percentage point, was particularly pro
-
nounced.2 From December 2013, the German 
HICP rate will no longer be affected by these biases and will therefore be discernibly lower 
than in the previous month.
Public finances3
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
The statutory health insurance institutions and 
the health insurance fund recorded an almost 
balanced result in consolidated terms in the 
third quarter of 2013. This contrasts with a sur -
plus of close to €2 billion one year previously. 
The statutory health insurance institutions and 
the health insurance fund both saw their fi -
nances deteriorate by around €1 billion. The 
statutory health insurance system’s revenue in-
creased by a total of 1½%, while growth in ex-penditure (just over 5½%) was far stronger.
The statutory health insurance institutions con-
tinued to receive a steady flow of income from 
the predetermined payments made by the 
health insurance fund, which were up by 3½% International

commodation services sub- index to explaining the current 
deviations between CPI and HICP inflation rates, Monthly 
Report, April 2013, p 7.
2 If this statistical effect is excluded, the HICP rate in No -
vember would have been distinctly lower than the CPI rate. This is due to the fact that, unlike the HICP , the CPI basket of goods also includes gambling. The fees for state- run lot-
teries were raised significantly in May, which accounted for 0.2 percentage point of the annual CPI rate.
3 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter.

debt, see the statistical section of this report.Deutsche Bundesbank

on the year. However, growth in expenditure 
accelerated to just over 5½%. There was once 
again a particularly steep increase in spending 
on out- patient medical and dental treatment 
(combined figure: +11%), following the aboli -
tion of the surgery visit charge – which was de-
ducted from expenditure – at the beginning of 
2013. Without this special effect, expenditure 
on these items would have risen by 5%. Spend-
ing on hospital treatment also increased at a 
faster pace (just over 5%), partly as a result of 
the legal provisions requiring health insurance 
institutions to assume a greater share of hos -
pitals’ increased personnel costs. Finally, pay -
ments for pharmaceuticals rose perceptibly for 
the first time in a long while (by almost 3½%).
The health insurance fund’s transfers to the 
health insurance institutions went up by 3½%, 
but its revenue increased by only 1½%. At 3%, contribution receipts continued to record fairly 
substantial growth. This reflects the ongoing favourable employment and wage develop
-ments, although their impact was dampened by the particularly low mid-2013 pension in
-
crease in western Germany (+0.25%). How -
ever, growth in revenue was mainly muted by 
the discretionary cuts to the central govern -
ment grant (by €2½ billion for the year as a 
whole, down to €11½ billion).
Although the health insurance fund accumu -
lated a deficit of €2½ billion between January 
and September 2013, as a substantial surplus is expected in the final quarter owing to the con-
tribution base being widened by bonus pay -
ments, it seems that a positive balance could 
still be posted for the year as a whole. The €1½ billion surplus accrued by the health insurance institutions during the first three quarters of the year is unlikely to be completely erased by the 
deficit that could emerge for the final quarter. 
Overall, the statutory health insurance system 
as a whole is thus expected to once again re -
cord a surplus in 2013 and consequently the 
reserves of the health insurance fund and the 
health insurance institutions (which most re -
cently came to just over €10½ billion and €17 billion, respectively) will probably be topped up further.
In 2014, however, the financial situation of the 
statutory health insurance scheme is set to de-
teriorate dramatically. The previous govern -
ment envisaged a further €1 billion cut to the 
central government grant. A reduction in the mandatory discounts for manufacturers of pharmaceuticals – which had been extended 
on 1 August 2010 – has been planned for some time (and is only slightly scaled back in the co-
alition agreement). Furthermore, some health 
insurance institutions have announced sizeable premium payouts for their members, which, for the most part, will probably impact on the insti-tutions’ finances in 2014. Over and above this, 
further interventions are set to increase ex -
penditure, such as the improvements to in-  
patient and out- patient medical care negoti -
ated in the coalition agreement.Fund’s finances

It was furthermore agreed that non- income-  
related additional contributions will be replaced 
by contribution premiums in proportion to 
wages. The key instrument promoting compe-
tition among the health insurance institutions 
will thus focus on attracting high- earning 
members. Furthermore, the goal of detaching 
the financing of the statutory health insurance 
scheme from wages and increasingly shifting 
the redistribution components to the tax and 
transfer system will probably no longer be pur -
sued in future. Rather, it is planned to once 
again organise the redistribution of income 
solely among persons with health insurance by 
means of contributions in proportion to wages 
up to the maximum level of earnings subject to 
contributions. This would render the central 
government grant previously envisaged for this 
purpose obsolete.
Public long- term care 
 insurance scheme
The public long- term care insurance scheme re-
corded a slight deficit in the third quarter of 2013, as it did one year earlier. Following the 
benefit increases, particularly those for individ-
uals suffering from dementia, expenditure went up very sharply (by 7½%). However, at 
8%, revenue rose even more strongly, not least 
owing to the increase in the contribution rate 
from 1.95% to 2.05% (plus an extra 0.25% in 
each case for childless persons) at the begin -
ning of 2013. Furthermore, as in the case of the 
statutory health insurance scheme, the on -
going favourable employment and wage devel-opments and the dampening impact of the low pension increase in western Germany were also contributory factors.
The public long- term care insurance scheme is 
expected to record a surplus for 2013 as a 
whole because the additional revenue from the 
increase in the contribution rate will initially ex-
ceed the additional expenditure owing to re -
forms. The coalition agreement envisages fur -
ther significant benefit increases, which are planned to be financed through another rise in 
the contribution rate by 0.5 percentage point 
overall. From 2015 onwards, 0.1 percentage 
point of this rise is to be used to build up a spe-
cial reserve (which will be managed by the 
Bundesbank). In the future, the more extensive 
benefits will exacerbate the financial burdens 
resulting from demographic change. Although 
building up a capital reserve will shift part of the additional costs to today’s contribution 
payers, this will only be able to provide tempor -
ary relief for future contribution payers. Once 
the reserve has been depleted, the entire finan-
cial responsibility will once again rest on the 
shoulders of future contribution payers.

gross terms (previous month: €118.2 billion). 
After deducting redemptions, which also 
 increased, and taking account of changes in 
 issuers’ holdings of their own bonds, the vol -
ume of outstanding domestic bonds rose by 
€5.6 billion. In addition, foreign debt securities 
worth €1.7 billion net were sold in the German market.
Domestic enterprises issued €5.7 billion net worth of own bonds in the month under 
 review. On balance, these were primarily bonds 
with a maturity of more than one year.
The public sector issued €5.3 billion worth of 
bonds in the capital market in October. Central 
government (including the resolution agency which is classified as part of central govern
-
ment) accounted for €5.0 billion of this figure. It issued mainly ten- year Federal bonds (Bunds) 
and two- year Federal Treasury notes (Schätze) 
for €7.3 billion and €5.6 billion respectively, but also 30-year Federal bonds for €1.6 billion. This contrasted with net redemptions of five- year 
Federal notes (Bobls) for €9.2 billion. In the month under review, the state governments 
tapped the capital market for €0.3 billion net.
On balance, the outstanding amount of debt 
securities issued by domestic credit institutions 
decreased by €5.4 billion in October. Other bank debt securities and public Pfandbriefe 
were redeemed for €6.3 billion and €2.5 billion respectively, as well as, to a lesser extent, mort-gage Pfandbriefe (0.8 billion). By contrast, debt 
securities issued by specialised credit institu -
tions were sold in the market (€4.1 billion net).
Domestic non- banks were the sole net pur -
chasers in October. They added, on balance, 
€13.5 billion worth of bonds to their portfolios. The  majority of these were domestic securities. 
By contrast, German credit institutions reported 
net sales totalling €3.7 billion, the majority of 
which were domestic securities. Foreign invest-
ors and the Bundesbank sold debt securities for 
a net amount of €1.7 billion and €0.8 billion 
respectively.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
issued €0.2 billion worth of new shares in the 
German equity market. The volume of foreign 
equities outstanding in the German market also 
rose (€1.1 billion). On balance, equities were 
acquired solely by domestic non- banks, which 
added €5.4 billion net worth of shares to their 
portfolios. By contrast, foreign investors and 
domestic credit institutions disposed of equity 
holdings for €3.9 billion and €0.2 billion net re-spectively.
Mutual funds
In October, domestic mutual funds sold share 
units for a total of €5.8 billion net in the

month). On balance, fresh funds were injected Net issuance of

 institutional investors (€4.0 billion). Mixed 
securities- based funds and mixed funds were 
the main asset classes to record inflows (€2.0 
billion and €1.9 billion respectively). Share-  
based funds and bond- based funds also suc -
cessfully placed new shares in the market (€1.5 
billion and €0.8 billion respectively). In the re -
porting month, foreign funds traded in the 
German market sold shares to the tune of €3.7 
billion. On balance, domestic non-  banks were 
the main purchasers, adding €9.0 billion net of mutual fund shares to their portfolios. Domes-tic credit institutions also acquired mutual fund 
shares worth €1.3 billion net. By contrast,  foreign investors reduced their holdings by 
€0.9 billion.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus – in unadjusted terms – of €19.1 billion in 
October 2013. The result was €0.9 billion down 
on the level of the previous month. This in -
crease was primarily due to a declining trade surplus, which outweighed the improved sur
-
plus in invisible current transactions, compris -
ing services, income and current transfers.
According to provisional figures released by the 
Federal Statistical Office, in October the foreign trade surplus went down by €2.4 billion on the 
month to €17.9 billion. After adjustment for 
seasonal and calendar effects, it decreased by 
€2.0 billion to €16.8 billion. The value of ex -
ports was up slightly on the previous month 
(+0.2%), whilst imports rose strongly (+2.9%).
In October, Germany recorded a surplus of 
€2.9 billion in invisible current transactions, 
compared with €2.2 billion in September. This 
was primarily due to the increase in net cross- 
border income by €1.0 billion to €6.7 billion, 
which largely reflected the lower dividend pay-
ments from portfolio investment to non-  
residents. The deficit for current transfers re -
mained broadly unchanged at €3.0 billion. By Current account

contrast, the deficit on the services sub- account 
increased by €0.4 billion to €0.8 billion.
With financial market activity relatively quiet, 
German cross- border portfolio investment re -
sulted in net capital exports of €12.6 billion in 
October. Both the higher portfolio investment 
abroad of German investors (€6.0 billion) and a 
withdrawal of funds by non- resident investors 
from the domestic securities markets (€6.5 bil-lion) played a part in this. Portfolio investors in 
Germany were focused on purchasing mutual 
fund shares (€3.7 billion) in October. In add -
ition, they acquired money market paper (€2.7 
billion) and shares (€0.6 billion). By contrast, they divested themselves of bonds issued by non- residents (€1.0 billion). Foreign investors 
sold German equities (€3.9 billion), in particu -
lar. They also disposed of German debt secur -
ities (€1.7 billion) and mutual fund shares 
(€0.9 billion).
Direct investment resulted in relatively high net 
capital inflows (€14.5 billion) in October. The 
fact that non- resident firms provided their Ger -
man affiliates with €14.8 billion in funding 
– mainly via longer- term financial loans – was a key contributing factor. German foreign direct 
investment was close to balance in October 
(€0.3 billion net).In other statistically recorded investment, com-
prising financial and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investment, Germany saw net 
capital outflows of €18.7 billion in October. 
Transactions by enterprises and households re-
sulted in net capital exports of €21.1 billion. 
They increased their short- term bank deposits 
abroad whilst at the same time decreasing fi -
nancial loans abroad. Government entities re -
ported inflows of funds worth €0.6 billion in October. The banking system saw inflows of 
€1.8 billion, largely in response to all other bal-
ance of payment transactions. While credit in-
stitutions’ net external assets rose by €26.8 bil-lion in October, the net external position of the 
Bundesbank fell by €28.6. The decline in the 
TARGET2 balance and higher deposits by inter -
national organisations at the Bundesbank 
played a role here.

Outlook for the German economy – 
macroeconomic projections  for 2014 and 2015
The German economy has picked up momentum again. There has been a continuation of the 
expansion in aggregate output that was interrupted for a time by the escalating sovereign debt 
crisis in the euro area. The driving forces are changing, however. While external impulses had the upper hand during the upturn which followed the economic and financial crisis, domestic eco-
nomic activity has come to the fore recently. A part in this is played by the German economy 
being in good shape, as is shown by the low unemployment rate, continuing growth in employ-ment, and marked growth in earnings. Low interest rates are also having an effect. These factors are supporting private consumption and driving housing construction. By contrast, external trade has been tending to be weak of late. With the cyclical situation continuing to become brighter in the industrial countries and given the emerging improvement in the euro area, there should also be a pick- up in exports and, in their wake, an upturn in corporate investment and imports.
Under these conditions, the German economy could grow by 1.7% in the coming year and by 
2.0% in 2015, after an increase of no more than 0.5% in 2013. In calendar- adjusted terms, this 
would result in growth rates of gross domestic product (GDP) amounting to 0.6% in 2013, 1.7% in 2014, and 1.8% in 2015. Given potential growth of 1.4% in each of the next two years, aggre-gate capacity utilisation will increase moderately from a normal level in 2013. This will be accom-panied by a further rise in employment, predominantly fed by immigration. The current account surplus could go down to the level it had before the sovereign debt crisis escalated. Leaving aside the details of the new German government’s coalition agreement, which were not yet known at 
the time this projection was completed, the government budget could show something of an 
improvement and achieve a surplus of just under ½% of GDP in 2015. There could be a distinct fall in the high debt ratio.
The sustained improvement in the labour market situation compared with the past decade is 
reflected in an acceleration of wage growth, which is to be seen as a normalisation. Consumer 
price inflation as measured by the HICP could initially moderate from 1.6% in 2013 to 1.3% in 
2014, but then go up again to 1.5% in 2015. If energy is excluded, the rate is likely to increase to 1.9% in 2015 in the wake of the accelerated rise in wages.
The risks to the forecast are to be seen, first, in the external setting. The effects of the euro- area 
debt crisis have been contained and major reforms have been initiated. Nevertheless, the burden-
some level of debt and the structural problems that continue to exist mean that the European and global economies remain highly vulnerable. Second, domestic risks exist. A number of the meas-ures under discussion for the coalition agreement have the potential to harm the efficiency of the labour and goods markets, and the fiscal stance will probably be eased. The fact that the under-
lying pace of growth might be stronger than described here is to be seen as a cyclical upside 
opportunity.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current situation
As expected in the June projection, the German 
economy quickly recovered from its weakness 
in the final three months of 2012 and the first 
quarter of 2013 and returned to an expansion-
ary course. Following heightened GDP growth 
of 0.7% in the second quarter due to catch- up 
and backlog effects, overall output went up by 0.3% in the third quarter. This means that the 
German economy is likely to have returned to 
the range of normal capacity utilisation. This is suggested not only by the data on capacity and construction equipment utilisation, but also by 
the high degree of satisfaction with which 
firms describe their business situation in surveys undertaken by the Ifo Institute and the Associ-
ation of German Chambers of Commerce and 
Industry (DIHK).
The cyclical upturn has been sustained recently 
almost entirely by domestic economic activity. 
Private consumption has benefited from the 
prospect of substantial gains in real incomes, and housing construction has been driven by a  sharp rise in demand for accommodation, 
 especially in urban centres, as well as extremely 
favourable financing conditions and the lack of 
opportunities for investing capital that are 
deemed to be safe and profitable. This is also 
apparent in the steep rise in housing building permits. As construction activity in the first four months of the current year was very weak due 
to the weather, the high level of equipment 
utilisation already achieved last year in the main 
construction industry means that considerable 
backlog demand is now likely to have arisen.
In real terms, exports of goods have not yet 
fully recovered from their sharp decline  towards 
the end of 2012. Exports to non- euro- area 
countries in particular were still tending to be 
weak. By contrast, exports to the rest of the euro area were pointing upwards again. Des
-
pite buoyant domestic demand, the expansion 
in industrial output was therefore no more 
than subdued. According to the Ifo Institute, it was not until October that manufacturing cap-
acity utilisation approximately matched its longer- term average again. This is probably 
also the key reason for the lack of momentum so far in corporate investment.
On the labour market, developments in em -
ployment were more positive than assumed in 
the June projection, while unemployment 
– contrary to expectations – did not go down 
slightly, but rose somewhat instead. This is to 
be seen in connection with the extremely high 
level of immigration, which was already 13% 
higher in net terms in the first half of 2013 than it was in the same period of 2102 and thus also 
up on the June projection. On the one hand, 
this largely labour- market- oriented immigration 
is counteracting supply shortages and thus strengthening employment growth. On the 
other hand, it is tending to restrict the oppor -
tunities of domestic job- seekers if they are less 
mobile and do not have the same level of skills.
The rise in labour income in the second and 
third quarters was lower than was expected in the June projection. One major factor in this is 
that the wage bargainers in the retail trade 
have not yet been able to conclude a new pay agreement. Moreover, some of the new agree-
ments make provision for a pay freeze in the 
first few months after they come into force. In 
contrast to expectations in spring, the rise in Rapid cyclical

negotiated rates of pay in the current year will 
therefore probably be limited to 2.5%. Added 
to this is the fact that the scale of bonus pay-
ments in industry is probably somewhat smaller than last year.
Measured by the annual HICP rates, the price 
trend flattened somewhat in the second and 
third quarters of 2013, as was also expected in 
the June projection. The fact that the price 
trend was overestimated chiefly in the case of 
industrial goods excluding energy, but also for services is an indication that the accelerated in-
crease in wages, under the impact of the ap -
preciation of the euro, is making itself felt in 
consumer prices more slowly than hitherto as-sumed. By contrast, the price increases for food products were distinctly sharper than expected. 
A considerable part in this was played by the weather conditions, which were not always 
 favourable for agriculture.
Major assumptions
This projection is based on assumptions made 
by the Eurosystem’s experts concerning global 
trade, exchange rates, commodity prices and 
interest rates. The assumptions are based on 
 information available as at 15 November 2013. 
The assumptions regarding sales markets in the 
euro area are derived from projections by the 
national central banks of the other euro- area 
countries.
Against the backdrop of a pick- up in industrial 
activity, global economic growth became 
stronger again during 2013. There was a shift-
ing of emphasis from the emerging economies to the industrial countries, which will probably 
continue during the projection period. Above-  
average growth rates are still expected from the emerging market economies, but, given growing structural impediments and rising long- term interest rates, overall output in this 
group of countries is unlikely to go on expand-
ing at the same pace as in earlier years. In the 
industrial countries, negative factors such as the level of private sector debt and the consoli-
dation efforts in the public sector are becoming 
less significant for economic activity. Overall, global growth could strengthen perceptibly 
without, however, matching the rapid pace of 
expansion achieved prior to the financial and 
economic crisis. Given a purchasing power par -
ity weighting of 2¾% in the current year and 
3½% in 2014, global expansion will be some -
what weaker than assumed in the June projec-tion. For 2015, a further slight increase to 3¾% is expected.
In the euro area, there are growing signs of a 
continuation of the recovery process that 
began in spring. There was a further rise in eco-nomic output in the third quarter of 2013, and the short- term indicators show that an increase 
is likely to be achieved in the fourth quarter, too. The key factor in this is that there is no further restriction of domestic demand. Even 
so, the strains resulting from the debt and ad-
justment crisis are still exerting an impact. 
Given ongoing low capacity utilisation and, in 
some countries, difficult access to bank loans, 
industrial investment is recovering only slowly. 
Furthermore, in many countries the high level 
of private sector debt and unemployment are 
depressing private consumption. At the same 
time, in a number of countries the adjustment 
of costs structures is making progress and en -Inflation initially

terprises are opening up new sales markets, 
enabling them to enjoy a larger share of global 
growth. It is to be expected that higher export 
growth will also generate stimuli for domestic 
activity. Owing to a negative statistical carry-  
over effect and the weak start to the year, the 
GDP growth rate for the euro area in 2013 will be negative again at -0.4%, despite the incipi-
ent recovery process. It is not until 2014 and 
2015 that positive growth rates of 1.1% and 
1.5% are expected again. If Germany is ex -
cluded, a  decline of 0.8% will be followed by 
increases of 0.9% and 1.4% respectively.
A dip in global industrial activity almost brought 
the expansion of world trade to a halt in the 
second half of last year. In the current year, there has been a marked recovery in inter
-
national trade in line with the renewed pick- up 
in industrial output. It is anticipated that this process will continue in the coming year and 
that global imports of goods and services will 
then increase at a rate of 6%, compared with 
2¾% this year and 5¼% in 2014. German  exporters’ sales opportunities were severely 
dampened last year by the decline in imports 
within the euro area in particular. In view of the 
initially muted upturn in intra- euro- area trade, 
sales market growth in 2013, at only 1¼%, should be well below the already depressed 
rate of expansion in world trade. Given that the 
recovery process within the euro area is 
strengthening only slowly, this is likely to apply to the next two years, too, albeit at decreasing 
intervals. With the expected expansion in ex -
port markets of 4% in 2014 and 5% in 2015, 
German enterprises would take a share of the 
stronger global growth.
Since a lull in spring, the euro has undergone a 
fairly steady trend appreciation. In the period 
that is relevant to the derivation of the ex -
change rate assumptions, the euro, at US$1.34, stood 2¼% higher than in the June projection. 
In nominal effective terms, ie compared with 
other currencies relevant to foreign trade, the 
euro appreciated by 1¾%.Output losses and the fear of a military escal -
ation of the political disputes in the Middle East 
led for a time in summer to a marked acceler -
ation in crude oil prices, especially on the spot 
market, although futures prices were pointing 
downwards across all delivery periods. At 
US$108¼ per barrel of Brent crude oil, the  assumptions for the current year, which are 
 derived technically from futures prices, are 
2½% higher than those of the June projection. 
For 2014, at US$104, they are around 4% 
higher than in the June projection, although the premium is clearly lower in euro terms 
owing to its appreciation against the US dollar 
in the intermittent period. According to the for -
ward prices, a further decline in the price of 
crude oil to US$99¼ is assumed for 2015.
A decline in the prices of food commodities set 
in on the international markets as early as the 
summer months and thus sooner than assumed 
in the June projection. This is likely to continue. Other agricultural commodities are expected to become more expensive, however. Overall, fol-
lowing a distinct decline this year, commodity 
prices will probably fall again in 2014 as well 
before going up on an annual average in 2015.
At the beginning of November, the Governing 
Council of the ECB reduced the interest rate on 
the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations 
to a new all- time low, prompted by diminishing 
price pressures, very low recent HICP rates and still- subdued credit dynamics. This decision and 
the subsequent communication have some -
what dampened expectations regarding the 
path of short- term interest rates. As in the Bun-
desbank’s June projections, this forecast as -
sumes that the three- month interest rate for 
unsecured transactions on the interbank mar -
ket will stand at 0.2% this year and at 0.3% in 
2014, before rising to 0.5% in 2015. In the 
summer, the yield on nine to ten- year German 
government bonds rose well above the as -
sumptions in the June forecast. The upward 
trend is likely to continue in this forecast period. 
Based on the yield curve, the forecast predicts 
that the yield of 1.6% this year will be followed Sales market

by yields of 2.0% in 2014 and 2.4% in 2015. 
This puts next year’s yields 20 basis points 
higher than predicted in the June projections.
The lending rates of German banks are almost 
unchanged compared with the spring. Given 
the assumed path of money market interest rates and long- term yields on government 
bonds, the lending rates for enterprises and 
consumers are also likely to rise slightly in the 
forecast period, starting from a very low level. 
The results of the Bank Lending Survey (BLS) indicate that banks left their credit standards for loans to enterprises largely unchanged in the third quarter of 2013, and barely any change is expected for the fourth quarter  either. According to the Ifo Credit Constraint 
Indicator, the share of enterprises reporting  restrictive access to bank credit remains very 
low by longer- term standards. Funding condi -
tions are therefore still categorised as extremely 
favourable. This is unlikely to change in this 
forecast period.1
For public finances, the projections generally 
only include measures which have either  already been approved by parliament or have 
been defined in detail and are likely to be im -
plemented. In particular, they do not take ac -
count of the arrangements made in the Ger -
man government’s coalition agreement, which 
were not yet known when the forecast was 
completed. The fiscal policy measures included 
in this forecast would lead to a limited increase 
in the general government deficit in 2014 and 
have no net impact in 2015. The additional bur -
den on public finances in 2014 is mainly the 
result of the assumption that the statutory pen-sion contribution rate would be cut by another 
0.6 percentage point to 18.3%, thus bringing 
the reserves back to their upper limit of 1.5 times the scheme’s monthly expenditure, in 
line with the basic rule, at the end of 2014. The 
forecast assumes that the outpayments from the flood assistance fund set up in summer 2013 (totalling €8 billion) will be spread out 
over a number of years and will thus have rela-tively little impact on the fiscal balance in the 
individual years of the forecast period.
As things stand, the measures outlined in the 
coalition agreement, which are not included in these projections, are unlikely to fundamentally change the forecast picture for public finances 
in the next two years, although they do indi -
cate a less stringent fiscal policy path. The 
agreement  envisages additional expenditure on 
the pension and long- term care insurance 
schemes and on education and infrastructure, 
amongst other areas. From a general govern -
ment perspective, the financial impact of the measures in the coalition agreement in com
-
parison with the estimates underlying this fore-cast is likely to be limited by the fact that social 
security contribution rates are unlikely to be cut, contrary to what is assumed in the fore
-
cast.2 The figures available so far suggest that

nual terms. The burdens on public finances 
may also have more of an impact in the second 
half of the legislative period, most of which lies beyond the forecast horizon.
Economic outlook3
While economic growth was primarily driven by domestic activity in the second and third 
quarters of 2013, external factors are also likely 
to regain importance from autumn onwards. Alongside the significant improvement in ex
-
pectations regarding both industrial output and 
exports reported in the Ifo surveys, this is also 
indicated by new orders in manufacturing, which rose by 1½% in both of the past two 
quarters. Notably, there was a marked increase 
in orders from non- euro- area countries and, 
more recently, in orders from within Germany. 
Greater cyclical momentum in industry should 
also help to at least maintain the current pace of growth in services. Given the  excess demand for housing construction, the expansion of cap-acity in the construction sector is likely to con-
tinue and the growth rate for construction 
work should initially remain comparatively high. These factors combined suggest that growth in 
the German economy will be fairly strong in 
the final quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014 provided that it is not slowed down tem-porarily by especially bad weather.
Over the medium term, the German economy 
should benefit not only from the rebound in 
global economic growth but also from the fact 
that the European economy is increasingly 
 regaining its footing. The mere prospect of this 
improvement should induce enterprises to in -
vest more in new machinery and equipment 
and in property. In addition, the outlook for pri-
vate consumption is fairly positive, the expan -
sionary phase in private residential construction 
is set to continue for some time and govern -
ment consumption and investment expenditure 
is unlikely to place any restraints on growth, 
meaning that Germany’s economic growth 
should strengthen over the forecast horizon.
Under these conditions, real GDP in Germany could grow by 1.7% in 2014 and by 2.0% in 2015, following an increase of 0.5% in 2013. After working- day adjustment, GDP growth 
would thus come to 0.6% in 2013, 1.7% in 
2014, and 1.8% in 2015. The fairly low rate of expansion in 2013 is attributable to a statistical 
carry- over effect from 2012. The stronger cyc -
lical  dynamics are also reflected in the annual 
rates of change, which are projected to rise 
from 1.6% in 2013 to 1.9% in 2015.
With the growth profile outlined in this fore -
cast, the utilisation of the German economy 
would increase moderately from a normal level 
in 2013. In this forecast, the estimated poten -
tial growth is slightly higher than in previous forecasts. The increase in immigration will Stronger cyclical

probably delay the point in time when labour 
shortages due to demographic change become 
noticeable. It therefore appears appropriate to 
raise the estimated potential growth rate for 
2014 and 2015 to 1.4%, following rates of 
1.3% in 2013 and 1.2% in 2012.
The projected GDP growth rates for 2013 and 
2014 are thus both just under 0.2 percentage 
point higher than in the June forecast. In 2013, 
the picture for exports in particular is some -
what more favourable, although this is partly 
due to data revisions. In 2014, a better outlook 
for private consumption and residential con -
struction are the decisive factors.
Exports should already experience a significant 
rebound in the final quarter of 2013, bringing 
the preceding weak phase to an end. This is 
indicated by the marked improvement in indus-
trial firms’ export expectations since August 
and the rise in new orders from abroad. Ac -
cording to the autumn survey by the Associ -
ation of German Chambers of Commerce and 
Industry, exporters’ sales expectations have im-
proved distinctly for the medium term, too. 
While the pick- up in demand has been fuelled 
by non- euro- area countries so far, the recovery 
now on the horizon for the euro area will prob-ably provide additional sales opportunities. Fol-lowing a slight rise of ¼% this year, this means that a marked strengthening of export growth 
is likely. With the growth rates of 4% in 2014 
and 5½% in 2015 assumed in this forecast, 
 exports are broadly in line with developments 
on the sales markets. Unlike in the preceding 
years, disproportionately high growth is un -
likely in view of changing cost trends and  increasing competition from other euro- area 
countries. In addition, there is now a tendency, 
at least in some sectors, to replace or at least 
supplement exports with on- site production.4
Germany’s increasing exports, above all to 
other euro- area countries, mean that the weak 
phase in corporate investment should soon be 
over. Rising capacity utilisation in industry, 
abundant own funds and exceptionally favour -able funding conditions should help to boost 
enterprises’ investment. However, it should be 
borne in mind that the structural reforms in 
other euro- area countries and the progress 
made in adjusting their economies will also 
 revive their appeal to German enterprises as a 
location for manufacturing. In addition, efforts 
to locate some parts of production close to end 
consumers will stimulate investment in non-  
euro- area countries. Consequently, this projec-
tion assumes a normalisation of corporate in -Slight upward

vestment in Germany, but not a substantial in-
crease in capacity.
The rising demand for both housing and invest-
ments which appear likely to retain their value has coincided not only with a distinct increase in rents for new tenancies and in housing prices 
but also strong growth in the number of new 
permits for construction projects. There was a 
year- on- year rise of just over 15% in the third 
quarter of 2013, and the upward trend appears 
to be continuing unabated. The national ac -
counts data show that investment in residential construction – including investment in existing 
buildings, which is probably growing less 
strongly – was 3% up on the year overall in the 
third quarter. Given the high level of capacity utilisation, whether the sharp rise in demand 
will rapidly generate actual construction work 
will depend on how quickly capacity can be in-
creased. In addition to immigration, the EU’s 
open markets should help in this process. The 
fairly subdued growth to date in prices for con-
struction work certainly suggests that the cap-
acity constraints have not yet expanded the 
scope for price rises. It can therefore be as -
sumed that, following the two mid-  year quar -
ters, which were particularly influenced by catch- up effects, the rate of growth in con
-
struction work will remain fairly high but start 
to decline. This would result in annual average growth rates of 5½% in 2014 and 3¾% in 
2015 for investment in residential construction, 
following a rise of only 1¼% in 2013. In rela-
tion to aggregate economic output, investment 
in residential construction would continue to 
rise into 2015 and substantially exceed the low 
recorded in 2008. Yet it would still be well 
below the high recorded for post- reunification 
Germany in 1994.5
Growth in public investment has probably only 
been moderate in 2013. The forecast assumes 
a stronger pace of expansion in the coming years, not least in view of the relatively good 
financial situation of many municipalities. The 
coalition agreement, which has now been pro-
visionally signed, envisages additional govern -
ment investment. However, it is important to note that the total pool of investment funds still has to be allocated to specific years and 
investments are often only implemented after a fairly long planning phase.
Following a decline of ¾% in 2013, gross fixed 
investment will probably increase by 4¼% 
overall next year and by almost 5% in 2015. In 
addition, stocks are likely to be replenished in 
2013 and 2014. Even though machinery and 
equipment in particular have a fairly high im -
port component, gross fixed investment would 
therefore make a substantial contribution to the cyclical improvement in Germany’s eco
-
nomic growth.
Private consumption is benefiting from house -
holds’ growing conviction that the economic 
outlook has improved and that they themselves 
will profit from this through a distinct rise in income – at least that is what is indicated by the regular GfK surveys of consumer confi
-
dence. According to our projections, house -
holds’ real disposable income should rise by almost 1½% in 2014 and by 1¾% in 2015, after increasing by only around ½% this year. Residential con-

far higher and, above all, there was considerable demand for renovation and new buildings in eastern Germany.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report 
December 2013 20

Given the improvement in consumer senti -
ment, growth in expenditure on private con -
sumption could be somewhat stronger than 
the rise in disposable income. The saving ratio 
would then continue to fall slightly, reaching 
9.8% in 2015. Despite the mandatory contribu-
tion rates to the social security schemes prob -
ably being higher than assumed in this fore -
cast, the additional social benefits envisaged in 
the coalition agreement could give disposable 
income and private consumption a slight added 
boost.
Growth in real government consumption is 
likely to remain subdued in 2013. However, a 
sharper nominal rise is likely, not least because 
the surgery visit charge has been abolished. In 
real terms, too, it is assumed that growth will 
regain strength in the subsequent years, and the increase in government consumption will prob-ably be roughly in line with potential output.
The expected strong expansion in domestic final demand should go hand in hand with a 
marked increase in imports. Although the Fed-
eral Statistical Office’s input- output tables, 
which were last published for 2009, show a 
lower intensity of imports for some important 
demand components than in the preceding 
years, this is probably due mainly to the 2008-09 economic crisis. For the forecast period, it is 
assumed that import behaviour will become more similar to that seen in the years before 
the crisis. Provided that this is the case, imports should grow by just over 5% next year and by 
6½% in 2015, after increasing by only 1% in 2013. The other euro- area countries should 
benefit particularly strongly from the sharp rise in imports.
In view of the strong import growth, Germa -
ny’s current account surplus could decline from almost 7% of nominal GDP in 2013 to 6¼% in 2015. It would then be close to the level seen before the escalation of the euro- area debt cri-
sis. The trade account surplus could decline 
from 6% to 5½% of GDP . In this forecast, the 
comparatively subdued dynamics in corporate investment and in the price component of 
nominal GDP in Germany will prevent a sharper 
 decline. Looking at investment income, the 
continuing rise in external assets means that 
substantial inflows remain likely. However, cur -
rent transfers to the rest of the world are likely to increase distinctly, partly because of the rise in immigration.

tion. The flow of migrants in the first half of 
2013 significantly exceeded last year’s elevated 
level. According to the current projection, a net inflow of 385,000 people is expected for 2013 
as a whole, compared to inflows of 370,000 
people in 2012. Noticeably higher numbers of 
immigrants from other euro- area countries in 
particular are likely this year in view of the con-
siderable labour market disparities, and this heightened level could largely be maintained over the following years. The net influx from 
the central and eastern European EU member 
states, which were granted full labour mobility in 2011, is expected to ease gradually over the 
forecast horizon. By contrast, inflows from 
 Romania and Bulgaria will increase temporarily 
as restrictions on the freedom of movement for 
workers are lifted. Net immigration in 2014 is 
therefore expected to be broadly similar to 2013. In 2015, the number of immigrants 
could then fall to 350,000. Because the major -
ity of these immigrants are pursuing employ -
ment opportunities, immigration significantly and directly increases the potential labour 
force. It will probably swell the labour force by 
280,000 people in both 2013 and 2014, and by 
just over 250,000 people in 2015.
A large number of immigrants are expected to 
find work fairly quickly, especially as they often have good formal qualifications and target seg-
ments of the German labour market in which 
the demand for labour cannot always be met 
through local supply. Employment can thus continue to grow despite decreasing local 
 reserves. However, it is still likely to continue to 
weaken slightly over the forecast horizon from 0.6% in 2013 to 0.4% in 2015. This slowdown is consistent with the ongoing return to normal wage growth.
The temporary cyclical weakness and large 
 influx of qualified workers have caused a slight 
increase in unemployment since the second 
quarter of 2012. Although immigration levels 
remain high, the brighter economic outlook is 
likely at first to slow the increase in unemploy-
ment and then initiate a slight countermove -
ment. The unemployment rate as defined by 
the Federal Employment Agency could fall from 6.9% this year to 6.7% in 2015, while the un-employment rate calculated according to inter -
national conventions could decrease from 
5.3% to 5.2%.
Labour costs and prices
To forecast the increase in negotiated wages, 
all the agreements concluded in previous years 
are analysed and extrapolated at the end of their validity periods, taking into account the 
macroeconomic framework and sector- specific 
features. In the retail sector, which employs around 10½% of the workers included in the 
Bundesbank’s negotiated pay rate statistics, no 
agreement has been reached despite months 
of wage negotiations. This projection assumes 
that a new agreement will soon be reached 
which will include compensation for the past Further rise in

few months in which wages did not go up.6 
This is one of the main reasons why the nego-
tiated wage projection for 2014 now predicts a 
3.1% rise in remuneration, while the June pro-
jection calculated an increase of 2.9%. Assum-ing that the degree of success depends on the 
business cycle, the wage demands made for 
the 2014 pay round (5.5% in both the chemical industry and the printing industry) are in keep-
ing with this picture. Wage growth of 3.1% is 
also expected in 2015, revealing an underlying 
trend of moderate acceleration in negotiated 
wages.
While wage drift is likely to have been negative 
this year, due in part to somewhat smaller 
bonus payments, it is expected to be neutral on 
a monthly basis in 2014 and 2015. Various 
 effects are likely to balance each other out. On 
an hourly basis, wage drift is likely to be nega-tive again next year, but then move into neutral territory.
A reduction in employers’ contributions to the 
statutory pension insurance scheme, which 
was assumed on the basis of the current legal 
situation, would lower growth in compensa -
tion per employee to 2.8% in 2014. Without 
the contribution rate cut, labour costs would 
be expected to rise by 3.1%, as in 2015. Raising 
the long- term care contribution rate as envis -
aged in the coalition agreement would result in 
a slightly sharper increase in labour costs in 
2015. The introduction of a general minimum 
wage of €8.50 on 1 January 2015 would prob-
ably have a fairly small impact on aggregate 
wage costs to begin with, because transitional 
rules are to apply at first. These rules stipulate 
that sector- specific minimum wages and nego-
tiated rates of pay that are below this level 
must only be replaced by the statutory min -
imum wage as of 1 January 2017.
If the macroeconomic distribution relationships 
remained unchanged and there were a 1% rise in trend productivity, an increase in wage costs of around 3% would result in a domestic infla-
tion rate of around 2%. Actual productivity growth having fallen significantly short of the 
longer- term trend in recent years, during the 
projection period, a certain catch-  up effect is 
expected to slow the rise in unit labour costs despite the acceleration in wage growth. As
-
suming that the wage share continues to sta -
bilise at a level that – although higher than dur -
ing the economic boom in 2006 and 2007 – is 
depressed from a long- term perspective, dur -
ing the forecast period, the price for domestic value added would tend towards an increase of close to 2% pa, but might potentially not quite 
reach this level in 2015 either. The dispropor -
tionate increase in the GDP deflator in the cur -
rent year can be attributed to a temporary Neutral wage

6 After this projection was completed, it was announced 
on 5 December 2013 that the wage bargainers in Baden- 
Württemberg had reached an agreement for the retail sec-
tor that could be the forerunner for similar agreements throughout Germany. The agreement envisages a wage increase of 3%, backdated to 1 July 2013, and a further 2.1% rise from 1 April 2014. A larger share of the rise in 
wages could therefore be recorded for 2013 than assumed in the projection.Deutsche Bundesbank

widening of margins resulting from the surpris-
ingly strong improvement in the terms of trade.
Generally subdued price developments and a gradually strengthening internal component 
have helped to shape the consumer price infla-tion forecast. Wage growth is primarily fuelling the price of services, while the accelerating in-
crease in income is pushing up housing rents. 
Growing domestic distribution costs are also likely to affect the prices of industrial goods 
and food. In the short term, at least, this will be countered by the fact that the price of fruit and 
vegetables has risen very strongly this year 
owing to unfavourable weather conditions and 
the expected correction should slow the in -
crease in food prices next year. In terms of the 
prices of industrial goods, the fairly significant 
appreciation of the euro and the depressed 
price trend caused by subdued global industrial 
activity should initially have an impact at the upstream stages of the economy. Excluding  energy, HICP inflation is therefore likely to in
-
crease gradually from 1.6% in 2013 to 1.5% in 
2014 and 1.9% in 2015. However, it should be borne in mind that German annual HICP infla-
tion for 2013 is biased upwards due to chain-  
linking problems in the accommodation ser -
vices sub- index in particular.7 Without this 
 effect, the increase in inflation in the forecast 
would appear much more pronounced. On the 
other hand, it should be remembered that the 
abolishment of the surgery visit charge has 
 reduced the 2013 growth rate and this should 
also be seen as a special factor.
The forecast for the energy component of the 
HICP is primarily determined on the basis of 
 assumptions regarding crude oil prices and 
 exchange rates. These indicate a slight down -
ward movement in the price of transport fuels 
and heating oil. With regard to electricity, 
cheaper purchase prices appear to largely com-
pensate for additional expenses caused by 
higher contribution charges for energy from  renewable sources. Consumer prices for gas 
and heat energy are likely to move sideways at 
first, potentially following heating fuel prices later. If the conditional assumptions prove to 
be accurate, energy prices should fall slightly by 
0.3% in 2014 and 1.2% in 2015.
Under these conditions, HICP inflation for Ger -
man consumers would amount to 1.6% in 
2013, 1.3% in 2014 and 1.5% in 2015. Despite 
the rather subdued price trend in Germany, 
these figures would be considerably higher 
than the average rate of inflation in other euro- area countries, at least towards the end of the forecast period.
Public finances
General government looks set to record an -
other broadly balanced budget this year (2012: 
surplus of 0.1% of GDP). On the one hand, 
owing to the economic slowdown in the fourth 
quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013, 
the cyclical impact, which was still distinctly 
positive in 2012, is expected to decline.8 On the 
other, the temporary burdens created last year 
by the resolution of WestLB have been lifted and there are signs of a slight structural im
-
provement in the budget. The general govern-ment budget is likely to be broadly balanced in 
2013 in structural terms as well. The improve -
ment on the previous year is due, amongst other factors, to further moderate develop
-
ments in pension expenditure, the fall in inter -
est expenditure and fiscal drag.9 This more than 
compensates for any budgetary burdens, not -
ably the lowering of the pension contribution 
rate.Consumer prices

The debt ratio is still high (81.0% at the end of 
2012), but looks set to decline perceptibly this year. The downward trend due to nominal GDP growth in the denominator, given the now only 
relatively limited deficits posted by central, 
state and local government, is being intensified 
by the ongoing portfolio reduction at government- owned bad banks. By contrast, 
this trend is being slowed by the capital injec-
tions – which increase gross debt – to the ESM 
and the EFSF assistance loans10 as part of the 
measures to stabilise the euro area.
No major budget movements are forecast for 
2014 or 2015 either, leaving aside the new co-
alition agreement, which was not yet known 
when the forecast was finalised. By 2015, there 
could be a slight gradual improvement in the 
fiscal balance and a surplus of just under ½% 
of GDP could be achieved. This will be due pri-
marily to the recovery in economic activity. In 
particular, the rule- based reduction of the con-
tribution rate to the statutory pension insur -
ance scheme as assumed in the forecast for 
2014 will have a negative impact in structural 
terms. However, this may be outweighed by 
 alleviating factors such as the further decline in 
interest expenditure and fiscal drag. Despite 
the slight improvement, the general govern -
ment budget would therefore remain virtually 
balanced in structural terms. According to 
available information, the coalition agreement 
will only result in relatively limited budgetary burdens by 2015, especially if the pension in
-
surance contribution rate is not lowered, in 
contrast to our current assumption.
The developments in the general government 
budget reflect a noticeable improvement in the budgets of central, state and local government, 
but this improvement is accompanied by a 
 deterioration in the social security funds. Cen -
tral and state governments need to prepare to 
comply with the long- term budget ceilings im-
posed by the national debt brake, which in principle require balanced budgets for central government from 2016 and for state govern
-
ments from 2020. There is likely to be stronger growth in social security spending, not least because various relief factors from previous years no longer apply (eg moderating factors 
regarding pension adjustments, savings in the 
area of active labour market policy). Significant deficits are to be expected in the statutory pen-sion insurance scheme, in particular.
In the scenario presented here, the debt ratio 
will decrease more rapidly over the next few 
years. This reflects the improvements in the fis-cal positions of central, state and local govern-ment as well as stronger nominal GDP growth. 
In addition, it is assumed that the debt-  
increasing impact of the euro- area stabilisation 
measures will no longer be felt by 2015. How-
ever, the debt ratio would still be significantly 
higher than 70% in 2015.
Risk assessment
The risks to the forecast in the real economy 
are to be seen, first, in the external setting. The 
effects of the euro- area crisis have been con -
tained and extensive reforms have been initi -
ated in some crisis countries in order to en -
hance the functioning of the labour and goods 
markets and improve public finances. Steps have been taken at European level to better 
adapt the institutional framework to the chal -
lenges created by monetary union. Neverthe -
less, the burdensome debt and the structural 
problems that continue to exist in a number of 
non- euro- area countries, too, mean that the 
European and global economies will remain 
highly vulnerable for some time to come. The 
lesson learned is that economic downturns in

the coalition agreement, such as a generous 
general minimum wage or measures to slow 
rent price increases, have the potential to im -
pair the efficiency of the labour and goods 
markets. The agreed fiscal policy measures will 
probably relax the fiscal stance, although the 
impact on the general government deficit dur -
ing the forecast period could be rather limited. 
Labour costs may end up slightly higher than 
assumed in this forecast due to the coalition agreement. Although the various economic and fiscal policy measures could strengthen  aggregate demand in the short term, the an
-
ticipation of longer- term adverse side- effects 
may have the opposite effect.
The fact that the underlying pace of growth in 
Germany might be stronger than described 
here is to be seen as a cyclical opportunity. This 
is indicated, for example, by the  latest results of 
the Ifo Institute’s business surveys and the 
GfK’s index of consumer confidence. First, this may be the result of the unusually low interest 
rate and the particularly favourable financing conditions, although it is difficult to estimate their overall impact on economic growth. Second, export opportunities may be better than assumed in this projection, especially if global investment activity were to receive an 
additional boost.
Although growth expectations for the emer -
ging market economies have been lowered compared to the June forecast, the question 
remains as to whether the still fairly high rates 
of expansion for the global economy are con-
sistent with the marked downward movement 
in crude oil prices derived technically from  futures prices, which is taken into account in 
the inflation forecast. Should the hoped-  for 
global growth therefore be achieved, it appears likely that prices will increase more sharply than 
calculated here. Stronger underlying growth 
dynamics in Germany would also be reflected 
in sharper price increases, especially towards 
the end of the projection period. The introduc-
tion of a general minimum wage could also 
lead to higher inflation.Domestic risks

Outlook for European retail payments
The creation of a Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) has been on the European Union’s policy 
agenda since back in 2000. The objective was to increase competition and efficiency in this mar-
ket by introducing uniform procedures and standards for the settlement of euro- denominated 
payments throughout Europe. The changeover from national credit transfers and direct debits to 
a common set of European payment instruments on 1 February 2014, as stipulated by the Euro-
pean legislator, is now close to becoming reality. Given that the changeover date is just a few 
weeks away, the still- low take- up rate of SEPA instruments in Germany is worrying. It is now cru-
cial for users to set about switching to SEPA with the utmost urgency. Yet the imminent transition to SEPA credit transfers and SEPA direct debits is just one of the milestones on the road towards creating a single European market for cashless payments. For one thing, a wide range of excep-tions for national solutions will remain in place until 1 February 2016. For another, there is more to cashless payments than just credit transfers and direct debits. Other instruments include pay-ment cards and, more notably, payment methods which can be used online or via mobile tele-phone, some of which tend to evolve more within national systems than in a European context. Adapting the statutory framework for retail payments and creating a stronger institutional plat -
form for dialogue between market participants will take these changes into account. Suitably 
observing security concerns while simultaneously making steady improvements to the efficiency of European retail payments should be the goal here.Deutsche Bundesbank

SEPA credit transfers and 
SEPA direct debits – new standards for Europe
Credit transfers and direct debits are the two 
traditional cashless payment instruments, alongside card payments. The credit transfer 
and direct debit schemes currently in use across 
the euro area are to be largely phased out on 
1 February 2014 and replaced by the corres -
ponding SEPA payment schemes in accordance 
with Regulation (EU) No 260/ 2012 (the “SEPA 
migration end- date Regulation”).1 In Germany, 
this means that the DTA (exchange of data 
media) format, which has been the techno -
logical platform used for German payments 
since 1976, will be discontinued. The German 
SEPA Council, which is chaired jointly by the 
Bundesbank and the German Federal Ministry 
of Finance and whose members include top-  
level representatives of both providers and 
users in the German payments market, was es-
tablished to support the launch of the Single 
Euro Payments Area in Germany.
The departure from the national legacy pay -
ment schemes and the narrow migration win -
dow present payment service providers (PSPs) 
and their institutional customers with chal -
lenges that should not be underestimated. 
Businesses, public authorities and associations 
will have to invest a great deal of time and ef-
fort to make their payment processes SEPA-  
compliant, notably so regarding migration to 
the SEPA direct debit schemes. Private custom-
ers, meanwhile, can look forward to quite a 
smooth changeover. Their main concern in the 
medium term will be getting into the habit of 
using the international bank account number 
(IBAN) rather than the customary account iden-
tifiers (account number and bank sort code).
With the weeks counting down to the statu -
tory end- date on 1 February 2014, the current 
SEPA take- up rate is worrying. SEPA credit 
transfers still account for a very small percent-
age of all the credit transfers initiated in Ger -
many, at 20.93% in October 2013. Not only are take- up rates in many other euro- area coun -
tries already significantly higher than in Ger -
many, they have recently increased at a much 
more dynamic pace as well. In the euro area, 
credit transfers account for a market share of 
36%2 of the transaction volume in Germany, 
and are also an important payment instrument 
in France (18%), the Netherlands (10%) and 
Italy (7%).
The number of creditor identifiers (creditor IDs) 
that have been issued (1,228,777 as at 10 De-
cember 2013) is a useful gauge of Germany’s 
readiness for SEPA direct debits because all dir -
ect debit creditors are required to apply for one. The sharp rise in creditor ID applications observed in recent months and the growing 
number of direct debit creditors informing their customers about the transition to SEPA suggest 
that ever more direct debit creditors are pre -
pared for SEPA. But still, much remains to be 
done. SEPA direct debits as a percentage of all 
direct debit transactions in Germany were still 
extremely low in October 2013, at 3%. The situation is much the same elsewhere in the euro area. Direct debits are particularly wide
-
spread in Germany, with a market share of 47%, followed by France (19%), Spain (13%) 
and the Netherlands (7%).3
A host of German enterprises are planning to 
migrate to SEPA in the current fourth quarter of 
2013. All in all, around 25 million credit trans -
fers with a value of €227 billion and roughly 35 million direct debits worth something in the re-
gion of €52 billion need to be migrated every 
working day in Germany.

lion direct debits every working day will have to 
be effected under considerable time pressure, 
and entails substantial operational risk. Busi -
nesses which fail to become SEPA- compliant in 
good time risk exposing themselves, and their 
counterparties, to liquidity bottlenecks and 
costs owing to the incorrect or late processing 
of payments.
The advanced state of SEPA readiness in the fi-
nancial industry, responses from market partici-pants, and the growing number of market par -
ticipants informing their customers about SEPA would suggest that many enterprises are suffi-ciently prepared for SEPA. So timely completion of the transition to SEPA by the statutory dead-line of 1 February 2014 is still a likely scenario. 
However, Germany will see all the payments 
being switched over within a very narrow mi -
gration window, which could harbour the risk 
of increased disruptions in payment processing. 
Macroeconomic risk is a somewhat unlikely 
prospect as things stand, though, because the technical option of converting payment for -
mats from DTA to SEPA also serves as a fall-  
back solution.
Providers and users of credit transfers and dir -
ect debits are not the only ones who will see a big difference when SEPA is rolled out; the new payment standards will also have an impact on 
the market for retail payments processing be -
tween banks. Settlement procedures and sys -
tems will need to be brought into line with the 
organisational and technological requirements 
of the SEPA schemes. Some of these adjust -
ments were already in place when the respect-ive schemes went live (SEPA credit transfers on 
28 January 2008; SEPA direct debits on 1 No -
vember 2009). The clearing system run by the 
Bundesbank, the Retail Payment System (RPS), 
incorporated SEPA payment processing into its 
range of services early on. Once retail pay -
ments have been harmonised across Europe in 
February 2014, international clearing houses 
will also find it easier to serve the German mar -… but not

ket, which will probably contribute to more in-
tense competition in the settlement landscape.
Traditionally, only a small share of domestic re-
tail payments in Germany are processed via 
clearing houses, however. While it is true that 
almost 12 million payments are settled in the 
Bundesbank’s RPS every working day, the bulk 
– roughly 85% – are processed purely on a bi-
lateral basis or within the respective internal 
networks of the cooperative and savings bank 
sectors. Some of the payments settled bilat -
erally appear to be shifting to clearing houses, at least initially.
Even after the SEPA credit transfer and direct 
debit schemes have become the new standards on 1 February 2014, it will still not be possible 
to shut down the processing infrastructures previously used under the corresponding na
-
tional payment schemes on that date because 
some payments outside the scope of the SEPA migration end- date Regulation can continue to 
be processed under the legacy schemes for a transitional period. In Germany, these include cheque and card payments, and direct debits under the German electronic direct debit 
scheme (Elektronisches Lastschriftverfahren, or ELV), which can be used until 1 February 2016; this is because Germany elected to make use of 
a Member State option. The legacy and new infrastructures will therefore need to be run 
side by side until February 2016. The technical 
prerequisites for the SEPA-  compliant further 
 development of the ELV are essentially in place. 
But it is up to market participants to design and 
implement an appropriate scheme. The Bun -
desbank and the German Banking Industry Committee (Deutsche Kreditwirtschaft)
4 are 
working on developing SEPA- compliant alter -
natives for card and cheque transactions. While 
card payments are growing in importance in Germany, with a market share of 17.5%, 
cheques, at 0.2%, play no more than an insig-
nificant role. Once cheque and card payment processing has been migrated to SEPA, the 
Bundesbank’s RPS, which is based on the leg -
acy national standard, is to be shut down on 
1 February 2016.
Temporary derogations

make use of additional transitional Member 
State options until 1 February 2016 in order to 
make allowances for the temporary continued 
use of certain national procedures and to grant 
sufficient time for necessary adjustment pro -
cesses. National legislators decide whether or 
not to take up the individual options.
For instance, Article 16 (1) of the SEPA migra -
tion end- date Regulation allows payment ser -
vice providers (PSPs) to accept from consumers, 
until 1  February 2016, the national account 
identifiers (BBAN) – the account number and bank sort code in Germany  – for domestic 
credit transfers and to convert these data, se -
curely and free of charge, into IBAN and BIC. In 
addition, Article 16 (3) of the Regulation en -
ables national niche products, that is, instru -
ments with a market share of less than 10%, in the field of credit transfers and direct debits to 
be exempted from the requirements of the 
Regulation until 1 February 2016. Article 16 (5) 
of the SEPA migration end- date Regulation, 
meanwhile, allows the mandatory use of the SEPA message formats
5 based on the ISO 
20022 XML standard at the customer- bank 
interface to be delayed until 1 February 2016. 
Finally, Article 16 (6) of the SEPA migration end- date Regulation gives PSPs the right to require their customers to state both the IBAN and the BIC for national SEPA credit transfers and direct debits up until 1 February 2016.
In order to make the transition to SEPA as 
smooth as possible for consumers, the German 
legislator has made corresponding amend -
ments to the Payment Services Oversight Act 
(Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz) by way of the 
SEPA Accompanying Act (SEPA- Begleitgesetz) 
so as to make use of the Member State options 
offered under Article 16 (1) and (4) of the SEPA 
migration end- date Regulation.
The European Payments Council (EPC) has 
stipulated that SEPA data formats are manda -
tory for interbank payments, but has so far only 
issued a recommendation for data formats at 
the customer- bank interface.As a consequence, a host of specifications have 
been developed for the SEPA schemes at the 
customer- bank interface, which means that a 
uniform data structure currently does not exist 
for customer orders in the Single Euro Pay -
ments Area. This has been criticised, not with-out good reason, by users who have to support 
different versions of the standard for different 
PSPs.
The EPC’s recommendation is not being fol -
lowed to the letter in Germany, either. The 
GBIC may have implemented the EPC’s stand-
ards word for word in its data format specifica-
tions, but the supplementary rules for complet-
ing fields, which are designed to enhance data 
quality, constrain these rules.
Besides the introduction of uniform specifica -
tions for customer- bank data formats across 
the Single Euro Payments Area, further har -
monisation steps are desirable as they could potentially give rise to additional efficiency 
gains. These include rolling out a common set 
of communication and security standards for 
the transmission of payment data files to PSPs to replace the inconsistent procedures and so-
lutions currently used by PSPs across Europe. 
The establishment of EBICS Société coopérative 
à responsabilité limitée (SCRL), an enterprise 
jointly run by the GBIC and the French CFONB 
(Comité Française d’Organisation et de Nor -
malisation Bancaires) to advance and maintain 
the EBICS standard,6 which is available to all 
countries as an open standard, represents the 
first step towards achieving greater harmonisa-tion in this field.

and differentiate the payment services they 
offer. These additional services, which are sub-
ject to an EPC licence, can be tailored to suit 
the requirements of specific user groups. PSPs 
may offer such services at their discretion, and 
they are essentially encouraged to do so be -
cause they enhance the efficiency of the SEPA 
schemes.
Additional services might, however, lead to na-
tional solutions becoming entrenched because traditionally, user requirements tend to be simi-
lar within national borders, and domestic pro -
cessing workflows between PSPs are often bet-
ter attuned to each other than those at the European level. As a case in point, PSPs in Ger -
many, Austria and Spain offer what is known as the “COR1 option” for SEPA Core direct debits, which allows the time cycle – that is, the lead time for presenting a direct debit to the paying agent ahead of the due date – to be shortened 
to one business day. The benefit for users is 
that liquidity is available sooner than under the 
SEPA Core Direct Debit Scheme, where the 
time cycles are five business days for initial and one- off direct debits, and two business days for 
subsequent direct debits. As things stand, bilat-
eral agreements are needed between PSPs in

border COR1 direct debits; settlement through-
out Europe is still not possible.
The Eurosystem is very anxious to prevent the 
further development of the market from nur -
turing insular national solutions, which would 
go against the basic principle of SEPA, which is to create a single internal market for payments 
based on common standards and highly effi -
cient processes. Bearing this objective in mind, 
national additional services can, at best, only 
be interim solutions for services offered across Europe within the Single Euro Payments Area.
Changed framework 
 conditions in European 
 retail payments
Not only do retail payments have to be brought 
into line with a common set of European stand-ards, the institutional framework likewise needs 
to be overhauled in order to incorporate in -
novative developments in the field of payments 
brought about by the now- ubiquitous use of 
the internet.
To revise the current Payment Service Directive 
(PSD), the European Commission, on 24  July 
2013, presented a proposal for the “Directive 
on payment services in the internal market and 
amending Directives 2002/ 65/EC, 2013/ 36/EU 
and 2009/ 110/EC and repealing Directive 2007/ 
64/EC”, otherwise known as the Payment Ser -
vice Directive II (PSD II). This new regime is de -
signed to reflect technological advances in internet and mobile payment schemes. The Commission proposes that payment initiation 
services and account information services inter 
alia be added to the list of payment services, 
and that providers of such services be brought under the scope of the Directive and be super -
vised. The new service providers should be sub-
ject to the same rights and obligations (eg re -
garding data protection and liability) as the existing payment institutions. The Commis
-
sion’s proposal also suggests that account-  
carrying payment service providers should be obliged to grant these competitors access to 
their payment accounts.
To offer enhanced protection for consumers, 
the maximum amount a payment user could be obliged to pay in case of an unauthorised pay-
ment transaction should be lowered from the 
current amount of €150 to €50, except in cases 
of fraud or gross negligence on the part of the 
payment user.
The conditional right to a refund under the PSD 
is to essentially be made unconditional, as has 
already been agreed in the SEPA schemes. 
However, according to the Commission’s pro -
posal, this unconditional right to a refund would be ruled out if the purchased good or service has already been consumed or used. This clause restricting the right to a refund 
should be viewed in an extremely critical light 
because the highly automated nature of bulk 
retail payments makes it almost impossible to 
establish a link to the underlying transaction. 
What is more, it is precisely the unconditional 
right to a refund within a certain period of time 
which has made the direct debit scheme in Germany, and thus the SEPA Direct Debit Scheme as well, such a popular payment in
-
strument. This is crucial to the success of the SEPA direct debit. Alongside its proposal re
-
garding PSD II, on 24 July 2013 the Commission 
also presented a proposal for a Regulation on 
Multilateral Interchange Fees (MIFs) for card-  
based transactions. The proposal promotes the idea of a single European regulatory system for interbank fees arising from card usage, both at 
the national level and for cross- border pay -
ments. MIFs constitute charges agreed be -
tween the merchant’s bank (acquirer) and the 
card- issuing bank. The merchant’s bank trans -
fers this fee to the merchant who in turn either passes it on directly to the customer or factors 
it into his own price calculations. At present, there are considerable differences in the fees 
charged for credit or debit card use within the euro area.… and should 
therefore evolve into trans- European solu-tions over the medium term

lators  planning

eral interchange fees …Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report 
December 2013

The proposal to regulate MIFs envisages a cap 
of 0.2% of the transaction value for debit cards 
and 0.3% for credit cards. Depending on whether the payment is domestic or cross-  
border in nature, the rules should take effect 
either two months or two years after the Dir -
ective enters into force. In the event that the Commission’s proposal becomes legally bind
-
ing, statutory provisions regarding the upper 
limit of MIFs for card payment transactions 
would be stipulated.
The proposal also envisages provisions relating 
to common business practices in card- based 
transactions. It is currently standard practice for 
the card- issuing bank to decide which card 
schemes can be mentioned on a single card (eg 
girocard, formerly referred to as EC card, 
coupled with Maestro or V  PAY) and which card scheme is the most commonly used. In 
Germany, girocard is the most frequently used 
payment card for domestic transactions while 
international card schemes are preferred for 
cross- border purchases. In its Directive, the EU 
Commission now advocates that the card -
holder be given the opportunity to decide for 
himself which of the card schemes specified on his card he would like to use to pay for a given 
purchase. It also proposes discontinuing the 
hitherto standard practice under which a mer -
chant is automatically obliged to accept all the 
products belonging to a given card scheme if 
he accepts one of those products.
The draft version of the Payment Services Dir -
ective II as well as the draft Regulation on inter -
change fees for card payment transactions 
have yet to be adopted by the European Parlia-
ment and the Council of the European Union. 
The legislative process is not expected to come 
to a close until sometime during the next legis-
lative period of the European Parliament, which 
begins in September 2014.
In addition, the EU Commission presented a proposal for a further Directive designed to strengthen consumer rights in terms of their access to and use of payment accounts. The proposal seeks to render payment account fees 
more transparent and more easily comparable 
for EU consumers. Moreover, it favours manda-tory services for changing accounts that would 
make it simpler for consumers to switch from 
one provider to another within the EU. Ultim -
ately, the rationale is that all EU consumers should be able to open a payment account 
with basic functions irrespective of their finan-
cial situation (and of their place of domicile in 
the EU).
Besides efficiency, greater importance is being 
attached to retail payment security. This is par -
ticularly true given the technological progress occurring in this field. The ongoing develop
-
ment of harmonised European minimum stand-ards to increase retail payment security are part of this development, as mirrored by the efforts of the SecuRe Pay Forum (Forum on the Secur -
ity of Retail Payments) which was set up in 
2011. These efforts take the form of a voluntary 
joining of forces by banking supervisors and 
payment systems overseers from across Europe 
with the additional involvement of observers 
from Europol and the EU Commission. In Janu-ary 2013, subsequent to a public consultation, 
SecuRe Pay Forum published its “Recommen -
dations for the security of internet payments” 
(focusing in particular on credit transfers, card 
payments and e- money transfers), which are

panding the underlying payment infrastructure 
necessitate large- scale investment which, in the 
case of retail payments, has hitherto been 
largely financed by private sector participants, 
in particular by the banking industry. This sec -
tor’s active involvement is of pivotal import -
ance in achieving future progress in payment 
instruments and infrastructures. As part of the 
ongoing regulatory efforts it is essential to en-
sure that European retail payment operations 
continue to be enhanced, primarily on the basis 
of market- driven action. Here, however, it is 
necessary to involve payment service users in 
an appropriate manner when setting the course 
for the future.
To date, no decision has been made as to how 
to approach the further strategic development of SEPA and who should be responsible for this task. In tandem with the SEPA roll- out and as a 
strategic benchmark for retail payments in the 
EU, in 2010 the ECB and the EU Commission 
set up the SEPA Council which accommodates representatives from both the user side and the supplier side at EU level plus a number of Euro-system observers and is chaired by the ECB and 
the EU Commission. Up to now, the SEPA 
Council has not delivered on its promise to de-velop strategic intents for European retail pay-ment transactions, which is why it is soon to be 
replaced by a Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB) set up for this purpose and chaired by 
the ECB. The EU Commission will only have ob-server status. In designing this new body, three aspects have to be taken into account. First, it 
needs to be able to operate efficiently. To this 
end, the number of participants must be re -
stricted and/or operational subgroups should 
be tasked with presenting proposals as a basis for making decisions. Second, all the parties in-
volved have to be willing to provide sufficient 
resources to enable them to work effectively 
with this body and to lobby for acceptance of 
its decisions among relevant member associ -
ations. Third, it must be firmly rooted at the national level as the task of physically imple
-
menting the strategic requirements set by Brus-
sels has in the past mainly fallen to actors at the national level, which will presumably re -
main the case in the future as well.
Leaving the territory of 
 classic instruments: card, 
 online and mobile payments
Having successfully introduced pan- European 
standards for credit transfers and direct debits, 
the Eurosystem is now pressing ahead with es-tablishing an integrated single market for card 
payments. Unlike credit transfers and direct 
debits, however, this area is marked by a lack 
of uniform European technological standards. 
Up to now, efforts have been limited to guide-lines and calls for action in pursuing the path to “SEPA for cards”, such as the requirements per -
taining to European card systems contained in the ECB’s sixth SEPA Progress Report.
7
Given that the cards market entails more actors 
and interfaces and is thus more complex than 
the market for credit transfers or direct debits, 
the Eurosystem is focused on fostering a market- driven integration of the European 
cards market by standardising the three key 
technical interfaces which exist in the card pay-ments domain. In the absence of a holistic ap-proach, in some cases multiple standardisation 
initiatives are giving rise to competing specifi -
cations for the various individual interfaces.
The first relevant interface is between the cus-
tomer and the terminal.8 Here, the communi -
cation between the chip embedded in the card 
and the merchant’s terminal are of pivotal im-
portance. The second interface lies between the terminal and the merchant’s bank (ac

which can read the chip in the customer’s card and sets the payment process in motion.

cation chain is located between the acquirer 
and the card- issuing bank (issuer), in other 
words the customer’s bank. This is especially 
important from a German perspective because 
Germany’s card transactions environment achieves high levels of efficiency in terms of 
interbank settlement thanks to its shared use of 
the infrastructures in place for credit transfers 
and direct debits. The goal should therefore be 
to use the ISO 20022 format that is also ap -
plied for SEPA, as envisaged, for instance, by 
the Berlin Group’s standardisation initiative.
In this context, the Eurosystem is promoting a 
far- reaching standardisation manifesto with an 
emphasis on open and free standards. Only then will it be possible to accomplish system interoperability throughout Europe as the ul
-
timate basis for allowing any payment card to 
be used at any terminal within the EU.
In recent years, the turnover generated by on-
line shopping in Germany has gone up by an 
annual average of more than 10%.10 In con -
trast to purchases made in a regular store, with 
online shopping there is often a time lag be -
tween the payment being made and receipt of 
the item. Sellers generally prefer not to dis -
patch the goods until they are certain that pay-
ment has been effected by the purchaser or 
have a guarantee that this will occur. The cus-tomer, on the other hand, wishes to avoid the 
risk inherent in advance payment of having to 
“chase after” his money should the goods not be delivered. This innate tension between both 
sides of the market is the backdrop against 
which online payment methods must operate. 
For a long time, online shopping was domin -
ated by classic payment methods such as the credit transfer, purchase on account or pay
-
ment by credit card, all of which are still widely 
used. Specialised online payment instruments, 
such as PayPal or Germany’s “SOFORT Über -Online shopping

weisung” scheme are gaining a stronger foot-
hold, however.11
The bulk of new providers offering online pay-
ment methods, more and more of which are 
non- banks competing with the traditional 
actors involved in payment transactions, offer 
customers no more than an alternative channel 
for accessing the classic payment instruments 
which already exist. For the most part, the new online payment methods consist in unambigu-ously identifying the customer, say on the basis of that person’s e- mail address or password so 
as to then carry out a credit transfer, direct 
debit or payment by card “in the background”, as is the case with PayPal, Amazon Payments or 
ClickandBuy. It is further notable that a grow -
ing number of online merchants now offer 
their own procedures for this purpose, many of 
which can be used for purchases from other 
online shops. This has the advantage for users – and thus also for the online shop – that they 
are not obliged to register afresh and make 
their payment details known to yet more mer -
chants.
New PSPs penetrating the market are faced with a changing market structure in terms of 
how online shopping operates. For one thing, 
increasing use is being made of mobile devices as a means of initiating a purchase; this can be 
attributed to the proliferation of smartphones 
and tablet computers. For another, it is possible to discern an ever- greater overlap between on-
line shopping and over- the- counter (OTC) pur -
chases. This development has likewise been 
made possible by the widespread availability of 
mobile devices which can also be used as 
points- of- sale (see the box on mobile points of 
sale on page 38).
Large PSPs closely involved in online shopping 
have launched pilot schemes as a way of also 
gaining a foothold in the OTC business. To this end they offer services which allow payment to be made at the POS by scanning a QR code;
12 
payment is then effected using the PSP’s pro -
cessing system and the relevant amount credited to the OTC retailer. The benefits 
offered by the QR code technology are its high 
level of flexibility in terms of displaying codes, 
for example on a purchase receipt, the cash register display or payment terminal and the 
widespread incorporation of cameras in mobile phones that are able to read the codes. Never -
theless, QR codes also harbour a number of fundamental security risks. As no QR code-  
specific security certificates are currently avail -
able, when scanning a code the user may be 
directed to a website that is contaminated with 
malware or automatically activate the down -
load and installation of a malicious programme. 
The risk of being exposed to such misuse is es-
pecially high if the user scans QR codes in a 
public space (eg from a billboard). QR code 
technology is just one example of the various 
initiatives through which internet-  based PSPs 
are attempting to make headway in the OTC 
sector.
That said, a parallel development is also under -
way in the opposite direction. While in the past 
it was only possible to use cash to settle in -
voices arising from cash on delivery (COD) pur -
chases, new payment services are emerging 
that offer additional options for paying with 
cash when shopping online. COD is a relatively 
expensive way to make payment and the cus -
tomer is obliged to hold the relevant amount at the ready when an item is delivered. Moreover, 
it is awkward to pay for services using this 
method of payment. Under the new payment 
schemes described above, upon completing an online purchase the buyer prints out a barcode 
or receives this information (as an on- screen 
image) on his or her smartphone. He or she 
then shows the code to an OTC merchant par -

ate final payment using that merchant’s POS 
system, be it by cash, debit or credit card.
Although these new schemes have introduced 
an additional tool for the cash payment of 
internet purchases, cashless payment instru -
ments have steadily gained in importance for 
OTC business in the retail sector, with a particu-lar preference for debit and credit cards.
13 This 
trend is evidenced by the contactless technol -
ogy NFC,14 which is mainly intended as an al -
ternative for small payments which are pre -
dominantly settled using cash. To pay by con -
tactless card, it is merely necessary to hold this card in front of a sensor at a suitably equipped POS terminal. For amounts up to €25, there is no need to enter a PIN. Credit card companies 
are already issuing more and more cards fea -
turing the relevant chip, while the Savings 
Banks Finance Group has been conducting an 
NFC pilot project known as “girogo” since 
2012. As yet it is still unclear whether the Ger -
man banking industry will equip all its girocards with a corresponding chip. Contactless cards 
could represent an interim step on the road to payment by mobile phone.
Electronic wallets (e- wallets) embedded in mo-
bile phones enable the user to virtually store 
not just payment cards but also admission tickets to events, rail tickets or vouchers, to name a few examples. However, most of the 
pilot projects currently underway in the market 
relate to “closed systems”. In other words, 
each e- wallet is provided by just a single pro -
vider and can only be used within limited par -
ameters. This aspect deters potential users 
from setting up such a wallet. Open standards 
could be helpful in this regard. A range of ini-
tiatives jointly orchestrated by the banking in -
dustry, the retail trade and mobile phone oper -Contactless 
card payment schemes have yet to catch on …… and e- wallets are still in their infancy Accepting card payments by smartphone: mobile point of sale (mPOS)
A new app and card reader service for card 
payments called “Square” was introduced 
in the United States in 2009. The data on a 
payment card’s magnetic stripe can be read 
by swiping the card through an adapter which plugs into the audio jack of a sup-ported smartphone. Payment is initiated 
once the card holder has signed on the dis-play.
In Europe, similar systems were launched by 
other service providers in 2010, at fi  rst 
 employing the magnetic stripe readers in common use in the United States. At the beginning of 2010, however, the require-ment that was adopted by the EPC to  migrate to payment cards with a chip for 
new terminals entered into force.
In line with this, pure chip readers as well as 
chip readers with a PIN pad were intro-duced in Europe. With some of these de-
vices, it was possible to make a contactless 
connection with a smartphone. Security 
concerns do exist, however, about systems 
that require inputting a PIN on a smart-
phone.
Unlike traditional card terminals, mobile 
points of sale (mPOS) are characterised by 
simple price models and, in many cases, 
straightforward online registration for mer-
chants. The target group therefore consists 
mainly of small retailers and tradespeople who previously did not accept card pay-ments. In contrast to customary POS ter-
minals, no monthly fi  xed costs are incurred 
and commissions, which were uniformly 2.75% to begin with, now sometimes  approach the amounts charged in the 
 established POS market.

ators have been pursuing this approach since 
2011 in France, and more recently also in Aus-
tria.
Outlook
Following many decades of only limited mo -
mentum, the creation of a single payments 
market together with fast- paced change in the 
field of communications technology have been 
setting a new course for the future of pay -
ments. In particular, the increasing prevalence 
of internet- based services in everyday life gives 
new PSPs access to some interesting areas of business. This is leading to a restructuring of 
the range of payment- related services on offer, 
accompanied by greater challenges for market participants and regulators alike. Thus far, pay-ment services have almost exclusively been pro-vided by credit institutions; now, however, new providers have taken the stage that are leaving 
their mark through innovative solutions al -
though their market share is in many cases still 
negligible. By contrast, the banking industry 
enjoys the bonus of customer trust and, thanks to the services it has introduced, arguably finds 
itself in a relatively better starting position in terms of its ability to launch innovative prod -
ucts onto the market.
From a regulatory perspective, attention must 
remain focused on achieving the right balance 
between opening up the market and promot -
ing competition on the one hand and ensuring 
secure payment transactions on the other. 
There is a risk that the associated regulations 
will become increasingly complex and more and more time will be needed to review the process. This would engender market uncer
-
tainty and in turn greatly impede the develop-ment and progress of new innovative products 
in the European payments arena. This could 
then result in a situation where providers con-
centrated on the European market would lose 
out against their international rivals on account 
of the fact that large multinational enterprises 
are already well- established in many European 
markets, not just in the field of card payments but also in the online payment services sector. With this in mind, caution should prevail when pushing ahead with efforts to harmonise rules 
across Europe, the overall aim being to offer 
actors a stable and efficient framework within 
which they can operate.Deutsche Bundesbank

German enterprises‘ profitability and 
financing in 2012
The temporary slowdown in economic activity in 2012 meant that commercial enterprises saw 
only marginal growth in sales. Nevertheless, profitability remained favourable. This was partly 
because the cost of materials rose much less sharply than in the previous two years. Moreover, 
staffing flexibility helped keep cost increases within limits despite a further rise in headcount and 
marked growth in wages. Weak demand dragged primarily on a number of industries such as 
manufacturers of basic metals, chemicals and chemical products, electrical equipment as well as machinery and equipment, whereas the automotive sector and makers of other transport equip-ment continued to perform very well. Construction enterprises benefited from the booming build-
ing demand, posting a record return on sales. The energy enterprises’ profits recovered signifi -
cantly from the slump in 2011. The dampened pace of industrial activity had very little impact on 
the services sector. Cost-  related strains were the main cause of poorer results in some sectors 
such as wholesale and retail trade or transport and storage.
Sales of goods came to a standstill in some areas towards the end of 2012, leading to a build- up 
of stocks of finished goods in most industries. By contrast, demand in many parts of the automo-
tive industry was consistently buoyant, as was borne out by persistently high stocks of intermedi-ate products. With utilisation of production capacity high, the need among car manufacturers to invest in new plant and equipment remained strong. Other sectors held back from investing given their unfavourable orders situation, although the building and energy sectors expanded capacity considerably. Moreover, the services sectors continued their steady process of capital accumula-
tion. Thus, the corporate financial statement statistics contrast somewhat with the picture, 
painted by the latest national accounts data, of a markedly weak investment trend in trade and industry in 2012.
Enterprises continued to acquire equity investments both inside and outside Germany. Increased 
intra- group lending also contributed to strengthening corporate ties. External financing picked up 
in 2012, although financing needs were down compared with the preceding years; however, 
bank loans did not play a significant role, despite the very favourable borrowing terms. Corporate equity levels rose in line with total assets. Non- financial enterprises as a whole did not continue 
the process of strengthening their capital base, which had been observed for a number of years. 
However, firms that are still undercapitalised are likely to remain committed to reducing their 
capital shortfall.Deutsche Bundesbank

Underlying trends
The temporary slowdown in German economic 
activity during the course of 2012 left its mark 
on the accounts of German non- financial en -
terprises, yet without harming their profitabil -
ity.1 Growth in sales, which in 2011 almost 
matched the strong rate of expansion recorded 
when the economy began to pull out of the 
severe recession of late 2008 and early 2009, 
slackened significantly in the year under review. At the same time, however, firms managed to 
limit cost growth to a similar extent. The an -
nual result before taxes on income in 2012 in-
creased almost as strongly as one year earlier. 
The gross return on sales as an average for all 
firms included in the Bundebank’s corporate 
 financial statement statistics was around 4½%, 
as in the previous two years. The fact that prof-
itability was not impaired in the more difficult 
cyclical environment in 2012 attests to German businesses’ extensive ability to adjust, although firms also benefited from the fact that the pur -
chase prices of intermediate goods rose only 
marginally and that the increases in personnel 
expenses induced by the wage bargaining part-ners again remained within reason.
The weaker sales growth affected all the major 
economic sectors, although the individual 
manufacturing subsectors displayed a highly variegated performance. The automotive sec
-
tor and other transport equipment held up relatively well, while major manufacturers of 
intermediate goods just matched their sales re-sult for 2011 or dipped under it. Industrial firms’ 
profitability in 2012 was unchanged on the year and was again higher than that of the other sectors. The construction industry’s re
-
turn on sales rose further, although its merely 
marginal rise in output probably indicates that it has been working at close to full capacity for 
some time now. By contrast, business was weaker in wholesale and retail trade and in 
transportation and storage; as cost pressure in-
tensified somewhat, this dented profitability. 
The profit situation of the information and 
communication sector as well as among business- related service providers in 2012 again 
markedly outperformed the average level for all 
the economic sectors considered.
The aggregated balance sheet of the non-  
financial enterprise sector did not show any 
notable shifts on the assets side. This is surpris-
ing given that the pronounced investment  restraint indicated by the latest national ac
-
counts data is not reflected in firms’ reported 
fixed investment, which shows that the volume 
invested in the procurement of new tangible 
fixed assets in 2012 was roughly on a par with 
the average for the previous two years. The as-
sociated depreciation total was concurrently 
exceeded by one- eighth.
In manufacturing and mining (including quarry-ing) the gross increase in tangible fixed assets, 
as extrapolated from the sample of financial 
statements, amounted to 5% in 2012. The Fed-
eral Statistical Office’s recently published in -
vestment survey likewise points to a marked 
rise. According to these figures, industrial and 
mining enterprises with 20 or more employees 
invested just over 3% more in tangible fixed assets than they did in 2011.
2 Based on the 
standard revision practice used in the past, the 
national accounts figures, which according to 
the latest data show a 1% drop in nominal gross fixed capital formation in the economic sectors under review in 2012, are likely to be 
adjusted accordingly.
In 2012, the acquisition of equity investments 
came close to the previous year’s level. As at the end of the balance sheet year, equity in
-
vestments accounted for 34% of the fixed assets of all non- financial enterprises, com
-
pared with only 22½% 15 years ago. This in -Corporate profit -

crease in equity investments is also a reflection 
of rising foreign activities, which are usually 
undertaken by legally autonomous entities, in-
dicating that German firms have further 
stepped up their presence in the international 
markets.
Non- financial enterprises’ equity grew at the 
same rate as total assets in 2012. The process 
of strengthening the capital base that had been 
evident for quite some time has apparently 
come to a halt (for the factors determining the 
sustainable strengthening of the capital base 
over the last decade, see the box on pages 44 
to 46). It appears that the marked structural 
improvement in German firms’ financial resili -
ence has prompted them of late to also take 
greater advantage of the exceptionally favour -
able debt financing environment. This was demonstrated in 2012 by the fact that funds raised, which were down by one- sixth overall 
versus 2011, were sourced to a somewhat 
greater extent from higher bank borrowing and 
increased bond issuance. However, growth in 
liabilities to affiliated companies was again the 
main driver of external financing. Evidently, 
there was no notable demand for external cap-ital injections. The balance sheet weight of pro-visions was  reduced further in the period under 
review. As in previous years, this was substan -
tially due to the obligation set forth in the Act 
Modernising  Accounting Law (Bilanzrechts-
modernisierungsgesetz) to offset provisions for pensions against corresponding plan assets.
The sound financing situation of trade and in -
dustry as well as the often favourable or at 
least satisfactory profit ratios across the various sectors are important factors in explaining why 
the threat of insolvency diminished further in 
2012, even though the economic environment was patchy. The corporate default rate dropped below the already very low pre- crisis level; the 
decline was especially pronounced in whole -
sale and retail trade. Given the ongoing buoy-
ancy of the construction industry, it comes as 
no surprise that the number of building firms 
filing for insolvency fell again. Corporate insolv-encies likewise dropped markedly in the trans-portation and storage sector in 2012, although they remained well above the pre- crisis level. In 
manufacturing, the number of business clos -
ures was only marginally down; the same ap -
plies to business- related service providers.
Sales and income
In 2012, non- financial enterprises’ sales failed 
to match the growth rates recorded in the pre-
vious two years (+9½% on average), rising by 
only 2½% compared with 2011. While person-
nel expenses rose at a similar rate in 2012 
to 2010 and 2011, the cost of materials went 
up only very moderately. The fact that the an-
nual result before taxes on income grew by 
7%, which was close to the 2011 growth rate, 
was also attributable to the small increase in 
depreciation and in enterprises’ other expenses. On balance, the gross return on sales remained 
at 4½% despite the distinctly less favourable 
macroeconomic environment.
The temporary dip in economic activity primar -
ily affected manufacturing. As a result, indus -
trial firms’ sales only rose by just over 1% in 
2012, compared with a double- digit increase in 
2011. One exception here was the production 
of vehicles and other transport equipment, Multi- year pro-

Capital base of non- fi  nancial enterprises in Germany 
 sustainably strengthened
According to the extrapolated results from 
the Bundesbank’s corporate fi  nancial state-
ments statistics, the non- fi  nancial corporate sector’s balance sheet equity ratio has been 
increasing continuously since 2000, rising 
by a total of 8½ percentage points to 27½% at the end of 2012. While equity more than doubled at 109% in this period, the balance 
sheet total grew by merely 43%. On bal-ance, the much lamented capital shortfall of German enterprises identifi  ed in past international comparisons of capital struc-
tures has largely been eradicated. Even dur-
ing the fi  nancial and economic crisis parts of the German corporate sector managed 
to strengthen their fi  nancial resilience.
The clearly discernible structural changes on 
the liabilities side of the annual fi  nancial 
statements are primarily the result of a 
broad- based corporate strategy to improve 
the capital base, which was accompanied by substantial earnings growth. It is likely that other factors such as the systematic  reduction of bank liabilities (deleveraging) and to some extent market exit of fi  nan-cially stressed enterprises also contributed 
to this development.
The increase in the equity ratio was a great 
deal higher for small and medium- sized en-
terprises (SMEs) at 14½ percentage points 
than for large enterprises (+4 percentage points).
1 In view of the fact that SMEs’ 
equity came to less than one- tenth of the balance sheet total in 2000, this develop-
ment can be regarded as a catching- up pro-
cess. Back then SMEs were deemed to be 
undercapitalised, whereas large enterprises 
have always had a relatively favourable cap-
ital structure by international standards  – not least as a result of accumulated re-serves, which represent long- term capital. 
The increase in the equity ratio of all enter-prises together can, to a certain extent, also be attributed to a structural effect, as large 
enterprises, which traditionally have a bet-
ter equity position, grew signifi  cantly more 
than SMEs in the period under review. If such proportional shifts are considered not only in terms of size category but also legal form, the structural effect accounts for just under one- quarter of the overall increase in the aggregated equity ratio.
In Germany, a large number of SMEs are 
 organised in the legal form of partnerships 
and sole proprietorships. Given that com-
pany owners bear liability against their pri-
vate assets and profi  ts are taxed as part of 
the income tax assessment procedure, an 
exact distinction between business and per-sonal affairs cannot be made. This systemic lack of clarity in the allocation of capital can cause assets that are used for business pur-
poses (eg as collateral for loans to enter-prises) to remain in the company owner’s private sphere. They therefore do not ap-
pear in the balance sheet of the enterprise. If this capital is merely “reassigned”, eg due 
to banks’ stricter collateral requirements, some of the fi  nancial growth is of an ac-counting nature. Therefore, the extent of the actual catching- up process of SMEs in relation to large enterprises cannot be  determined accurately against this back-
drop. However, the process is also likely to 
have been of a material  nature because comparable small and medium- sized cor-porations, to which such considerations apply to a lesser extent, considerably im-
proved their equity ratio by around 13½ per-centage points in the observation period.
In a sector comparison, the catching- up pro-
cess of SMEs with regard to equity becomes 
particularly evident. Economic sectors that are marked by a large number of such companies 
saw equity ratios in 2012 which represented 
twice or three times the fi  gures recorded in 
2000. Among the sectors with strong growth 
are, above all, the wholesale and retail trade 
(+13 percentage points) and construction 
(+9½ percentage points). By contrast, enter-
prises in the chemical industry and vehicle

manufacture, the capital structure of which is 
traditionally relatively favourable, improved 
their capital base only slightly, if at all.
The upward trend in equity was based, 
above all, on the increase in retained earn-
ings among corporations and in undistrib-
uted profi  ts among non- corporations. Al-
though the available annual accounts data 
do not permit an exact distinction between 
all the internally fi  nanced parts (based on  retained corporate earnings, in particular) 
and externally fi  nanced parts (obtained from external fi  nancing sources) of the increase in 
the formation of equity capital,2 it is never-
theless possible to establish that more than half the increase stems from internal sources and was thus generated in the sales process by the enterprises themselves.

A key motive for the structural changes in 
funding behaviour is the tightening of bank-ing regulation through the regulatory frame-
works Basel II and Basel III. At the time, en-
terprises were made aware at an early stage – mainly by their principal bankers and trade bodies but also as part of public discussion – that banks’ prescribed credit risk- based cap-
ital requirements could lead to less favour-
able fi  nancing conditions and possibly even 
problems with regard to lending, especially 
for enterprises with low equity ratios and 
limited risk- bearing capacity.4 As a result of 
the extended requirements for banks’ cap-
ital and liquidity positions through Basel III, it 
is also expected at present that even more 
emphasis will be put on the creditworthi-ness of enterprises and enterprises will therefore be advised to continue to work 
systematically on their capital structure.
In addition, changes in tax legislation fa-
vour a greater accumulation of reserves in 
the corporate sector. The 2000 business tax 
reform introduced a reduction in the cor-
porate income tax rate for corporations to a uniform 25%, doing away with unequal tax treatment of retained earnings and creating 
an incentive for greater accumulation of 
revenue reserves. It is likely that the further 
reduction in the corporate income tax rate 
to 15%, which was adopted as part of the tax legislation of 2008, and the introduc-tion of preferential tax treatment for re-
tained profi  ts for partnerships and sole pro-prietorships by lowering the top income tax rate for retained profi  ts from 45% to 28.25%, also caused the payout behaviour of enter-prises to change.
5 It is evident that the sus-
2 A key reason is that balance sheet data contain an-
nual accounts either prior to or after appropriation of profi  t. Prior to appropriation of profi  t, the breakdown 
of the annual accounts into capital to be distributed and retained capital has not yet taken place, which 
means that the entire annual profi  t is still allocated to 
internal funding. This problem arises primarily with corporations, while partnerships and sole proprietor-
ships present their balance sheets mainly after appro-
priation of profi  t.3 See also Deutsche Bundesbank, Long- term develop-
ments in corporate fi  nancing in Germany – evidence based on the fi  nancial accounts, Monthly Report,

dienst, Zeitgespräch, Finanzierungsprobleme des Mit-
telstandes durch Basel II?, volume 7 2002, pp 383ff (in German only).5 However, the introduction of a fl  at- rate tax on cap-
ital income as part of the tax reform of 2008 also 
meant tax increases in the corporate sector. The tax-
ation of capital income was standardised for private 
investors and corporations.Equity ratio of non-financial corporations

tained reduction in tax rates for retained 
profi  ts set incentives for internal funding.
Lastly, capital developments possibly also 
refl  ect enterprises’ efforts to enhance their 
risk provisioning. The sectors, in particular, 
that were confronted with a serious slump 
in demand during the recession year of 
2009 allocated a great deal more equity in 
2010 even though, at a rate of well above 
20%, they were not among the undercapit-
alised sectors before the crisis. Evidently, 
the fi  nancial and economic risks in the cor-
porate sector induced by exogenous shocks 
are to be offset by an appropriate capital 
buffer. Coupled with a comfortable overall 
level of profi  tability, German enterprises have therefore also had the necessary  fi  nancial strength since 2003 to build up risk cushions, thereby documenting en-
hanced resilience and creditworthiness.
The now much improved funding situation 
of German enterprises is also discernible in an international comparison of equity ratios 
of small and medium- sized incorporated enterprises6 in the manufacturing sector of 
selected European countries for 2000 and 
2011. The comparison shows that the small and medium- sized corporations in Germany have caught up in terms of capital and are 
now at the top end of the group of coun-
tries concerned, while they had been at the 
very bottom of the scale ten years earlier. This fi  nding is confi  rmed by survey results from the European Central Bank and the 
European Commission, according to which 
SMEs in Germany were able to considerably reduce their need for debt fi  nancing owing to greater availability of equity.
7 This devel-
opment caused the importance of bank 
loans as a means of corporate fi  nancing to 
decline correspondingly, although bank 
loans still dominate in the capital structure 
of a considerable proportion of SMEs in 
particular.
Hence, the improvement in the fi  nancing 
situation of German SMEs in recent years is 
essentially the result of increased recourse to internal sources of fi  nancing amidst a persistently good earnings situation and widespread use of the various funding sources
8 available for corporate fi  nancing. 
Attempts to classify the German corporate 
fi  nancing system in a generalised way as “bank- based” do not (now) correspond 
with the actual fi  nancing pattern, which is 
far more mixed.

are only available for this legal form, the comparison is 
limited to incorporated enterprises. These data are 
available for a restricted group of EU countries in the

which along with coke and refined petroleum 
product manufacturers generated the biggest 
rise in sales (+5%). A major factor in this con -
text was that brisk motor vehicle sales in the 
United States, Russia and China, in particular, 
more than offset the sluggish demand in euro- 
area countries. While manufacturers of ma -
chinery and equipment and the chemicals in -
dustry both posted slight sales increases, these 
did not suffice to enable them to equal the 2011 annual result, amongst other things 
owing to steadily rising personnel costs. After 
recording double- digit growth rates in 2010 
and 2011, manufacturers of electrical equip -
ment and of basic metals even suffered a drop in sales in 2012. However, this did not adversely 
affect either sector’s profitability. Overall, the manufacturing sector’s return on sales re
-
mained at 5% in the reporting period.
The construction industry, too, raised its sales 
only slightly in 2012 compared with the previ -
ous year. However, this is probably due to the fact that this sector, which has been producing at near maximum capacity for some time now, 
is reliant on investment in capacity extensions 
and higher headcount in order to raise business activity substantially. The very strong demand is 
reflected by the fact that construction firms’ gross return on sales reached a new record 
level of 6% in 2012. Small increases in the cost of materials also played a part in this.
The growth in revenue of the energy sector by 
more than one- eighth was driven not only by 
the strong expansion in electricity trading but 
also by the production launch of a large num-
ber of plants which extract energy from renew-
able sources. This was accompanied by busi -
ness start- ups. Energy companies reported an-
other good annual result in 2012 after their 
pre- tax profit in 2011 had slumped heavily due, 
amongst other things, to losses incurred in en-
ergy trading and expenses directly related to 
the decommissioning of nuclear power plants. 
However, this sector was not yet able in 2012 
to fully achieve the level of returns generated in the years preceding the German government’s decision to switch to non-  nuclear energy pro -
duction.
Whereas retail traders and, to a lesser degree, 
wholesalers managed to push up their sales 
slightly, a drop in new car registrations in 2012 
led to a slight decrease for traders of motor  vehicles and motorcycles. Costs rose faster 
than income in all trading sectors, primarily as 
a result of higher personnel expenses. Motor 
vehicle dealers’ and retailers’ profits fell mark -
edly. All trade sectors saw their return on sales 
decline, with retail traders again proving the 
most profitable, with a return of 3½%.
The economic slowdown had less of an impact 
on the other services sectors on balance. The 
business services sector posted another sub -
stantial increase in sales (+4%) and significantly higher profits in 2012. Business- related services, 
in particular professional, scientific and tech -
nical activities, led the business economy in 
terms of profitability. Although the transporta-
tion and storage sector and the information 
and communication industry were able to mar -
ginally improve their income in 2012, higher 
costs prevented them from achieving a better 
annual result. Posting a return on sales of 8¼%, 
the information and communication industry 
was again among the leaders of the economic sectors considered here, while the performance of transport and logistics enterprises was clearly below average. Moreover, at 2¼%, their return was still well below the pre- crisis level.
Income and expenses  
in detail
Enterprises’ gross revenue – which, in addition 
to the proceeds from sales, also includes the 
small accounting item “change in finished 
goods” – increased by 2½% in 2012. The year- 
on- year change in the other income compon -
ents varied a great deal across the corporate sector. However, these disparate influences more or less cancelled each other out, which Construction

meant that enterprises’ total income expanded 
in tandem with their sales and gross revenue.
Enterprises’ interest and similar income de -
clined by 1% year- on- year in 2012. This was the 
result of a further fall in average remuneration, which was already very meagre. Overall, inter -
est- bearing assets – the total stock of which 
expanded by 2% in the corporate sector  – 
yielded a return of just 2%. By contrast, income 
from long- term equity investments grew by 
one- twelfth in the year under review. This in -
crease was attributable mainly to profitable dir -
ect investments by German vehicle manufac -
turers in China3 and to profit growth recorded 
by subsidiaries of German business services providers; income from long-  term equity in
-
vestments in the chemical industry contracted 
significantly. Other operating income rose by 4%, and thus also made an above- average 
contribution to the growth in enterprises’ total income.
The rise in enterprises’ cost of materials was 
much more moderate in 2012 than in the pre-
ceding years, at 3%. This increase was only 
marginally higher than the growth in sales. This 
was mainly attributable to the modest rise in 
intermediate goods prices. On the import side, raw materials were 4½% more expensive, and 
semi- finished goods prices went up by 1¾%; 
these compare with double- digit rates of in -
crease in 2010 and 2011 brought about by the global economic upturn. The prices of domes-
tically purchased intermediate goods rose by 
¼% in 2012. These rates of increase consider -
ably alleviated the cost of materials, particularly 
in industry. In the business services sector, the 
growth in proceeds from services rendered ac-tually exceeded the rise in the cost of procuring 
intermediate services. The retail trade sector, on the other hand, had to cope with buying prices increasing more sharply than selling prices in 2012. A similarly unfavourable cost Interest income

situation was also experienced in the informa-
tion and communication industry.
In the period under review, as in the previous 
two years, personnel expenses – bringing to -
gether the payroll costs for core staff  – re -
corded another comparatively sharp rise, ad -
vancing by 3½%. One reason for this was a marked increase in pay. For instance, collect
-
ively agreed wages in the private sector went 
up more sharply in 2012 than in the preceding years, with the manufacturing sector being the 
main catalyst in this respect. In addition, em -
ployees’ wages were supplemented by in some 
cases substantial one- off payments and bo -nuses. This was the case at car manufacturers 
in particular. The second reason is that enter -
prises also hired additional labour in the period 
under review, though not to the same extent 
as in 2010 and 2011. A cross- sector comparison 
reveals that manufacturing and the wholesale 
and retail trade sector, in particular, saw per -
sonnel expenses rise faster than sales revenue. However, by longer- term standards the ratio of 
personnel expenses to gross revenue in these 
sectors – as in the whole non- financial corpor -
ate sector – remained at a low level.

firms’ costs. Measures to reduce costs by ad -
justing flexible staffing components are likely to 
have played a role here. Industrial firms were 
particularly active in cutting back their tempor -
ary hirings, the costs for which are generally 
booked to this item. In addition, weak order books eroded employees’ working time ac
-
counts on balance in large parts of the manu-facturing sector. This meant that, unlike in 2010 
and 2011 when working time credit balances accumulated, no additional provisions had to be set up to cover such a liability. There was 
likewise a decline in transfers to provisions for 
pensions – transfers which had caused a signifi-
cant increase in extraordinary expenses in 2010 
owing to the introduction of the German Act 
Modernising Accounting Law.
Depreciation at enterprises recorded only a 
modest increase of 1% in the period under re-
view. Although depreciation of tangible fixed 
assets in practically all sectors climbed for the 
first time since 2008 (+2½%), write- downs on 
financial and other assets fell following a sharp 
rise the year before.
In the period under review, enterprises’ interest 
and similar expenses dropped for the first time since 2009 (-4½%). This was attributable solely to the low level of interest rates, which pushed 
the implied interest cost down to 4¼% on 
average over the year, whilst enterprises’ inter -
est- bearing liabilities once again expanded 
considerably in 2012.
Sources and uses of funds
Enterprises’ sources of funds were one- sixth 
lower in 2012 than in 2011. This was attribut -
able to considerable shrinkage in internal finan-
cing, which made up only two- thirds of total 
funding in the period under review, compared 
to a ratio of three- quarters in 2011. Internal 
funding sources were narrowed, first, by the write- back of provisions. Second, retained 
earnings in 2012 were once again lower than 
in the year before. On the other hand, external financing expanded slightly. This was brought 
about by a considerable increase in long- term 
liabilities, following net repayments in 2011. Firms notably incurred new payment obliga
-
tions to affiliated companies. Capital market  finance did not play a significant role, aside 
from isolated bond issues by major companies. 
Small and medium- sized enterprises are likely 
to have had greater recourse to the lines of 
credit granted to them by the banks.
As in 2011, the use of funds in 2012 was 
roughly divided 70:30 between the acquisition 
of non- financial assets and the accumulation of 
financial assets. More than half of the latter 
category was accounted for by the acquisition 
of new long- term equity investments. Corpor -
ations are much more active in this regard than unincorporated enterprises; in the period under review there was only a slight drop in these ac-quisitions compared to the high level recorded 
in the previous two years. Corporations were 
comparatively restrained in investing in produc-
tion facilities. In the year under review, the 
gross increase in tangible fixed assets nonethe-
less exceeded depreciation of such assets by one- eighth, compared to one- tenth in 2011. 
However, this was overwhelmingly attributable 
to extraordinarily large capacity expansions at 
the major car manufacturers and other trans -
port equipment makers, with most other sec-
tors recording rather low figures.
At unincorporated enterprises, investment in 
tangible fixed assets in 2012 – relative to depre-
ciation – was not only more substantial than 
that undertaken by corporations, but also more 
broadly based across sectors. The production sector was led in this respect by small and medium- sized construction and energy firms, 
presumably owing to robust housing construc-
tion and the accelerated expansion of renew -
able energy generation facilities. However, un-
incorporated enterprises in industry cut back their accumulation of tangible fixed assets 
somewhat in 2012 following two years of sig-
nificant growth. In the services sector, in which

more widespread than in the production sec -
tor, the formation of tangible fixed capital was 
increased across the various sectors in the 
period under review. This needs to be seen in 
relation to an across- the- board decline in the 
year before. Taken overall, the capital invest -
ment behaviour of non- financial enterprises re-
flects the sectoral demand profile, which was 
shaped in 2012 by temporarily weaker demand 
in the heavily export- oriented industrial sector, 
on the one hand, and by burgeoning construc-tion and services business, on the other.Balance sheet developments
The total assets of the non- financial corporate 
sector expanded by 3% in 2012. This was 
somewhat less than the growth figure for 2011 
(+4½%). The assets side noticeably included more long- term receivables from affiliated 
companies and other long- term equity invest -
ments. Inventories rose in line with total assets, 
whereas the growth in tangible fixed assets was below average. On the liabilities side, 
 liabilities and provisions expanded at the same 
rate as equity overall, though there were 
 noticeable shifts within this item. For instance, 
lower provisions were booked in 2012 than in Balance sheet

2011, whilst the balance sheet included more 
short- term and long- term liabilities to affiliated 
companies in particular. The relative weight of 
the items that reflect such financial interlinkage 
within corporate groups has been expanding on both sides of the balance sheet for years, and now makes up more than one- sixth of 
assets and just under one- quarter of liabilities.
The stockpiling of inventories observable in the period under review is largely explained by the 
temporary lull in demand for industrial prod -
ucts, which forced many manufacturing firms 
to warehouse finished goods. The electrical 
 engineering sector, basic metals producers and chemicals firms all faced flagging demand in 
the course of 2012. Manufacturers of transport 
equipment, on the other hand, registered 
barely any rise in their inventories of finished goods. This sector’s buoyant position is add
-
itionally attested by the fact that its holdings of intermediate goods have remained high, whilst enterprises in some other branches of industry 
have been more circumspect in placing input 
orders. A smaller part of inventory stockpiling 
was caused by a one- tenth increase in the 
stock of contracts in progress at construction companies in 2012, which had also risen 
sharply in the two preceding years. This  upward 
trend is explained by the continued  robustness Inventory stock-
piling prompted by flagging  industrial and booming  construction  demandEnterprises’ balance sheet*

of the construction business. In the period 
under  review, almost two- fifths of all assets in 
the construction sector consisted of unfinished 
buildings and structures.
The growth in tangible fixed assets arose pre -
dominantly from the increase in movable fixed assets, whilst investment in land and buildings 
rose only modestly. This difference applied 
across practically all major industries. The ex -
pansion of production facilities was particularly 
substantial in car manufacture, and related 
both to plant and equipment (+10%) and to the amount of industrial/commercial space 
being used (+6½%). This points to considerable creation of new capacity in the automotive sec-
tor. This impression is reinforced if Germany’s 
large global car manufacturers are regarded in 
isolation: their tangible fixed assets posted 
double- digit growth over 2012 on average.
Intangible fixed assets declined somewhat as a 
share of the aggregate total assets of non-  
financial enterprises in 2012, as they did in 
2011; this was connected notably with a fall in goodwill. On the other hand, long- term receiv-
ables, securities and equity investments ex -
panded substantially, which meant that finan -
cial asset components played a major part in 
the build- up in enterprises’ overall fixed assets. 
As a result, the ratio of fixed to total assets rose to 45% in the period under review, following a decline in the previous two years.
The growth in fixed assets was mirrored in 2012 by an expansion in long- term capital, 
which comprises equity, long- term liabilities 
and provisions for pension. The combined 
share of these items has remained unchanged 
for several years at around 48% of total assets. 
This means that, in terms of matching maturity, 
the means of production and receivables are 
solidly financed. With the ratio of equity to 
total assets unchanged of late and the relative 
weight of provisions for pensions shrinking in 
the context of greater off- balance- sheet fund -
ing of company pension commitments, enter -
prises have accumulated more long- term liabil-ities. Loans from affiliated companies have played a greater part in this than additional 
bank borrowing.
At the end of the 2012 financial year, the equity 
ratio amounted to 27½% on average across all the sectors surveyed, which was the same level 
as in 2011, when it had recorded only a rela -
tively modest rise compared with previous 
years. Unincorporated enterprises, which have 
been steadily catching up with corporations for some time, raised their equity levels further. In 
the year under review, their equity amounted 
to 17% of total assets. The equity ratio of cor -
porations has stuck at just over 30% since Rise in tangible

2010. The sectoral breakdown likewise shows a 
variegated picture. Thus in the production sec-tor and in wholesale and retail trade the equity ratio rose in 2012, whereas it declined a little at business services providers and fell appreciably 
in the information and communication sector. 
Overall, the inter- sectoral heterogeneity of 
equity ratios is likely to have been further re -
duced because sectors with below-  average 
ratios have tended to increase them to a 
greater extent. This is true in particular of the 
construction industry, wholesale and retail trade, and accommodation and food service 
activities.Trends for 2013
Industrial enterprises are likely to have recorded only very moderate sales growth overall in 2013. 
According to data from the group financial statement statistics, which cover non- financial 
groups listed on the DAX and MDAX, sales rev-enue was practically stagnant against 2012 until 
the third quarter of 2013. However, there was 
distinct relief in terms of the cost of materials, 
with prices for both domestically and externally 
purchased intermediate goods having eased. With a moderate pick- up in employment and 
very uniform growth in pay, personnel expenses 
are likely to have risen to an extent similar to that experienced in the previous two years. From today’s perspective, there has therefore 
probably been no marked decline in the profit-ability of the enterprise sector as a whole.
The impression gained from extrapolating single- entity financial statements available up 
to 2012 – namely, that the drive to strengthen 
equity ratios in the aftermath of the sharp  recession in late 2008 and early 2009 has 
abated – receives further corroboration from 
the consolidated financial statements for 2013. The equity ratio has remained unchanged since 
that time at around 29% of total assets. With 
profitability at a constant level, the corporate groups’ desire to keep shareholder dividends 
on an even keel is consistent with steady trans-fers to retained earnings.
Corporate groups’ tangible fixed assets at the 
end of the third quarter of 2013 amounted to just under 26% of total assets, as in 2012. This 
means that this ratio has stabilised on group 
balance sheets at a level which is significantly 
higher than the corresponding ratio in the ag-
gregated single- entity financial statements, 
where the ratio has declined distinctly in recent 
years. Taking into consideration the fact that fixed capital formation at foreign subsidiaries boosts non- financial assets on group balance 
sheets, but is reflected on single- entity balance 
sheets only partly and through other items (eg

The financial system in transition: 
the new importance of repo markets
Market developments, the impact of the financial crisis and regulatory measures have greatly 
enhanced the importance of the markets for securities repurchase agreements, or repo markets, 
to the financial system in the past few years. Owing to the financial system’s central role in trans-
mitting monetary policy measures to the real economy and thus ultimately to price develop -
ments, central banks’ interest in what goes on in the repo markets is growing. Two trends in 
particular are posing challenges.
Because short- term loans are increasingly being collateralised with securities, fluctuations in 
securities prices have a more direct impact on liquidity distribution, particularly between commer-
cial banks. Declining prices of collateral used for repo transactions could lead to rising margins 
and haircuts and thus to further price losses, which can disrupt interbank liquidity distribution 
and, in an extreme case, bring it to a halt altogether. In order to stop such a spiral of destabilisa-
tion, the central bank would, in extremis, be forced to enter the interbank market as an intermedi-ary.
The growing importance of central counterparties (CCPs), which are becoming established in the 
repo markets and offer certain advantages to the contracting parties for repos with regard to the handling of collateral, could pose a similar challenge to central banks. If, for instance, the default of a single counterparty were to threaten the CCP itself, the central bank could be forced to act as the liquidity provider of last resort in order to maintain financial stability.
Since both cases could result in systemic risk to financial stability, which would hamper the 
smooth implementation of monetary policy, it is in a central bank’s own best interest to minimise 
such risks. These markets accordingly need to be regulated and monitored constantly, central 
financial market infrastructures need to be protected against the default of major players, and 
the risks associated with repo transactions need to be internalised as comprehensively as pos -
sible, ie to be taken into account when pricing repo transactions.
Because repo markets have become more and more important in the monetary policy transmis-
sion process, regulation and government intervention in this segment of the financial market are impacting increasingly on monetary policy. The planned financial transaction tax would have a 
lasting adverse effect on the repo market and would jeopardise interbank liquidity distribution. 
The likely result would be an increase in bank funding through the Eurosystem, which would not 
be desirable from a monetary policy and regulatory perspective.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Repo transactions are by far the most import -
ant, and most relevant, form of secured money 
market transactions. The repo markets are used 
by financial institutions, securities traders, en -
terprises and other market participants, par -
ticularly to manage their liquidity or fund longer- term investment. The importance of 
repo transactions has continued to grow in the past few years. This is related to the continuing 
trend of hedging risks from lending business and confining such business owing to capital 
adequacy requirements. This trend began prior 
to the financial crisis and mirrors falling turn -
over in the unsecured money market. It was amplified dramatically by the crisis. Immedi
-
ately following the Lehman bankruptcy, the un-
secured interbank money market largely dried 
up in the medium and longer- term segments; 
no sustained revival of this segment, particu -
larly in the longer maturities, is on the horizon.
The repo markets are undergoing major up -
heaval, not least due to the financial crisis: the 
significance of over- the- counter (OTC) repo 
transactions is tending to diminish, while elec-tronic repo trading platforms and the attendant 
settlement infrastructures are not only gaining 
market share but are also making a tangible 
contribution to the growth of these markets. In addition, since the crisis, money market partici-
pants have become much more discriminating 
with regard to the quality of eligible collateral 
and counterparties.
Repo markets are an important element of 
monetary policy because of their special role in 
the monetary transmission process. The repo markets’ growth and enhanced importance have, in recent years, not just “changed the 
game” for financial market participants but are also presenting supervisory authorities and cen-tral banks with a new set of challenges. These 
challenges affect a wide range of areas – 
includ ing the operation of payment and secur -
ities settlement infrastructures, financial stabil -
ity analysis and financial market monitoring.At the same time, the repo markets have be -
come the subject of regulatory initiatives and tax proposals, engendered by the persistent 
 financial crisis.
Given the importance of the repo markets, 
these regulatory initiatives are likely, in turn, to affect the conduct of monetary policy and the 
monetary transmission process, which could 
pose new challenges to future Euro system 
monetary policy. This article discusses the 
aforementioned aspects in context and con -
cludes that the interests of an effective stability- 
oriented monetary policy which is consistent 
with the EU treaty must be maintained when 
designing the framework for the repo markets.
Features of repo transactions
A securities sale and repurchase agreement, or 
simply repo, is a contract in which the seller 
sells securities to the buyer while at the same 
time committing to repurchase the same, or 
similar, securities at a later date. The repur -
chase price is equal to the original selling price 
plus interest on the cash received. From the 
buyer’s perspective, this is also known as a “re-
verse repo”, as the buyer first buys and then 
resells the securities – the “reverse” of a repo. 
Depending on the perspective, repos can rep -
resent either a loan against securities or secur -
ities lending against cash.
A repo consists of two transactions, or “legs”.– 
On the value date, the seller (ie the bor -
rower) sells the securities to the buyer (ie the 
lender) for an agreed amount.
– Upon maturity, the seller repurchases the 
 securities for the original sum and pays the 
buyer interest on the money received over 
the term of the repo.
For the duration of the repo transaction, own-
ership rights to the collateral pass to the lender. 
The lender has full control over the collateral Growing signifi-

and can use it, for instance, as collateral to take 
out a loan of his own.
As an alternative to the bilateral repo transac -
tions described above, there is also the option 
of triparty repo transactions, which make up the majority of repo business in the United 
States. In a triparty repo, there is a third- party 
agent between the securities lender and liquid-
ity provider. This agent physically holds the  securities posted as collateral; the original 
counterparties remain the contractual parties 
to the transaction. The agent (mostly a clearing house in Europe; a clearing bank in the United States) manages the collateral, makes substitu-
tions whenever necessary, monitors the risk 
and collects the margin. Should the agent de -
fault, the liquidity provider maintains legal 
ownership of the securities.
If the parties to a repo transaction agree on a 
specific security as collateral, this is known as a 
special repo. Conversely, General Collateral 
(GC) repos refer to a selection (say, a list) of se-
curities. The list of eligible securities (GC bas -
ket) can comprise, for instance, euro- area gov-
ernment bonds. GC repos are always money-  
driven: they are conducted because the bor -
rower wants to obtain liquidity. Special repos, 
by contrast, are mostly securities- driven: the 
lender is looking for a very specific security. Special repos can be used, for instance, to 
meet delivery obligations from a short sale.
In order to protect both parties to the contract 
against the other’s possible default, the value 
of the pledged collateral should correspond 
roughly to the cash value of the repo. There is 
a further risk of loss if the market for the secur -
ity pledged as collateral is not sufficiently liquid. The security might then have to be sold below 
its valuation price. Therefore, margins or hair -
cuts are usually agreed for repo transactions.
The securities’ market value may change during 
the lifetime of the repo. Variation margins are 
calculated for such changes in asset prices. The 
collateral is marked to market, generally on a daily basis. If the collateral value falls, the bor -
rower has to pledge additional collateral. If the 
collateral value increases, the borrower receives collateral back.
The repo rate represents the interest payable upon expiration of the repo. Most repo con
-
tracts are set at fixed rates. For floating- rate 
repos, the repo rate is based on a benchmark 
interest rate with an agreed premium or dis -
count. The repo rate changes in line with the 
benchmark interest rate. The rates on special repos are mostly slightly below the GC rates because, in the case of special repo transac
-
tions, the collateral provider is required to pay 
the repo rate although he often does not actu-
ally need liquidity. If he reinvests the cash  received as a GC repo, he can obtain interest 
income; however, there are also risks involved 
in such transactions. If demand for a certain 
 security is particularly high, the special repo 
rates could be well below the corresponding 
GC repo rate.
Repos are settled OTC or on  exchanges and via 
central counterparties (CCPs). The volume of 
OTC repos is significant and the process is not 
very transparent, as there are generally no 
supervisory reporting  requirements for market 
participants. Trading in a regulated market such 
as an electronic  exchange makes trading activ-
ity transparent in terms of price formation, the 
ratio of supply to demand and the volume of 
contracts concluded, and ensures the anonym-ity of sellers and buyers at the time of the trade. 
If these trades are settled via CCPs, this ano -
nymity is retained during settlement. The neu -
tral CCP ensures that the trading partners re -
main anonymous in the settlement phase, as -
sumes the obligations incurred and guarantees 
their fulfilment. In addition, a CCP administers, 
prices and nets the trading positions and, on 
the day of fulfilment, settles the payment and 
delivery legs of each transaction. In the case of 
money market transactions via CCPs, counter -
party credit risk and settlement risk are re -
duced; at the same time, banking supervisors Special securities 
or baskets of  securities can

require less capital backing for these transac -
tions.
Because, in a repo, the title to the collateral 
is  transferred to the lender, the lender can, in turn, pledge the securities received as col-lateral for a further repo. “Re- hypothecation 
chains”  may be the result. Although the re- hypothe cation of collateral increases the 
 securities markets’ liquidity and reduces each 
individual bank’s liquidity management costs, 
re- hypothecation chains can be problematic in 
terms of financial stability: if one actor in a 
re- hypothecation chain defaults, other actors in 
the chain could end up not being able, in turn, 
to return an owed security once a repo reaches 
maturity. The actors would then be liable for 
damages where the value of the collateral ex -
ceeds the repo’s repayment amount. The inter -
connectedness between banks and the shadow 
banking system is viewed as particularly prob -
lematic. Because of lower capitalisation, some 
shadow banks are generally less able to absorb 
shocks.
Participants and structure  
of repo markets in Europe and Germany
Banks and financial services providers use repos 
to manage their liquidity, cover short sales, 
build up leverage or hedge interest rate risk. 
Investors such as mutual funds, pension funds, 
insurers and corporate treasuries use repos to 
invest surplus liquidity or obtain additional 
 returns on their portfolios.
The repo markets are important but, like other 
OTC markets, relatively intransparent. In Eur -
ope, the repo market grew rapidly, in terms of 
outstanding volume, until the financial crisis; it has fluctuated considerably since then (see the 
chart on page 62). The International Capital 
Market Association (ICMA) estimates the total 
volume of contracts outstanding in the Euro -
pean repo market at around €6 trillion at 
present. Business is strongly concentrated, with the 20 leading institutions accounting for 80% 
of trading activity. Two-  thirds of repos have a 
maturity of not more than one month, most 
not more than a week; the vast majority of the remainder has a maturity of up to one year.

A Eurosystem money market study has shown 
that the secured money market –  despite a 
drop in turnover in 2008 and 2012 – remains 
the largest money market segment in Germany 
and Europe. According to the latest Euro 
Money Market Survey, the secured money mar -
ket is around eight times the size of the un -
secured money market in terms of transaction 
volume.2
The Eurosystem money market survey also  inquired about the counterparties’ country of 
origin. Unsecured money market turnover in 
Germany in 2013 showed a declining trend in 
cross- border trading with euro- area counter -
parties (around 27%, as against 47% in 2007). 
By contrast, in 2013 some 50% of turnover in 
the secured market was with euro-  area coun -
terparties; it can thus be said that the borders 
between euro- area countries play a less 
 restrictive role in the secured market, as 
 expected.
Importance of repos for 
bank funding in Germany
As part of its monthly balance sheet statistics, 
the Bundesbank collects data on repos of banks 
domiciled in Germany. The bulk of both asset- side and liability- side domestic transactions are 
conducted between banks or between banks and CCPs. Banks’ liability-  side repo funding 
makes up around 5% of their total assets (see 
the chart on page 64). Around 25% of these outstanding repos are overnight transactions. 
Another approximately 72% have a maturity or notice period of up to one year. In similar fash-Transfer of title

Infrastructure developments in the European repo market
Growing importance of settlement 
 infrastructure
Upheaval on the money market and the 
trend towards secured fi  nancial transactions are enhancing the importance of the secur-ities settlement infrastructure.
On the European repo markets, over- the- counter (OTC) trading has increasingly  migrated to trading platforms involving a 
central counterparty (CCP), although bilat-
eral trade in certain securities is still attract-ive for some banks.
It is evident that the market infrastructure is 
currently still deeply fragmented. Although 
CCPs are the main clearing houses, central 
securities depositories (CSDs) and their 
 securities settlement and collateral man-
agement systems are also signifi  cant. Both 
of these private infrastructure segments 
– CCPs and CSDs – must interact with cen-
tral bank infrastructures in order to settle payments in central bank money via pay-
ment systems, for example.
International clearing and settlement 
market for Eurobonds split between two CSDs
During clearing, reciprocal claims, liabilities 
and delivery obligations are determined. The clearing process involves transmitting, coordinating and, in some cases, confi  rm-ing transactions and other modalities (eg 
payment channel, place and time of deliv-
ery). Clearing and settlement houses oper-
ate at a national or international level. 
Within the EU, the two international central 
securities depositories (ICSDs) Euroclear in Brussels and Clearstream in Luxembourg have divided up the international clearing and settlement market for Eurobonds (ie bonds denominated in euro that were 
 issued in a non- euro- area country) among 
themselves. Securities denominated in local 
currency are generally still held in custody 
and settled by the respective national CSD, 
although the two ICSDs have also increas-
ingly been settling national securities since 
the launch of European monetary union. However, more and more links are being 
 established among national CSDs as well as 
between national CSDs and ICSDs. This makes it easier to settle cross- border repo 
transactions. In the future, the Eurosystem’s TARGET2-Securities (T2S) project will enable a uniform settlement of securities in central 
bank money within Europe. This will allow 
cross- border repo transactions to be settled 
even more cost- effectively. CSDs will give up their individual settlement systems and 
use a single platform. This will, it is hoped, 
cut the at present considerably higher cost 
of cross- border transactions and bring it 
more in line with the cost of national trans-actions.
Interoperability between CCPs being 
strengthened
In July 2013, the two ICSDs and Clearstream 
Banking AG and Eurex Clearing AG reached a cooperation agreement strengthening the 
interoperability of their systems (triparty settlement interoperability initiative). This agreement aims to improve the interoper-
ability of the settlement and collateral man-agement systems by 2015, making it easier 
to move securities between the infrastruc-
tures and reducing collateral pool fragmen-
tation. This will, it is hoped, result in more 
effi   cient collateral management within 
 Europe.Deutsche Bundesbank

ion to developments in the European repo mar -
ket, German banks’ repo market financing ex -
panded rapidly up until the outbreak of the fi-
nancial crisis and has been fluctuating relatively sharply since then.
For German multinational banks, repos are 
considerably more important than for the Ger -
man banking industry as a whole. Upon the 
outbreak of the subprime crisis in the US real- 
estate market, however, the percentage share 
of repos in the short- term funding of German 
multinational banks fell significantly, from 
nearly 60% before the crisis to 48% just before the Bear Stearns rescue in March 2008. Follow-ing the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, this figure 
was a mere 35%.3 These figures indicate that 
access to repos for short- term funding pur -
poses initially became more difficult immedi -
ately after the outbreak of the crisis, as the col-lapse of the subprime market refuted the con-
ventional wisdom that repos based on securi -
tised loans were relatively safe.
The revival, since 2009, of the trend towards 
secured funding of banks has had implications 
for unsecured creditors. According to BaFin, some €1,100 billion in euro- area banks’ liabil
-
ities matured in 2012, 80% of which were un-
secured. However, only around 20% of funding 
was unsecured in 2012.The significance  
of the euro- area repo  
markets for monetary policy
Defining and implementing a single monetary 
policy is the Eurosystem’s central task. The pri-
mary objective of monetary policy is to main -
tain price stability. The Governing Council of 
the ECB takes its monetary policy decisions on 
the basis of broadly based analyses, including 
analyses of the repo markets. The Eurosystem 
then implements the Governing Council’s mon-
etary policy decisions using the instruments 
contained in the monetary policy toolkit. Mon-
etary policy refinancing operations –  reverse 
open market transactions which provide com -
mercial banks with liquidity against collateral 
on a revolving basis – are a central instrument. 
The central bank is the initiating party.
Central banks have traditionally used open market operations as a way to influence the banking system’s aggregate liquidity position vis- à- vis the central bank in order to manage 
short- term money market rates (money market 
management). The short- term money market 
rates, in turn, influence the rates of interest on 
other longer- dated financial instruments and 
the rates of interest on bank loans and deposits 
(the interest rate channel of monetary trans -
mission).
Repos with other participants in the repo mar -
ket are a commercial bank’s closest substitute 
for refinancing operations with the Eurosystem. 
Central banks can use the terms and conditions of their refinancing operations to influence the 
costs of similar money market transactions 
 between commercial banks. This monetary pol-
icy arrangement requires  functioning financial 
markets which transmit monetary policy stimuli 
effectively to the financial sector and from 
there to the real economy.Significant

Repo markets and central bank policy: 
an international review
Central banks can infl  uence liquidity via 
open market operations. As well as outright 
transactions, these operations include col-
lateralised loans, which are very similar to 
repo transactions and which are also some-
times referred to as such by the central banks. The Federal Reserve began using repos as early as 1917 to provide loans to 
banks. In the following decade, the Federal Reserve also began to use them to provide 
loans to securities traders. The use of repo 
transactions was temporarily suspended 
during the Great Depression and the Second 
World War. The Federal Reserve did not  reintroduce this type of transaction until 1949. In 1951, the US Congress approved the Treasury- Federal Reserve Accord. This established the independence of the Fed-eral Reserve, which gained control over 
monetary policy, and repos became attract-ive once again.
In the 1970s, a number of countries intro-
duced repo transactions as a monetary  policy instrument. In the United Kingdom, 
repos with government securities as collat-
eral fi  rst began to be used on a daily basis 
in 1997. Japan and Switzerland started 
using repos in 1997 and 1998, respectively. Since the start of European monetary union 
in 1999, the Eurosystem has used refi  nan-cing operations, which are very similar to repos, as a fundamental monetary policy 
 instrument.1
Repos have become an important monetary policy instrument for central banks. Through 
repo transactions, central banks can man-
age liquidity in the money markets and sig-nal the target interest rate to market partici-pants. In addition, conditions for repo trans-actions between private parties give an  insight into market participants’ expect-
ations of monetary policy in the near term. A number of central banks additionally use 
repos to manage their foreign reserves. 
Repos widen the spectrum of investments.
The repo markets have benefi  ted from the 
use of repos as a monetary policy instru-
ment. More banks have become active on 
the repo markets through the central banks’ repo transactions. By supplying the banking 
system with additional liquidity through repos, central banks helped to keep the 
banks solvent during the fi  nancial crisis.

tions of repo markets for central banks, CGFS Working paper, March 1999.Deutsche Bundesbank

During the ongoing financial crisis, the Govern-
ing Council of the ECB has regarded this trans-
mission process as being disrupted. To ensure 
the efficacy of monetary policy measures, it adopted temporary non- standard monetary 
policy measures. Because the euro area’s finan-
cial system is largely bank- based, the central 
non- standard monetary policy measures were 
tailored to the banking system (fixed- rate full 
allotment in refinancing operations, extension 
of collateral pool). These measures, in turn, im-
pacted on activity in the repo markets and 
tended to reduce turnover.
The repo markets during the 
financial crisis
The loss of confidence as a result of the finan-
cial crisis has not only caused the medium and 
longer-  term segments of the unsecured inter -
bank money market to dry up, but also  affected 
the international repo markets  –  although 
transactions there are collateralised. From mid-
2007 onwards, the repo markets came under 
pressure as doubts about securities’ quality and 
current market valuations spread. Strains on 
the US repo market spilled over to international 
repo markets. Financing conditions tightened; 
increasingly, collateral had to constitute highly 
rated and liquid government bonds. Invest -ment banks such as Bear Stearns were sud -
denly faced with funding gaps because large 
parts of their extensive securities portfolios that 
were backed by short- term assets were no 
longer accepted as collateral on the US repo 
market. With the default in September 2008 of Lehman Brothers, which was particularly active on the repo markets, the  liquidity crisis, which 
had previously been simmering in Europe, 
 developed into a fully- fledged financial crisis. 
The repo markets could then only be used for 
high- quality securities, and this by itself was 
not enough to ensure banks’ liquidity.
On the European repo market, the growing risk 
aversion that had emerged in 2010 in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis reduced acceptance of securities from certain EU countries. Market 
participants began to differentiate more be -
tween the creditworthiness of government 
bonds issued by different euro-  area countries. 
Bonds of countries that market participants be-
lieved to pose a higher credit risk were rarely 
accepted as collateral. However, on the whole, 
the share of euro- area government bonds in 
repo transactions in Europe remained relatively stable at around 80% in the period from 2009 to end-2012.
4
On balance, the proportion of government 
bonds from the peripheral euro- area countries 
fell sharply. The share of German government 
bonds dropped only slightly; they attracted in-
creasing demand as secure and liquid assets. 
The decline in the percentage of bonds issued 
by peripheral euro- area countries in CCP repo 
transactions was particularly striking. While the 
overall market share of German government 
bonds shrank slightly, on the CCP repo market, French and German bonds, as well as securities 
issued by public international financial institu -
tions, especially Pfandbriefe, offset these shifts in the securities spectrum.Loss of confi-
dence during  financial crisis also hurting repo marketsSegmentation in favour of high- quality securities

Increased signifi  cance of general collateral repos
During the fi  nancial crisis, the importance 
of general collateral repos (GC repos), which are cleared on electronic trading 
platforms involving a CCP , has grown even 
further. The share of repo transactions cleared via CCPs rose from 37% in 2008 
to 65% in 2013. Alongside other electronic 
trading platforms that involve CCPs, the outstanding volume of Eurex Repo’s GC 
pooling, in particular, rose from €22 billion at the beginning of January 2008 to around 
€165 billion in mid- November 2013. This 
was mainly due to a growing circle of coun-
terparties, especially international partici-pants. The number of GC pooling partici-
pants increased roughly fi  vefold to 111 (of 
which 50 in Germany) in the period from 
January 2008 to November 2013.
As collateral baskets, Eurex has established, 
in particular, the general collateral pooling 
baskets: the GC pooling ECB basket com-
prises around 7,500 top- quality ECB- eligible 
securities, the GC pooling ECB EXTended 
basket contains some 25,000 ECB- eligible 
securities, including bonds with a lower rat-
ing. The assets’ different credit ratings are refl  ected in the fundamentally divergent 
interest rates of the two GC pooling collat-eral baskets (see chart below).
After the Eurosystem allocated a record vol-
ume of liquidity to the banks with its two 
three- year tenders at year- end 2011-12, ex-
cess demand for liquidity has given way to 
excess supply in the GC pooling market. Now borrowers, not creditors, determine 
the interest rates, and the spread between 
the two repo rates has shrunk. Following 
the three- year tenders, the difference in the interest rates in the collateral baskets fell to almost zero, as did, in particular, the level of the repo rates overall. Besides excess liquid-
ity, this refl  ected the low market rates and 
low yields on top- rated securities.

The main reason for the increased use of Ger -
man government bonds in CCP repo transac -
tions, as opposed to the situation on the mar -
ket as a whole, is that collateral providers in 
CCP repo transactions can be certain that they 
will receive their bonds back upon maturity, as 
securities cannot be re- hypothecated in most 
CCP repo systems. However, in bilateral OTC 
repo transactions, it is customary for securities 
to be re- hypothecated. Market participants 
were thus hesitant to use their German govern-
ment bonds for fear of not having them 
 returned.
Eurosystem measures during 
the financial crisis
As a rule, all euro- area banks that are subject 
to minimum reserve requirements can conduct 
refinancing operations with the Eurosystem 
(broad group of counterparties). The Eurosys -
tem national central banks grant them loans 
against pledged securities through regular refi-
nancing operations in accordance with the  national implementation of single monetary 
policy. Until the outbreak of the financial crisis, 
this was achieved using competitive bidding 
procedures where the allotment volume was determined in advance. This was just enough to cover the aggregate liquidity requirements 
of the banking system. Of the 6,300 credit in-
stitutions in the euro area, around 2,200 are 
eligible as Eurosystem counterparties and rela -
tively few of these usually take part in refinan-cing operations.
The Eurosystem accepts a broad spectrum of 
securities ranging from public bonds to credit 
claims. It also accepts covered and uncovered 
bank bonds as well as corporate bonds and 
asset- backed securities (ABS) with correspond -
ing haircuts.
During the financial crisis, the medium and 
longer-  term segments of the unsecured inter -
bank money market dried up to a large extent. The repo markets also temporarily came under pressure: first, numerous banks were no longer 
considered reliable enough to conduct even 
 secured money market operations and, second, 
securities with lower liquidity and credit ratings 
were rarely accepted as collateral for repo 
transactions. To safeguard banks’ liquidity and 
avoid a credit crunch, central banks worldwide 
took non- standard measures. They purchased 
securities with low liquidity or provided banks 
with additional liquidity in the form of secured loans.
The Eurosystem responded to the widespread 
loss of confidence on the money and financial 
markets with extensive non- standard monetary 
policy measures. In order to meet banks’ need 
for liquidity in this extraordinary situation, the 
Eurosystem decided in mid- October 2008 to 
apply full allotment in its monetary policy refi -
nancing operations. This full allotment has con-
tinued virtually unchanged ever since. Eligible 
counterparties receive unlimited liquidity as long as they have enough suitable collateral. The Eurosystem also temporarily offered refi
-
nancing operations with longer maturities. In 2009 for instance, it conducted three longer-  
term refinancing operations (LTROs) with a  maturity of 12 months; total recourse was in 
excess of €600 billion. As of December 2011, 
there were two more LTROs with a maturity of 
three years. Take- up amongst Eurosystem 
counterparties was more than €1,000 billion.
This large- scale use of refinancing operations 
was possible because the Eurosystem had, 
since October 2008, significantly extended the 
collateral that it would accept for monetary 
policy operations. In particular, it lowered the 
credit threshold (rating requirements) for eli -
gible collateral to ease the shortage of market-
able and eligible assets being experienced at 
many institutions.
For central bank refinancing operations with 
exceptionally long maturities – as with all non- standard monetary policy measures – there is a 
danger that private transactions will be 
crowded out of the markets and market prices Monetary policy

will be distorted. The longer these measures 
are in place, the greater the risk. There are indi-
cations that the Eurosystem’s large- volume refi-
nancing operations may have crowded out 
parts of the repo market. ICMA data show a clear slump in the European repo markets in 
2008 and 2009. Even in the following years of excess liquidity, the repo markets did not return 
to pre- crisis growth levels (see the chart on 
page 62).
Since the crisis began, the previously uniform 
repo markets appear to be deeply segmented. Some banks lack eligible assets, or their specific 
risk characteristics prevent them from raising funds on the funding markets. Others would receive liquidity and funding on the markets 
but prefer to use the Eurosystem operations in some instances, as the conditions are more at-
tractive than on the private market. Interest rate conditions in relation to the maturity of 
the operations may be better or the assets ac-cepted as collateral more generous. In particu-
lar, the Eurosystem even accepts assets that usually cannot be used as collateral for repo transactions between private parties. It thus 
 reduces the incentives for banks to develop a 
capital and financing structure that would 
 enable them to regain access to the money and 
capital markets. The objective of the Eurosys -
tem measures was to ease market distortions 
during the crisis. However, they also have side 
effects. There is a danger that the Eurosystem 
measures will, over time, perpetuate the exist-
ing market segmentation. For a broad- based 
recovery of the euro- area economy, it is essen-
tial that the financial sector problems that 
caused the market segmentation in the first 
place be resolved.
Challenges for regulators 
and financial stability policy
During the financial crisis, the repo markets, 
which are particularly important for short- term 
financing, experienced sharp distortions. They 
were therefore included in various regulation initiatives. As financial markets are interconnected 
at a global level, new regulation initiatives are 
often proposed by international committees or 
organisations working on specific aspects of 
regulation and financial stability policy.
For instance, a workstream on securities lend -
ing and repos organised by the Financial Stabil-
ity Board (FSB) is currently investigating the 
shadow banking system and how the variability 
of margin and haircut requirements for repo 
transactions impacts on financial stability. The 
resulting policy recommendations were pub -
lished at the end of August 2013. A further as-
pect of regulation issues looks at the central 
role of CCPs. The Committee on Payment and 
Settlement Systems (CPSS), which is based at 
the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), has published a consultative report together with the International Organization of Secur
-
ities Commissions (IOSCO) on quantitative re -
porting standards for CCPs to improve the in -
formation available on the systemic import -
ance, robustness and potential risks of CCPs. 
The mechanisms dealt with in this context are 
numerous and complex, but the following is 
symptomatic: if investors believe the risk relat-ing to individual securities issuers to be higher, then the participants in the bilateral repo mar -
ket will tend to increase their margins and hair -
cuts. This could spell funding problems for 
 financial market participants who finance large 
securities portfolios via repo transactions, and 
they may have to sell securities to remain  liquid. 
This could trigger a spiral of falling bond prices, 
dwindling market liquidity, increasing margins 
and haircuts, and a further drop in lending val-
ues. To what extent individual market partici -
pants with particular market power can accel -
erate such a spiral through their margin and/or 
haircut decisions is the subject of debate. Deci-
sions that are correct and sensible from an indi-
vidual market participant’s perspective may 
have a detrimental effect on the stability of the 
financial system. Conclusions for concrete 
regulations at national or European level have 
yet to be put forward, but will have an impact 
on the repo markets.Favourable

The repo market in the USA
Large outstanding volume of 
repo transactions in the USA
The largest repo market worldwide, with an 
outstanding volume of around US$10 tril-
lion (approximately 70% of US GDP), is still 
to be found in the USA. The US repo mar-
ket is predominately based on US Treasury 
securities, but there are also markets for mortgage- backed securities (MBS) and for 
corporate bonds.
Unlike in the euro area, only a few banks in 
the USA have been designated as primary 
dealers by the Federal Reserve. Monetary policy is thus transmitted by the Federal  Reserve as repo transactions via primary 
dealers to commercial banks.
According to ICMA data, around two- thirds 
of repos in the United States are what are 
known as triparty repos. In a triparty repo, a 
clearing bank provides important services 
for administering the securities exchanged between the securities lender (cash bor-
rower) and the liquidity provider as well as 
providing intraday liquidity.
Securities portfolios fi  nanced via the 
 triparty repo market
The clearing bank manages the securities 
which are pledged as collateral. Should the 
securities lender default, the liquidity pro-vider maintains title to the securities. The 
triparty repo market is the most important 
source of funding for investment banks and 
securities broker- dealers as they can obtain 
short- term liquidity to fi  nance their secur-
ities portfolios. Liquidity providers are usu-
ally money market funds, investment funds, 
asset managers or public authorities with 
surplus liquidity. Repos are an uncompli-cated alternative to bank deposits for li-
quidity providers as the funding is collateral-ised and can be called daily. The short- term 
availability is possible due to the daily re-payment of all repos, regardless of their 
maturity. The liquidity provider is paid back the funds it provided and the securities are 
returned to the securities lender. This ap-proach differs from the procedure em-ployed in Europe, in which repos are only 
settled upon maturity. As a result, the secur-ities lender in the US repo market (particu-larly the broker- dealer) experiences a fund-
ing gap until the repo is “rewound” at the 
end of the day. This is usually bridged with 
intraday credit provided by the clearing 
bank. In the triparty repo market, a clearing bank  assumes the relatively complex task of 
managing securities (settlement, adminis-
tration) and the settlement of cash fl  ows for both parties.
Daily repayment harbours risks
As the crisis has shown, this arrangement 
harbours signifi  cant risks. Where there is doubt regarding the creditworthiness of a cash borrower, liquidity providers such as clearing banks are no longer interested in 
extending their repos or providing intraday 
credit (bridge loans). Should a broker- dealer 
default, liquidity providers would have to 
sell repo collateral in a stressed market en-
vironment. This scenario materialised fol-
lowing the collapse of the investment bank Bear Stearns, which put  liquidity on the tri-party repo market at risk of drying up. Asset 
fi  re sales also  resulted in fi  nancial conta-
gion.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report 
December 2013 68

Future liquidity regulations, which are part of 
the  Basel III framework, govern banks’ behav -
iour with regard to the term structure of their 
assets and liabilities, and thus also focus on repo markets as a key source of short- term 
 financing for banks. The new liquidity rules 
contain defined ratios and thus set specific standards for managing banks’ liquidity risk. 
The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) records liquid-
ity inflows and outflows for maturities of up to 30 days and the net stable funding ratio 
(NSFR) for maturities of up to one year. Banks 
will have to maintain adequate liquidity (or 
 liquid assets) to cover net cash outflows over a 
30-day or a one- year period respectively. This 
raises banks’ demand for eligible liquid assets 
and many banks’ interest in a more balanced 
asset- liability structure. The liquidity regulations 
planned under  Basel III are likely to increase 
banks’ demand for longer- term transactions on 
the repo market.
Implications of the financial 
transaction tax
The financial transaction tax being discussed in 
the EU could, if it is implemented, also have a 
considerable impact on the repo markets. As 
part of the “enhanced cooperation”, 11 euro-  
area countries are planning to implement a  financial transaction tax that also applies to 
transactions between financial institutions. The 
tax is to be levied if at least one party in the 
 financial transaction resides in a participating 
member country (nonetheless, both parties would be subject to the tax) or if the party 
 issuing the  financial instrument is located in a 
participating member country. The tax would 
therefore apply even if financial instruments are 
traded outside of the 11 participating coun -
tries, provided they were issued within one of 
the participating countries.
In theory, the tax would consequently apply to 
the financial activities of financial market partici-
pants across the globe. In practice, however, the 
legal implementation of this tax in foreign juris-dictions would be problematic. A legally binding 
minimum tax rate of 0.1% for general financial 
transactions (including repo transactions) and 
0.01% for derivatives transactions is being dis -
cussed. The financial transaction tax would  impose a very high burden on short-  term and 
revolving repo transactions in particular, as it 
would be incurred afresh for every transaction.
It is highly likely that the tax would cause the 
repo market to dry up, at least in the short-  
term segment, because the tax would be in -
creasingly disproportionate relative to interest 
income, the shorter the term of the repo trans-
action. A shift of funding from the repo market 
to the unsecured money market, where the tax 
is not applicable, would not be consistent with 
the future liquidity regulations within the 
 Basel III framework. The  Basel III concept of LCR 
favours secured forms of financing over the 
 unsecured provision of liquidity on the inter -
bank market, because unsecured short- term 
 financing is considered less stable following the 
experiences of the financial crisis.
Another way of avoiding the tax would be se -
curitised lending operations. These are secured 
transactions in which securities are pledged as 
collateral. They do not change ownership, as 
with repo transactions, and might not be sub -
ject to the financial transaction tax. However, the financing costs for secured money market 
operations without ownership transfer are likely to be higher than for repo transactions because the liquidity provider incurs higher liquidity risks 
as there is no option of re- hypothecation. An -
other reason why market participants are un -
likely to see such transactions as an attractive substitute is that insolvency law differs widely across Europe and this could impair legal cer
-
tainty. Furthermore, the business model of elec-
tronic trading platforms and CCPs would be called into question without there being any 
 alternative solutions available.
If the repo market were to shrink as a result of 
such a tax, banks would probably increasingly 
refinance themselves with the Eurosystem.Liquidity regula-
tions increase appeal of longer- term repo transac-tions for bank  financing

Outlook: repo markets 
caught between monetary policy, taxation and  regulation
Various trends are emerging on the repo mar -
ket as one of the central segments of the finan-
cial market, which are symptomatic of the 
 entire financial sector as the financial crisis tails 
off. They reflect the sometimes concurring, 
sometimes conflicting interests of the various stakeholders and participants. Central banks 
are, given their monetary policy mandate (and 
their additional tasks, for instance regarding 
payments), key market players that can take 
 action even in a crisis. Above all, central banks 
have a particular interest in ensuring that their 
monetary stimuli are transmitted to the real 
economy  effectively.
The planned financial transaction tax puts the 
role of the repo markets at risk. Governments 
have two objectives in using the financial trans-
action tax. As a steering tax, it is hoped that 
this measure will restrict transactions and place a burden on those market participants that the 
general public considers to be responsible for 
distortions in the financial sector. As a fiscal tax, it is intended to increase tax revenue. However, a financial transaction tax on repo transactions would make such transactions unprofitable for 
banks. The most obvious and much more at -
tractive  alternative for banks would be to take 
up loans from the central bank, which would 
then become a liquidity manager for the bank-ing system. From both a monetary policy and a 
regulatory perspective, it would not be desir -
able for prohibitively high taxation de facto to eliminate interbank liquidity distribution via the repo  markets and instead force the Eurosystem 
to  assume this role with its monetary policy in-
struments.
The variability of haircut and margin require -
ments in the financial cycle could also increas-ingly push central banks into the role of a cen-
tral intermediary. If a large proportion of a 
bank’s balance sheet assets that can be used as collateral is financed via repo transactions and 
the lending value of these securities falls ab -
ruptly, the central bank could be forced into 
the role of a liquidity provider of last resort.
The growing importance of CCP clearing could 
also have an impact on central banks. During 
the financial crisis, the number of international 
participants on trading platforms such as Eurex 
Repo GC Pooling grew sharply. The current  financial crisis has shown how large, well 
 established financial market participants can 
also be hit by illiquidity or insolvency. Central financial market infrastructures with growing 
importance thus have to be protected from the 
default of large financial institutions without 
central banks having to step in as liquidity pro-viders of last resort.
Other regulatory intervention measures in the 
repo markets could also drive banks out of the 
market and into the central bank’s arms, thus 
hampering it in the conduct of its monetary policy tasks. Liquid repo markets for non-  
eligible liquid assets can help financial institu
-
tions to meet regulatory liquidity requirements. 
If parts of the repo markets become illiquid, banks could increasingly seek central bank 
loans to comply with liquidity requirements. Yet the aim of regulation is that banks comply with 
regulatory liquidity requirements using their own resources and not by taking up central 
bank loans.
The trend towards secured money market op -
erations also has an impact on monetary policy. 
There is very little supply and demand for  unsecured money market loans with longer 
maturities. As they are not collateralised, they 
would be considerably more expensive than 
repo transactions and would be of interest 
 predominantly to borrowers who do not have 
adequate marketable securities. However, no 
institution is likely to divulge such information 
willingly. By offering a broad collateral frame -
work that includes far more than just market -
able securities, the Eurosystem exposes itself to 
demand for liquidity from those institutions in Central banks’ 
focus is on  effective monet -
ary policy

particular that no longer have an adequate 
amount of unused marketable securities. They 
are therefore prepared to pay the Eurosystem 
the key interest rate, which is currently consid-
erably higher than the repo rates for market -
able securities.
In recent years, the repo markets, which are of 
key importance for the central bank, have undergone, and are still undergoing, great 
change – driven by market developments, 
 responses to the crisis and regulatory meas -
ures. These developments can have far-  
reaching repercussions for the central bank at a 
number of junctures. It is thus very much in 
central banks’ interest to monitor activities on 
the repo markets more closely and gain a bet-
ter understanding of them.Far- reaching
