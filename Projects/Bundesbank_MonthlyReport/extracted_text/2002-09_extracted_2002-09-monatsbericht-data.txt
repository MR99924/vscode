Economy as a wholeAccording to Federal Statistical Office figures,
there was a further increase in real gross do-mestic product (GDP) in the second quarter ofthis year, although the rise on the first quarter(which has been revised upwards somewhat)remained moderate at a seasonally adjusted0.3%. Overall output in the first three monthsof 2002, adjusted for working-day variations,had been 0.2% down on the comparableperiod of 2001, but was slightly up on the yearin spring. In calendar-month terms, which doesnot take account of the varying number ofworking days, year-on-year growth in thesecond quarter amounted to 0.5%, comparedwith a figure of -1.2% in the first quarter.
In spring, for the first time in some while,
households’ consumption generated slightpositive stimuli. Even though the relevant fig-ure was still 1.1% down on the year, there wasa seasonally and price-adjusted increase in pur-chases of 0.2%. Furthermore, there was amarked rise in exports in the second quarter.Nevertheless, the fact that the increase in im-ports was somewhat sharper still led to adecline in net exports. The slowdown indestocking produced a positive contribution togrowth. This contrasts with a further sharp fallin investment in machinery and equipment aswell as in construction investment.

6months, in which there had been a number
of particularly large orders. In July, the orderintake remained a good 2% down on thesecond quarter in seasonally adjusted terms,although it did match the average level of thefirst few months of this year. Over 12 months,there was a decline of
12%, which followed a
slight negative figure in the second quarter.
In foreign business, especially, the fact that
no major new contracts were placed led to aslowdown in the flow of orders. In domesticbusiness, on the other hand, seasonally ad-justed orders in July largely held up at thelevel at which they have been moving sinceearly in the year.
Seasonally adjusted industrial output in July
was somewhat down on the precedingmonth: output in June had been especially
high owing to the fact that there were com-paratively few public holidays and days takenoff to make up long weekends this year. Incomparison with the second quarter as awhole, output held up. The year-on-yeardecline narrowed from 2
12% on an average
of the second quarter to 114% at the end of
the period under review.
ConstructionIn seasonally adjusted terms, demand for
construction work recovered somewhat inJune compared with the preceding month.Owing to the large number of public holidaysand days taken off to make up long week-ends, demand in May had been at a particu-larly low level, however. On an average of thesecond quarter, there was a marked declinein the level of incoming orders. The year-on-year figure, which had gone down to -
14%i n
the first quarter, increased again to one-tenth.
New industrial construction orders were very
weak in the second quarter. Public sectorcontractors, too, were notably restrained overthe past few months. In residential construc-tion, there was initially a continuation of theupturn that had been observable in the firstquarter, but the inflow of orders narrowedagain in June.
Seasonally adjusted construction output (the
July figures for which are already available)held up at the level of the previous months,although this remained low – as is revealedby the marked year-on-year downturn. Al-Real GDP

7though the present rate of -7% will probably
be revised upwards somewhat as part of theoverall survey, there will still be a perceptibledecline.
Labour marketThe labour market continued to be shaped by
a continuing decline in employment. Accord-ing to an initial assessment by the Federal Stat-istical Office, the seasonally adjusted numberof persons in work in June fell to 38.71 million,ie 40,000 fewer than in May and 250,000, or0.6%, fewer than 12 months previously. Alarge number of jobs have been shed not leastin industry and in the construction sector.
At a seasonally adjusted 4.10 million, the
number of persons out of work in Augustwas more or less as high as in July. Whilethere was a further significant increase inwestern Germany, unemployment in easternGermany fell on an almost matching scale.This was partly due to the fact that the schoolterm in three east German Länder ended asearly as June, which had led directly to a risein unemployment: quite a large number ofschool leavers register as unemployed for aninterim period until they start vocationaltraining or work. This now has an alleviatingeffect on the seasonally adjusted series, whichis geared to typical seasonal movements. Incyclical terms, the rise in unemployment inGermany as a whole continued, albeit at aslower pace, up to the end of the periodunder review.

8went up to 9.9% in August. According to the
standardised EU method, the figure remainedunchanged at 8.3%.
The number of persons attending vocational
training courses and taking part in job cre-ation schemes remained almost unchangedat 510,000 in August. In year-on-year terms,there was a reduction of 50,000.
PricesThe rate of consumer price increase remained
within narrow bounds in August. The year-on-year rate of increase amounted, as before,to 1.1%. Seasonally adjusted, the consumerprice index was no higher than in May. Themain reason for the stabilisation of prices isthat the upward pressure on industrial goodsprices recorded at the turn of the year hasnow petered out. Furthermore, after havingincreased sharply early in the year, food priceshave returned to normal. (It is very probablethat the exceptionally wet weather in Augustwill not have a major impact on consumerprices in the coming months either.) In sea-sonally adjusted terms, price increases in theservices sector have likewise mostly come toa halt over the past few months. This haslargely offset the rise in housing rents, whichhas been accelerating slightly for some time.
The external sector, too, had a price-dampening
impact in July. Imported goods again becamecheaper in seasonally adjusted terms, being4.2% lower than in the comparable period of2001. Domestic industrial selling prices werelikewise reduced further and showed a fall of1.0% on the year.Public finance
Indebtedness of central, state and local
government
Indebtedness of central, state and local gov-
ernment rose very steeply in July (+ 317.3 bil-
lion). In the first six months of 2002 net bor-rowing totalled 327.4 billion. Of this sharp
growth in debt in July, 36.8 billion was attrib-
utable to short-term cash advances andmoney market loans which are subject tostrong fluctuations during the year.
The increase in the Federal Government’s
capital market debt (+ 33.0 billion) was attrib-
utable to the sale of two-year Federal Treas-ury notes (Schätze) which yielded 34.9 billion.

9Indebtedness of the Redemption Fund for Inherited Liabilities and Bundesbank
profits
The Redemption Fund for Inherited Liabilities
has existed as a special Federal fund since1995. The debts of the Debt-Processing Fund,the Treuhand agency, liabilities of house-builders in the former German Democratic Re-public, debts of social institutions at local gov-ernment level in eastern Germany and liabil-ities arising from equalisation claims after1994 were transferred to the RedemptionFund for Inherited Liabilities. The aim was tocombine, pay interest on and repay the “fi-nancial legacies” which arose in connectionwith the German reunification. Debts shouldbe completely repaid within one generation,ie within 30 years. The Redemption Fund forInherited Liabilities was initially financed bytransfers from the Federal budget amountingto 7.5% of the assumed liabilities andthrough that part of the Federal Govern-ment’s revenue from the Bundesbank profitthat was in excess of DM7 billion. Net re-demptions were made to the amount that therevenue of the Redemption Fund for Inherit-ed Liabilities exceeded its expenditure (whichwas mainly for interest payments).
In 1999 the debts of the Redemption Fund for
Inherited Liabilities were integrated into Fed-eral Government debt. Since then the debtsof the Redemption Fund for Inherited Liabil-ities have been financed directly out of theFederal budget. Since there is no longer anyspecific follow-up financing for debts of theRedemption Fund for Inherited Liabilities, itsdebts are redeemed through maturing secur-ities and their corresponding repayments.That is why the debts of the RedemptionFund for Inherited Liabilities are being re-duced relatively quickly: while remainingdebt stood at 5156 billion (DM305 billion) at
the end of 1998, it had already been reducedto578.7 billion by the end of July 2002. This
amount is made up primarily of bonds of theTreuhand agency ( 549 billion) as well as, for
example, loans against borrowers’ notes fromthe Debt-Processing Fund, the Treuhandagency and the Redemption Fund for Inherit-
ed Liabilities, and liabilities arising from se-curities issued jointly with the Federal Gov-ernment. The speedy reduction in debt refersonly to the individual debt items of the Re-demption Fund for Inherited Liabilities as atthe end of 1998. Since its debts are financedthrough the Federal Government’s gross bor-rowing, the overall indebtedness of the Fed-eral Government and its special funds doesnot decline at the same time. The debt instru-ments issued for refinancing purposes are nolonger attributed to the Redemption Fundfor Inherited Liabilities.
The statutory use of that part of the Bundes-
bank’s profit which exceeds 53.5 billion re-
duces the amount required to refinance ma-turing securities. This share – which amountedto57.7 billion this year – accrues to the Re-
demption Fund for Inherited Liabilities, there-by generating a surplus of the same amountwhich then serves to redeem the debt whichwould otherwise have been financed throughFederal Government securities. Redeemingthese debts in this manner ensures that grossFederal Government borrowing – which ismade up of net new borrowing plus the re-sidual amounts of those loans and Federal se-curities which mature in that particular finan-cial year – decreases by a correspondingamount.
These interrelationships illustrate that it is not
possible to finance additional expenditure by“suspending” redemptions of the Redemp-tion Fund for Inherited Liabilities withoutraising the indebtedness of the Federal Gov-ernment and its special funds or increasinggovernment deficits. However, that would re-quire statutory regulations permitting the useof a larger share of the Bundesbank profit oreven the whole of that profit for currentbudget financing. This would, however, leadto an increase in net borrowing and indebt-edness vis-à-vis the status quo.

10for33.7 of this amount and market manage-
ment operations for 31.3 billion. No redemp-
tions were made. The outstanding amount ofother Federal securities declined on balance.In the case of bonds, the new issue of 5%ten-year bonds with an allotment volume of39.2 billion was offset by the redemption of
two bonds with the same maturity ( 33.1 bil-
lion in the case of a railway bond and 37.7
billion in the case of a Federal bond (Bund)),both of which had an 8% coupon. Debt se-curities of the Currency Conversion Equalisa-tion Fund amounting to 31.1 billion were re-
deemed on schedule. No significant changesto the level of indebtedness were recordedfor those special funds not integrated intoFederal Government debt. Matured bankloans to the “German Unity” Fund werefinanced through a participation in the afore-
mentioned issue of ten-year bonds.
State government net borrowing was fairly
high in July ( 37.7 billion) and was significantly
more than the level in the earlier months ofthis year. Treasury notes issued by state gov-ernments raised 37.6 billion net, which was
the largest volume issued in any one month.As in the first six months of the year, the larg-est borrowers were the states of Berlin andNorth Rhine-Westphalia. Bank loans (exclud-ing short-term cash advances) redeemed bythe states totalled 30.4 billion on balance.
Local government appears to have againmarginally raised its indebtedness in July.
Federal Government borrowingIn August the Federal Government drew
313.5 billion net on the capital markets, 38.9
billion of which was required to refinance ma-turing securities. The volume of outstandingmoney market loans went down by 36.8 bil-
lion. Net Federal Government debt was con-sequently lowered by 32.2 billion.
The most significant single item of gross bor-
rowing was the follow-up auction of five-yearspecial Federal bonds (Bobls). 38.4 billion was
allocated with an average yield of 3.93%. To-gether with sales in the open market ( 30.6
billion) and market management operations(31.1 billion), the total volume of series 140
has now reached 310 billion. After deducting
redemptions, the outstanding amount ofBobls increased by 31.2 billion. The monthly

(3.24%) was 15 basis points lower than inthe previous month. The outstanding amountof Bunds fell by 30.8 billion as a result of mar-
ket management operations, and the out-standing amount of Schätze rose by 30.2 bil-
lion. Owing to the persistent weakness innew sales, Federal savings bonds were re-deemed to the amount of 30.7 billion net.
Securities markets
Bond marketIssuing activity in the German bond market
increased in July. Domestic borrowers issueddebt securities to a market value of 385.9 bil-
lion, compared with 365.0 billion in the previ-
ous month. After deducting redemptions andtaking due account of changes in issuers’holdings of their own bonds, net sales in-creased sharply to 317.6 billion from 34.1 bil-
lion in June. Sales of foreign bonds in Ger-many were also well up ( 310.4 billion), after
33.3 billion in June. As previously, most of
these bonds were denominated in euro. At328.1 billion, the amount raised from sales of
domestic and foreign bonds was thereforesignificantly higher in July than in the previousmonth ( 37.4 billion).
A major part of the amount raised in July ac-
crued to the public sector ( 312 billion com-
pared with 37.0 billion in June). The Federal
Government raised 38.9 billion net from sales
of its own bonds. It sold 35.2 billion net
worth of two-year Federal Treasury notes(Schätze), followed by ten-year bonds ( 32.3billion) and 30-year bonds ( 30.9 billion). The
outstanding amount of five-year special Fed-eral bonds (Bobls) and Federal savings bondswent up by 31.0 billion in each case.
1At the
same time the Federal Government re-deemed special fund bonds in the amount of34.2 billion. In July, the Land governments in-
creased their indebtedness in the bond mar-ket by 37.3 billion, again considerably more
than in June ( 32.0 billion).
Industrial bonds were sold in July to a net
value of 34.4 billion, compared with 30.2 bil-
lion in June. Net sales of these securitiestherefore exceeded the amount of fundsraised by the credit institutions, which onlyexpanded their borrowing in the bond marketby31.2 billion in July. In June, however, the
outstanding amount of bank debt securitieshad gone down by 33.0 billion. The low fig-
ure for net sales by banks was mainly due tonet redemptions of public Pfandbriefe ( 36.7
billion) and mortgage Pfandbriefe ( 32.0 bil-
lion). By contrast, sales of debt securities is-sued by specialised credit institutions raised36.9 billion and other bank bonds 33.0 bil-
lion.
No euro bonds were issued in July by non-
residents under the lead-management ofGerman institutions. Owing to high redemp-tions, the outstanding amount of thesebonds issued by non-residents, some of

In July foreign investors predominated on the
buyers’ side of the German bond market, in-creasing their bond portfolios by 320.9 bil-
lion, with private sector issuers accountingfor the bulk of this total ( 311.6 billion). Do-
mestic non-banks upped their investment inthe bond market by 310.6 billion, purchasing
35.9 billion of foreign debt securities. Their
net investment in domestic debt instrumentsamounted to 34.7 billion, almost all of which
was invested in bonds issued by private bor-rowers. The credit institutions reduced theirholdings of domestic debt instruments by37.9 billion. At the same time, they added
34.6 billion worth of bonds and notes to their
portfolios.Equity market
Issuing activity in the German equity market
remained subdued in July. Domestic enter-prises placed new shares to a market value of30.7 billion (June: 30.6 billion). German in-
vestors’ portfolios of foreign equities went upby35.9 billion on balance, somewhat less
than in June ( 37.9 billion). Overall, 36.6 bil-
lion of domestic and foreign paper was soldin the German equity market.
In July equities were bought primarily by do-
mestic non-banks ( 38.5 billion). On balance,
they mainly added foreign paper to theirportfolios ( 35.0 billion). By contrast, credit in-
stitutions sold shares amounting to 32.4 bil-
lion. Specifically, they reduced their portfolioof German equities by 33.3 billion net and
purchased foreign shares worth 30.9 billion.
Foreign investors acquired German sharesworth 30.5 billion in July, all of which were
portfolio investments.
Investment fund certificatesIn July domestic investment funds recorded
inflows of 33.6 billion. Funds open to the
general public and specialised funds benefit-ed to the same extent. Of the funds open tothe general public, open-end real estatefunds, to which 31.4 billion of new capital ac-
crued, led the field. Money market funds sold30.4 billion worth of investment fund certifi-
cates. Bond-based funds and mixed funds ex-panded by 30.1 billion each. By contrast,

from sales of domestic and foreign invest-ment fund certificates thus came to 35.1 bil-

As in the previous months, investment fund
certificates ( 35.9 billion) were purchased pri-
marily by domestic non-banks. Foreign invest-ors bought 30.3 billion worth of German in-

Balance of payments
Germany’s current account ran a surplus of
30.5 billion in July, 33.5 billion less than the
surplus in June. The main contributory factorwas a larger deficit on invisible current trans-actions with non-residents, which compriseservices, factor income and current transfers.
According to calculations by the Federal Stat-
istical Office, the trade surplus amounted to312.1 billion compared with 310.8 billion in
June. There was likewise a larger trade sur-plus in July than in June after the eliminationof seasonal factors ( 310.6 billion compared
with 39.8 billion). This development is due to
the fact that the seasonally adjusted declineof approximately 7
12% in the imports of
goods in July compared with the previousmonth was faster than the decline in the ex-ports of goods (-4
12%). This means that,
when compared with the second-quarteraverage, imports of goods declined by 4
12%
and exports of goods by 2%.Major items of the balance

14The remaining current transactions with non-
residents showed a deficit of 311.0 billion in
July, which was 34.5 billion more than in
June. A larger deficit on factor income ac-counted for the bulk of the increase ( 34.3 bil-
lion). This was due mainly to the fact that,normally, interest payments on public bondsare relatively large in July. However, net ex-penditure on cross-border services also rose(by 31.5 billion). By contrast, net current
transfers to non-residents fell by 31.2 billion.
In the field of financial transactions foreign in-
vestors again showed considerable interest inGerman securities in July. The outcome wasthat net capital imports arising from portfolioinvestment amounted to a total of 37.9 bil-
lion compared with 318.5 billion in June. In
the process non-resident investors spent321.6 billion in acquiring German paper in
July (June: 319.7 billion). Most of their de-
mand was for bonds and notes ( 314.6 bil-
lion), both public and private. They also in-vested 36.3 billion in German money market
paper but only 30.5 billion in shares. German
residents invested somewhat more heavilyagain in foreign paper, at 313.7 billion, in July
whereas in the previous month they hadbeen extremely restrained in their cross-border operations. The bulk of their portfolioinvestment ( 38.7 billion) was in bonds, most
of which were denominated in euro – as hasbeen the case for quite some time. In add-ition, German savers spent equal amounts(31.8 billion) in acquiring foreign shares and
money market paper and 31.5 billion in the
purchase of investment fund certificates.
In contrast to portfolio investment, direct in-
vestment resulted in net capital exports (of310.2 billion). German enterprises invested
310.1 billion in their foreign subsidiaries, with
the acquisition of participating interests inLuxembourg and Slovakia playing a particu-larly important role. Foreign proprietors with-drew 30.1 billion in funds from their branches
and subsidiaries domiciled in Germany.
Cross-border capital flows arising from non-
securitised credit transactions were fairlymoderate in July. For example, financial trans-actions undertaken by enterprises and indi-viduals with non-residents resulted in a netoutflow of 31.4 billion. Enterprises were
stocking up their balances with foreignbanks. Much the same is true of the publicsector, which exported 30.5 billion (net). By
contrast, German credit institutions recordednet capital imports of 311.1 billion in their
non-securitised external business, but thesewere more than offset by outflows of 315.0
billion from the Bundesbank. As usual, mostof this amount was in connection with bal-ances in the payments system TARGET.

– at transaction values – by 30.5 billion in July.Invisibles

15The performance
of German creditinstitutions in 2001In financial year 2001 the German
banking industry’s performance wasless than satisfactory. Following a de-cline in 2000, there was a further con-traction in both the operating resultand the profit for the financial year be-fore tax. Owing to developments onthe stock markets, in operating busi-ness this was mainly due to commissionbusiness and own-account trading.Furthermore, risk provision had againto be expanded considerably. By con-trast, interest business tended to havea stabilising effect on performance.Even so, the interest margin, ie theratio of net interest received to theaverage balance sheet total, fell to anew low. The increase in general ad-ministrative spending slowed downduring the year under review. All in all,the operating result after the valu-ation of loans and securities was morethan one-third down on the previousyear. Despite performance-boosting“extraordinary accounts” and lowertaxes on income and earnings, theprofit for the year, 510.4 billion, was
52.2 billion less than in 2000. Perform-
ance in the various categories of banksvaried considerably in line with theirbusiness structure. Following the pre-dictable trends to date, a furtherworsening of banking industry per-formance can be expected this year.

16Overview
The financial year 2001 was characterised by
falling prices on the equity markets and a de-terioration in the economic climate, particu-larly in the second half of the year. Both fac-tors put increased pressure on the perform-ance of the German banking industry, thatpressure having already been felt in 2000.The fall in stock market prices, for instance,led to a poorer result in commission businessand own-account trading. However, this wasoffset by a certain amount of relief generatedby interest business as customers demon-strated a renewed greater propensity to de-posit their resources with banks. Economicdevelopments were reflected primarily in afurther rise in risk provisioning accompaniedby a relatively greater reluctance on the partof enterprises and individuals to increase theirborrowing. The economic slowdown prob-ably also prompted the banking industry tobe more particular about the quality of itsloan portfolio.
Against this background the net interest re-
ceived in 2001 rose by 32.2 billion (2.9%)
after decreasing in 2000.
1This was due less
to factors relating to interest rates than to thegrowth of the average balance sheet totaland, in particular, changes in the balancesheet structure. For instance, the share ofDM

17non-banks’ bank deposits involving a lower
rate of interest increased slightly for the firsttime since the early 1990s, thus restrictingthe rise in interest paid. Nonetheless, theinterest margin, ie the ratio of net interest re-ceived to the average balance sheet total, fellback further to a new low of 1.12%. Al-though banks saw their surplus from commis-sion business dwindle by 32.8 billion in the
year under review, this was, at 325.3 billion,
still their second-best result to date. In add-ition to buoyant demand for bonds, pay-ments also had a stabilising effect. Grossearnings, ie the sum of the net income frominterest and commission business, decreasedslightly by 30.5 billion. General administrative
spending was up, although the annual rate ofincrease of 4.3% was more moderate than inprevious years. In the total, the partial operat-ing result declined by 33.9 billion to 323.4 bil-
lion.
Although it was down on 2000, the contribu-
tion made by own-account trading, 35.4 bil-
lion, was above average again in 2001. How-ever, this amount was generated primarily bythe big banks. Net other operating income orcharges rose by 31.6 billion to 33.6 billion.
Valuation charges connected with loan andsecurities business placed a considerable bur-den on performance. At 319.5 billion, these
charges were 33.6 billion more than in 2000.
This was mainly due to the unfavourable eco-nomic situation, which prompted Germanbanks to build up sizeable provisions for do-mestic lending business.

18312.9 billion, it was 37 billion lower than in
2000.
By contrast, the balance of the “extraordinary
accounts” enhanced the banks’ performanceslightly, going up from - 30.6 billion in 2000
to +31.2 billion. This was mostly attributable
to the sharp rise in the outcome of financialinvestment business and to higher extraordin-ary income. To this was added the release ofspecial reserves. In the year under review theGerman banks’ profit for the financial yearnonetheless shrank by 35.2 billion to 314.1
billion. Although a clear further reductionwas made in the burden of taxes on incomeand earnings – only 33.7 billion as opposed
to36.7 billion in 2000 – the profit for the fi-
nancial year after tax declined year on year by32.2 billion to 310.4 billion. In the year underreview 33.9 billion of this amount was set
aside as reserves, roughly the same amountas in 2000. In 2001 the balance sheet profitfell by just under one-quarter to 36.6 billion.
The poorer performance is also reflected inthe lower return on equity, this being definedas the ratio of pre-tax profit for the financialyear to the average equity capital as shownon the balance sheet
2; at 6.23% it was well
below the 2000 figure of 9.32%. The returnon equity after tax was only 4.59%, com-pared with 6.07% in 2000.
Current figures for the first half of the year
suggest that the performance can be expectedto deteriorate further in the current year. Thefactors which were already predominant in2001 are likely to become even more accentu-ated. Along with the further slump in priceson the equity markets, the main factor is therising number of company insolvencies, whichimplies a matching need for risk provisioning.Relatively speaking, interest business can prob-ably be expected to exert a comparativelystabilising influence on performance figuresagain in 2002. With regard to administrativespending, the first effects of the cost-cuttingprogrammes introduced in the course of lastyear are likely to be felt. Given the numbers ofjob cuts, which are quite high in some areas,this applies particularly to staff costs.

19though there was still little room for man-
oeuvre. Domestic credit institutions slightlyupped their profits, which had decreased inthe previous year by 32.2 billion (2.9%) to
379.1 billion. Relative to the total surplus in
operating business, the contribution made byinterest business went up for the first time ina long while, from 67.8% in 2000 to 69.7%.The amount of interest paid grew at a rate of3.4%, barely faster than interest received(3.3%). As the balance sheet total increasedat an average rate for the year of 5.6%, iemore strongly than net interest received, theinterest margin, as the ratio of the two, againdipped slightly as an average of all banksfrom 1.14% in 2000 to a new low of1.12%.
3The underlying balance sheet total used tocalculate the interest margin includes inter-bank business. This does not affect the netinterest received by the German banking in-dustry when viewed as an aggregate sincethe interest paid by the individual banks is off-set by the interest received and vice versa. By
contrast, if the balance sheet total is adjustedfor interbank business (2001: 31,861 billion),
the figures show that the “adjusted” interestmargin narrowed from 1.55% in 2000 to1.51% in the year under review.

3In 2001 the credit institutions’ net income received
from the remuneration of minimum reserve holdings at
the Bundesbank was 31,614 million (2000: 31,408 mil-
lion). Excluding this income, the interest margin would
have been 1.09%.

20corresponds more or less to that of the inter-
est margin calculated by traditional methods,as interbank business between the institu-tions covered by these statistics expanded in2001 at roughly the same pace as the corres-ponding balance sheet total. Interest businesshad hardly any effect on the decline in theinterest margin in 2001 as calculated by trad-itional methods.
In 2001 the slight rise in net interest received
is probably due less to interest-related factorsthan to the changes in the balance sheettotal and balance sheet structure. Althoughthe interest rate result was enhanced by thedevelopment of the yield curve, which be-came increasingly steeper as the year pro-gressed and lent support to income derivedfrom maturity transformation, it was under-mined by the persistently low rate of interest.
At all events, the (lagged) connection be-tween the interest rate level on the capitaland money markets and the interest marginis evident for 2001, too (see chart above).
5By
contrast, the net interest received was bol-stered by the rise in the average balancesheet total and by changes in the balancesheet structure. This primarily affected invest-ors’ comparatively strong preference for allo-cating funds to bank deposits.

21sector, with an annual growth rate of 2.2%,
was again down on the year.6Consumer
credit stagnated while housing loans andlending to enterprises expanded moderately.Despite favourable financing terms, the pro-pensity of enterprises and individuals to con-tract debt was obviously subdued, in particu-lar, by the bleak economic climate. The bank-ing industry also focused more closely on thequality of its loan portfolio. The net interestreceived tended to be boosted by loans tonon-banks abroad granted by the foreignbranches of German banks (+10%).
There was a moderate increase in interest
received mainly because the income fromlending and money market transactions roseby no more than 2.4%, or 37 billion. These
two areas of business account for the bulk(almost four-fifths) of the total interest re-ceived. The growth in current income fromequities, participating interests and shares inaffiliated enterprises was similarly weak.Declining income from shares in affiliatedenterprises contrasted with an increase incurrent earnings from equities. The interestreceived from debt securities and Debt Regis-ter claims grew more rapidly, by 34.3 billion
or 7.2%.

22clear impression on the liability-side activities
of the German credit institutions. The shareof non-banks’ bank deposits in relation to thebalance sheet total increased slightly for thefirst time since the early 1990s. In particular,there was a significant topping-up of short-term liabilities vis-à-vis domestic non-banks,which tend to involve a lower rate of inter-est, and especially of overnight deposits(+18
12%). Accordingly, the credit institutions
needed to draw less on other, more expensivesources of funds. The growth of bearer debtsecurities (up by just over 4%, from +8% in2000) or interbank funds (+2%, from +9
12%
in 2000) was far slower; their share in the bal-ance sheet total stagnated. The rise in interestpaid was again held back by a perceptible de-crease in short-term interest rates, particularlyin the second half of the year, as liability-sidebusiness shows a greater percentage of short-term or variable-yield items.
As already mentioned, the increase in de-
mand for securitised forms of investment(equities, bonds, investment fund certificates)which has been observed in recent years didnot maintain the same momentum in theperiod under review. Even so, it would not beappropriate at this juncture to assume thatthis is associated with a permanent change incustomers’ investment patterns. Rather, thecomparatively rapid growth in bank depositsis probably closely related to uncertainties onthe capital markets. We need to wait and seehow much ground securitised investment re-gains as time goes by. A more marked growthin deposits would, in any case, have only alimited dampening effect on interest paid bycredit institutions since a keener yield aware-ness among investors has also made it more
expensive to use customer deposits for refi-nancing purposes. In 2001 German credit in-stitutions increasingly remunerated overnightdeposits – which expanded sharply – at a ratein line with the money market.
In 2001 most categories of banks saw a con-
tinuation of the downward course whichinterest rates had been taking for some years.Developments were particularly unfavourableamong the regional institutions of credit co-operatives whose extensive interbank andwholesale banking business leads in any caseto narrow interest margins. After a percep-tible improvement in their interest business in2000 (brought about by exceptionally highcurrent earnings from shares in affiliated en-terprises), these income components shrankback to normal proportions in 2001, causinginterest margins to move clearly in the oppos-ite direction. Of the remaining categories ofbanks which, owing to their business struc-ture, have a similarly small interest margin,theLand banks recorded a slight improve-
ment in their net interest received (from0.56% to 0.60%), reflecting the marked in-crease in interest received from lending andmoney market transactions. By contrast, de-velopments at mortgage banks followed thegeneral trend. The comparatively high inter-est margins at savings banks and cooperativebanks, whose prime business is in retail trans-actions, also narrowed further. For savingsbanks they shrank from 2.33% in 2000 to2.27% in 2001 and for credit cooperationsfrom 2.45% to 2.41%. Rising income frominterest business was offset by a similar in-crease in expenditure.

23interest margin also decreased from 0.94%
to 0.89%. By contrast, the credit institutionscategorised as “regional banks and othercommercial banks”, which had previouslybeen particularly affected by statistical reclas-sification, made a distinct recovery in terms oftheir interest result, with the interest marginwidening from 1.72% to 1.83%.
Net commissions received
In financial year 2001 the German credit insti-
tutions were unable to follow through onthe record commission business achieved in2000. Net commissions received were downby32.8 billion (-9.9%) to 325.3 billion, which
was nonetheless the second-best result everachieved in the German banking sector. In re-lation to the average balance sheet total, the
result from commission business contractedfrom 0.42% in 2000 to 0.36%, therebyroughly matching the average in recent years.The decrease was mainly caused by income-related developments; it is made up of a 32.6
billion decline in commissions received and a30.2 billion increase in commissions paid. Net
commissions received have become slightlyless important than net interest received. Al-though the ratio of the two fell from 36.5%in 2000 to 32%, it was still well above earlierlevels (25.1% in 1998 and 28.9% in 1999).Commission business was thus a significantsource of income for the German credit insti-tutions even despite the decline during theperiod under review.% %

24The unfavourable commissions result was
shaped mainly by the weak demand for equi-ties. At 33.28 billion, the turnover of shares
traded on German stock markets was welldown on 2000 ( 34.62 billion); in addition, the
volume of resources allocated to share-basedfunds, 35.1 billion, compared with 338.5 bil-
lion in 2000, all but collapsed completely.Revenue from placement business was alsodown; only 21 IPOs in 2001 (as opposed to152 in 2000) and equity issues of 317.6 bil-
lion compared with 322.7 billion in 2000
point to a clear loss of momentum. By con-trast, stronger demand for fixed-interest se-curities, despite the accompanying narrowermargins, pushed up income from commissionand placement business. In 2001 domesticnon-banks purchased 3121.6 billion worth
of bonds, nearly twice as much as in 2000(365.1 billion). The amount raised from bond-
based funds went up slightly to 325.4 billion
(from 321.5 billion in 2000).
Other components of commissions received
mostly had a stabilising effect on the growthof net commissions received. This applies topayment transactions in particular, as well asto commissions earned on credit processingand, at some banks, on guarantee business.With regard to specialised funds business,where margins are relatively small in anycase, the amount of funds attracted was stillhigh despite the decline in share prices,meaning that commission income has prob-ably changed little. Savings banks, in particu-lar, are likely to have benefited from risingincome from intermediation business, andparticularly from loan contracts for buildingpurposes.
The downturn in net commissions received
affected the various categories of banks todiffering degrees. Commercial banks, for in-stance, were most affected, in keeping withtheir share in the total net commissions re-ceived; they experienced income shortfalls of31.6 billion, or just under 60% of the de-
crease. Patterns of development at the bigbanks and regional banks included in the stat-istics varied. While at the big banks the de-cline in net commissions received was belowthe average for the banking industry as awhole, the regional banks recorded a some-what sharper decline. The cooperative banksalso experienced an over-proportionate declineof30.5 billion in net commissions received.

Administrative expenditure
General administrative spending rose in the
year under review by 33.4 billion or 4.3% to
381.0 billion, ie far more slowly even than in
preceding years. Together with the decline innet income from commission business, thisled, despite an increase in the net interest re-ceived, to a decrease of 33.9 billion in the
partial operating result, taking it to 323.4 bil-
lion, the lowest figure since 1992. This wasequivalent to 0.33% (2000: 0.41%) of theaverage balance sheet total and thus repre-sented a new low. The impact of reorganisa-tion and cost-cutting programmes had notyet been translated into lower costs in the
year under review. The big banks were re-sponsible for half of the increase in adminis-trative spending alone and the Land banks
for just under one-quarter. Administrativespending also increased distinctly at the re-gional and other commercial banks andparticularly at the credit institutions majority-owned by foreign banks. By contrast, it waslargely stable at savings banks and coopera-tive banks when compared with 2000.
Staff costs went up by 31 billion or 2.5%, far
more slowly than other administrative ex-penditure (+ 32.3 billion or +6.5%). Unlike
previous years, it was possible to restraingrowth in staff costs in the year under review.The number of employees in the Germanbanking industry fell by nearly 5,600 orStructural data on German credit institutions

Slight increase

26around 0.8%, the first decrease since 1996.
At just over 728,000, the number of employ-ees was even slightly below the 1997 figure(see table on page 25). Most of the job cuts– just under 4,400 – were in the private bank-ing sector. The credit cooperatives reducedthe number of their employees by 1,100 andthe savings banks by 1,300. The Land banks
added just under 1,000 employees (2.3%) totheir overall workforce, including in the field
of investment banking.
The rise in the agreed rates of pay of just over
2% in the banking industry as a wholepushed up staff costs. This is especially true ofthe private banking sector and the coopera-tive banks, where pay increases of 3% tookeffect, but applies less to the public sectorbanks, where pay rises were of a more mod-erate 1.3%.
Although the non-staff operating costs or
“other administrative spending” rose by justover 6
12%o r 32.3 billion to 338.0 billion
overall, ie far more slowly than in 2000 (justunder 12
12%), in relation to staff costs they
continued to increase slightly. Half (just over31.2 billion) of the rise in this expenditure
was attributable to the big banks, whichupped their other administrative spending by11
12% compared with 2000. By comparison,
the increase at the Land banks was stronger
still ( 30.5 billion or 17%). In particular, an im-
pact was made by investment in the IT sector,particularly in the expansion of electronicchannel of distribution and data processing.In addition, the trend towards outsourcingbusiness units continued, which led to a shiftfrom staff costs to other administrativespending in their statement of income. A fur-ther factor was investment made for the pur-pose of restructuring the branch network,particularly among savings banks.
The consolidation process among banks and
their branch networks which had been underway for some years continued in 2001. Thenumber of institutions thus fell by 8% or 216%

Net profit or net loss on financial
operations
Although the banks failed in the year under
review to maintain the exceptionally good re-sult of 36.4 billion in own-account trading
achieved in 2000, they nonetheless recordedan above-average income of 35.4 billion or
0.08% of the average balance sheet total.However, this income was concentrated evenmore markedly on the big banks than in2000, these earning 34.9 billion or roughly
90% of the banks’ total trading figures.Own-account trading by the big banks morethan offset the negative balances in the par-tial operating result and the net income ornet charges from the valuation of assets. Theuncertain market climate put a noticeabledamper on the share trading result for mostof the big banks but, to an extent, they morethan made up for this, especially in the areasof money market and foreign exchange deal-ings, derivatives trading and, in some cases,bond trading, too. By contrast, in the othercategories of banks the trading result de-clined and for some of them the decreasewas sharp. The regional banks and othercommercial banks even recorded a negativefigure of 3191 billion. Credit institutions ma-jority-owned by foreign banks accounted for
three-quarters of this amount alone.
Net other operating income or charges
The positive figure for net other operating in-
come or charges rose in the year under re-view by 31.6 billion to 33.6 billion. The in-
crease in other operating income in the strict-er sense from 31.7 billion to 38.4 billion was
a crucial factor. The other operating chargesin the narrower sense were, however, almostunchanged across all categories of bankstaken together. The other taxes – unrelatedto income – that are also included in the netfigure, the gross result for the credit coopera-tives’ transactions in goods and the incomeor depreciation in leasing business changedonly slightly.
Operating result before the valuation
of assets and the cost/income ratio
The operating result before net income or net
charges from the valuation of assets (ie totalnet income from operating business after ad-ministrative costs have been deducted, butbefore risk provisioning) fell in the year underreview by 33.4 billion to just over 332.4 bil-
lion. Again in relation to the balance sheettotal, the operating result for nearly all cat-egories of banks was down – for some con-siderably; only the Land banks managed to
increase their operating result before valu-ation of assets to an extent that was virtuallyin line with their balance sheet total.

28The cost/income ratio developed unfavour-
ably again in 2001, with administrativespending going up and operating resultsgoing down. As defined narrowly (expend-iture to gross earnings, ie net interest and netcommissions received), the ratio increasedfrom 74.0% to 77.6% and in a broad de-finition (gross earnings plus own-accounttrading and other operating income orcharges) from 68.4% to 71.4% (see table onpage 29). This marked a continuation of theupward trend in recent years. The growth ofsome of these figures varied quite consider-ably across the individual categories of bank.While the ratio of costs to operating incomecontinued to increase significantly at the bigbanks and the central institutions of coopera-tive banks, in particular, and rose slightly forthe other categories of bank, this ratio deteri-orated considerably among the branches of
foreign banks.
Net income or net charges from the
valuation of assets
As in 2000, the German banks expanded
their risk provision perceptibly. This placed aheavy burden on their performance. For in-stance, the cost of evaluating loans and ad-vances, other assets and securities went upby33.6 billion from 315.9 billion in 2000 to
319.5 billion in 2001 (see chart on page 30).
Write-downs and value adjustments increasedby34.4 billion to 322.3 billion. These were
offset by value adjustments and release ofprovisions amounting to 32.7 billion, which
was slightly more than in the previous year.Operating result before net income or net charges from the valuation of assets*

made of the cross-offsetting option permis-sible under section 340 (f) (3) of the GermanCommercial Code. The credit institutionsmade a clear reduction in their taxed hiddenreserves, held in accordance with section 340(f) of the German Commercial Code. At thesame time 31.2 billion was allocated to the
fund for general banking risks (in accordancewith section 340 (g) of the CommercialCode).

In 2001 by far the largest proportion of thevaluation expenditure was again accountedfor by domestic lending business. The mainfactor here was the increase in company in-solvencies. These rose by 14.3% to 32,278,with trade and manufacturing along with theconstruction industry being most affected. Al-though the number of consumer insolvencieswent up sharply, at a rate of 26.7%, thesedevelopments are unlikely to have played akey role in terms of risk provisioning by theGerman credit institutions since the share ofconsumer credit in total lending to domesticenterprises and individuals is comparativelysmall (end-2001: just over 9.9%). In 2001valuation expenditure on foreign loans alsoincreased, particularly as a result of the ten-sions in South America, after risk provisioningfor foreign loans had been significantly re-duced in the previous year.

30of assets, were likewise perceptibly higher in
the year under review. Overall, they were33.3 billion compared with 31.4 billion for
2000.
In 2001 increased valuation charges mainly
concerned those categories of banks whichoperate internationally and in the field ofwholesale banking. There was an especiallysharp increase at the Land banks, for in-
stance, but the commercial banks, particular-ly the big banks, also added perceptibly totheir risk provision. By contrast, the banks in-volved in retail business, such as savingsbanks and credit cooperatives, undertook arelatively moderate expansion of their valu-ation expenditure in 2001. The central institu-tions of cooperative banks, which had madeabove-average increases in their risk provisionin 2000, took less far-reaching precautionary
measures in 2001.
All in all, the burden imposed by greater risk
provisioning led to a reduction of 37.0 billion
or just over one-third in the operating resultof the German banking industry as a whole;in 2001 the operating result was 312.9 bil-
lion.
Net other and extraordinary income or
charges
The balance of the “extraordinary accounts”
improved from - 30.6 billion in 2000 to 31.2
billion in the year under review and wastherefore back in the black, after negativebalances in the previous two years. This wasmainly due to a sharp increase in the profitsfrom financial investment business
8from
30.6 billion (2000) to 34.0 billion (2001) as
well as to extraordinary income, which morethan offset the increase in charges incurredthrough loss transfers and the derived profits.The renewed partial release of special re-serves in the order of 31.5 billion was a fur-
ther sustaining factor; these were mainly setup in 1999 for release between 2000 and2003 with a corresponding effect on earn-ings.

31to the result achieved by the big banks. By
contrast, the increase in extraordinary incomewas focused on the regional banks and othercommercial banks and essentially on one spe-cific institution which released provisions inthe area of real estate funds. Of the chargesincurred through loss transfers, which wentup by 32.0 billion to 32.8 billion, the big
banks accounted for 30.7 billion, the regional
banks and other commercial banks for 30.7
billion and the Land banks for 30.6 billion.
Losses from subsidiaries operating in the realestate sector were reflected in these figures.More than half ( 30.4 billion) of the increase in
derived profits was attributable to the creditinstitutions majority-owned by foreign banks.If all categories of banks are viewed together,the big banks, in particular, stabilised theirperformance with an increase of 32.1 billionin the balance of the “extraordinary ac-
counts”, while, with the exception of the co-operative banks, lower or negative balancesunder these items placed an additional bur-den on the other categories of banks.
Taxes on income and earnings, profit for
the financial year
For the banking industry as a whole, the im-
pact of the poorer operating result on thebanking industry’s profit for the financial yearbefore tax was only slightly alleviated by theresult of the “extraordinary accounts”. At314.1 billion, the profit for the financial year
before tax was 35.2 billion, or just over one-

32commercial banks as well as central institu-
tions of cooperative banks, while dippingonly slightly at big banks and credit coopera-tives. The mortgage banks upped their profitfor the year before tax by more than half. Asan average of the German banks, return onequity declined significantly from 9.32% to6.23% (see table above).
In 2001, taxes on income and earnings
reached a low not seen since the early 1980s;this can only be partly explained by the sharpdownturn in revenue. In addition, changes intax law were a major factor, as they had beenin 2000.
10Overall, taxes on income and earn-
ings fell by 33.0 billion to 33.7 billion. The tax
ratio decreased again in the year under re-view from 42% (1999) and 35% (2000) tojust over 26%. As in 2000, the big banks’ in-dividual annual accounts recorded total tax
receipts of 30.4 billion. This was primarily the
result of one institution’s releasing provisionsfor taxation amounting to 30.9 billion; these
had been set aside to cover deferred taxes oncapital gains and were released in accordancewith the tax exemption for these profitswhich came into effect in 2002. The Land
banks, some of which also released provisionsfor deferred taxation, also saw a reduction of31.1 billion in taxes on income and earnings
compared with 2000, taking the final figureto30.3 billion.
All in all, the profit for the financial year after
tax, 310.4 billion, was 32.2 billion down onReturn on capital of individual categories of banks*

47Productivity
developmentsin GermanyThe extent to which an economy grows
and prospers is largely determined bychanges in productivity. In Germanythe rate of productivity increased muchmore slowly in the 1990s than in earlierdecades. At the same time, however,the rise in output per hour workedwas, at an average of 2.0%, discerniblyfaster than the rise in output per per-son employed, which was 1.4% perannum. Even so, Germany is less suc-cessful than, say, the United States inincorporating the factor labour intothe production process, with the resultthat a hard core of structural un-employment has been formed. By con-trast, the degree to which capital, as afactor of production, and total factorproductivity have contributed togrowth is not much different from thatin other industrial countries. The rateof labour productivity is partly deter-mined by changes in real labour costs.If these rise too quickly, labour tends tobe replaced by capital, and the “em-ployment threshold”, ie the growthrate at which employment begins to in-crease, also rises. An international com-parison shows that in 2001 output perperson employed was significantlylower in Germany – as in other westEuropean countries – than in theUnited States. However, there wereonly relatively small differences in theoutput per hour worked by each em-ployed person. Even so, the analysissuggests that there is a need for actionon the part of economic policymakers.

48Aspects of output developments
in Germany
The outlook for productivity in Germany was
favourable at the beginning of the 1990s.German reunification and the opening-up ofcentral and eastern Europe appeared to pro-vide new opportunities for greater specialisa-tion in larger markets and consequently amore rapid increase in productivity. Therewere additional grounds for optimism in themiddle of the decade. These were embodiedin the term “new economy”: new improvedtechnologies – especially in the fields of infor-mation and communications – were seen as ameans of accelerating the increase in prod-uctivity and thereby enhancing the outputpotential of the German economy. Yet theseexpectations were not fulfilled. The realisa-tion that, even by international standards, the
growth in production and productivity wasonly slight ultimately led to the belief that interms of growth Germany was at the bottomof the euro-area league. Changes in product-ivity will be outlined below, and possible de-terminants will be analysed in an attempt toexplain cause and effect.
The rates of increase in macroeconomic out-
put and in productivity per person employedshow a similar trend over the long term (seethe adjacent chart). During the past threedecades there has been a general tendencyfor both rates to decline, albeit with sharpfluctuations. The downturn in the productiv-ity trend was interrupted in the second half ofthe 1980s and again as a result of the boomfollowing reunification.
The degree of progress in productivity can be

By definition, real gross domestic product(GDP) per head of the population – apartfrom demographic influences – can be div-ided into hourly productivity, working hoursper person employed, employed persons inrelation to the members of the workforce(employment rate) and members of the work-force in relation to the population of workingage (rate of participation in the labour force).It becomes clear during the whole of theperiod observed that major factors contribut-ing to the increase in material living standardsChange from previous year

49played a greater role in the United States
than in Germany. Not only did productivityrise more rapidly in the United States; a largerpercentage of the workforce was also actual-ly employed. Furthermore, the average num-ber of hours worked in the United States re-mained more or less constant whereas in Ger-many the number of hours worked per per-son employed fell substantially. The differ-ences in employment ratios are particularlystriking. In the 1990s the United States re-corded a rise of 2 percentage points to about95% in this ratio – calculated on the basis ofstandardised data – whereas the ratio in Ger-many declined by 2 percentage points to92

Problems of definition and measurement
Measuring increases in productivity is fraught
with a number of terminological, conceptualand empirical difficulties.
2Generally speak-
ing, productivity in the sense of a measure ofefficiency for a given factor of production isdefined as the output-input ratio. It is there-fore an indicator of how much a unit of thatfactor of production contributes to the pro-duction process.
3
Regarding the numerator of the ratio, caremust be taken to ascertain whether the rateof productivity refers to the volume of outputthat includes inputs or to the gross valueadded by an enterprise, economic sector oreconomy. There is a risk of double-counting ifthe output figure is used. If one economicsector manufactures only semi-finished prod-ucts (eg leather) and another only finishedproducts (eg shoes), adding the total inputs
and outputs of both sectors would give a mis-leading result with respect to the total outputof the economic sectors concerned becausethe flow of intermediate products (leather inthe example cited) would be counted twice,ie as the output in the first sector and as theinput in the second sector.

owing to a lack of space is the productivity of natural re-
sources. For example, the Council of Experts calculates
an energy intensity for economic output as a whole. See

50tomary to determine rates of productivity on
the basis of the values added, ie after deduct-ing the inputs.
5
If measures of productivity are to be interpret-ed meaningfully, inputs have to be independ-ent from output. However, this requirement isnot always fully met. The treatment of thepublic sector in the national accounts is aclassic example of this. Here the value addedis measured in terms of the inputs, ie on thebasis of employee remuneration and assum-ing an estimated increase in productivity. It istherefore often advisable not to include thislarge sector when calculating aggregatedmeasurements.
6
It is also appropriate for a longer-term com-parison to determine productivity on the basisof price-adjusted data. In this case the resultis also influenced by the method of price ad-justment used, and all the problems of deflat-ing have a direct effect on the measurements.The main difficulties lie in taking adequate ac-count of the changes in product quality. Forexample, price reductions on goods in the in-formation and communications technologysector have been statistically much greater inthe United States during the past few yearsthan in Europe. This divergence can be ex-plained to some extent by differences in themethod of price adjustment.
7
Levels of productivity for labour as a factor ofproduction can be calculated using alterna-tive measures of employment, namely outputper person employed and output per hourworked. Differences may arise in the waythese measures change owing, for example,to reductions in working hours or an increase
in the spread of part-time working. Depend-ing on the aim of the analysis, efforts can alsobe made to take account of quality changesin the factor labour. For example, studiesundertaken on the United States indicate thatthe volume of labour is increasingly reflectingactivities for which a higher qualification isnecessary.
8If measures of labour productivity
are to be used to analyse the labour market,it has to be borne in mind that so-called mar-ginal productivity is the important measure.However, this coincides with the averagelevel of productivity only under fairly specificassumptions.
9
In the case of capital as a factor of productionthere is the difficulty that – analogous to thevolume of labour – it is actually the “services”derived from the capital stock which shouldbe measured.
10As these cannot be directly
monitored, however, it is often assumed for
5The problem also exists at the macroeconomic level be-
cause large volumes of inputs are often imported in open
economies.
6The real estate sector is likewise often excluded from
the calculations as the total value of housing added in
this sector is established and estimates are necessary for
the value added in the case of owner-occupied dwell-
ings.

51simplicity’s sake that the services are propor-
tional to the level of capital held. Anotherproblem in measuring the factor capital isthat capital goods are installed at differenttimes. If the productivity calculation is to beused to estimate the output potential, it maybe necessary to take account of the hetero-geneity of capital goods as far as their (rela-tive) efficiency in different “vintages” is con-cerned.
11
If measures of productivity are to be interpret-ed as measurements of prosperity, it wouldalso be necessary to take into account thatpart of the output must be used to maintainthe capital stock.
12It may therefore be advis-
able to base calculations on net value addedor net productivity. However, in this case, too,the ability to interpret (partial) factor-related
levels of productivity, ie productivity levels cal-culated for individual factors of production, islimited. The reason is that total output alwaysdepends on the volumes used, the factorcombination and the quality of all factors andnot just on the particular factor being ob-served at any one time.
A comparison of the annual average rates of
change in selected productivity measure-ments for Germany between 1992 and 2001(see the adjacent table) illustrates the signifi-cance of conceptual differences. As expected,the productivity values rose faster than thecorresponding ratios based on price-adjusteddata. The growth in labour productivity is alsolargely dependent on the definitions of theemployment variables chosen. For example,output per hour, at 2.0% per annum, rosediscernibly faster than real GDP per personemployed (1.4% per annum). By contrast,
the productivity of capital shows a negativetrend over the period under review. The sali-ent point here is that production in Germanyhas become more capital intensive, ie jobshave been accompanied by an ever increasinguse of capital.Labour and capital productivity in the

52Progress in productivity
and its components
The trend in the productivity of labour is
often obscured by cyclical factors. Cyclicalfluctuations in productivity per person em-ployed are closely correlated to cyclical fluctu-ations in total economic output, and there islittle time lag between them (see the chartabove).
13The productivity of labour therefore
follows a pronounced pro-cyclical course.However, the interpretation of this finding iscontroversial. It can be taken as proof thatchanges in productivity are of great signifi-cance for cyclical developments. However,measurement problems and the customary“hoarding” of employees in periods of eco-nomic weakness point in the other direction.Even so, emphasis will be given in what fol-lows to productivity trends over the medium
and longer term rather than to cyclical as-pects.
More information on this issue can be ob-
tained by using Solow growth accounting.Here economic growth is attributed to the ef-fects of changes in labour and capital as fac-tors of production and to a residual compon-ent – which is often defined as total factorproductivity and can be regarded as a meas-ure for technical progress.
14In order to carry
out such a breakdown, however, the incomeshares that accrue to the factors of produc-tion must be known.
15Another important
point here is the definition of the factor la-bour. If it is broadly defined, it includes notonly employees’ income but also an imputedentrepreneurial remuneration. Accordingly, asmaller share of total income accrues to thefactor capital.

13The cyclical component is calculated on the basis of
productivity per person employed using a band-pass filter
as demonstrated by M Baxter and R G King (1999), Meas-
uring Business Cycles: approximate band-pass filters for
economic time series, The Review of Economics and Stat-
istics 81, p 575-593. All fluctuations that last for more
than two years but less than eight years were regarded
here as being cyclical.
14For this procedure see also Deutsche Bundesbank
(2001), Factor prices, employment and capital stock in
Germany: results of a simulation study, Monthly Report,
July 2001, p 49-61, especially p 54.
15Assuming that there is unrestricted competition on
the goods and factor markets and constant returns to
scale, the income shares of the factors of production are
equivalent to the partial threshold levels of productivity
of the factors of production and add up to 1.
16Another possible theoretical assumption is that the in-
come shares attributable to the factor capital should also
include payment for the use of human capital. In this
case the capital stock would have to be defined different-
ly, and the share of the factor capital increased according-
ly. See G Mankiw, D H Romer and D N Weil (1992), A
contribution to the empirics of economic growth, The

53Quite apart from this problem of definition
the Solow growth accounting for Germanybetween 1992 and 2001 shows a fairly stablepattern (see the adjacent table). For example,the (arithmetical) contribution which the fac-tor labour makes to growth is negative be-cause the number of hours worked has fallen.This finding illustrates once again that em-ploying the factor labour more intensively inthe production process represents a key chal-lenge for Germany. Instead of this, the coun-try is forming a hard core of structural un-employment, a development which is alsotypical of a few other continental Europeaneconomies. By contrast, the factor labour inthe United States and in various EU countrieshas been able to make a sizeable contributionto economic growth.
17Radical reforms of job
allocation, wage formation and the social se-curity systems appear necessary so that thefactor labour no longer impedes GDP growthbut, instead, strengthens it. This is all themore urgent given the fact that the age struc-ture of the German population is developingless favourably than in other industrial coun-tries. That alone will check the momentum ofgrowth.
The contribution which the factor capital
makes to growth in Germany is more or lessthe same as in other industrial countries. Byway of qualification, however, it must be saidthat productivity in Germany as a whole is stillbelow that of other European countries orthe average of the industrial countries. This isdue to the persistently low level of productiv-ity in eastern Germany. Seen from this aspect,one might have expected that Germanywould be expanding its capital stock morequickly than these countries. Any contribu-
tion to growth by the factor capital that issimply in line with that in other countries istherefore really inadequate.
The extent to which total factor productivity
actually reflects technical progress and thefactors that influence the contribution of thiscomponent to growth play an important rolein assessing the outlook for growth in Ger-many. It must be emphasised, however, thattotal factor productivity is determined as a re-sidual which therefore also represents aSolow growth accounting for alter-
native shares of income attributed tocapital as a factor of production

54measure of our lack of knowledge.18For ex-
ample, all measurement errors and inaccur-acies or classification problems in connectionwith the other factors of production are re-flected in this variable.
Even so, academic studies provide important
information on the determinants of thissource of prosperity. For example, there is em-pirical evidence that new technology is intro-duced and widely applied more slowly in theEuropean economies than, say, in the UnitedStates.
19Another factor is that in the United
States the manufacture of high-tech goodscontributes more to value added than in Eur-ope. A study by the European Central Bankfound
20that the spread of new technology
was still making no major macroeconomiccontribution to the acceleration in productiv-ity growth in the euro area. However, it as-
sumed that the importance of this factorwould become greater in future.
An economic policy which encourages innov-
ation and technical progress as well as therapid spread of new knowledge and skills canresult in a faster increase in total factor prod-uctivity. Structural reforms on the goods mar-kets improve the conditions for productivitygrowth.
21A cross-section comparison of
20 OECD countries indicated, for example,that a reduction in trade barriers or a de-crease in the plethora of regulations on thegoods markets has a favourable effect ontotal factor productivity. The detrimental im-pact of goods market regulations on product-ivity momentum is also documented in a newOECD study.

55United States in the second half of the 1990s
reflected the impact of a new economy.What is overlooked here, however, are thecomparatively restrictive assumptions onwhich the usual interpretation of this prod-uctivity measurement is based.
23If other no
less plausible assumptions are made (for ex-ample, that technical progress cannot bemonitored directly), substantial deviations ap-pear in the estimates of total factor product-ivity. This is also true when total factor prod-uctivity is calculated on the basis of develop-ments in real factor costs.
24If one considers
that in the United States the introduction ofnew technology is accompanied by increasedinvestment in information and communica-tions technology goods, it is likely that thefactor capital played a substantial role as the“vehicle” for technical progress.
Productivity developments
and structural change
Macroeconomic productivity is influenced not
only by the change in productivity in the indi-vidual economic sectors but also by changesin the respective ratios of sectoral employ-ment to overall employment and of sectoralvalue added to overall value added. If thegrowth rate of labour productivity in Ger-many in the period from 1992 to 2001 isbroken down in this respect (see the adjacentexplanatory notes), it emerges that theThe “shift-share” breakdown of therate of change in labour productivity
It is possible to determine how much of the
change in labour productivity is due to the sec-toral structure change by carrying out a “shift-share” analysis.

tion for determining the rate of change in labourproductivity in the economy as a whole (^yt) is the
starting point for this observation.

56“structural change” component becomes
relatively significant (see the table on page 54).This finding is surprising because it is at vari-ance with the results in other periods and inother countries. It therefore appears that withrespect to the growth process in Germany arelatively rapid cross-sector structural changehas been a significant factor. The structuralchange effect is positive, ie employment andvalue added ratios increased in economic sec-tors with higher average productivity. This ap-plies, for example, to enterprise-related ser-vice providers and the financial sector.
The impact of sectoral structural change on
the increase in labour productivity throughoutthe economy also helps to explain the rela-tively slow growth in eastern Germany. Thechart above shows the comparative levels ofproductivity and real wage costs in eastern
Germany as a percentage of western levels.Two tendencies become apparent here. First-ly, the east-west ratio of wage costs was sig-nificantly above the productivity gap through-out the period under review. This exerted tre-mendous pressure on enterprises to reducejobs and continues to represent a core prob-lem of the east German labour market. Sec-ondly, it is striking that the initially rapid con-vergence in productivity slowed down dis-cernibly after the mid-1990s and subsequent-ly came to a standstill. Consequently, the eastGerman productivity gap remained consider-able and ultimately amounted to approxi-mately 40% if measured in terms of the westGerman level. Growth accounting indicatesthat a lower level of total factor productivityis largely the reason for eastern Germany’slagging behind. Overall factor endowment,by contrast, is playing a minor role.
25Such a
finding suggests that deficits still exist in thecase of infrastructure and in the opportunitiesfor improving the organisation of labour; thecomparatively small average size of busi-nesses and the sectoral structure could alsobe important factors.
Productivity and the labour market

mixed blessing, depending on the labourmarket situation. On the one hand, there arefears that there could be “growth withoutas a percentage of the west German level

57jobs”, ie that the increase in labour productiv-
ity could be too fast. On the other hand,rapid rates of productivity growth create add-itional real allocation opportunities and en-able incomes to grow quickly and workinghours to be reduced. What is often over-looked here, however, is the fact that the la-bour market and productivity change areinterdependent: a permanently excessive risein wage costs creates incentives to replace la-bour with capital or, alternatively, to reducejobs where productivity is low or to shift themabroad. As a result, the increase in theamount of capital used for domestic output(capital deepening) exceeds the amount sug-gested by autonomous technical progress.This effect can be illustrated using the Solowmethod mentioned above: the rate of changein labour productivity can be expressed as thesum of the rate of total factor productivityand the (weighted) capital deepening. Theadjacent chart shows the outcome of such abreakdown for Germany during the periodbetween 1992 and 2001.
26It is clear that a
not insignificant proportion of the increase inlabour productivity may be traced back to thiscapital deepening.
Productivity growth also determines the “em-
ployment threshold”, ie that particular rate ofgrowth in real GDP at which the level of netemployment begins to increase. This thresh-old is not a natural constant but, instead, de-pends on a number of conditions. The mostimportant of these conditions is presumablythe change in the wage level followed by thewage structure. The more the general wagerise exceeds a hypothetical neutral rate, thehigher the “employment threshold” (see theexplanatory notes on page 59). However, the
measured growth in productivity must not beused without qualification as a measure forwage increases that ensure employment. In-stead, the growth in labour productivity is anendogenous variable which has to be adjust-ed to take account of the “dismissal product-ivity”, ie the rise in productivity that is due tothe wage-induced reduction in labour utilisa-tion.
27
The “employment threshold” as it is under-stood here refers to gainful employment anddenotes the rate of growth in real GDP atwhich the number of persons employed starts%

58to rise. This “critical value” fell in Germany
from about 234% on an average of the 1970s
to about 112% in the 1990s. It is certain that
this development is partly due to the general-ly more moderate wage increases in the1990s compared with the 1970s. Anotherrelevant point is that, especially in the 1990s,the ratio of part-time employment to totalemployment rose substantially. This was prin-cipally the result of the sharp increase in low-paid part-time employment (whose earningsceiling was recently 3325). If considered in
isolation, an expansion in part-time employ-ment leads to a fall in the “employmentthreshold” because more persons are em-ployed at a given rate of GDP growth. This ef-fect must not be confused with a fall in the“employment threshold” arising from an eas-ing of the wage pressure. In order to increasethe volume of labour in terms of hours

International comparison
of productivity trends and levels
There is an additional methodological prob-
lem when comparing productivity levels inter-nationally. For example, the variables have tobe converted into a common currency. Inorder to measure the (value of) performancegaps per person employed (or per hourworked) it is advisable to use purchasingpower parities, such as those published bythe OECD, instead of the respective exchangeGross value added in the corporate sector per person employed compared with that

59Deutsche Bundesbank“Employment threshold“ and real labour costs
The “employment threshold“ has assumed a prom-
inent role in the employment policy debate. It 
denotes the minimum rate of growth in output 
that is necessary to increase employment. However, 
participants in the debate often overlook the fact 
that the employment threshold is not a constant 
but depends, in turn, on economic determinants. 
The considerable importance of the wage formation 
process can be illustrated using a simple long-term 
demand-for-labour function. The following long-
term demand-for-labour function can be derived on 
the basis of a CES production function, assuming 
constant returns to scale:1 
l – q  =  const   –  σ(w – p)  +  ( σ –1)λ ⋅ t
where I is the (intended) demand for labour, q out-
put and w-p the real cost of labour, in logarithmic 
form in each case, σ is the elasticity of substitution 
between labour and capital, λ is the rate of (autono-
mous) technical progress and t is time. Such an 
approach can be estimated using, for example, the 
dynamic ordinary least-squares regression method 
(DOLS) as a cointegration relationship:
lt – qt  =  β0  +  β1(w – p)t  +  β2t  +  ut
If the number of employed persons is used as the 
measure of employment, real gross domestic prod-
uct as output, real compensation per employee as 
an approximation of labour costs and the deflator 
of gross domestic product as the general price level, 
estimating a cointegration relationship using the so-
called DOLS method and on the basis of annual Ger-
man2 data between 1970 and 2001 gives the follow-
ing results:
lt – qt =  – 2.07  –  0.46( w – p)t  –  0.010 t  +  ût (– 4.87) (– 3.25) (– 6.00)
The coefficient of determination (R²) amounts to 
0.99. The values in brackets are t-values based on 
the long-term variance. If subjected to the usual tests and allowing for a 5 % error probability, the 
null hypothesis of a cointegration relationship can-not be rejected.
The estimate for the long-term elasticity of substitu-
tion therefore amounts to 0.46 and the estimated 
rate of (neutral) technical progress to 1.85 % per 
year. This rate represents the “employment thresh-
old“ when the increase in wages has no effect on 
the level of employment. If the increase in wages 
is greater than that, employment falls ceteris pari-
bus by 0.46 % for every additional percentage-point 
increase in real labour costs. The empirically meas-
ured “employment threshold“ increases accordingly. 
This interrelationship is illustrated in the chart show-
ing two alternative rates of technical progress. It 
must be remembered when interpreting the esti-mates that they are averages for the whole of the 
period under review. If the data from the more recent past are taken as a basis, the increase in 
wages which will have no effect on the level of 
employment is smaller.

fluctuations.
According to these calculations on purchas-
ing power parities, the nominal gross valueadded per person employed in the US corpor-ate sector was, at US$61,700, much greaterin 2001 than the comparable values for theeuro-area average (US$51,500) and for Ger-many (US$49,500). This comparison alsoshows that productivity per person employedin Germany declined following reunificationfrom 90% of the US level in 1990 to 74% ayear later (see the table on page 58). Later inthe 1990s, however, productivity increasedagain and in 2000-01 was 80% of the USlevel.Following the absolute and relative decline in
productivity in 1991, the nominal gross valueadded per hour worked in the corporate sec-tor in Germany has now almost reached theUS level again (see the adjacent chart). Bycontrast, the gap between Spain and Italy, onthe one hand, and the United States, on theother, has increased considerably in the pastdecade. France, the Netherlands and Belgiumfare fairly well in a comparison of hourlyproductivity with the United States. However,the fact that these countries’ value added perperson employed is considerably less than USproductivity may also be seen as a sign oftheir preference for shorter working hours, ieit must not be interpreted as economic ineffi-ciency. The situation in the southern euro-area countries is different. Despite therebeing virtually no change in working hours,Spain and Italy have hardly improved theirlevels of productivity per hour worked com-pared with that of the USA during the pastdecade, and Portugal’s position has actuallydeteriorated slightly. By contrast, Ireland andFinland have clearly gained ground eventhough they have been unable to draw levelwith the United States.
The comparison of the productivity levels on
the basis of the hours worked per person em-ployed has shown that the gap between Ger-many and the United States is smaller than isfrequently assumed. Even so, the analysissuggests that there is a need for action byeconomic policymakers in Germany. This canbe seen from the fact that the German econ-omy has returned to lower productivitygrowth rates now that the reunificationboom has disappeared. By contrast, product-

61ivity growth in the United States increased
during the second half of the 1990s. It waspossible in the process to increase employ-ment substantially and thereby to integrate“marginal” or less productive members ofthe labour force into the economic process.This is all the more surprising given the factthat the manufacturing industry, which trad-itionally achieves above-average productivitygrowth rates, has a much smaller weight inthe United States than in Germany. It wouldbe desirable in the light of this to increaseGerman growth in total factor productivity.The introduction and spread of new technol-
ogy may be encouraged by reducing the arrayof regulations, for example. A technology-related increase in the productivity of labourwould also increase the options of distribu-tion that are available over the long term.At the same time, real labour cost develop-ments should provide an incentive to lowerthe “employment threshold” through a lesscapital-intensive growth process. Greaterflexibility and differentiation in wages aswell as a reduction in non-wage labour costswould be appropriate here.

63Quotas and voting
shares in the IMFThe International Monetary Fund
(IMF), in addition to its important con-sultative and surveillance functions,has the task of providing resources tomember countries experiencing tem-porary balance of payments problems.The IMF is structured as a “fund” inthat the member countries pay into apool of financial resources in accord-ance with predetermined shares of thecapital. This pool is then used to ex-tend credits. The members’ shares orquotas determine not only their finan-cial contributions but also their votingshares and influence on IMF policy.Given that fact, it is hardly surprisingthat the methods used for calculatingthe quotas in the IMF are the subjectof constant debate. The methods ofcalculation used in the past have anumber of shortcomings and thereforeoften lead to an outcome that mem-bers do not accept. The present articledescribes the calculation methods cur-rently in use, points out their inad-equacies and discusses the variousexisting proposals for change.
The functions of the quotas in the IMF
Each member of the IMF has a share in its
capital. The capital shares, known as quotas,have several functions. First, the quotas de-termine the capital subscriptions (paymentcommitments) of the member countries.Since the Second Amendment of the Articlesof Agreement in 1978, members have pro-

scription in the form of reserve assets, ie spe-cial drawing rights (SDRs)
1or foreign curren-
cies acceptable to the IMF, and the remainderin their own currency.
2Second, the quotas
determine the extent to which the individualmembers can access the IMF’s financial assist-ance. Third, quotas determine the distributionof voting rights in the IMF. In addition to afixed number of basic votes, which is thesame for all members, voting power is basedon the size of the capital subscriptions (seeadjacent table). Last but not least, quotas alsodetermine a member’s share in the allocationof SDRs.
Quota payments as a source of
refinancing
In addition to the importance of the quotas for
the individual IMF members, the absolute sizeof the combined quotas has a major part toplay, reflecting, as it does, the resources per-tentially available for IMF credits.

son, the overall size of the quotas is a subjectof recurring debate about the Fund’s appropri-ate role in overcoming its members’ balance ofpayments problems. At present, the quotas ofQuota and voting shares in the IMF

65the 184 members amount to a total of
SDR213 billion or US$282 billion. This contrastswith a figure of less than US$10 billion whenthe IMF was founded in 1944. Under the IMFArticles of Agreement, a general review of theappropriateness of the quotas (and thus of theFund’s financial resources) is to be conductedat intervals of not more than five years. Up tonow, these reviews have resulted in the adop-tion of eight overall quota increases. These in-creases were intended to bring the IMF’s abilityto provide conditional liquidity successively intoline with the anticipated growing needs of itsmembers for the Fund’s financial resources (seeadjacent table).
Since the mid-1970s, the debate on the
financial resources of the Fund has been con-ducted against a backdrop of flexible ex-change rates and ever closer real and finan-cial integration in the world economy (in thisconnection, see also the table on page 66).Over the past 20 years, for example, globaltrade has increased by 6% in real terms and,at current prices, roughly trebled (calculatedon an SDR basis). The expansion in the finan-cial sector has been much sharper still. Theadvancing liberalisation of capital movementsand the associated integration of the financialmarkets led to explosive growth in cross-border capital transactions in the 1990s.
Given those developments, there are some
quite conflicting assessments of IMF liquidity.Those advocating a marked raising of theoverall quotas are expecting a sharp increasein the claims made on the Fund by its mem-bers. It is argued that the growth in cross-border transactions is linked with increasingbalance of payments disequilibria, the finan-
cing of which is one of the IMF’s core tasks.This argument is disputed, however. Thosemembers less convinced of the necessity ofan overall quota increase point to the satis-factory liquidity position of the Fund. Despiterecently undertaken sizeable lending commit-ments, Fund liquidity is in better shape thanits multi-year average. Additionally, so theline of reasoning continues, comparing thequotas with cross-border financial flows isnot a sufficient argument for increasing thequotas, since most of these flows take placebetween the industrial countries which havenot made demands on the IMF’s resources formany years. In other words, the emergingmarkets and developing countries – the “ac-tual credit customers” of the IMF – account

The level of Fund resources that is adequate
can be determined only in the light of an ap-propriate lending policy, and this is preciselythe point on which the IMF members continueto hold considerably diverging views. A finan-cially strong IMF may indeed create a certaindegree of confidence, but over-abundant li-quidity would be likely to create the wrong in-centives and thus tend to be counterproduc-tive. This is because the expectation of exten-sive financial assistance might encourage arisky and destabilising economic policy in themember countries. There is also a risk that theincentive structures on the international capitalmarkets might be distorted to the detriment ofprivate investors’ risk-adequate behaviour,thereby making future financial crises morelikely. Avoiding over-abundant IMF liquidity isthe only way to make market players act in aprudent manner and make them aware oftheir responsibility to protect themselves, ie bygiving credible signals that they cannot placeunlimited reliance on the Fund’s resources.Apart from this, the demand for Fund re-sources and the Fund’s liquidity needs wouldbe reduced “automatically” given improvedcrisis prevention.

67was to determine the overall size of the Fund
quotas and the distribution of quotas amongthe individual members. Each member’s quotawas determined by the following variables:national income, foreign reserves, externaltrade and the variability of its exports. Thesevariables were intended to take into account,first, each country’s relative economic size andability to contribute to Fund resources and,second, each member’s potential need forFund credits. The design and specification ofthe Bretton Woods formula were subject toseveral predetermined constraints, however.The United States, which as the strongesteconomy also had the most extensive foreignreserves (in this case, gold), would have thelargest IMF quota. The United Kingdomwould have the second-largest quota, half aslarge as that of the United States, and thequotas of other large members should be“reasonably related” to those of the UnitedStates and of the United Kingdom. Giventhese constraints, it is not surprising that thefinal agreed quotas were in some cases signifi-cantly higher or lower than the quotas deter-mined in accordance with the above-mentioned variables (the “calculated”quotas). While the actual US and UK quotaswere very close to the results of the formula,other countries’ quotas showed a consider-able divergence.
The quota formula was revised for the first
time in the early 1960s. This revision aimed,first, to realign actual and calculated quotasfollowing an excessively sharp increase in thecalculated quotas. Second, it was designed toproduce somewhat higher calculated quotasfor smaller member countries. For this pur-pose, four formulas (derived from the Bretton
Woods formula) were adopted for use to-gether with the original formula in determin-ing the quotas. Finally, more wide-rangingdata on current payments and current re-ceipts were introduced alongside data on im-ports and exports. This increased the numberof formulas used for calculating the quotas toten. The outcome of all these changes wasthat calculating the quotas became a verycomplex operation. A further revision of thequota formulas as part of the Eighth GeneralReview of Quotas in the early 1980s broughtonly a small degree of simplification in thecalculation method, however. After the 1983revision, only data on current payments andreceipts were used for transactions across na-tional borders, gross domestic product (GDP)replaced national income and reserves werebroadened to include SDRs and a number ofother items. Additionally, the coefficient ofvariability was reduced in the four derivedformulas in order to limit the mathematicaleffect of a sharp rise in commodities prices.
In the Eleventh General Review, which was
concluded in January 1998, five formulaswere applied in total (see overview onpage 68). These are combined in a complexoperation to give, first, the calculated quotas.Only after a series of extensive adjustmentsare the actual quotas then produced.

69are extremely complex and therefore difficult
to understand. In some cases, they are incon-sistent. The formulas lack “transparency”,not only insofar as they fail to provide infor-mation per se but also in the sense that they
have no explanatory power. The procedurefor combining the individual formulas whichultimately produces the calculated quotas isalso difficult to understand. Furthermore, theadditional calculations demonstrate that thecalculated quotas have been construed, fromthe outset, only as an intermediate step. Atall events, in the most recent General Review,the actual quotas were arrived at only afterprotracted negotiations and ad hoc modifica-
tions of the specifications. The actual quotasreflect, among other things, the specialwishes and concerns of the individual coun-tries. The large “equiproportional compon-ent” of the increases, ie increases are distrib-uted in proportion to the members’ oldquotas, results in a pronounced inertia. Theactual quotas are thus very slow in catchingup with developments in the world economy.The reason for this is that broad consent is re-quired (an 85% majority). Member countriesare reluctant to accept a reduction in theirquota shares not only on grounds of prestigebut also because of the implications thiswould have in terms of their voting powerand potential access to credit. That is espe-cially the case for countries whose actualquota is higher than the one calculated. Theupshot of this is that there continue to beglaring differences between the actual andthe calculated quotas – something which ap-plies to both the overall sum of the quotasand the shares of the individual countries (seechart on page 70).Apart from the cited technical deficiencies and
inconsistencies, in many countries there is aconsiderable degree of political dissatisfactionwith the quotas set for them. Many membersregard their shares in the Fund as inappropri-ately low. The emerging market economieswith a high rate of growth and an intensive in-volvement in international current and financialtransactions feel that their increased weight inthe global economy is not being given ad-equate consideration. The poorer developingcountries are dissatisfied because the quotacalculations and the relevant determinedquotas have meant that, as a group, theirquota share has been falling for some time. Inparticular, there are doubts as to whether thevariables used to calculate the quotas take ad-equate account of the radical changes whichhave taken place in the world economy and inthe international financial system. As a result,there is a prevailing consensus, albeit for quitedifferent and occasionally conflicting reasons,that the methods of calculating quotas, in theirpresent form, are fraught with major deficien-cies. For attaining a higher degree of approvalfor the setting of the quotas, there are basicallytwo options: either to aim at negotiated solu-tions from the outset, with the mathematicalcalculations serving, at most, as a guideline; orto attempt to develop a new and comprehen-sible quota formula which meets with thebroad acceptance of the IMF membership.

70International Monetary and Financial Com-
mittee (IMFC)) requested the Executive Boardto review the quota formulas.
4As a first step
in the review process, in May 1999 the IMFestablished an external eight-member panelof experts, chaired by Professor RichardN Cooper of Harvard University (Germanmember: Professor Horst Siebert, President ofthe Kiel Institute of World Economics). Thispanel was commissioned to submit an inde-pendent report on the adequacy of the quotaformulas and to make proposals on a formulawhich would more closely reflect members’relative position in the world economy as wellas their ability to contribute to and (potential)need for the Fund’s financial resources. Thisreview was also to take account of the extentto which variables reflecting the increasingglobalisation of the markets and other deter-minants, such as per capita income andpopulation, should be included in the for-mula. (See the box on page 71 for the termsof reference of the quota formula review.)
The Quota Formula Review Group (QFRG) first
examined the persistent deviations of the ac-tual (negotiated) quotas from (formula-derived)calculated quotas and asked whether theactual quotas display consistent features or fol-low certain statistically verifiable principles. Ac-cordingly, the panel used a number of econo-metric approaches in an attempt to establish acorrelation between the different variables andthe actual quotas. This was designed to throwlight on the underlying motives specific to theSDR

71negotiations. Although this approach brought
a limited amount of success, it did not providea basis for recommending a definite, transpar-ent and persuasive new formula.
In its final report, the panel recommended a
formula containing only two variables: GDPand the variability of current receipts, includ-ing the variability of capital flows. The vari-ables are defined on the basis of shares sothat the results denote a priori the calculated
quota shares of each member country.
The recommendations in the report were
taken up by the Executive Board as a valuablestimulus to the debate. However, the Direct-ors were unable to bring themselves to makea decision on defining a new formula. Therewas, for example, some criticism that the pro-posed formula did not adequately reflect thedescribed multiple functions of the quotas.The Executive Board discussion has sincecontinued. Given the, in some cases, seriousdifferences of opinion that exist, agreementon a new formula is unlikely to be achievedvery soon – if at all.
Quota calculation reform: desirable basic
principles
In order to achieve a greater measure of con-
sensus in determining the members’ quotas,the following basic principles would have tobe applied.
First, the calculation of the quotas should be
as transparent and straightforward as pos-sible. A formula can be credible, persuasiveThe mandate of the Quota FormulaReview Group
The mandate of the group is intended to ... in-
clude the following main areas:
– To review the quota formulas and their work-
ing, and to assess their adequacy to help de-termine members’ calculated quotas in theIMF in a manner that reasonably reflectsmembers’ relative position in the world econ-omy as well as their relative need for andcontributions to the Fund’s financial re-sources, taking into account changes in thefunctioning of the world economy and theinternational financial system and in light ofthe increasing globalization of the markets.
– To propose, as appropriate, changes in the
variables and their specification to be used inthe formulas.
– To examine other issues directly related to
the quota formulas.
... the group is requested ... to review, inter alia,
issues that have arisen in recent discussions bythe Executive Board. ... In this connection, someDirectors have requested the explicit inclusion ofcapital movements and access to capital marketsin the quota formulas, while other Directorshave noted that the quota formulas should con-tain a variable that would indicate a member’sper capita income as an indicator of relativewealth, and they also ask whether populationshould be taken into account, either directly orindirectly.
Issues regarding data have also arisen, in particu-
lar, whether purchasing power parity indexes ...should be used to convert nominal GDP ex-pressed in domestic currency into SDRs as an al-ternative to the current practice of making suchconversions at market exchange rates. Directorshave also raised questions regarding both thenumber of quota formulas and whether theyshould be reduced, and also the possibility of re-structuring the formulas so as to simplify themwith a view to removing anomalies in their work-ing.

72and acceptable to the vast majority of mem-
bers only if it is easily understood. In that re-spect, changing over to a single formulawould represent a significant gain in itself.
Second, the quota formula should not be
weighed down with political objectives. Wideacceptance will not be gained by designingthe formula so that the existing distributionof quotas (or a different one felt to be desir-able) is generated mathematically. Predeter-mining the envisaged quota shares for certaingroups of countries (advanced economies,emerging markets, developing countries orother groupings) would also be a very ques-tionable practice. That would only make itmore difficult, if not impossible, to derive aneconomically feasible formula.
Third, it is crucial that the quota formula be
based on verifiable and clear economic cri-teria and that it reflect the relative economicposition of each member country and be thesame for all members. It would be imprudentto select and weight the variables so that cer-tain countries are given preferential treat-ment. The variables used should also respectthe IMF’s mandate and its character as amonetary institution geared to the balance ofpayments.
Fourth, it is important that the quota formula
should not set the wrong incentives whichmight conflict with the pursuit of the IMF’sprinciples and sustainable underlying condi-tions in the world economy. A formula – in-cluding, say, the criterion of “vulnerability tocrisis” – which ultimately rewards a flawedeconomic policy with increased voting powerand greater access to credits has to be avoid-
ed under all circumstances.
Fifth, it would be advisable not to pursue too
many different aims simultaneously with thequota formula. A quota formula should mere-ly determine the percentage shares of the in-dividual members, ie the “correct” structureof the quotas. A separate decision should bemade on the absolute size of the Fund.
Sixth, it is important that the results of an
agreed method of calculation be implemented.In other words, there should not arise a situ-ation where the quota calculations are followedby negotiations after which the quota sharesend up being set on a discretionary basis.
The individual variables
As a measure of economic performance, GDP
is the best indicator of a country’s relativeposition in the world economy as well as, to acertain extent, its ability to contribute to theFund’s resources. Up to now, domestic cur-rency GDP has invariably been converted atmarket exchange rates, thus providing astandard of comparability. This approachshould be maintained. It adequately reflectsthe international “market value” of a coun-try’s resources from which the member’sfinancial commitments to the IMF have to bemet. Converting GDP using purchasingpower parities (PPP) – as proposed by manycountries with what tend to be weaker cur-rencies – would, by comparison, be less expe-dient. A PPP-based adjustment of GDP – ascommonly performed by the World Bank, for

73example – may be a useful method of making
cross-country comparisons of real income. Itis geared too much to the domestic pricelevel, however, and fails to take account ofthe actual market conditions for cross-bordertransactions.
With good reason, openness has been in-
cluded in the quota formula(s) to reflect coun-tries’ integration in the world economy. Coun-tries which press ahead with liberalisation andthe opening of their borders, thus increasingtheir influence on the world economy, shouldthereby earn themselves greater voting powerin international monetary policy. To a certaindegree, an “openness variable” is an indicatorof the extent to which a country that is inte-grated in the international economy mightneed Fund resources in the event of externalshocks. The use of an openness variable in par-allel with domestically oriented GDP is not un-disputed, however. Some reference is made tothe fact that the openness percentages correl-ate too closely with the shares of GDP andthus have no additional informative value. Inactual fact, large countries do also show size-able external transactions in most cases, whichresults in an unmistakable positive correlation.Nevertheless, the differences between theshares produced by the two variables can bequite glaring in specific instances, with smallercountries tending to show a relatively large de-gree of openness (see also the adjacent table).For that reason, the openness variable, as acorrective to the GDP variable, should not bedispensed with.

74greater importance to the world economy, it
is also important to include in the formula notonly “real openness” (trade in goods) – as atpresent – but also “financial openness”.There is therefore rightly an ongoing discus-sion on the use of an indicator that accuratelydescribes a country’s integration in the inter-national financial markets in addition to theone based on current receipts and payments.The choice of a suitable financial opennessvariable raises problems, however, as thereare considerable variations in the quality andavailability of the data (see the “discrepancystudies” cited in the references on page 77).Potential candidates, apart from the capitalflows themselves, are the international invest-ment position and investment income.
Capital flows are comparatively volatile in
most cases and are therefore no more thanan inadequate reflection of integration in theinternational financial system. Moreover, thedata on capital flows are incomplete. By com-parison, the foreign assets and liabilitiesshown in the international investment pos-ition would be a better indicator of a coun-try’s financial integration in the world econ-omy. However, only a few countries report oninternational investment positions, eventhough members are actually required to pro-vide such information to the IMF. Owing tothe lack of such data, the use of this variablewould therefore also be fraught with difficul-ties. Investment income streams could beused as an indicator of financial integration,however. These reflect, as it were, the earn-ings side of external assets. It is true that thisinvestment income also suffers from signifi-cant statistical inadequacies, but it has oneadvantage in that such data are available for
almost every country. No decision has beenmade yet in this matter and, quite apart fromthat, the weighting attached to financialopenness in the calculations would still haveto be determined.
Also under discussion is the inclusion in the
quota formula of a component to model thevariability of international receipts – as an in-dicator of a member’s vulnerability to crisisand thus of its potential need for the Fund’sresources. Such a variable is designed to cap-ture the potential short-term margin of fluc-tuation in both current account receipts andcapital inflows. This might set the wrong in-centives, however, since a “vulnerability vari-able” of this kind would “reward” (with ahigher quota and greater voting power) thosecountries whose external “vulnerability” isdue to weaknesses in their own domesticeconomic policy. Moreover, the vulnerabilityfigures for some countries do not appear tobe particularly consistent. Some major indus-trial countries, for example, displayed a “vari-ability” in their balance of payments and cap-ital inflows over the past few years which washigher than that of a number of crisis coun-tries. Fluctuations in balance of paymentstransactions are thus only of limited use as anindicator of a country’s external vulnerability.
From a present-day perspective, the case for
including foreign reserves when calculatingthe quotas appears to be less persuasive thanit was at the time the IMF was established. Ina world of flexible exchange rates and liberal-ised capital markets, large reserves of foreigncurrency are now much less of a material ne-

75cessity and have lost much of their indicator
quality. Large reserves are not always a signof strength and comparatively small reservesare not necessarily a sign of weakness. Evenso, for countries whose access to the inter-national capital market is not assured on asustained basis, reserves may still be of use,say, for the steady servicing of foreign debt.At least, the inclusion of foreign reserves inthe quota formula does not – in contrast tovariability – generate any negative incentiveeffects.
By contrast, calls for non-economic variables
to be introduced into the quota formula can-not be reconciled with the basic monetaryand balance of payments objectives for whichthe IMF was established. Such non-economicvariables would include “population” and“poverty indices”. These are often broughtinto the discussion with a view to increasingthe voting shares and credit access limits ofthe poorer developing countries. The IMF’smandate to promote countries’ external sta-bility through economic policy surveillanceand to make resources temporarily availableto its members facing balance of paymentsproblems leaves no scope for such variables.The primary objective of the quota formulamust be to reflect a member country’s relativeposition in the world economy – not its levelof prosperity: this is more a target variable ofdevelopment policy and thus a matter for theWorld Bank and other development institu-tions. Moreover, contrary to the intention,the inclusion of non-economic variablesmight tend to weaken, rather than strength-en, the borrowing countries’ potential accessto resources. That is because any weakeningof the Fund’s ability to provide financial assist-
ance stemming from a reduction in the lend-ing countries’ share of the quotas would ul-timately be to the detriment of the debtorcountries, which would have fewer total re-sources available to them.
Averaging, share structure and weights
An appropriate choice of variables, by itself,
does not mean that all the problems aresolved. A decision then has to be made onhow the variables should be “processed”. Forexample, the choice of the base period is amatter of some relevance. Using only themost recent year means that current develop-ments can be taken into account with a shorttime lag, but major cyclical fluctuations mayalso occur. Calculating an average over aperiod of, say, three to five years might coun-ter this effect without causing too much of adelay in adjusting the calculated quotas tothe latest economic developments.
Although the members’shares vary in relation
to each variable (see table on page 76), thisshare structure should not in itself constitutea basis for the choice and weights of the vari-ables. In particular, what is to be resisted isany attempt to set the weighting in a waythat gives certain (groups of) countries a
priori preferential treatment or, in fact,
achieves a given predetermined outcome.Instead, the weighting structure should beadequately plausible and thus persuasive. Thethree variables, GDP , “real openness” and “fi-nancial openness”, could each be given aweighting of one-third, for instance. Another

76possibility would be 50% for GDP and 50%
for openness to the world economy.
The role of the basic votes
In the debate on quotas, there are occasional-
ly calls for raising the number of basic votesin order to increase their relative importancefor the voting power of individual countries.Since the IMF has been in existence, eachmember has had 250 basic votes, independ-ently of its quota, plus one additional vote forevery SDR100,000 of its quota. This arrange-ment was agreed in Bretton Woods and canbe altered only by an amendment of the IMFArticles of Agreement, which requires an85% majority. In effect, the “basic vote” in-strument gives greater voting power to small-er countries with a lower-than-average quota
than would be the case if voting power weredistributed strictly in line with their quotashares. The reverse is true of countries (largeeconomies) with a higher-than-averagequota. The ratio of basic votes to overallvotes, which was 11.3% in 1945, is currentlyabout 2%. The decline in the weight of thebasic votes is due to the quota increasesmade since the IMF was founded. The fact oftheir declining weight alone cannot be citedas justification for an increase in the numberof basic votes, however. In a financial institu-tion which obtains its liquidity from the con-tributions of its members, a distribution ofvoting power determined largely by thequotas is probably the best way of ensuringefficiency.Structural data on the quota formula

time rather than their level. They are calculated as the weighted average of nature of the data (nominal or effective) or the compilation method. Thenational interest rates provided by the national central banks. The national country weights for the euro area retail bank interest rates are derived from
rates represent those rates that are currently available from national MFI balance sheet statistics or close proxies. The weights reflect thesources and which are judged to fit the standard categories. These national country-specific proportions of the relevant instruments within the eur o
rates have been aggregated to derive information for the euro area, in area, measured as outstanding amounts. The weights are adjusted monthly,some cases relying on proxies and working assumptions due to the so that interest rates and weights always refer to the same month. —1En-
