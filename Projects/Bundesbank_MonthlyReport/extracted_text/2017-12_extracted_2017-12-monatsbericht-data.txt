Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The strong upturn in output in the German 
economy since the beginning of the year is 
likely to be continuing in the final quarter of 
2017. This does not conflict with weaker pro -
duction activity in industry and the construc -
tion sector in October, as this decline was prob -
ably very largely due to the exceptional calen -
dar constellation with two “bridge” days. The 
fact that new industrial orders are continuing 
to provide a strong stimulus means that indus -
try is likely to remain the driving force behind 
the upturn. This is consistent with the Ifo busi -
ness climate index in manufacturing in Novem -
ber reaching a new record high since German 
reunification. Given the large backlog of orders, 
the construction sector is likely to be well able 
to maintain its heightened level of activity in 
spite of declining orders. Extremely optimistic 
consumer sentiment and the excellent situation 
on the labour market continue to provide posi -
tive stimuli for economic activity.
Industry
Industrial output in October 2017 was sharply 
down on the month in seasonally adjusted 
terms (-2%). It was also considerably lower 
than its third- quarter level (-1¾%). The excep -
tional calendar constellation with two “bridge” 
days around the Day of German Unity and Ref -
ormation Day, which had been declared a pub -
lic holiday this year in all federal states, is likely 
to have played a major part in the lower level 
of output in the reporting month. This evi -
dently led in many firms to very little work or 
no work at all being performed on the working 
day prior to each of these public holidays. This 
is suggested by the fact that the fall in produc -
tion was quite broadly based. The decline was 
particularly sharp in the automotive sector (-7%), which has many production sites in fed -
eral states which had two consecutive public 
holidays this year. This was also the reason for 
the very strong contraction in capital goods 
output (-2¾%). Moreover, producers of con -
sumer goods reported substantial cutbacks in 
production (-2%). By contrast, intermediate 
goods producers cut back their output mark -
edly less (-¾%).
Following an already exceptionally strong third 
quarter, the upturn in the intake of industrial 
orders continued in October. The volume of the 
previous month was exceeded by ½% in sea -
sonally adjusted terms. The inflow of new 
orders, at +2½%, was up substantially on the 
quarter. The regional breakdown shows that 
many orders were received from non- euro area 
countries, in particular (+3¾%). German motor 
vehicle manufacturers were the main benefi -
ciaries of the buoyant demand. There was also 
a considerable increase in the inflow of orders 
from Germany (+1½%) and from other euro 
area countries (+2½%); German enterprises re -
ceived, in particular, a significantly greater 
number of large- scale orders from these re -
gions than they did in the third quarter. In a 
sectoral breakdown, higher demand for capital 
goods (+4¾%) was clearly dominant. By con -
trast, the inflow of orders for consumer goods 
showed a noticeably more modest increase 
(+½%). Producers of intermediate goods, who 
reported a larger- than- average increase in 
orders in the third quarter, in fact reported a 
slight decline in the reporting month (-½%).
Industrial sales followed industrial output in 
October and fell sharply on the month in sea -
sonally adjusted terms (-1¾%). This meant that 
they were also clearly below their level in the 
third quarter (-1½%). This decline was due prin -
cipally to the sharp drop in sales of motor ve -
hicles and motor vehicle parts, although this 
came on the back of exceptionally strong 
growth in the third quarter. This meant that German 
economy  still on 
strong growth path at year- end

there was also a considerable fall in the sales of 
capital goods manufacturers as a whole. This 
contrasted with producers of intermediate and 
consumer goods, who posted strong sales 
growth. In regional terms, there were slight 
falls in domestic sales and strong losses in ex -
port turnover. In line with this, nominal exports 
of goods were down on the month (-½%). In 
comparison with the average of the third quar -
ter, this still represented a slight increase (+¼%), 
but there was a marginal decline in real terms 
(-¼%). In October, nominal seasonally adjusted 
imports of goods showed a distinctly stronger 
month- on- month increase (+1¾%), and were 
thus considerably up (+1¼%) on their level in 
the third quarter. As import prices went up at 
the same rate, real imports of goods remained 
at the level of the previous quarter in price- ad-
justed terms.
Construction
Seasonally adjusted construction output in Oc -
tober 2017 showed a steep decline on the 
month (-1¼%). There was a similar degree of 
failure to match the average level of activity in 
the third quarter. In the construction sector, like 
in industry, the exceptional calendar constella -
tion with two “bridge” days is likely to have 
played a key role in the noticeable dampening 
of activity. There was a significantly stronger 
decline in output in the main construction sec -
tor (-1¾%) than in the finishing trades (-¼%). 
Firms in the main construction sector were re -
ceiving considerably fewer new orders in the 
third quarter – figures are available up to then – 
compared with the second quarter. Neverthe -
less, the large volume of the order backlog – as 
can be gauged, say, from the reach of orders – 
indicates that construction output will continue 
to be booming for the foreseeable future.

total seasonally adjusted number of persons in 
work in Germany went up by 41,000 on the 
month. Compared to the same month last year, 
this was an increase of 650,000, or 1.5%. This 
development has been sustained throughout 
by the favourable development in jobs subject 
to social security contributions. By contrast, 
there was a further decline in the number of 
persons working exclusively in low- paid part-  
time jobs and the self- employed. Leading indi -
cators of the demand for labour, such as the Ifo 
employment barometer, the Federal Employ -
ment Agency’s BA-  X job index and the labour 
market barometer of the Institute for Employ -
ment Research (IAB) are all at an extremely 
high level, suggesting that positive job growth 
is set to continue in the next few months. 
Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly diffi -
cult to fill vacancies adequately. The steady in -
crease in the time needed to fill vacancies is 
one indication of this.
After seasonal adjustment, unemployment in 
November showed a significant fall on the 
month. There were 2.48 million persons regis -
tered as unemployed with the Federal Employ -
ment Agency. The unemployment rate at the 
end of the period under review was still 5.6%. 
Compared with the previous year, 164,000 
fewer persons were out of work, and the un -
employment rate was 0.4  percentage point 
lower. Overall underemployment, which also 
counts the number of persons taking part in 
labour market policy measures, showed a mar -
ginally stronger decrease compared with Octo -
ber. The unemployment component of the IAB 
labour market barometer was still clearly posi -
tive recently, suggesting that unemployment 
will go on falling over the next few months.
Prices
Crude oil prices, which had been going up 
since the middle of the year, increased at a 
faster pace in November and were around 9% 
higher than the figure for October. This was 
due to both the fundamentals and growing geopolitical uncertainties. Prices showed a fur -
ther slight increase in the first half of Decem -
ber. As this report went to press, the price of a 
barrel of Brent crude oil stood at US$63. The 
discount on crude oil futures was US$1½ for 
deliveries six months ahead and US$3¼ for de -
liveries 12 months ahead.
Import prices increased again markedly in Oc -
tober in seasonally adjusted terms. This was 
true of both energy and other goods. Domestic 
producer prices presented a similar picture, al -
beit at slightly lower rates. As inflation at both 
the producer and import level was, in most 
cases, even stronger a year ago, the year- on- 
year rates fell slightly in each case from around 
3% to 2¾%; it was only in imports excluding 
energy that the rate persisted at 1¾%.
Consumer prices (HICP) increased moderately 
again in November by a seasonally adjusted 
0.2% after declining slightly in the previous 
month. There was a noticeable increase in en -
ergy prices in line with crude oil prices, and the 
prices of services were also higher than in the 
previous month. There was another moderate 
rise in housing rents. By contrast, lower prices 
in the case of unprocessed food offset the ef -
fects of higher prices for dairy products, and 
the prices of industrial goods (excluding en -
ergy) likewise remained virtually unchanged. 
Annual headline HICP inflation increased from 
+1.5% to +1.8% (CPI similarly from 1.6% to 
1.8%), while HICP inflation excluding energy 
and food went up from +1.1% to +1.3%. The 
headline rate is expected to be significantly 
lower over the coming months owing to base 
effects in the case of energy.

changed on the year. First, the health insurance 
institutions posted a surplus of €1 billion, as 
they did in the previous year. The surplus is at -
tributable not only to a seasonal component 
but also to the fact that increases in expend -
iture continued to lag behind the figures that 
had been estimated when the supplementary 
contributions were determined. Second, fol -
lowing special transfers of €½ billion to the 
health insurance institutions, the health fund’s 
deficit increased slightly to €½ billion.
With supplementary contribution rates remain -
ing unchanged on average, the health insur -
ance institutions’ revenue (mainly transfers 
from the health fund) climbed by 4% on the 
year. By comparison, expenditure rose at a 
slightly more subdued rate of just over 3½%. 
Of the total expenditure on benefits, the in -
crease in spending was below average in the 
case of both hospital treatment, the most sig -
nificant item in quantitative terms, and the less 
significant remedies and therapeutic appliances 
(+2% and +2½% respectively). By contrast, the 
rise in outlays on outpatient treatment (+5%) 
and pharmaceuticals (+4½%) was above aver -
age. Overall, the increase in spending on bene -
fits stood at 3½%. In view of the continued 
strong growth in the number of insured per -
sons (+1%), this is a fairly moderate increase. 
Many of these newly insured persons are prob -
ably immigrants,1 a group that appears to not 
only have a more favourable age structure than 
that of existing insured persons (as far as the 
health insurance institutions’ finances are con -
cerned) but also to make less use of health ser -
vices. In terms of other expenditure, adminis -
trative spending increased by 4%, not least be -
cause of the health insurance institutions’ 
higher pension provisions.
The health fund’s revenue increased by 4% in 
the third quarter, with contribution receipts 
from persons in employment rising at a slightly 
higher rate (+4½%) against a backdrop of on -
going favourable developments in wages and 
employment. By contrast, following the some -
what more moderate pension increase in mid-2017, pension contributions were up by a 
markedly lower rate of 2½%. Turning to other 
revenue items, the planned increase of €½ bil -
lion per year in the central government grant to 
its new standard level of €14½ billion per year 
also made a positive impact. At 4½%, however, 
the rise in spending by the health fund was 
more pronounced than its increase in revenue 
on account of the fund’s special transfers to 
the health insurance institutions.
In autumn 2016, the group of SHI estimators 
had forecast a €2 billion deficit in the health 
fund for 2017 as a whole.2 This was due to spe -
cial transfers to the health insurance institu -
tions that were adopted by legislators, which 
totalled €1½ billion, as well as €½ billion to be 
drawn from the reserves for the innovation 
fund and the structural fund.3 Following the 
first three quarters, however, a significantly 
smaller deficit is on the cards for the year as a 
whole. The improved revenue developments 
are chiefly due to employment dynamics hav -
ing generally been underestimated at that 
time.4 As a result, the special transfers can 
probably be covered for the most part by cur -
rent revenue. At the time of estimation, the 
health insurance institutions’ spending on 
benefits was expected to rise by 5%; however, 
the increase is now likely to be significantly 
below this. In October of this year, the group of 
SHI estimators was unable to mutually agree Statutory health

1 The term “immigrant” refers to persons migrating to par -
ticipate in the labour market, but also to refugees.
2 Spending by the health fund, and thus primarily revenue 
generated by the health insurance institutions as well, is 
determined prior to the start of the year and not adjusted 
as it progresses. Revenue adjustments therefore affect the 
health fund, whilst unexpected expenditure developments 
are felt by the health insurance institutions.
3 The innovation fund is used by the health fund and 
health insurance institutions to provide annual funding of 
€300 million, starting in 2016 and ending in 2019, for in -
novations in healthcare provision and related research. 
Funding provided by the structural fund (totalling €500 mil -
lion) is channelled into state government investment to im -
prove healthcare provision structures in the hospital sector, 
with federal states being required to invest the same 
amount in each case.
4 After a temporary data processing error by the Federal 
Employment Agency was remedied, growth in employ -
ment subject to social security contributions underwent a 
huge upward correction in the second half of 2016.Deutsche Bundesbank

on an expenditure projection. However, in view 
of developments over the first nine months (a 
year- on- year rise of 3½%), the estimates put 
forward by the Federal Ministry of Health and 
the German Federal Insurance Office (+4%) 
–  which are slightly lower than those of the 
representatives of the health insurance institu -
tions – could also still be slightly too high. For 
the year as a whole, the health insurance insti -
tutions are therefore set to record a consider -
ably higher surplus than last year (2016: +€1½ 
billion). A significant surplus of around €2 bil -
lion in the annual accounts thus appears likely 
for the overall SHI scheme, which equates to a 
marked year- on- year improvement (2016: al -
most +€1 billion).
For the coming year, the group of SHI estima -
tors expects a rise in income subject to compul -
sory insurance contributions of 4%, with both 
employee contributions and pension contribu -
tions increasing to only a slightly lesser degree 
than in the current year. The health fund will 
transfer the estimated revenue5 to the health 
insurance institutions. According to the group, 
the health fund will post a deficit totalling €½ 
billion arising from the funds to be drawn from 
the liquidity reserve and transferred to the in -
novation fund and the structural fund. Total ex -
penditure is expected to rise by 4½%.6 The 
slight acceleration is largely due to anticipated 
catch- up effects, as some of the new benefits 
adopted will not be implemented until 2018 
and will therefore have no impact on expend -
iture until that time.
Based on its estimate, the Federal Ministry of 
Health has lowered the necessary arithmetical 
supplementary contribution rate to cover rele -
vant expenditure by 0.1  percentage point to 
1.0%. The health insurance institutions’ esti -
mate would have yielded a somewhat higher 
supplementary contribution rate of 1.1% that 
was unchanged from 2017. The extent to which 
the supplementary contribution rates of each 
health insurance institution will actually be ad -
justed is up to the institutions themselves. Cur -
rent and expected developments suggest that there will be scope for contribution rate cuts. 
Efficiency improvements in the healthcare sys -
tem are a major item on the agenda so as to 
limit contribution rate increases in the future.Low health fund

Public long- term care 
insurance  scheme
The public long- term care insurance scheme 
posted a deficit of €1 billion in the core area7 in 
the third quarter of 2017 compared with a 
broadly balanced budget in the previous year. 
This deterioration was attributable, first and 
foremost, to the benefit increases introduced 
under the second Act to Strengthen Long- term 
Care (Pflegestärkungsgesetz II) . While total rev -
enue exceeded its prior- year figure by 12½% 
after the contribution rate was raised,8 growth 
in total expenditure was considerably stronger still at 27½%, with expected high growth in 
the first half of the year ramping up signifi -
cantly once again. High growth was recorded 
in all benefit areas as a result of the scheme’s 
range of benefits undergoing reform. Benefits 
in kind, together with cash benefits, which are 
quantitatively less significant, contributed in 
similar absolute terms to the overall increase 
(+20% and +54% respectively).
A significant deficit and a sharp deterioration 
are also expected for the year as a whole. All in 
all, additional expenditure in connection with 
the latest long- term care reform appears to be 
higher than originally expected by legislators. 
Even though the imminent adjustment of bene -
fit rates in 2018 was brought forward under 
the reform, demographic change will cause the 
freely available portion of the long- term care 
insurance institutions’ operational reserves9 to 
be gradually depleted in the years to come and 
further contribution rate rises to be needed in 
future.

the reporting month, which meant that the 
outstanding volume of debt instruments in the 
German market decreased by €12.1 billion 
overall.
Domestic credit institutions redeemed bonds 
worth €9.8 billion net in October (compared 
with €8.6 billion in September). There was a 
fall, in particular, in the outstanding volume of 
other bank debt securities (€9.8 billion), but 
also, to a lesser extent, in the outstanding vol -
ume of debt securities issued by specialised 
credit institutions (€1.5 billion). This contrasted 
with net issuance of mortgage Pfandbriefe and 
public Pfandbriefe to the tune of €1.3 billion 
and €0.2 billion respectively.
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
lowered their capital market debt by €2.8 bil -
lion net, compared with €3.5 billion in the pre -
vious month. Viewed in net terms, the redemp -
tions were attributable solely to non- financial 
corporations, while other financial intermediar -
ies issued bonds on balance.
In October, the public sector issued debt secur -
ities worth €2.4 billion net (following net re -
demptions of €6.2 billion in September). On 
balance, this was solely attributable to state 
and local governments, which issued new 
bonds worth €3.7 billion. Central government, 
by contrast, reduced its debt by €1.4 billion in 
net terms. Five- year Federal notes (Bobls) ac -
counted for the bulk of the redemptions (€13.3 
billion). This contrasted with net issuance of 
ten- year Federal bonds (Bunds) worth €7.0 bil -
lion and two- year Federal Treasury notes 
(Schätze) worth €4.2 billion.
In the reporting month, the Deutsche Bundes -
bank was the predominant buyer in the Ger -
man bond market, purchasing debt securities 
for €12.2 billion net, largely under the Eurosys -
tem’s asset purchase programmes. Domestic 
non- banks expanded their bond portfolios by 
€7.9 billion, concentrating mainly on domestic 
public sector instruments. By contrast, non-  
resident investors and domestic credit institu -tions sold debt securities for €27.3 billion and 
€4.9 billion net respectively.
Equity market
In October, domestic enterprises placed €0.6 
billion worth of new shares in the German 
equity market. The volume of foreign equities 
in the German market rose by €1.7 billion. On 
balance, shares were purchased chiefly by for -
eign investors (€2.9 billion), but also by domes -
tic credit institutions (€0.7 billion). Domestic 
non- banks sold equities for €1.3 billion in net 
terms, all of which were German shares, on 
balance.

funds reserved for institutional investors were 
virtually the sole beneficiaries (€10.1 billion). 
Among the fund providers, mixed securities 
funds (€6.4 billion) were the main sellers of 
new shares, followed by bond funds (€1.9 bil -
lion) and open- end real estate funds (€1.2 bil -
lion). The outstanding volume of foreign mu -
tual fund shares distributed in Germany in -
creased by €7.2 billion during the reporting 
month. Domestic non- banks were virtually the 
only buyers of mutual fund shares in October 
(€16.7 billion). Foreign investors and German

Balance of payments
Germany’s current account posted a surplus of 
€18.1 billion in October 2017, which was €7.7 
billion below the previous month’s level. This 
was caused by a decline in the goods account 
surplus and a lower invisible current transac -
tions balance, which comprises services as well 
as primary and secondary income.
The October surplus on the goods account was 
€5.3 billion down on the month at €20.4 bil -
lion, with exports of goods falling, while im -
ports rose.
In October, invisible current transactions 
showed a deficit of €2.3 billion, following 
broadly balanced income and expenditure bal -
ances one month earlier (€0.1 billion). One fac -
tor behind this deterioration was the services 
account deficit growing by €1.1 billion to €3.6 
billion, with lower income and increased ex -
penditure both playing a part in this. On the 
revenue side, it was primarily income from the 
use of intellectual property that went up, but 
this was more than offset, in particular, by a 
decline in receipts from IT and other business 
services. On the expenditure side, travel- related 
payments to non- residents saw the largest in -
crease. This was accompanied by a €1.1 billion

icit of €4.2 billion, not least on account of 
lower general government revenue from cur -
rent taxes paid by non- residents on income and 
wealth, together with increased government 
expenditure on current transfers relating to 
international cooperation. By contrast, the 
drop in net receipts in the primary income bal -
ance by €0.3 billion to €5.5 billion had little im -
pact. This was due mainly to lower income 
from dividends paid by non- residents.
In the reporting month, the international finan -
cial markets were influenced by a favourable 
economic outlook and decreasing risk aversion. 
Against this backdrop, Germany’s cross- border 
portfolio investment generated net capital ex -
ports in the amount of €30.1 billion, compared 
with €24.5 billion in September. Foreign invest -
ors sold German securities totalling €23.5 bil -
lion net during the month under review, mainly 
parting with long- term debt securities (€23.3 
billion) –  particularly private bonds  – and 
money market paper (€4.0 billion). Extensive 
redemptions also played a key role. By contrast, 
they acquired German shares (€2.8 billion) and 
mutual fund shares (€1.0 billion). German in -
vestors purchased foreign securities to the tune 
of €6.6 billion net, focusing on mutual fund 
shares (€7.2 billion) and shares (€1.4 billion), 
but disposing of money market instruments 
(€1.6 billion) and bonds (€0.3 billion).
Direct investment likewise generated net cap -
ital exports in October; these amounted to 
€8.4 billion, compared with €2.9 billion in Sep -tember. Domestic enterprises supplied their 
affiliates  abroad with funds worth €10.0 billion 
net. This was achieved both by boosting their 
equity capital (€6.1 billion) –  chiefly through 
reinvested  earnings – and by expanding their 
intra- group lending (€3.9 billion). Net funds 
flowing into Germany in the shape of direct in -
vestment came to €1.6 billion. In this context, 
non- resident investors provided German enter -
prises with additional equity capital totalling 
€2.0 billion, predominantly in the form of re -
invested earnings. By contrast, intra- group 
lending from abroad decreased slightly (€0.4 
billion).
Other statistically recorded investment, which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments, saw net capital 
imports of €24.7 billion in October. These arose 
from high net inflows of funds within the bank -
ing system, with funds from abroad flowing to 
the Bundesbank (€14.3 billion), as well as to 
monetary financial institutions (€11.4 billion). 
On balance, the transactions settled via Bun -
desbank accounts led to a decline in its 
TARGET2 claims. The cross- border activities of 
non- banks, by contrast, resulted in modest net 
outflows. Net capital exports were recorded 
not just by general government (€0.7 billion) 
but also by enterprises and households (€0.3 
billion).

Outlook for the German economy – 
macroeconomic  projections for 2018 and 
2019 and an outlook for 2020
Germany’s economy is experiencing a strong upswing. Driven by lively foreign demand, industry 
is seeing dynamic growth and the sharp upturn in business investment is persisting. Private con -
sumption and housing investment continue to benefit from the outstanding labour market situ -
ation. According to the current forecast, this broad- based, robust economic upswing is reaching 
an increasingly mature state, which means that the pace of growth is likely to slow in the medium 
term and converge to that of potential growth. As a result, exports will grow less dynamically, 
with further growth potential being constrained above all by strong capacity utilisation and, in 
particular, labour shortages.
In this scenario, the German economy could post strong calendar- adjusted growth rates of 2.6% 
this year and 2.5% next year, before expanding at a slower pace of 1.7% in 2019 and 1.5% in 
2020 (in unadjusted terms: 2.3% in 2017 and 1.9% in 2020). The growth rates of gross domestic 
product (GDP) are thus considerably outpacing those of potential output, particularly in the short 
term, and aggregate capacity utilisation could soon reach similarly high levels to those seen at 
the peak of the last economic cycle in 2007. This will be accompanied by increasing bottlenecks 
in the labour market and perceptibly rising wage increases.
As measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the inflation rate, which has 
increased considerably to 1.7% on average for 2017 owing to markedly higher crude oil prices as 
well as food shortages, is likely to remain similarly high until 2019 and could rise to 1.9% in 2020. 
Energy prices, which according to expectations will scarcely rise any further, conceal increasing 
price pressure among other goods and services resulting predominantly from more dynamic 
wage growth. Excluding energy and food, inflation is therefore likely to climb from 1.3% in 2017 
to 1.9% in 2019. An inflation rate of 2.1% is conceivable for 2020.
Public finances are developing very favourably under the current fiscal policy stance. Buoyed by 
the exceptionally good state of the economy and the low interest rates, the fiscal surplus would 
therefore rise noticeably above 1% of GDP in the coming years. However, it is to be expected that 
additional budgetary burdens will be adopted after the new government has been formed and 
that fiscal policy will therefore be more expansive. This is a key reason why, all in all, the risks for 
economic growth – and to a slight extent for price developments – are deemed to be tilted to the 
upside.
Compared with the June 2017 projection, economic growth expectations have now risen signifi -
cantly, particularly for 2017 and 2018. Mainly due to the changed outlook for energy prices, the 
inflation forecast has been raised somewhat for 2017 and 2018 and lowered slightly for 2019.Deutsche Bundesbank

Economic outlook1
The German economy grew sharply in the 
second and third quarters of 2017, even some -
what exceeding the strong pace of growth 
seen in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first 
quarter of 2017. In the second and third quar -
ter, real gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 
1.5% overall in seasonally and calendar ad -
justed terms, and thus considerably more 
strongly than expected in the June projection.2 
Driven by lively foreign demand, the value 
added of the manufacturing sector increased 
sharply. This led to a further rise in capacity util -
isation, with enterprises investing more than 
before in tangible fixed assets. Investment in 
housing construction also rose again consider -
ably, although signs are showing that the con -
struction sector is increasingly nearing its cap -
acity limits. With a large boost from the favour -
able development in the labour market, private 
consumption also expanded considerably.
Growing at rates far above those of potential 
output, the German economy’s high under -
lying pace of economic growth is likely to con -
tinue in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first 
quarter of 2018. The recent very strong inflow 
of orders as well as the record high level of sen -
timent in the manufacturing sector indicate 
that industrial activity will continue to rise ro -
bustly. As there are a large number of orders, in 
particular from abroad, and as export expect -
ations are especially optimistic, exports are 
likely to rise sharply. The increasing capacity 
utilisation and the lively demand are likely to 
motivate enterprises to invest more in machin -
ery and equipment. Private consumption also 
remains on a clearly upward trajectory in light 
of the marked rise in employment and optimis -
tic consumer sentiment.
Over the course of the projection horizon, it is 
to be expected that the German economy’s 
current high pace of growth will slow. The con -
siderable deceleration in employment growth, 
caused principally by demographic and migra -
tion factors, will amplify the shortage of skilled labour that is already perceptible in some sec -
tors. On the supply side, it will therefore be in -
creasingly difficult to maintain a rate of growth 
that is markedly higher than that of potential 
output. On the demand side, the currently high 
rates of export growth are likely to initially align 
with the lower, and progressively falling, 
growth in the markets for German exports, and 
subsequently fall even slightly below this level. 
This will probably contribute to corporate in -
vestment rising more slowly. In addition, the 
labour supply’s slowing growth rates could also 
have a dampening effect here, as enterprises 
are less likely to invest in new tangible fixed 
assets if they anticipate a shortage of skilled la -
bour. The expansion of private consumption 
could likewise be dampened by the slowing 
rise in employment. It is not expected that 
higher real wage growth will be enough to 
fully offset the braking effect on households’ 
real disposable income.
All this paints a picture of a strong upswing 
that is reaching an increasingly mature state, 
whereby the pace of growth is set to slow over 
time due to a decelerating rise in demand and, 
above all, gradual supply- side restrictions. 
Calendar- adjusted real GDP is likely to advance 
strongly by 2.6% in 2017 and – helped by the 
high statistical overhang at the beginning of 
the year – by 2.5% in 2018. In 2019 and 2020, 
growth rates could fall back to 1.7% and 1.5% 
respectively. As 2017 has fewer workings days 
than 2016, the growth rate for the current year 
without adjusting for calendar effects is lower 
at 2.3%. While such calendar effects scarcely 
play a role in the coming two years, they in -
crease the growth rate in 2020 by a consider -
able 0.4 percentage point to 1.9%. The GDP 
growth rates for 2017 and 2018 are thus ex -
pected to be significantly higher than estimated 
in the June projection, while the growth rate German econ-
omy continued its strong upturn in the second and third quar-ters of 2017 …

for 2019 has been revised upwards only mar -
ginally (see the table on page 31). An important 
factor in this upward revision is the greater 
dynamics 3 across the entire upswing, com -
bined with perceptibly higher growth in Ger -
man export markets for 2018 and somewhat 
higher growth in these markets for 2019 (see 
the box on pages 20 to 22).
According to this projection, the German econ -
omy will grow considerably faster than poten -
tial output this year and next year, while the 
difference between the growth rates is set to 
shrink markedly in 2019 and 2020. It is now 
estimated that potential output will expand by 
1.5% in both 2017 and 2018. Subsequently, it is 
expected to fall to 1.3% in 2020 on account of 
demographic change and an anticipated de -
cline in net migration.4 The already consider -
ably positive output gap this year will therefore 
expand again substantially, above all in 2018. 
According to current estimates, aggregate cap -
acity utilisation could soon reach similarly high 
levels to those seen at the peak of the last eco -
nomic cycle in 2007.
German exporters benefited in the second and 
third quarters from the ongoing strong expan -
sion in global trade and, contrary to expect -
ations, perceptibly increased their market share. 
Exports therefore grew more strongly than as -
sumed in the June projection. In the final quar -
ter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, the 
high export growth is likely to continue and 
again outpace the expansion of German export 
markets. At least this is indicated by German 
industry’s exceptionally high volume of incom -
ing orders from abroad, as well as enterprises’ 
very optimistic export expectations. Over the 
rest of the coming year, the rise in exports is Aggregate cap-

likely to align with the increasingly subdued 
growth of the export markets. As of 2019, Ger -
man exporters could even relinquish small 
amounts of market share. In trade with the 
other euro area countries they are gradually 
losing price competitiveness, above all because 
unit labour costs are rising faster in Germany. In 
addition, the increasing shift in Chinese de -
mand towards consumer goods is likely to 
dampen the additional need for capital goods. 
This applies similarly to demand from the 
United Kingdom, due to the UK’s aim to exit 
from the European Union. This would impact 
German exports disproportionately, as capital 
goods comprise a higher- than- average share of 
the country’s exports.
Against the background of the boom in indus -
trial activity and the increasing capital utilisa -
tion in manufacturing, industrial investment 
continued to experience a marked upturn in 
the second and third quarters. In particular, en -
terprises invested considerably more in machin -
ery and equipment, and did so to an even 
greater extent than estimated in the June pro -
jection. Industrial construction investment, by 
contrast, was not able to maintain its fast pace 
of growth and has been scaled back of late. In 
light of the highly favourable outlook for indus -
try, the strong cyclical upswing in business in -
vestment is likely to continue in the coming 
quarters. Even beyond this time horizon, com -
mercial investment should remain lively on ac -
count of the favourable financing conditions, 
rising demand and increasing overutilisation in 
the economy as a whole. However, the growth 
rates should then gradually decelerate, as the 
currently very buoyant demand for industrial 
export goods is set to fall markedly over the 
course of the projection horizon. In addition, 
the tendency of enterprises to expand their 
production capacity in Germany is likely to be 
less pronounced than in earlier boom periods. 
On the one hand, this is because Germany is 
fairly far advanced along the economic cycle 
compared to other countries, and especially to

for example, first of all exhaust any remaining 
capacity reserves there. On the other hand, the 
German economy is on a long- term path to 
lower potential growth as a result of demo -
graphic change. The associated drop in labour 
force potential is likely to have a dampening 
effect on business investment going forward.5
The housing market is still faced with excess 
demand. The persistently expansionary under -
lying trend in housing demand is being fuelled 
by households’ favourable income prospects 
and low financing costs. Added impetus is 
being provided by labour market- oriented im -
migration as well as the increasing population 
density in urban centres observed for some 
years now. Supply, measured in terms of hous -
ing investment, expanded exceptionally 
strongly until the middle of the current year. In 
the third quarter, however, housing investment 
grew only modestly and growth is expected to 
be more subdued for the final quarter of 2017 
and the first quarter of 2018 as well. This is 
probably attributable to the fact that the con -
struction sector, given the high production vol -
ume that has now been reached, is increasingly 
nearing its capacity limits. The reported for -
ward reach of the order books in the main con -
struction industry, the level of utilisation of ma -
chinery and equipment, and the business cli -
mate of the sector are all at a very high level, 
while enterprises are increasingly reporting dif -
ficulties in obtaining qualified staff and con -
struction prices are rising perceptibly. However, 
construction capacities in the coming years are 
likely to expand. Housing investment will there -
fore probably increase further, albeit at a slower 
rate than this year. The supply bottleneck in the 
residential property market could soon grad -
ually recede, as demand is likely to increase less 
considerably than in recent years. This applies 
in particular to new buildings, with the number 
of completions jumping especially sharply of 
late. This is indicated by the lower number of Housing

Underlying conditions for macroeconomic projections
This projection is based on assumptions 
made by Eurosystem experts about the 
global economy, exchange rates, commod-
ity prices and interest rates. The assump-
tions are based on information available as at 22 November 2017. The assumptions re-
garding economic activity in the euro area 
are derived from projections made by the national central banks of the euro area 
countries.1 With regard to fi  scal policy, the 
projections incorporate all measures that 
have been adopted or that have been ad-
equately specifi  ed and are likely to be im-
plemented.
Global economy gaining momentum, 
world trade buoyant
The pace of global economic growth over 
the course of 2017 was slightly higher than 
forecast in the June projection. It is as-sumed that the growth rates for the ad-
vanced economies (excluding the euro area) will fall again somewhat from their current fairly high levels. The recent solid economic growth in the United States is also likely to mark something of a turnaround compared with the more subdued upward movement 
observed in the fi  nal quarter of 2016 and 
the fi  rst quarter of 2017. Changes in inven-
tories also contributed signifi  cantly to eco-
nomic growth in the third quarter of 2017, 
meaning that the underlying pace of eco-nomic expansion is expected to remain 
moderate.2 Against the backdrop of the de-
bate surrounding the scope and implemen-
tation of a tax reform and further expan-
sionary measures, expectations concerning 
the positive impact on economic growth in 
the United States were lowered for 2018 
and 2019 as compared with the June pro-
jection. The assumptions in this projection 
were determined before the tax reform bill was passed by the US  Senate. If it is ap-proved by Congress, economic growth in the United States could be somewhat 
higher than assumed here.
Looking over the projection horizon, the emerging market economies will probably be able to largely maintain the pace of 
growth that they have reached in the mean-
time. A gradual deceleration in growth in China is being partly offset by develop-
ments in other east Asian countries. In add-
ition, Russia and Brazil are continuing to 
benefi  t from the recovery on the commod-
ity markets. All in all, the global economy (excluding the euro area and weighted by purchasing power parities) looks set to 
grow by 3¾% in all years over the projec-
tion horizon. The only exception to this is 
next year, in which a slightly higher growth rate is expected.
World trade expanded more strongly on 
average for 2017 than forecast in the previ-ous projection. While growth is expected to wane slightly in the years to follow, it is still 
likely to be markedly higher than the pace 
of expansion assumed in the June projec-
tion – particularly in 2018. Following an up-
tick of 5½% this year, international trade 
(excluding the euro area) is expected to in-
crease by 4½% next year, and to a lesser 
extent in the years thereafter.
1 The projections made by the national central banks 
of the euro area countries were completed on 30 No-vember 2017.
2 The burden on the US economy caused by hurri-
canes is likely to have been minimal in this context. See

Technical assumptions of the projection
Expectations of oil output cuts in major oil- 
producing countries and political confl  icts 
in the Middle East during a period of grow-
ing demand caused crude oil prices to surge in the third quarter of this year. The forward 
quotations from which these oil price as-
sumptions are derived are higher than those 
assumed in the June projection. However, whereas it was assumed in the previous projection that crude oil prices would re-
main broadly unchanged, they are now ex-
pected to fall slightly. The appreciation of 
the euro signifi  cantly lessened the shortfall 
compared with the June assumptions in euro terms. Following their sharp rise on 
average this year, the prices of other com-
modities on a US dollar basis are set to in-
crease moderately in line with expected 
global economic growth up until 2020.
On 26  October 2017, the ECB  Governing Council decided to scale back its net pur-
chases under the expanded asset purchase 
programme from a monthly pace of €60 
billion at present to one of €30 billion from January 2018. The purchases are set to con-
tinue until the end of September 2018, or 
beyond, if necessary, and in any case until 
the Governing Council sees a sustained ad-
justment in the path of euro area infl  ation 
consistent with its infl  ation target. The Gov-erning Council also confi  rmed its continued 
expectation that policy rates will remain at 
their current level for an extended period of time, and past the horizon of the net asset 
purchases. The fi  rm expectations of a sus-tained accommodative monetary policy 
stance have helped keep interest rates at a very low level since the June projection was 
fi  nalised. While market expectations con-
cerning future interest rate movements re-
main on a slightly upward trajectory, the slight trend increase in short- term interest 
rates and in yields on nine to ten- year gov-ernment bonds will now set in somewhat 
later than assumed in June. Much the same 
applies to bank lending rates in Germany. 
The expectation that the spell of low inter-
est rates will persist is consistent with the 
fact that the percentage of enterprises cit-
ing fi  nancing diffi   culties as a risk to eco-
nomic development in a survey conducted 
by the Association of German Chambers of 
Commerce and Industry (DIHK) in summer 
2017 remains at a historically low level.Oil price

Positive economic data for the euro area 
have given rise to a perceptible appreciation 
in the euro since the second quarter. A shift in expectations concerning economic policy impetus in the United States is likely to have further boosted the single currency’s appre-ciation against the US dollar over the course 
of the third quarter.3 The euro traded at 
US$1.17 in the period used for deriving the 
exchange rate assumptions, which was 7¼% higher than the assumptions in the 
June projection. Compared with the curren-
cies of the euro area’s 38 most important 
trading partners, the appreciation averaged 4½%.
Buoyant economic activity 
in the euro area
The rapid pace of euro area economic growth seen in the fi  nal quarter of 2016 
and the fi  rst quarter of 2017 continued over the course of the year and outstripped the 
economic upswing projected in June. Against the backdrop of expected further 
employment gains, rising wage growth and increasing capacity utilisation, domestic de-mand is set to remain an important provider 
of stimulus over the projection horizon, 
too. Turning to exports, growth consistent 
with robust developments in sales markets 
abroad is expected. It is therefore assumed 
that the strong growth rate for exports at present will slow down slightly over the 
years to come. The current high growth in 
domestic demand is expected to normalise as well. Moreover, the labour supply is hav-
ing an increasingly constraining effect in some countries. As a result, the pace of 
overall economic growth in the euro area is likely to decelerate slightly over the projec-tion horizon.
Given the improved outlook for the external 
environment compared with June and the 
buoyant activity in the euro area, expect-ations regarding GDP growth in the euro area (excluding Germany) were, following 
an increase of 2.3% this year, raised by 
around four-tenths to 2.2% for 2018 and by roughly three- tenths to 2.0% for 2019. Economic growth of around 1.8% is ex-
pected for 2020.
Fiscal policy measures moderately 
expansionary 
The fi  scal policy measures taken into ac-
count for Germany will have a moderately 
expansionary effect, both over the projec-
tion horizon as a whole and above all next 
year. The loss of revenue from income- 
related taxes as a result of various legislative changes will be broadly offset by additional revenue arising from overall progressive tax-ation. The contribution rate to the statutory 
pension insurance scheme will fall slightly 
next year from 18.7% to 18.6%. According 
to this projection, an additional reduction of 0.1 percentage point will be needed in 2019 so as to prevent the upper limit for the reserves from once again being ex-ceeded by quite a margin at the end of 
2019. The statutory health insurance institu-
tions are expected, on average, to slightly 
lower their (respective) supplementary con-
tribution rates next year and subsequently 
leave them unchanged. Furthermore, spend-ing by state and local government will rise – not least on fi  xed asset formation, for which 
a higher outfl  ow of provided funds is 
assumed .

building permits issued this year to date, which 
at the start of 2017 had already fallen sharply 
after the elevated level of the year before. In 
addition, the fall in population in Germany as 
well as – according to assumptions – receding 
immigration levels look set to have a dampen -
ing effect on additional housing demand over 
time. In terms of housing investment as a 
whole, the flagging momentum in new con -
struction will probably be counteracted by a 
further increase in investment in the housing 
stock, for example in connection with renova -
tion work to improve energy efficiency or to 
make accommodation more suitable for the 
elderly.
The increased expansion of the housing supply 
was also reflected in the growth rate of hous -
ing prices, which had been slightly lower since 
the first quarter of 2017. Nonetheless, price 
growth, which remains high and partially ex -
ceeds the rates set by macroeconomic deter -
minants, is set to recede further in future. As 
price adjustments on the property market are 
typically sluggish, the current price surge will 
probably have a certain knock- on effect on the 
rates in the coming years. Looking ahead, 
prices should increase at a pace consistent with 
the anticipated increase in disposable house -
hold income and the expected development of 
interest rates for mortgage loans (see the box 
on pages 24 to 26). In addition, price impulses, 
which are the result of immigrants entering the 
labour market and the increased share of the 
population living in urban areas, will probably 
continue to decline.
Growth in government investment should sig -
nificantly outstrip GDP growth over the projec -
tion horizon. At the political level, a need for 
greater investment has been identified, above 
all, in the areas of transport infrastructure as 
well as child day- care and schools.6 Consider -
ing the favourable prospects for central, state 
and local government budgets, a pronounced 
increase in investing activities thus seems plaus -
ible. Here it is assumed that the apparent plan -
ning shortfalls at the general government level at present can be better surmounted. Central 
government has also provided extensive fund -
ing for financially weak local governments, 
which is likely to be used to a far greater extent 
than has been the case to date, not least once 
it has been stocked up and its range of poten -
tial uses extended.
As was the case this year, there is set to be a 
strong increase in overall gross fixed capital for -
mation next year. Growth is projected to 
slacken somewhat in 2019 on account of 
weaker increases in commercial investment. As 
things stand, this trend appears likely to con -
tinue into 2020.
In spite of a dip in the third quarter, households 
stepped up their expenditure considerably in 
the second and third quarters overall. They also 
increased their savings by greater amounts. In 
the light of the very positive economic activity 
and the excellent condition of the German la -
bour market, private consumption remains on 
a clear upward trajectory, though the saving 
rate could also rise somewhat further again in 
the short term. Over the course of the projec -
tion horizon, however, the current extremely 
strong growth in real disposable income is 
likely to slow down perceptibly. This expect -
ation is driven by the fact that due to the in -
creasing supply shortages in the labour market, 
markedly slower employment growth is ex -
pected also when demand is persistently high, 
and that this is likely to be only partially offset 
by steeper rises in real wages. If households’ 
savings behaviour remains largely unchanged, 
private consumption is also likely to experience 
correspondingly weaker expansion.
Government consumption rose sharply last 
year, due in part to additional expenditure on 
refugees in Germany. Such expenditure is now 
expected to decline markedly, particularly on Gradual decline

A model of housing price developments in Germany
The Eurosystem’s projections for the 
country- specifi  c development of key macro-
economic variables are also to serve in fu-
ture as a starting point for the scenario cal-
culations on which the bank stress tests of 
the European Banking Authority (EBA) are based. These variables include, among 
others, housing prices, for which the Bun-
desbank has so far not published any pro-
jections. The Bundesbank’s macroeconomic 
projections for the German economy can be used to derive the data on housing prices in Germany which are required for 
these stress tests. These data are, however, 
of secondary importance from a monetary 
policy perspective. The incorporation of 
these data into the macroeconomic projec-
tions ensures that the derived estimates of 
housing prices, as were required in the stress tests, are consistent with the ex-
pected macroeconomic developments.1
The extrapolation of housing prices in Ger-many is based on an econometric approach, 
the core component of which comprises a 
long- term equilibrium relationship between 
housing prices, households’ disposable in-come and interest rate developments for mortgage loans. The error correction ap-proach also covers the dynamics in short- term price adjustments towards the equi-librium relationship if housing prices tem-porarily deviate from it.
2 The long- term 
equilibrium can be interpreted as a price- income-relationship adjusted for interest 
rate developments. Here it is assumed that in the long term, and provided that changes in interest rates are also taken into account, 
housing prices will develop in line with in-
comes. In the short term, the interdepend-
ence between price changes and housing 
completions is also factored into the model. 
While growth in the housing stock is likely to have a dampening effect on prices, it can 
be assumed that price growth, when 
viewed in isolation, provides an incentive to expand the supply of housing.
3 Infl  ation for 
construction services is also factored into 
the short- term equations.4
The empirical approach is consistent with the theoretical concept of a stock- fl  ow 
equilibrium in the housing market, accord-
ing to which both prices and the housing supply can adjust themselves to balance 
supply and demand in the housing market.5 
The housing stock is thus derived in the 
long term from the cumulative changes in 
supply resulting from the number of hous-
ing completions and the number of housing 
units that are no longer available on the 
market.6 In line with standard practice, the 
interaction of the various infl  uencing fac-

note, 17 November 2017.

3 See C Mayer and T Somerville (2000), Residential 
construction: using the urban growth model to esti-
mate housing supply, Journal of Urban Economics 48, 
pp 85-109. The approach, which involves linking the 
rate of change in housing prices in the short term to 
housing investment or housing completions, corres-ponds with the view that the long- term equilibrium requires neither a price change nor an expansion of 
the housing supply.
4 Credit growth does not form part of the model at 
present, as it has so far not been possible to determine an economically and statistically signifi  cant relationship 
between housing prices and the granting of housing 
loans in a suffi   ciently clear- cut manner. This could be 
due, in part, to the fact that the quality- adjusted price 
index for housing, on which the estimates are based, 
refers to a hypothetical dwelling with – in terms of de-sign – time- invariant characteristics such as age, size or location. By contrast, the available data on lending re-
fl  ect the actual regional mix as well as the average 
characteristics from changing property types.5 See D DiPasquale and W Wheaton (1994), Housing market dynamics and the future of house prices, Jour-nal of Urban Economics 35, pp 1-27.

tors is determined in a fi  rst step on the basis 
of past data. In a second step, these results are used to assess future housing price de-velopments.
Housing price developments are recorded 
in the empirical approach using the Associ-
ation of German Pfandbrief Banks’ (Ver-
band deutscher Pfandbriefbanken, or vdp) 
price index for owner- occupied housing in 
Germany, for which quarterly data have been available since 2003.
7 The price- 
sensitive change in the housing supply re-
fers to the number of housing completions, 
including construction work to existing buildings, whereas housing that has been 
withdrawn from the market, which results 
in a reduction of the housing supply, is as-
sumed not to respond to price signals in the calculations.
According to the estimation results, income 
growth in the case of households has a positive long- term impact on housing 
prices, whereas higher interest rates tend to 
push prices down.8 The estimated long- 
term interest rate effect also refl  ects the ex-
tremely sharp decline in interest rates in the 
7 The vdp price index for owner- occupied housing, 
which is quality- adjusted using hedonic methods, re-
fl  ects the development of prices for owner- occupied 
apartments and houses in Germany. See Deutsche Bundesbank, House prices in Germany in 2009, 
Monthly Report, February 2010, pp 58-59. No statistic-
ally consistent quarterly data on macroeconomic de-
velopments in housing prices in Germany are available 
which stretch back over a longer period of time. The 
temporal comparability of the Federal Statistical Of-
fi  ce’s house price index is only ensured following com-
pletion of the development phase from the reporting 
year 2014 onwards. See Federal Statistical Offi   ce, 
Qualitätsbericht Häuserpreisindex, 17 January 2017.
8 Nominal variables, adjusted for the general price 
level as measured by the GDP defl  ator, are factored 
into the estimates. An exception here are interest rates 
on housing loans, which were adjusted to take ac-
count of the survey- based data of Consensus Econom-ics for longer- term infl  ation expectations. Moreover, in 
the calculations the variables referring to a quantity 
were placed in relation to the number of households. The estimate is based on the period from the fi  rst qua-ter of 2003 to the third quarter of 2017.Estimated interrelationships in the housing market

years 2011 to 2016, which coincided with 
the recent upswing in prices in the German 
housing market. Housing prices were mark-edly higher of late than the estimates made on the basis of the long- term relationship.
9 
Nevertheless, the estimation results for the 
short- term adjustment dynamics – includ-
ing the delayed impact of price changes – 
suggest that price changes, in particular, 
will cause the housing market to approach 
its long- term equilibrium again in the fu-
ture.10
The empirical results can be illustrated using 
model- based reactions of housing prices and completions to unexpected changes in  the other factors (see the chart on page  25).
11 For example, rises in housing 
prices result in an expansion of completion 
numbers, which is consistent with price- induced investment incentives. According 
to the results, however, exogenous expan-
sions of the housing stock result in rather 
minor price- dampening effects. By contrast, 
income growth or a reduction in interest 
rates are likely to have a comparatively large 
impact on housing prices in Germany. On the whole, the simulation results suggest that the German housing market adjusts rather  sluggishly to exogenous develop-
ments.
The estimation results for the price dynam-
ics of housing and housing completions de-rived from past data are used to extrapolate the prices of housing, taking the long- term 
relationship into account. In this context, 
conditioning on the projections for house-
holds’ disposable income and construction 
price rises as well as the assumptions re-garding interest rate developments ensure 
that the housing price forecast is consistent 
with the expected macroeconomic devel-
opments. Moreover, further price- related 
aspects, such as regional shifts in the de-
mand for housing, which are not automat-ically captured by the model, can also be 
taken into account. Without them, the in-
corporation into the macroeconomic con-
text would be incomplete.
9 So far, this approach has not been readily suitable for 
evaluation purposes since, among other things, house-
hold income and mortgage interest rates do not ne-cessarily reach their longer- term levels in the estima-
tion period and may, in some cases, move only slowly closer towards them again. The Bundesbank’s data on housing overvaluations are currently based on a differ-
ent, regionally differentiated estimation model. They 
refer to an estimated fundamentally justifi  ed property 
price, which is conceptually based on the sustainable 
components of economic and socio- demographic fac-
tors. See F Kajuth, N Pinkwart and T Knetsch (2016), 
Assessing House Prices in Germany: evidence from a 
regional dataset, Journal of European Real Estate Re-
search 9 (3), pp 286-307.
10 The estimated adjustment coeffi   cient in the prop-
erty price equation is negative. Furthermore, statistical 
tests show that, from a macroeconomic perspective, neither household income nor the interest rate level 
contribute to the equilibrium adjustment in the hous-
ing market.11 The determination of the structural relationships is 
based on a recursive identifi  cation, according to which fi  nancial variables, such as housing prices or mortgage 
lending rates, are assumed to react more quickly to 
other shocks than real variables such as housing com-
pletions or household income. See K Tsatsaronis and H  Zhu (2004), What drives housing price dynamics:

ments Quarterly Review; and C Goodhart and B Hoff-
mann (2008), House prices, money, credit and the

account of the fact that assistance is increas -
ingly shifting to unemployment benefit II and 
related benefit payouts. This is curbing the in -
crease in government consumption consider -
ably, particularly this year. However, an acceler -
ation can then be expected once more, con -
tributing to the overall expansionary fiscal 
stance. A renewed increase in tangible goods 
purchases is likely to be followed by a con -
tinued building- up of staff levels, and health -
care and long- term care benefits should also 
continue to rise noticeably.
In 2018, imports of goods and services to Ger -
many will probably even slightly exceed the 
strong growth seen in 2017, but will then grad -
ually lose momentum. In terms of exports and 
business investment, this time frame reflects 
the development of those demand compon -
ents which are fuelled to a particularly great 
extent, directly and indirectly, by imports of 
intermediate goods. Alongside only moderately 
rising import prices based on international 
commodity price assumptions, imports are also 
bolstered by the fact that the German econo -
my’s international financial interconnectedness 
is expected to increase further, meaning that 
the import shares of all demand components 
should rise, too. Other EU member states are 
particularly likely to benefit from the high Ger -
man demand for foreign products on account 
of their increasing price competitiveness. Yet 
fairly strong growth rates can be expected for 
the imports from trading partners outside the 
euro area as well.
The high current account surplus will probably 
fall only slightly over the projection horizon. 
This is due to offsetting price and volume ef -
fects in the trade balance and the expectation 
of only minimal changes in net primary and 
secondary income over the projection horizon. 
In spite of the strong expansion of exports, the 
trade surplus this year is likely to decline. Price 
effects play a key role here, as imports rise in 
price more quickly than exports on account of 
higher crude oil prices. The reverse will prob -
ably be true in 2019, when based on the as -sumptions made regarding international com -
modity prices and exchange rates, import 
prices will increase only moderately whilst ex -
port prices rise considerably more strongly 
owing to domestic labour cost pressures. How -
ever, this is offset by the fact that in the light of 
substantial domestic demand, imports would 
then increase more strongly than exports in real 
terms, with the result that the overall trade sur -
plus could decline somewhat further. The same 
is true of the balance on the current account, 
which is nevertheless expected to remain high 
in 2019 at 7.7% of GDP .
Labour market
Very favourable labour market developments 
continued in the second and third quarters of 
2017. Although over the past six months em -
ployment growth lagged behind the extraor -
dinarily strong increase in the final quarter of 
2016 and the first quarter of 2017, it was none -
theless somewhat stronger than assumed in 
the June forecast. Registered unemployment 
declined to roughly the extent projected. The 
positive labour market developments are also 
likely to continue into the turn of 2017/ 2018. 
Leading indicators suggest that employment 
will see a further strong increase and that the 
number of unemployed persons will fall.
In the recent past, labour market tension has 
become amplified. Underemployment fell and 
the number of vacancies increased, meaning 
that in arithmetical terms, only about 2.3 un -
employed persons applied for each vacancy 
during the first three quarters of 2017.7 This 
trend will continue in the years ahead. While 
the demand for labour will continue to rise sig -

ity, the number of persons potentially available Strong rise in

to the labour market is set to rise considerably 
more slowly in future.
Demographic trends are a key reason for in -
creasingly subdued labour force growth over 
the next few years. Not only is the number of 
persons of working age declining at an increas -
ing pace, but the age structure is also shifting, 
meaning that the age groups with the highest 
level of labour force participation will be smaller 
in future.8
Moreover, it should be assumed that migration 
will contribute less significantly to the expan -
sion of the labour supply in the years to come. 
The number of migrants had already decreased 
significantly last year, on balance. This con -
cerned the number of refugees, for one thing. 
However, should refugees’ asylum applications 
be approved, they will only gradually become 
active in the German labour market and there -
fore bolster the labour supply for a while. As 
most of the asylum application procedures for 
refugees who migrated to Germany between 
2014 and 2016 have been completed and the 
overall recognition rate is only around 50%, a 
large number of persons are also obliged to 
leave the country and are therefore not enter -
ing the labour market. A crucial factor for the 
future labour supply is that substantially fewer 
persons from other EU member states are com -ing to Germany. Whereas the migration flow 
from central and eastern European countries to 
Germany was initially relatively one- sided 
shortly after the introduction of the free move -
ment of workers, an increasing number of per -
sons are now moving in the opposite direction, 
resulting in lower net migration rates. Income 
has recently increased in these countries signifi -
cantly more strongly than in western Europe. In 
addition, unemployment and consequently mi -
gration probability are declining both in these 
countries and in southern EU member states. 
The United Kingdom’s exit from the EU could 
trigger or divert migration flows towards Ger -
many to a certain extent. However, at least the 
number of migrants coming from eastern Eur -
ope to Great Britain was no longer particularly 
high shortly before the “Leave” vote.
Labour force participation is likely to increase 
further as workplace conditions and opportun -
ities for balancing work and family commit -
ments improve. By international standards, 
however, it has already reached a very high 
level, and saturation effects are clearly identifi -
able in individual age groups. This means that 
in spite of the outstanding labour market situ -
ation in Germany at present, which is making it 
particularly easy to take up employment, it will 
be difficult to raise the participation rate to the 
same extent as in previous years.
According to the projection, increasing labour 
market tension will result in the average dur -
ation of unemployment phases falling further 
and even persons with placement difficulties 
finding employment in more cases. The un -
employment rate over the projection horizon 
could therefore sink to around 5%. Nonethe -
less, employment growth is set to decline from 
1.5% in 2017 to around half of that by 2019, 
and will be considerably lower still in 2020. A

set the total number of hours worked. The 
declining  trend, based on the increasing share 
of part- time employees, was already reversed 
in 2017. In the next few years, too, it is likely 
that more overtime hours will be worked and 
fewer persons will be involuntarily working 
part- time, and that part- time employees’ work 
time will continue to increase. All in all, how -
ever, the rise in the total number of hours 
worked will be curbed substantially over the 
course of the projection horizon on account of 
a limited labour supply.
Labour costs and prices
Negotiated rates of pay increased only mod -
estly in 2017, too, given the high degree of la -
bour market tension.9 Low productivity growth 
and consumer price inflation coupled with high 
levels of immigration from other EU countries 
in previous years, which expanded the supply 
of available labour, contributed to the com -
paratively subdued wage development. It can 
be assumed that management and labour in 
the “large” wage round of 2018 will negotiate 
perceptibly higher rates than before. This is pri -
marily due to the excellent economic situation, 
which is also reflected in stronger productivity 
gains and considerably increasing domestic la -
bour market tension, but also because inflation 
rates have risen in the meantime. It is likely that 
the effects of high levels of labour market-  
induced migration in past years will continue to 
make themselves felt for a prolonged period 
and will, when viewed in isolation, also dampen 
wage developments over the projection hori -
zon. However, staff shortages will probably be -
come further exacerbated in 2019 and 2020, 
with the result that negotiated rates of pay will 
rise even more dynamically than in 2018.
Actual earnings are likely to increase much 
more strongly than negotiated rates of pay 
over the entire projection horizon. The main 
drivers of the consistently positive wage drift 
will be cyclically induced increases in working 
hours, performance- based bonuses and more wages exceeding collectively agreed rates in 
areas with particularly pronounced labour 
shortages.10 Average compensation per em -
ployee, which includes employers’ social contri -
butions on top of actual earnings, will thus also 
pick up perceptibly over the projection horizon. 
As in previous years, however, it will rise at 
slightly lower rates than actual earnings, espe -
cially as the contribution rate for the statutory 
pension insurance scheme will be falling slightly 
in the next two years. The steep surge in unit 
labour costs, which has persisted since 2012 
and is strong by historical standards, will none -
theless be distinctly dampened in this year and 
the next, since the slight acceleration in labour 
cost growth will be outstripped by the excep -
tionally large increase in productivity growth 
induced by cyclical factors. Unit labour costs 
are likely to rise much more strongly again from 
2019.Considerably

and extrapolated beyond their contractual term, taking 
into account the overall economic situation and industry-  
specific features.
10 Furthermore, the assumed increase in the statutory gen -
eral minimum wage in 2019 is expected to exert upward 
pressure on wages in wage segments that are not captured 
in the negotiated pay rate statistics. It is therefore likely to 
be reflected in the wage drift. In 2018 and 2020, when the 
minimum wage will not be raised, a certain countermove -

The unit labour cost profile and the changes in 
aggregate profit margins together determine 
domestic inflation as measured by the GDP de -
flator. Given the healthy economic situation, 
the temporarily subdued increase in unit labour 
costs should, on its own, allow enterprises to 
widen their profit margins in the short term. 
However, this effect is being counteracted this 
year by the deterioration in the real terms of 
trade on account of resurgent energy prices. 
Barring a further deterioration in the real terms 
of trade, though, margins should widen con -
siderably next year. Starting in 2019, profit mar -
gins will then broadly stabilise as unit labour 
costs rise more strongly again. Overall, domes -
tic inflation as measured by the GDP deflator is 
likely to pick up from 1.5% this year to 2.1% by 
2019 and to rise even further in 2020.
Consumer prices rose more strongly from the 
third quarter of 2017 than was predicted in the 
June projection. This was down to higher crude 
oil prices, on the one hand, which drove en -
ergy prices up considerably. On the other hand, 
food prices exceeded the projection owing to 
more dynamic commodity prices and more ex -
pensive tobacco products. Excluding the two 
volatile components of energy and food, how -
ever, the rate increased a little less strongly 
than assumed in June. Services, in particular, 
experienced distinctly weaker- than- expected 
price rises recently. This was largely because 
October saw not only a marked reduction in 
premiums for motor vehicle insurance but also 
a noticeable decline in the prices of package 
holidays.11 Finally, the slightly higher rates of in -
crease in rents recorded when the June fore -
cast was prepared tailed off. By contrast, the 
prices of non- energy industrial goods even rose 
somewhat more strongly than anticipated, des -
pite the unexpected appreciation of the euro.

stood at 1.8% in November and was thus 
0.3 percentage point higher than assumed in 
the June projection.
Over the projection horizon, the extremely fa -
vourable economic setting is likely to enable 
enterprises to initially widen their profit mar -
gins and subsequently to pass on to consumers 
the increasing price pressures brought about 
chiefly by rising labour costs. The inflation rate 
excluding energy and food should therefore be 
going up steadily over the coming years. Al -
ready this year, the prices of non- energy indus -
trial goods have risen more sharply than the 
average for the preceding years. However, in -
flation in non- energy industrial goods will prob -
ably tail off a little to begin with in 2018, be -
fore picking up again thanks to the cyclical ef -
fect. This is because the steep upward pressure 
on the prices of industrial goods this year also 
stemmed from a significant increase in com -
modity prices, which is not anticipated to con -
tinue in this manner. For services, the under -
lying upward tendency this year was still ob -
scured by lower consumer prices owing to the 
reform of long- term care in January 2017, 
which means that the rate is likely to surge up 
in 2018 when this effect is no longer present. 
Overall, consumer price inflation excluding en -
ergy and food could climb incrementally from 
1.3% in the current year to 1.9% in 2019. A 
further increase to 2.1% in 2020 is conceivable 
owing to significant overutilisation of economic 
capacity.12
The current significant price rises for food are 
likely to weaken slightly from 2018; prices 
should then more or less match the inflation 
rate excluding energy and food. By the end of 
this year, the steep rise in crude oil prices seen 
recently is likely to have largely been funnelled 
into consumer prices for energy, but the ele -
vated price level should mean that energy con -
tinues to make a positive contribution to the 
headline rate on average in 2018. In the subse -
quent years, however, energy prices are un -
likely to rise by much, primarily because of the 
assumption that crude oil prices will fall. Head -line HICP inflation should therefore lag slightly 
behind the rate excluding energy (and food), 
putting inflation in the next few years at a simi -
larly high level to this year. In 2020, consumer 
price inflation could reach 1.9%.
Public finances
Public finances are benefiting in this projection 
from very favourable framework conditions. 
The general government surplus is still growing 
this year (2016 surplus: +0.8% of GDP), in spite 
of the repayment of nuclear fuel tax.13 In the 
absence of any new measures, the surplus will 
then rise to just over 1½% of GDP in 2020. This 
improvement reflects both the cyclical upturn 
and declining interest expenditure. It will also 
be augmented in 2018, when the nuclear fuel 
tax repayment comes to an end. The baseline

12 For the purposes of the projection, it is assumed that 
the infrastructure levy will be collected from 2020. This will 
increase the inflation rate slightly, despite the price-  
dampening effect of the motor vehicle tax relief, which will 
more than compensate German residents. This is because 
the HICP is based on the domestic concept, which means 
that domestic expenditure by non- residents is included in 
the basket of goods and is taken into account when meas -
uring inflation.

that this tax is invalid, payments in the amount of 0.2% of

tural primary balance,14 will be distinctly expan -
sionary next year and slightly so thereafter. 
However, since budgetary policymakers are un -
likely to aim for surpluses as high as those ar -
rived at under this projection’s assumptions, 
tax cuts and additional spending are expected, 
in particular, after the new government has 
been formed. As a result, the fiscal balances are 
likely to be much lower than described here, 
and the fiscal policy stance more expansion -
ary.15
The revenue ratio is likely to rise again slightly 
this year. In particular, revenue from profit-  
related taxes is continuing to grow strongly, 
but the favourable developments in wages and 
the labour market are also having a positive ef -
fect. On the whole, the ratio is expected to 
shrink somewhat next year, when, amongst 
other things, the contribution rates for the 
pension insurance scheme and health insur -
ance will be lowered slightly. Moreover, the fast 
pace of revenue growth from profit-  related taxes is unlikely to be maintained. Virtually no 
changes are expected from 2019, on the whole. 
The expenditure ratio is under strain from 
strong nominal GDP growth in the ratio’s de -
nominator, falling interest expenditure and, 
next year, from the lapsing of the nuclear fuel 
tax repayment.16 Structural primary expend -
iture17 is likely to increase fairly perceptibly, 
however. As regards public long- term care in -
surance and health insurance, dynamic growth 
is expected overall, as in the recent past. Fur -
thermore, wage growth and the contribution 
rate cuts combined with more people entering 
retirement will lead to distinctly rising pension 
outlays, even if the sustainability factor is again 
expected to have a slightly restraining effect in 
future. In addition, the primary expenditure of 
central, state and local governments is likely to 
rise considerably given their growing surpluses. 
So far, there are plans to boost expenditure, 
particularly on child day- care, education, trans -
port infrastructure, internal security and de -
fence.
The debt ratio is likely to continue its rapid des -
cent (end-2016: 68.1%) and fall below the 60% 
threshold in 2019 – even in the event of 
budgetary burdens posed by newly agreed fis -
cal policy measures. Alongside the budget sur -
pluses of central, state and local governments, 
growth in nominal GDP will depress the ratio 
(via its denominator). The positive economic 
development will thus make itself felt in two 
ways: through the significant cyclical increase 
in surpluses and through higher GDP growth.

owned bad banks is accelerating the decline,

though developments here have sometimes 
been rather volatile in the past.
Risk assessment
Although this projection outlines the most 
probable scenario for economic growth and 
the inflation rate from today’s perspective 
under the given assumptions, there are a multi -
tude of risks and uncertainties that could cause 
economic developments to turn out differently 
than described here. All things considered, eco -
nomic growth is predominantly facing upward 
risks stemming chiefly from the domestic econ -
omy; the risks facing consumer prices also ap -
pear to be tilted slightly to the upside on the 
whole.
As regards future crude oil prices, which could 
have a major impact on the consumer price 
projection in particular, neither upside nor 
downside risk seems to have clearly gained the 
upper hand at present. A tightened oil supply 
–  owing to political tensions in major oil-  
producing countries, for example – could result 
in considerably higher oil prices than assumed 
here on the basis of forward quotations. How -
ever, unconventional forms of oil production in 
the United States, in particular, could also see 
stronger growth and dampen prices, offsetting 
this risk.
For an export-  oriented economy like Germa -
ny’s, the global environment sets key condi -
tions for its economic prospects. A sudden 
tightening of global financing conditions, 
which would hit vulnerable emerging market 
economies especially hard, or a sharp down -
turn in China could put a heavy brake on global 
economic growth and adversely affect German 
exports and investment. While the likelihood of 
growing protectionism has subsided markedly 
since the June projection, new trade barriers 
would take a heavy toll on the German econ -
omy. These risks are countered by a potentially 
more expansionary fiscal policy in the United 
States, on the one hand. On the other, the eco -Baseline

nomic upturn in the advanced economies could 
well persist longer than assumed here given 
continued favourable financing conditions, ac -
celerating growth in the global economy. The 
attendant higher demand for German exports 
could buoy up commercial investment in Ger -
many even more.
Fiscal policy could provide added domestic im -
petus. Once a new federal government has 
been formed, considerable expansionary fiscal 
measures are expected given the favourable 
budget position. Against the backdrop of the 
major overutilisation of aggregate capacity al -
ready included in the baseline, this could also 
exert additional distinct upward pressure on 
consumer prices.
All in all, domestic factors therefore give rise to 
price risk that is tilted slightly to the upside. The possibility of the labour supply reacting more 
elastically than assumed to the sustained high 
demand for labour, causing both wages and 
prices to rise more weakly than projected, only 
partially offsets the countervailing risk of higher 
demand for goods. The impact of the above-  
described global price risks is considered to be 
broadly level. In addition, the switch to a new 
weighting scheme in the HICP , now envisaged 
for 2019, is likely to give rise to considerable 
uncertainty surrounding measured price devel -
opments, with an unknown direction of im -
pact.18Expansionary

German enterprises’ profitability and 
financing  in 2016
The profitability of non- financial corporations improved significantly in the favourable overall eco -
nomic environment of 2016, having dipped in the previous year, partly as a result of one-  off 
effects. With demand in the sales markets strong, enterprises’ gross revenue rose further, although 
sales growth slowed. However, enterprises’ exceptionally good average return on sales – the 
highest since the Great Recession of 2008-09 – is partly the result of sectoral developments and 
other one- off effects. These include, in particular, valuation gains due to a change in the way that 
the provisions that need to be made for pension obligations are calculated, which brought down 
interest expenditure and personnel expenses in 2016. In addition, the cost of materials fell relative 
to sales, reflecting developments in prices for domestic and foreign intermediate goods; this 
boosted non- financial corporations’ annual results. Looking at the individual sectors, service 
enterprises, especially, benefited from the good business conditions and sharply expanded sales 
and total income. By contrast, income in manufacturing fell as sales stagnated.
The upward trend seen in enterprises’ equity ratio over the past few years is likely to have stabil -
ised at its elevated level in 2016. In any case, firms’ equity ratio has recently neither increased nor 
decreased substantially, with a factor being the temporary valuation gains on provisions for pen -
sions in the reporting year. However, the equity ratio of enterprises without pension obligations 
also stabilised at its previous level in 2016.
On the assets side of non- financial corporations’ balance sheet, the trend towards an increased 
build- up of financial assets compared to tangible fixed capital formation continued, and the 
increase in absolute fixed assets was somewhat smaller than in the preceding years. Energy com -
panies also again effected large write- downs on their power plants in the reporting year. Not only 
did enterprises trim their capacity expansion last year, they also modified their strategy of expand -
ing by purchasing shareholdings. However, German enterprises’ growing interconnectedness is 
also reflected in the significant proportion of funds that were used to purchase financial assets. 
Given that the German economy is still growing rapidly and in view of the group accounts avail -
able so far, the profitability of non- financial corporations is likely to have continued to strengthen 
in 2017.Deutsche Bundesbank

Underlying trends
In 2016, the strong upturn of the German 
economy continued apace despite weaker im -
petus from foreign trade. Dynamic private and 
public consumption and the strong increase in 
housing investment helped the real gross do -
mestic product (GDP) grow faster than in the 
previous year, at 1.9%. Aggregate output con -
sequently again outpaced potential output. 
Aggregate capacity utilisation rose further and 
considerably exceeded normal capacity utilisa -
tion. In addition to the favourable develop -
ments in sales markets, prices for intermediate 
goods fell again. Moreover, wage growth 
made a smaller contribution to enterprises’ 
cost increases than a year earlier. The extremely 
favourable overall economic environment 
helped non- financial corporations further im -
prove their earning power. At 4.7%, their re -
turn on sales before tax reached its highest 
level since the Great Recession of 2008-09, not 
least because enterprises were able to further 
boost gross revenue.1 Another important factor 
was the relief provided by valuation gains on 
provisions for pensions.
The way in which the discount rate for pension 
provisions is calculated was revised at the be -
ginning of 2016. The reference period for the 
average discount rate, which is the basis, 
amongst other things, for long- term provisions 
for pension liabilities towards active and former 
employees, was extended from seven to ten 
years. This meant that the discount rate rose in 
2016, as interest rates were higher in the three 
extra years that are now included than in the 
seven years of the original reference period. 
The necessary provisions for pension obliga -
tions were consequently much lower in 2016 in 
some cases, resulting in additional income. This 
had a dampening impact on interest expend -
iture and personnel expenses in enterprises’ 
profit and loss accounts and also affected bal -
ance sheet ratios.
In the reporting year, the equity ratio in the 
aggregate   balance sheet of the non-  financial corporations sector, in essence, stabilised at the 
elevated level it has stood at since 2014. The 
slight lift in the equity ratio reported for non-  
financial corporations overall can be attributed, 
in particular, to valuation gains on provisions 
for pensions. One reason for the increase in 
equity held by enterprises with pension liabil -
ities is probably that the distribution of any 
additional calculatory income resulting from 
the revaluation of the required provisions is 
prohibited.2 Another reason is that the revalu -
ation of pension provisions meant that external 
funds on enterprises’ balance sheets grew sig -
nificantly less than in the preceding year. In 
addition, the equity ratio of enterprises without 
pension liabilities also stabilised at its previous 
level. While the ratio between external funds 
and equity is stable, there is a trend on the 
assets side for companies to expand financial 
assets more than tangible fixed assets. The 
change in percentages given continuous bal -
ance sheet growth was in 2016 again reflected 
mainly in a weaker expansion of tangible fixed 
assets as compared to increased growth in 
claims on affiliated enterprises.
After the change in the calculation method 
raised the discount rate in the reporting year, a 
renewed decline in the discount rate is none -
theless on the cards in the following years; the 
necessary provisions are, however, unlikely to 
hit enterprises as hard as in 2015. Nonetheless, 
the equity ratio among enterprises obliged by 
falling interest rates to form additional pension 
provisions again following the 2016 financial 
year will probably be strained. However, enter -
prises with pension obligations could tend to 
increase savings going forward in order to bal -
ance out this effect by retaining more earn -Very favourable

The emergence of zombie fi  rms in Germany 
in the low- interest- rate environment
In functioning market economies, outdated 
production processes are usually gradually 
replaced by more effi   cient methods. The corporate sector is a crucial player in this process, with its innovations causing new goods and services, as well as production processes, to be developed, thereby spur-
ring productivity gains. However, direct or 
indirect subsidies can enable companies that are not really competitive in terms of productivity to remain in the market. The low- interest- rate setting which has pre-
vailed in the euro area for some years now could have been another factor leading to a situation in which undercapitalised lenders, in particular, continue to fund ineffi   cient or 
even insolvent corporate borrowers  – known as zombie fi  rms.
1 The low interest 
rates could be reducing the opportunity costs for creditors of rolling over non- 
performing loans (NPLs) or allowing defer-
ment of payments as compared to making 
write- downs on claims, realising losses or 
forming provisions.2 This would mean that 
economic resources would tend to remain 
in less productive uses. In macroeconomic terms, productivity and economic growth 
could be stifl  ed via this channel.
How to defi  ne and statistically capture 
zombie fi  rms
Current empirical research suggests a rela-
tionship between a slowdown in productiv-
ity growth in some advanced economies 
over the past few decades and a rise in the 
number of zombie fi  rms.3 Firm- level micro-
data from the Bundesbank’s Financial State-
ment Data Pool can be used to assess the 
quantitative importance of zombie fi  rms in 
Germany and their contribution to overall economic developments in the corporate 
sector.4If fi  rms in the dataset do not exit the market 
even though their medium- term operating 
revenue is insuffi   cient to fund major ex-
penditure items, they are classifi  ed as zom-
bie fi  rms.5 In line with the approach pur-
sued in the literature, variant A classifi  es as 
a zombie fi  rm one that cannot meet its interest payments (including similar ex-
penses) out of its operating and investment 
income for three consecutive years. For a 
zombie fi  rm, the interest coverage ratio, ie 
the ratio of operating and investment in-come to interest payments, would be less 
than one in three consecutive years.6 Alter-
natively, variant B defi  nes a zombie fi  rm as 
one whose cash fl  ow has been negative for three consecutive years.

The results based on the latest available 
three- year period, which ends in 2015, are 
compared with two suitable points in time 
1 See eg F Schivardi, E Sette and G Tabellini (2017), 
Credit misallocation during the European fi  nancial cri-
sis, CESifo Working Paper No 6406.2 Another possible effect of low interest rates is to ob-scure the actual (inferior) quality of the loans and thus 
the need for write- downs, since the debt is easier to 
service even for ailing borrowers.3 See eg M Adalet McGowan, D Andrews and V Millot (2017), The walking dead? Zombie fi  rms and product-ivity performance in OECD countries, OECD Economics Department Working Paper No 1372.4 See Deutsche Bundesbank, Financial statements stat-

ability and to capture only those enterprises with

prior to the extraordinary slide in interest 
rates following the fi  nancial and economic 
crisis in the euro area. One of the reference 
points in time is the year 2007, the last year 
of the solid upswing in Germany prior to 
the onset of the Great Recession. The other 
is the year 2000, in which aggregate cap-
acity utilisation was at a similar level to the evaluation period.
8
The defi  nition of the measure in variant A 
incorporates not only conventional interest 
payments on loans but also expenditure ne-
cessitated by the low- interest- rate environ-
ment. Such expenditure includes pension entitlement- related interest expenditure 
over the past few years due to changes to 
accounting rules.9 These considerations 
thus rest on the assumption that servicing overall interest expenditure – and not just interest expenditure based on ongoing 
lending relationships – is relevant to a fi  rm’s fi  nancial stability. Income from equity hold-
ings between affi   liated fi  rms is also taken 
into account .10No increase in percentage share of zombie fi  rms in low- interest- rate setting
The results of both approaches show that zombie fi  rms make up a small percentage 
of all fi  rms in Germany and that this share 
has not increased in the low- interest- rate setting. In 2000, they accounted for only 
somewhere near 8% of all fi  rms according 
to variant A; in 2007 and 2015, this share 
was even lower, at around 4¾% in each of 
those years. Variant B yields a similar pic-
ture; here, zombie fi  rms make up only 
around 1½% to 2% of all fi  rms in 2000 and 
2007 – even less than in variant A – and the fi  gure for 2015 is only barely higher than in the two reference years. What the analyses therefore show is that, in 2015 – the latest 
year for which data are available  – the 
quantitative importance of zombie fi  rms in 
Germany was similarly small as in earlier up-
swings and has not increased in the low- 
interest- rate setting.
8 As in the case of the evaluation period, the results 
for the reference years are based on three- year time- 
spans.
9 Since the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetz-
buch) was amended in 2010, discount rates must be 
calculated based on average yields over a period of 
several years. With interest rates persistently low, pen-
sion liabilities consequently necessitate additional 
interest expenses. See also Deutsche Bundesbank, Ger-
man enterprises’ profi  tability and fi  nancing in 2015, 
Monthly Report, December 2016, pp 57-76.
10 This means that earnings and expenditure metrics 
are consistently captured together when calculating the interest coverage ratio. Interest expenditure also contains interest on loans taken out by a parent for 
subsidiaries. The operating result from core business is 
also augmented to include income from equity hold-
ings in other fi  rms so as, for instance, to factor hold-
ings without self- generated income out of the popula-tion of zombie fi  rms. Alternative versions, in which in-come from equity holdings in other fi  rms or additional 
interest expenses owing to the setting- aside of provi-
sions for future pension obligations are excluded, pro-duce qualitatively similar results.Zombie fi  rms in Germany*

Zombie fi  rms: lower profi  tability, lower 
investment and more highly leveraged
From a macroeconomic perspective, it is of 
interest whether and how zombie fi  rms im-
pede the effi   cient allocation of labour and 
capital, and to what extent they affect the 
productivity and investment patterns of all 
non- fi  nancial corporations. Not surprisingly, variant A shows that zombie fi  rms are con-
siderably less profi  table than other fi  rms 
– measured in terms of the ratio of annual 
result before taxes on income over gross 
revenue – which, in many cases, is actually 
negative.11 In all reporting years, zombie 
fi  rms’ share of sales is low.12
The ratio of the gross increase in tangible fi  xed assets to total assets is smaller for 
zombie fi  rms than for others in all reporting 
periods. Consequently, zombie fi  rms tend to underinvest. However, their small share 
of total fi  xed assets means that their damp-ening impact on non- fi  nancial corporations’ 
productivity is likely to be small.13 In add-
ition, the extent of potential capital misal-
location is likely to be very limited given the small share of fi  xed assets tied up in zombie fi  rms.
Moreover, the evaluations show that zom-
bie fi  rms have, on the whole, a signifi  cantly lower equity ratio and are more dependent on external funding than other fi  rms. In all evaluation periods, they are generally more highly indebted to affi   liated enterprises and, in some cases, to credit institutions.
No signs of dampening effects on 
growth or productivity
It must be noted that the analyses are sub-
ject to constraints which make it diffi   cult to draw conclusions regarding the universe of 
fi  rms. One is that the Financial Statements 
Data Pool tends to be biased towards more stable fi  rms, which means that zombie fi  rms 
might be under- recorded. On the other hand, though, the identifi  ed sample of 
zombie fi  rms could also contain young fi  rms 
and start- ups with a promising economic outlook since the fi  rm age could not be 
taken into account owing to the absence of 
information on the year the fi  rm was founded. All in all, the descriptive results 
do, however, indicate that, for the sample 
of fi  rms in Germany covered by the analysis, 
zombie fi  rms are not a signifi  cant factor in 
11 For many fi  rms, the size of interest expenditure 
does not appear to determine whether the fi  rm is clas-
sifi  ed as a zombie fi  rm. Other cost components, such 
as the cost of materials and staff or write- downs, as 
well as earnings components seem to play a more 
prominent role.12 The groups of zombie fi  rms and non- zombie fi  rms 
show a similar size structure in the underlying refer-
ence data set.
13 This fi  nding also holds if the respective previous 
year is assessed, mitigating the potential impact of 
clustered investment. In addition, variant B produces, 
on the whole, a qualitatively similar picture.German non-fi  nancial corporations’ balance sheet and P/L metrics

ings.3 Overall, it is therefore unlikely that such 
provisions will lower the capital adequacy of 
many enterprises with pension obligations to 
such an extent as to cause funding difficulties, 
for example.
At just over 1%, companies’ sales growth was 
weaker in the reporting year than in the two 
preceding years. The sharp decline in sales 
among energy suppliers, as a consequence of 
both smaller trading volumes and lower prices, 
had a dampening effect. Excluding energy sup -
ply, sales would have risen by approximately 
2% in aggregate. Moreover, one- off effects in 
connection with the new accounting rules 
under the German Accounting Directive Imple -
mentation Act (Bilanzrichtlinie- Umsetzungsge -
setz) have an impact on the way sales are re -
ported and on the expense items. First, parts of 
other operating income were, for the first time, 
allocated to sales in 2016 and, second, excise 
duties have, since then, no longer been re -
ported under sales and thus not under operat -ing taxes. In the reporting year, these two op -
posing effects resulted, overall, in a slight in -
crease in sales as reported in enterprises’ ag -
gregate profit and loss accounts.
Non-  financial corporations’ cash flow grew 
sharply again in 2016, although the net inflow 
of funds as a whole declined. However, exter -
nally financed capital injections for corpor -
ations were comparatively small as well. A con -
siderable proportion of the incoming funds was 
–  as in the previous year  – used to acquire 
financial  assets. In this context, companies 
granted loans mainly in the context of trade 
payables and within their corporate group. The 
percentage of enterprises’ funds used to ac -
quire liabilities was roughly three times as high Moderate sales 
growthNet inflow of funds lowerterms of their number, sales or tangible 
fi  xed assets held.14 Their weight has not 
increased  in the low- interest- rate setting, either. As they lack signifi  cance, zombie 
fi  rms are currently unlikely to be having any perceptibly dampening effect on productiv-
ity and economic growth in Germany. This 
fi  nding is consistent with the assessment 
that the German corporate sector has been in largely good shape for several years now.
14 This fi  nding is reinforced by the fact that a relatively 
large number of companies classifi  ed as “zombies” are 
part of a corporate group. In these cases, overriding 
considerations could encourage parent enterprises to 
assume reported losses in the long term.
3 A simulation- based quantification suggests that this ef -
fect could be a factor in non- financial corporations’ in -
creased saving. See Deutsche Bundesbank, Potential effects 
of the increase in pension provisions as a result of changes 
to the discount rate on non- financial corporations’ savings,

as that used to expand the stock of tangible 
fixed assets. The pace of corporate expansion 
through the acquisition of shareholdings 
slowed down in the reporting year, falling short 
of the very high levels seen in the two previous 
years.
The number of corporate insolvencies con -
tinued to decline in 2016 and hit a new all- time 
low. The continued strong increase in cash 
flows and favourable conditions for debt re -
structuring have probably improved non-  
financial corporations’ prospects. By and large, 
sectoral trends reflected macroeconomic devel -
opments. In manufacturing, the construction 
sector as well as in the services sector, the 
number of insolvencies fell sharply again. How -
ever, some sectors exhibited something of a 
slowdown in business activity. For example, the 
number of bankruptcies in accommodation 
and food services increased, and business con -
ditions in transportation and storage did not 
appear to improve either.
Sales and income
At just over 1%, non- financial corporations’ 
sales growth was slightly weaker in 2016 than 
in the previous year, when it was almost 2%. 
However, this probably understates growth in 
the volume of goods and services, as sales 
prices moderated further in the reporting year. 
For instance, prices of manufactured goods 
sold domestically fell by 1.8% and those in -
tended for export came down by 0.8% as com -
pared with the previous year, in which domes -
tic producer prices had declined at a similar 
pace, but export prices rose moderately, by 
0.8%.
At the sectoral level, there were again relatively 
large differences in terms of the integration in 
international value chains in the year under re -
view. This is clear from the fact that sectors 
that focus on domestic markets tended to ex -
hibit higher sales growth than those active in 
international trade. Whereas sales growth was Corporate

moderate to strong in all observed services sec -
tors –  with the exception of the import and 
export- heavy wholesale trade – sales in the in -
dustrial sector fell perceptibly, by just over 1%, 
in 2016. Besides the change in the way in 
which excise duties are reported, sharply lower 
import prices – especially for energy – are likely 
to have been a major factor.4 The resulting sav -
ings in the cost of materials were, in part, 
passed on in the form of lower sales prices. 
This relationship is reflected in the electricity, 
gas and water supply sector, which contributes 
some 10% to sales. As a result of the lower 
cost of materials (-10%), domestic prices there 
also declined sharply (-6%) in a business envir -onment characterised by low margins.5 Overall, 
revenues in this sector were considerably down 
from the previous year’s level (-8.5%). In add -
ition, sales momentum in the industrial sector, 
which is heavily geared towards exports, eased 
off noticeably, and revenues more or less stag -Enterprises’ income statement*

4 The decline in sales as a result of the change in the way 
in which excise duties are reported is relevant mainly for 
enterprises in the production sector.
5 The cost of materials as a percentage of sales is 85% in 
this sector, compared with 66% for all surveyed enter -
prises. As a consequence, sales in this sector are particularly 
sensitive to changes in the cost of materials.Deutsche Bundesbank

nated in the year under review.6 By contrast, 
sales in the construction sector, which mainly 
serves domestic markets, expanded sharply in 
the reporting year (6%) following moderate 
growth in the previous year (3%).
Enterprises’ other income, which mainly com -
prises income from non- core- business activities 
as well as income from participating interests, 
fell sharply in the reporting year. Again, one- off 
factors had a role to play. The Accounting Dir -
ective Implementation Act means that parts of 
the sums which had, up until 2015, been re -
ported as other operating income have since 
been allocated to sales.7 As a result, other op -
erating income – and thus other income as a 
whole – fell sharply on paper in the reporting 
year (-27.5%). Even so, in relation to gross rev -
enue, other operating income still represented 
the largest item under other income. Moreover, 
the reallocation of other operating income to 
sales meant that sales growth was just over 
1  percentage point stronger in 2016 than it 
would have been if the reporting change had 
not taken place. This did not affect income de -
velopments as a whole, however, as it merely 
represents a reorganisation among different 
earnings items. Another dampening factor was 
income from long- term equity investments, 
which fell by just under one- tenth in the re -
porting year, after having grown very strongly 
in the previous year (+44%). Non- financial cor -
porations’ interest and similar income has been 
at a fairly steady low level since 2013.
In the reporting year, non- financial corpor -
ations’ total expenditure decreased slightly by 
1%. This was due mainly to changes made in 
the context of the German Accounting Direct -
ive Implementation Act, as a result of which re -
ported operating taxes in particular and, to a 
lesser extent, other expenditure were lower 
compared with the previous year.
The largest item in the expenditure account, ie 
cost of materials, remained virtually unchanged 
on the year. The share of this item in gross rev -
enue, which has been declining since 2012, fell further to just over 64% at last count. The fa -
vourable evolution of prices of intermediate 
goods and raw materials in this period is likely 
to have played a key role here. However, there 
are major differences at the sectoral level. On 
the one hand, a number of economic sectors 
– such as the industrial sector or electricity, gas 
and water supply – continued to benefit from 
the more favourable prices of raw materials in 
2016 compared with a year earlier. On the 
other hand, significant increases were recorded 
in the cost of materials in the construction sec -
tor (7%) and a number of areas of the services 
sector, especially business services (6.5%), the 
information and communications sector (8%) 
and motor vehicle trade (8.5%).
Mirroring the share of the cost of materials, the 
importance of the second- largest expenses 
item, ie personnel costs, continued to expand 
in 2016. However, the increase in this cost 
item, at 2.5%, was weaker than the average 
across the five preceding years. Against the 
backdrop of the favourable economic situation, 
this somewhat unusual low expansion is also 
linked to the increase in the statutory reference 
rate for pension provisions as from the 2016 
financial year. Consequently, non- financial cor -
porations were able in 2016 to make lower 
pension provisions or dissolve those previously 
set aside. Some companies record such relief 
under personnel expenses, while others book it 
under interest expenditure; in the reporting 
year, this meant that the alleviating effect of 
provisions was felt in both items. Firms without 
pension reserves saw personnel costs rise con -
siderably, whereas firms with pension reserves 
recorded only a slight increase. However, given 
that interest expenditure excluding pension li -
abilities represents a relatively small cost item, Enterprises’ 
other income strongly influenced  by one- off effects

6 At a more deeply disaggregated level, it is evident, how -
ever, that revenues in vehicle manufacture rose particularly 
sharply – as in the preceding years; gains of 8.5% in 2014 
and 9.5% in 2015 were followed by a plus of 5% in the 
year under review. The motor vehicle trade also benefited, 
with sales picking up by 8.5% in 2016, following 6.5% in 
2015.
7 Other operating income includes exchange gains and 
write- ups as well as revenue from the release of provisions 
or the sale of tangible fixed assets.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
December 2017

the new method of calculating the reference 
rate in this case led to a fairly sharp decline of 
29.5%. By contrast, interest expenditure re -
mained virtually unchanged for firms without 
pension provisions.
Following a strong previous year (+7.5%), 
growth in the third large expenses item, ie 
other expenses, dropped by just over 1.5% in 
the reporting year. Besides one- off expenses in 
the case of some large firms in the previous 
year, in the year under review, this was also at -
tributable – as mentioned above – to changes 
in reporting based on the Accounting Directive 
Implementation Act at the expense of other 
operating expenses and in favour of the cost of 
materials, which mirrored the changes in other 
operating income and in sales. Moreover, with 
regard to operating taxes, the 2016 income 
statement for enterprises reflected the fact that 
excise duties are no longer included in sales, 
rendering the corresponding expenditure item 
obsolete. Hence, expenditure on operating 
taxes decreased by 86% in the reporting year.8 
Without this reform, growth in sales, total in -
come and expenditure would have been just 
under 1 percentage point higher.9 On balance, 
this does not affect the annual result.
Resulting from an essentially unchanged total 
income and a decline in total expenses, the re -
turn on sales before tax improved from 3.8% in 
the previous year to 4.7% in the reporting year. 
However, in 2015, the emissions scandal 
weighed heavily on profits in motor vehicle 
manufacturing. If, in addition, the relief pro -
vided by the reduced requirements for pension 
provisions is taken into account, the profitabil -
ity of non- financial corporations in the report -
ing year should not differ substantially from the 
previous year’s level.
Sources and uses of funds
In the light of the ongoing economic recovery, 
internal financing remained at a high level des -
pite the slight drop in 2016. Concerning exter -nal funding, non- financial corporations’ confi -
dence in the sustainability of the healthy econ -
omy is probably also reflected in the increased 
build- up of long- term obligations. Overall, ex -
ternal financing decreased slightly amidst re -
duced capital injections. This development 
could also have something to do with reduced 
purchase volumes for long- term equity invest -
ments following the one- off effects in the two 
preceding years, particularly as a result of the 
consolidation in the telecommunications sector 
and the chemical industry.
As in the preceding year, around half of the 
available funds were used for investment in 
tangible fixed assets. The gross increase in tan -
gible fixed assets was somewhat higher than 
the subdued level a year earlier. However, ad -
justed for replacement investment and depreci -
ation, the increase in tangible fixed assets was 
lower than the year before. This was attribut -
able, in particular, to the information and com -
munications sector; in 2016, activity in this sec -
tor was, amongst other things, characterised 
by the slowdown in broadband network ex -
pansion. In addition, negative impulses eman -
ated from transport and energy companies, 
which continued to record substantial write-  
downs on their power plants.
Following the consolidation of enterprises in 
the telecommunications sector and the chem -
ical industry in 2014 and 2015, during which an 
above- average increase in purchases of long-  
term equity investments was recorded, the 
pace of corporate expansions calmed in the re -
porting year. After a boost to the acquisition of 
long- term equity investments in the two pre -
ceding years, expansionary activities in motor 
vehicle manufacturing were likewise scaled Decline in other 
expenses also due to legisla-tive changes

8 The excise taxes recorded for 2016 are essentially attrib -
utable to enterprises whose financial year differs from the 
calendar year and started as early as 2015. For these enter -
prises, the aforementioned effect does not occur until the 
following year.
9 At the sectoral level, the areas of the manufacturing sec -
tor “manufacture of food products, beverages and tobacco 
products” as well as “manufacture of coke and refined pet -
roleum products” were particularly affected by the changes 
due to the Accounting Directive Implementation Act.Deutsche Bundesbank

back. By contrast, manufacturers of machinery 
and equipment, energy suppliers and retailers 
increasingly invested in equity stakes.
Balance sheet developments
The good economic situation in 2016 was also 
reflected in the development of the aggregate 
balance sheet of the non- financial corporations 
sector, which grew to much the same extent, 
on average, as it had in the preceding five 
years. This was in part due to the interconnect -
edness of companies, which could be observed 
in balance sheet developments. The rate at which companies became more interconnected 
in the reporting year hardly dropped; this was 
mirrored by the increase in claims and liabilities 
vis- à- vis affiliated companies. Against this back -
drop, long-  term positions, in particular, grew 
perceptibly in almost all sectors. Overall, finan -
cial obligations to affiliated enterprises con -
tinued to make the largest contribution to the 
increase in external funds. In the reporting year, 
the expansion of enterprises’ balance sheets 
was also reflected in the greater use of trade 
credits. Both short- term receivables and ac -
counts payable rose a great deal more across 
all sectors than in previous years.Stable growth in

While liabilities arising from trading activities 
and to affiliated companies showed dynamic 
growth, the significance of credit institutions in 
the external financing of non- financial corpor -
ations continued to wane in 2016. The share of 
obligations to the banking sector in liabilities 
fell from just over 30% in the early 2000s to 
around 20% in 2016.10 The reduction in long-  
term liabilities to banks in the reporting year 
took place, for the most part, in the energy 
supply and the information and communica -
tions sectors.
The downward trend in borrowing through 
credit institutions was counterbalanced by a strong expansion in liabilities in the form of 
bonds.11 The share of issued bonds in corpor -
ations’ total liabilities tended to increase in the 
period between 2011 and 2016, though this 
form of financing played a fairly minor role for 
non- corporations. This can probably be ex -
plained by the prolonged period of low interest Further decline

10 This decline was offset by a build-  up of liabilities to 
affiliated  companies in connection with cash pooling and 
financing entities.
11 The fact that the share of bonds in total assets remains 
relatively low is, amongst other things, due to the fact that 
bonds are often issued via foreign financing entities and 
that intra- group funding is, in this case, recorded under 
obligations to affiliated enterprises. The actual volume of 
financing generated via bonds is thus higher than indicated 
in the category of bonds.Deutsche Bundesbank

rates and investors pursuing higher yields. In 
2016, the issuance of both short- term and 
long- term bonds rose, with the strong increase 
confined to just a few sectors. In the case of 
long- term bonds, more than half of the growth 
was down to the manufacture of motor 
vehicles , while around half of the increase in 
short- term bonds was attributable to the 
energy  sector.
In 2016, external funds grew at a more moder -
ate rate than in the previous year. While the 
volume of liabilities expanded by roughly the 
same measure as total assets, the increase in 
reserves was distinctly lower on the year owing 
to the recalculation of the discount rate for 
pension provisions. Provisions for pensions 
even fell on aggregate, with manufacturers of 
motor vehicles, in particular, experiencing a sig -
nificant decline. In the reporting year, enter -
prises again reported higher equity ratios. 
However, adjusted approximately for the valu -
ation gains from pension provisions, the equity 
ratio of non- financial corporations remained 
more or less constant at what is now a clearly 
elevated level.
On the assets side, the trend increase in liquid 
funds relative to total assets observed across 
several sectors since the early 2000s continued. 
In the case of non- financial corporations as a 
whole, the share of cash and bank balances in 
total assets (7%) was 2  percentage points 
higher in 2016 than at the beginning of the 
millennium. On the one hand, this appears to 
indicate non- financial corporations’ higher 
preference for liquidity. On the other hand, 
however, this balance sheet item could also re -
flect the fact that interest rate spreads between 
short and long- term yields have been relatively 
narrow due to the low- interest- rate setting.
The increase in tangible fixed assets was some -
what lower compared with previous years and 
failed to keep pace with the expansion of total 
assets in the year under review. Mirroring the 
development of financial assets, the import -
ance of tangible fixed assets for investment continued to decrease, with the trend increase 
in long- term equity holdings also a relevant 
factor. In addition, growth in intangible assets 
was weak on the whole.12 However, the trad -
itionally relatively volatile goodwill in some sec -
tors came into play here. Excluding the damper 
emanating from this sub- item, total intangible 
assets increased sharply again.Equity ratio

counteracted by negative exchange rate ef-
fects.1 Groups active primarily in the ser-
vices sector reported an increase in sales of 
2.4%, whereas groups from the industrial 
sector saw their earnings go down by 1.1%. 
Various groups were forced to contend 
with increased competitive pressure in their 
sales markets, which meant that price re-ductions, especially of commodity inputs 
for low- value- added products, were passed on to purchasers.
Operating results, measured in terms of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) as well as after 
depreciation (EBIT), were up signifi  cantly, at 
7.8% and 9.2%, respectively, on the year; 
provisioning by the Volkswagen group and 
write- downs by E.ON had weighed heavily 
on the previous year’s fi  gures. Distinct re-
ductions in personnel and distribution costs 
by some large groups played a role in the positive growth. At €112.1 billion, groups 
achieved the highest EBIT fi  gure since statis-tics were fi  rst collected in 2007.
The year 2016 saw signifi  cant extraordinary 
expenses as well. For instance, the motor 
vehicle industry set aside further provisions 
for legal risk (Volkswagen group) and 
posted substantial expenditure in connec-tion with defective airbags supplied by a now insolvent Japanese supplier. The en-
ergy supply sector, which is assigned to the industrial sector, once again posted a weak operating result. The aftermath of the deci-
sion to phase out nuclear energy and the energy U- turn, as well as ongoing provi-
sioning in conjunction with falling crude oil 
and gas prices, have been weighing dis-tinctly on the operating result. In 2016 
alone, expenditure on provisioning totalled 
more than €13 billion. On balance, the in-
dustrial sector increased its EBIT by 4.4%. By contrast, corporate groups in the ser-
vices sector posted a much higher operat-
ing result of 24.7%.
For the universe of groups, the strong rise 
in results, amidst a slight decline in sales, 
means that profi  tability was higher than the 
average of previous years. For all of 2016, 
the weighted return on sales across all sec-tors rose by 0.5 percentage point to 6.9%. 
Here, too, the positive result was driven mainly by groups in the services sector, which generated a return of 8.8%, the 
highest since 2007 and up by 1.6 percent-
age points on the year. Measured against previous years, the return generated by 
groups in the industrial sector was, at 6.4%, more on the average side.
German groups’ total assets were up by 6.5% compared with 2015. On the assets side, non- current assets contributed 3.8 percentage points to the increase, while current assets accounted for 2.7  percent-
age points.
On the liabilities side, debt and equity grew 
at around the same rate. It was specifi  cally short- term fi  nancial liabilities which, on ag-
gregate, grew increasingly signifi  cant rela-
tive to total assets. This refl  ects the use of 
favourable short- term funding terms. In particular, large groups with access to 
global fi  nancial markets took advantage of 
international bank loans and commercial paper as sources of funding. Short- term

liabilities  continued to be fully covered by 
current assets.
The equity ratio remained, on balance, 
largely unchanged in 2016 at 28.5%. This is 
due to a combination of counterbalancing 
effects. On the one hand, one- off effects in 
the case of E.ON depressed this fi  gure by 
around 0.8 percentage point. The increase 
in provisioning for pension obligations also 
had a negative effect on account of a fur-
ther decrease in end- of- period interest 
rates, with the 15-year discount rate stand-
ing at 1.7% at the end of 2016, as against 2.4% a year earlier.
2 This is the primary rea-
son why German groups’ pension obliga-tions are estimated to have gone up by more than €24 billion to around €178 bil-
lion.3
On the other hand, the overall positive 
earnings development among the reporting 
groups –  with isolated exceptions  – in-creased equity, since these groups were 
usually able to retain large amounts of their earnings and transfer them to their reserves. 
Capital increases and balance sheet effects 
relating to the hedging of future cash fl  ows, 
along with earnings from currency transla-
tion differences, likewise impacted posi-
tively on the reported level of equity.
The equity ratio of groups focused mainly in 
the industrial sector fell slightly by 0.3 per-
centage point to 26.9%, whereas that of 
groups in the services sector, owing in par-
ticular to retained profi  ts, increased by a signifi  cant 1.6 percentage points to 35%, the highest aggregate value since fi  gures

Trends for 2017
With regard to the persistently high growth 
levels of the German economy in the current 
year, non- financial corporations’ sales are likely 
to have risen significantly. Enterprises’ earnings 
may improve as the broad- based economic re -
covery now also encompasses positive stimuli 
from investment in machinery and equipment. 
By contrast, the costs of intermediate goods 
and raw materials in 2017 probably again ex -
ceeded the preceding year’s level, after having 
fallen – in relation to sales – to an all- time low 
in 2016. Given the excellent state of the labour 
market, enterprises’ personnel costs in 2017 
are also likely to have risen somewhat more 
strongly than in 2016.
Overall, the profitability of groups in the cur -
rent year can be regarded as good; this is also 
reflected by the solid growth in sales. In the 
first three quarters of the current year, the 
gross return on sales of German groups for which final data are already available increased 
to 8%.13 This significant rise is based, first, on a 
countermovement to the depressed level a year 
earlier, which had been induced by extraordin -
ary burdens.14 Second, the listed groups have 
not yet reported any exceptional burdens on 
the aggregate for 2017. On the contrary, the 
energy sector benefited from the Federal Con -
stitutional Court ruling that the Nuclear Fuel 
Tax Act (Kernbrennstoffsteuergesetz)  of Octo -
ber 2010 is incompatible with the German con -
stitution. Groups of corporations in this sector 
therefore received repayments amounting to 
€4.6 billion.
The good earnings position is one of the main 
reasons for the increase in the equity ratio of Signs of

2014, the equity ratio of groups in the ser-
vices sector was merely 31%.
On aggregate, the equity ratio of groups in 
the industrial sector is lower than that of 
groups in the services sector, owing primar-
ily to motor vehicle manufacturers’ funding 
business (customer fi  nancing and fi  nancial 
leasing), which impacts heavily on the fund-ing structure at group level. In 2016, more-
over, the adverse effects on energy sup-
pliers’ equity of, fi  rst and foremost, impair-
ments on assets made themselves felt. Ex-
cluding the large car manufacturers and 
one- off developments in the energy sector, the aggregated equity ratio of groups in the 
industrial sector would be comparable to 
that of groups in the services sector. Over-
all, German non- fi  nancial groups are in good shape, both in terms of their net assets and fi  nancial position as well as in 
terms of their earnings position.Capital ratios of German non-financial

listed groups. While individual components of 
items with no effect on profit or loss led to 
significant  changes in equity in the first nine 
months, on balance, these changes were 
largely offset by the end of the third quarter. 
The revaluation of groups’ pension obligations 
as a result of the end- of- period interest rate 
being increased at the end of the third quarter 
as well as the revaluation of hedges of future 
cash flows had a positive impact on equity in 
this context. By contrast, converting the bal -
ance sheets of subsidiaries from foreign cur -
rency to euro led to an exchange rate- induced 
loss. Besides the good earnings position, cap -
ital increases among individual groups of enter -
prises caused equity to increase further.
Concerning assets, it is likely that the long-  
observed trend of a declining tangible fixed 
assets ratio in favour of intangible assets con -
tinued in the current year. However, experience 
has shown that this decline cannot be used as 
a guide as to the general development of non- 
financial corporations’ holdings of tangible 
fixed assets, as groups’ financial figures are 
often shaped by outsourcing or acquisitions. 
On the other hand, the earnings situation of 
groups, which is expected to improve greatly in 
2017, suggests that non- financial corporations’ 
sales growth gained further momentum in the 
current year. The already very high level of ag -
gregate capacity utilisation, too, might have 
boosted enterprises’ willingness to expand 
their productive capacities.Growing

Mark- ups of firms in selected European 
countries
Growing mark- ups of firms are seen by many as evidence of increasing market power and a fall -
ing degree of competition. Indications of such a development in the United States have become 
more prevalent in the past few years, where recent studies find that both market concentration 
and mark- ups of firms are on the rise. This raises the question as to which firm mark- up trends are 
cropping up in EU countries. It should be noted that the EU integration process and the acceler -
ated pace of structural reforms are expected to have pushed up competitive pressure somewhat. 
The prolonged economic downturn in some European economies may also have had an impact 
on mark- ups.
Since firms’ mark- ups cannot be observed directly, they have to be estimated. To that end, a com -
monly used econometric method has been applied to data from 27 sectors dominated by private 
firms in seven European countries for the period from 1996 to 2014. The cross- section analysis of 
these data shows that mark- ups in manufacturing were on average lower than in services sec -
tors. Within manufacturing, higher mark- ups are demanded in segments where research and 
development activities are comparatively high. In cross- country comparisons, there are indica -
tions of above- average mark- ups in research- intensive branches of manufacturing in Germany 
and in various service sectors in Italy. The revenue that may result from these mark- ups appears 
to be shared to some extent with employees.
Over time, mark- ups in the European countries studied have been seen to behave in a largely 
procyclical manner. This appears to be connected to the sharp dip caused by the financial and 
sovereign debt crisis. There is no evidence of a long-  term increase in mark- ups, and in some 
cases, the estimations even indicate a decline in the structural component of the mark- ups. The 
divergent findings between Europe and the United States may suggest that different factors have 
been at play. It may be assumed that globalisation has raised competitive pressure in general and 
has therefore had a similar impact on mark- ups on both sides of the Atlantic, but this overall 
trend is likely to have been augmented in Europe by the European integration process. By way of 
contrast, the fact that a large number of newer, internet- based firms, which in some cases have 
pronounced market power owing to network effects, primarily have their origins and bases in the 
United States may have played a role there. The protracted economic crisis also had an adverse 
impact on the mark- ups of firms in Europe. The extent to which mark- ups will rise again as the 
economy recovers remains to be seen. This normalisation could temporarily fuel general inflation 
pressures in European countries.Deutsche Bundesbank

Background
Competition is considered to underpin eco -
nomic prosperity. It induces firms to align them -
selves with the wishes of customers and to 
strive to improve. Competition boosts product 
diversity and quality, and stimulates innovative -
ness. Competition for labour ensures that em -
ployees benefit from economic progress in the 
form of higher wages. Most importantly, how -
ever, competition limits firms’ market power, 
meaning that prices are geared to costs. From 
this perspective, rising mark- ups would be a 
sign of increasing market power and a falling 
degree of competition.
In the United States, there have been growing 
signs of such a development in the past few 
years. Recent studies indicate a reduced mo -
mentum in terms of firms being founded and 
wound up, an increase in market concentration 
and a rise in the mark- ups of firms.1 Among 
other things, these factors serve as an explan -
ation for the weak investment momentum ex -
perienced since the turn of the millennium and 
for the lower productivity growth.2
In the European Union (EU), access to what 
were previously national markets was to be 
simplified with the single market. Similarly, 
product market reforms, such as those sug -
gested in the European Commission’s country- 
specific recommendations, often aimed at in -
tensifying competition by taking down barriers 
to entry. This was also accompanied by the ex -
pectation that the scope of firms’ market 
power would be reduced. Furthermore, the 
question arises as to how the period of pro -
longed economic weakness has impacted on 
firms’ mark- ups in certain countries.
The mark- ups of firms in selected European 
countries are analysed below against this back -
drop. A comprehensive analysis is precluded by 
the limited availability of data in Europe com -
pared to the United States. Since the mark- ups 
of firms cannot be observed directly, they have 
to be estimated. The standard data on EU countries required for these estimations are 
only available in a very highly aggregate format 
and for a limited period of time. This analysis is 
therefore limited to seven economies3 and a 
period of just under 20 years (1996 to 2014); it 
covers the private sector broken down into 27 
sectors.
Determining factors of 
mark- ups
The intensity of price competition in a market is 
typically estimated based on mark- ups resulting 
from the difference between prices and mar -
ginal costs.4 Strong mark- ups, ie prices that are 
significantly higher than the marginal costs, 
serve as an indication of a limited degree of 
competition or a high level of market power. 
Firms exposed to high competitive pressures 
have a greater incentive to keep mark- ups low 
to prevent market share losses.
The context in which firms operate is a key fac -
tor in determining the intensity of competition. 
In particular, factors such as entry barriers, 
openness to foreign competition, anti- trust and Mark- ups as 
indicators of competitive intensity

Margin concepts and indicators of the profi  tability 
of non- fi  nancial corporations in the euro area
Price- cost margins shed light on the inten-
sity of price competition. However, it is not 
possible to directly infer fi  rms’ profi  tability 
from the size and development of these margins, as fi  xed costs are not taken into account. For instance, software develop-
ment can entail high costs. By contrast, the 
(marginal) costs associated with selling a licence  are usually very low. Prices must 
therefore be higher than marginal costs in 
order to cover total costs. This should be borne in mind when analysing the profi  t-
ability of the corporate sector.
The profi  t share, which in the national ac-
counts framework is the ratio of gross oper-
ating surplus to the gross value added of the non- fi  nancial corporations sector, is 
often used as an indicator of the profi  tabil-ity of non- fi  nancial corporations.
1 The gross 
operating surplus itself is defi  ned as gross 
value added less compensation of employ-
ees.2 It is often interpreted as the share of 
value added that remunerates the factor 
capital. However, this indicator falls short in 
some respects since the incomes of self- 
employed persons are assigned in their en-tirety to income from capital. What is more, the gross operating surplus can also contain 
economic rents, ie gains that go beyond 
what is needed for the remuneration of the factor capital.
In the national accounts framework, more-
over, entrepreneurial income is reported; 
this is conceptually equivalent to profi  t be-
fore distribution and income tax as calcu-
lated in business accounting.3 Essentially, it 
differs from the gross operating surplus 
through the addition of income on assets 
and the deduction of interest and lease ex-
penses.4 The ratio of gross entrepreneurial income to gross value added is referred to 
here as the entrepreneurial income ratio. 
Another measure of profi  tability is the gross return on capital, ie the ratio of gross oper-ating surplus to capital stock.
5
An examination of these indicators for the euro area reveals rather divergent develop-ments. The profi  t share rose markedly until 2007, then declined during the crisis before recovering somewhat later. These develop-
ments are also refl  ected in the entrepre-
neurial income ratio, which shows an up-
ward trend overall, however. This was at-
tributable to rising property income before 
the fi  nancial crisis and a decline in the 
interest burden since then. The gross return 
on capital initially increased quite signifi  -cantly, then fell again, and has recovered only marginally to date. Most recently, it 
1 This indicator is also referred to as the profi  t ratio. In 
the context of business cycle analysis, it is often con-
sidered in combination with movements in other real 
economic variables (such as investment) and prices. 
The profi  t share is counterbalanced by the wage ratio. 
See, for example, European Central Bank, Measuring 
and analysing profi  t developments in the euro area, 
Monthly Bulletin, January 2004, pp  63-73; and Na-
tional Bank of Belgium, Corporate profi  t margins: Re-
cent developments in a low infl  ation context, NBB Eco-nomic Review, September 2015, pp 41-54.2 In this context, “other subsidies received” are added and “other taxes on production” are subtracted. Both 
items are less substantial in quantitative terms, how-
ever.3 For more information on this, see the comments on 
p 209, Eurostat, European system of accounts – ESA 
2010, European Commission, 2014.
4 In short- term business cycle analysis, reference is 
often made to a macroeconomic margin indicator that 
is calculated as the difference between the rates of growth of the value added defl  ator (or alternatively, 
the GDP defl  ator) and unit labour costs. A positive dif-
ference denotes an increase in the profi  t share and, 
accordingly, a decrease in the wage ratio.5 The indicator used here is published by Eurostat and is calculated as the ratio of the gross operating surplus 
to the (net) assets and liabilities of non- fi  nancial cor-
porations.Deutsche Bundesbank

competition regulations and their implementa -
tion are important.
The size of mark- ups is also affected by a range 
of other factors, which do not necessarily indi -
cate inefficiencies and anti-  competitive behav -
iour. For example, mark- ups vary with de -
mand’s sensitivity to price changes (price elasti -
city of demand). Product diversity, which takes 
account of the different wishes of consumers 
and the need for variety, often goes hand in 
hand with reduced elasticity. While this does 
allow higher mark- ups in market segments, 
these mark- ups may be necessary to cover the 
higher costs of product diversity. Likewise, firms 
may temporarily achieve a competitive edge 
because of their innovations. In this case, 
higher mark- ups reflect, among other things, 
prior expenditure on research and develop -
ment (R&D).5 Due to returns to scale, there 
may also be a rise in market concentration, 
where care should be taken to ensure that 
gains in efficiency also reach consumers through lower prices. In general, it is important 
that markets do not become unassailable so 
that firms cannot continue to amass revenue 
without assigning it to a function.
According to a recent study on the United 
States, initial competitive restrictions are not 
the most significant factor in the long- term rise 
in market concentration.6 Rather, the most pro -
ductive firms appear to be increasingly able to 
acquire larger market shares because of tech -Other structural

5 Békés et al (2016), for example, present evidence that 
innovative firms may demand higher mark- ups and that 
product quality is positively correlated with the mark- ups of 
firms. See G Békés, C Hornok and B Muraközy (2016), Glo -
balization and the markups of European firms, IfW  Kiel 
Working Paper, No 2044.
6 It should be noted that an increase in market concentra -
tion does not necessarily imply a rise in mark- ups (see also 
the box on pp 62-63). In a recent study, the OECD never -
theless found evidence of a positive correlation of this kind 
based on sectoral data for the United States. See OECD

nical change and globalisation.7 This correl -
ation is also referred to as the “superstar firm” 
hypothesis. These firms include platforms that 
allow simple price and quality comparisons, 
from which more productive firms in particular 
would be able to benefit. The growing import -
ance of information- based goods, which are 
characterised by high fixed costs and low mar -
ginal costs, eg online services, may also explain 
this development. Furthermore, new technolo -
gies may amplify network effects and thus lead 
to dominant market positions. Nonetheless, 
there are also indications in the United States 
that regulatory and competitive aspects may 
have been a factor in the rise of market con -
centration.8
In addition to these structural factors, there are 
cyclical influences on the mark- ups of firms, 
though it is not clear a priori  whether procycli -
cal or countercyclical trends are predominant.9 
Empirical studies also do not give a clear pic -
ture in this regard.10 Mark- ups typically have a 
countercyclical pattern in New Keynesian 
macroeconomic models. Owing to adjustment 
costs, prices respond more slowly than procy -
clical marginal costs, which are determined by 
the costs of intermediate goods.11 By contrast, 
the fact that the price elasticity of demand 
could contract during an upswing, for instance, 
suggests procyclical mark- ups. This would 
allow firms to increase their mark- ups.12
Mark- up estimations for 
selected  European countries
Neither firms’ marginal costs nor mark- ups can 
be observed directly. Estimation methods there -
fore have to be applied, in which a distinction 
can be made between methods that are ap -
plied to either the demand side or the produc -
tion side. Both approaches complement each 
other in principle, but a production- side 
method is used here since the data require -
ments are less exacting.13The estimating approach was selected based 
on considerations regarding the Solow residual, 
which is calculated from the difference be -
tween the growth rate of (gross) output and 
the contributions to growth from labour, cap -
ital and intermediate goods. Under certain con -
ditions, this residual measures the rate of tech -
nical change when there is perfect competi -
tion. When competition is imperfect, the Solow 
residual can be shown as a combination of

difficulty. It is based, however, on a number of 
assumptions that should be taken into account 
when interpreting the results. For instance, 
there is an assumption of constant returns to 
scale, and an approximation of the user cost of 
capital is also necessary. Moreover, the original 
approach permits the estimation of time-  
invariant mark- ups only. For details of the esti -
mation method and the selection of data, see 
pages 65 to 67.
Cross- section analysis of 
sectoral  mark- ups
First, the mark- ups are calculated separately for 
each of the seven countries under review and 
each of the 27 sectors for the period from 
1996 to 2014. The results show clear indica -
tions that prices exceed marginal costs in most 
sectors. Exceptionally high mark- ups are re -
ported for real estate. This is also likely to be 
due to the fact that these calculations use a 
high degree of notional revenue (for instance, 
hypothetical rents for owner- occupied hous -
ing). As a result, this sector is excluded from 
further analysis.16
It can be seen that, on average, the dispersion 
of mark- ups within countries (ie between sec -
tors) is greater than that of the sector- specific mark- ups between countries,17 which suggests 
that there are sectoral particularities that span 
national borders. For instance, the mark- ups 
demanded in the manufacturing industry are 
typically lower than in other areas which are 
predominantly associated with services. The 
reason for this finding is often attributed to the 
international competition that firms operating 
in these sectors face due to the greater trada -
bility of goods.18 Moreover, if the sectors are 
sorted according to the level of spending on 
research and development, all countries (with 
the exception of Italy) demand higher mark-  
ups in those manufacturing sectors that are

ucts is also excluded from the analysis as estimates of pri -
cing in this sector are often only imprecise.

R&D intensive.19 In the other sectors, the pic -
ture is not entirely clear. According to the esti -
mation, among the countries under review, 
mark- ups were highest in Italy, closely followed 
by Germany. This was due, amongst other 
things, to the fact that mark- ups in the R&D-  
intensive manufacturing industry in Germany 
were slightly above average and those for other 
sectors in Italy, especially the services industry, 
were well above average.
Mark- ups over time
The question is whether market power has 
changed over the past few years. In order to 
answer this, the empirical model is extended 
and mark- ups are decomposed into a structural 
and a cyclical factor which varies over time de -
pending on the output gap.20 The structural 
component can change once, with a possible 
structural break occurring in any of the years 
from 1999 to 2011. Ultimately, the model with 
the least sum of squared errors is chosen.
To ensure that the number of observations is 
sufficient to enable the parameters to be iden -
tified, average mark- ups across countries and 
sectors are estimated in a panel. The previous 
results showed that mark- ups between sectors 
and countries vary to a lesser extent when 
broadly classified according to tradability and 
R&D intensity. It therefore appears appropriate 
to estimate these four items separately.
The application of the extended estimation ap -
proach initially confirms that, on average, lower 
mark- ups are demanded in the manufacturing 
industry than in the other sectors, and that, on 
average, R&D- intensive sectors have higher 
mark-  ups. Furthermore, in three of the four 
sector aggregates (manufacturing industry and 
R&D- intensive other areas), mark- ups demon -
strate procyclical behaviour.
With regard to the structural component of the 
mark- ups, indications of declining mark- ups 
can be found for three of the four broad sector definitions considered (less R&D- intensive 
manufacturing industry and other areas). Here, 
the break date identified varies across sectors. Modelling of

19 The classification of sectors according to R&D intensity 
is in line with the OECD’s definition. The OECD defines five 
levels of R&D intensity. The OECD does not assign the last 
category “low” to any of the manufacturing sectors. In this 
analysis, the manufacturing sectors that are assigned one 
of the first three categories are referred to as R&D inten -
sive. The OECD categorises most of the other non-  
manufacturing sectors as having a “low” R&D intensity. For 
this reason, in this analysis, the non- manufacturing sectors 
that are assigned one of the first four categories are re -
ferred to as R&D intensive. The OECD-  STAN data used for 
the analysis combine some sectors at a higher level of ag -
gregation. As a result, the classification for sector aggre -
gates 24 to 25 and 58 to 60 of the fourth revision of the 
International Standard Industry Classification (ISIC Rev 4) is 
not entirely clear. However, in this analysis, the former is 
considered to comprise manufacturing sectors with low 
R&D intensity whereas the latter encompasses non-  
manufacturing sectors with high R&D intensity (see also 
the table in the annex on page 66). See F Galindo- Rueda 
and F Verger (2016), OECD taxonomy of economic activ -

For the R&D- intensive other industries, a struc -
tural break is identified in 1999, which may be 
connected to deregulation efforts in the EU. In 
the case of less R&D- intensive other areas, the 
results suggest a connection with the eastward 
enlargement of the EU (break date in 2005). 
This may also be true for the less R&D- intensive 
manufacturing industry, although the structural 
break is identified in 2007 and may also be ac -
counted for by the global financial crisis. No 
clear trend could be identified for the R&D-  
intensive manufacturing industry.
Special features of the period 
under review
The time period underlying the analysis was 
characterised by exceptional developments due 
to the global financial and economic crisis as 
well as the subsequent European sovereign 
debt crisis, and these may have an impact on 
the estimation results. If the period from 2009 to 2014 is thus excluded from the sample, the 
parameter for measuring the cyclicality of 
mark- ups is estimated to be statistically signifi -
cant in one case only. This suggests that the 
economy primarily had a procyclical impact on 
mark- ups during the crisis years. With regard to 
the structural component of mark- ups, break 
tests continue to show declines for three of the 
four sector aggregates.21
During the period under review, there was also 
a sharp decline in yields on corporate bonds. 
This has an impact on the assumed user cost of 
capital. However, other return on capital indi -
cators imply only smaller declines or even a rise 
in the period under review.22 For this reason, 
the user cost of capital was calculated under

Market concentration in selected European countries
Estimations of price- cost margins provide 
no indication of a general increase in price- 
setting scope for European countries. This 
suggests that the intensity of competition in 
this group of countries has probably not re-
ceded markedly in the past years. To that extent, the question arises as to whether 
this outcome can be supported by other in-
dicators. Measures of concentration are often used as an alternative means of 
examining market structures.1 A small num-
ber of fi  rms accounting for a high propor-
tion of sales may point to dominant market 
positions. In the United States, such meas-
ures show a general increase in sales con-
centration, which is in line with the fi  nding of higher margins.
2
In the EU, unlike in the United States, the 
statistical offi   ces do not, as a rule, publish 
market concentration indicators. However, 
in 2008, as part of the work for EU KLEMS, measures of concentration for the years 1997 to 2006 were published on a one- 
off  basis.
3 In particular, the Herfi  ndahl- 
Hirschman index (HH index) – the sum of 
the squared market shares of the fi  rms be-
longing to a given sector – was reported. 
1 It is important to emphasise that indicators of mar-
ket concentration do not constitute a perfect measure 
of competition intensity, which depends on a wide 
range of factors such as market entry barriers, compe-
tition with imports, strategic interaction and econ-
omies of scale.

the alternative assumption that the real interest 
rate relevant for the firms’ activities amounted 
to 5% throughout the period. This modification 
has only a slight impact on the results, which 
continue to imply that mark- ups fell in three of 
the four sector aggregates. However, under 
this approach, there may have been a struc -
tural increase in mark- ups in the R&D- intensive 
manufacturing industry. In addition, the breaks 
are now estimated to have occurred on differ -
ent dates. In this specification, however, there 
are again a number of indications of procyclical 
mark- ups.
Role of bargaining power on 
the labour market
So far the estimations of mark- ups have not in -
cluded the particular features of wage forma -
tion. However, the behavioural patterns on 
product and labour markets can influence one 
another.23 If firms have market power, they may generate income. The degree of employ -
ees’ bargaining power determines how this in -
come is shared. The method applied here does 
not take into consideration such income to be 
shared with employees. As a result, it is pos -
sible that the price- cost margins are underesti -
mated. Recent studies therefore expand the 
original models of Hall and Roeger to allow for 
potential imperfect competition on the labour 
market.24
For the countries reviewed here, the estimated 
parameter of employees’ bargaining power, on 
Imperfect 
competition  on labour marketThe indicator assumes values between 
(close to) zero and one; larger fi  gures imply 
a higher market concentration.4
More recent information on the develop-
ment of concentrations stems from indica-
tors that were generated within CompNet.5 
In addition to the HH index, the share held by the ten largest fi  rms of the total sales of 
a sector is reported here. CompNet pro-vides better coverage of areas outside the 
manufacturing sector than EU KLEMS.6 For 
the most part, relevant data are available 
for the years 2000 to 2012.
The different indicators do not show a uni-
form trend. Although in isolated cases there 
are signs of an increase in market concen-
tration in the manufacturing sector, market 
concentration seems to be decreasing in 
other areas, such as trade, or showing little 
change. Combined, concentration indica-
tors do not point to a broad- based change in the competitive conditions in the coun-
tries observed.7
4 The HH index is published there for sectors accord-
ing to NACE Revision 1 (mostly using the 2-digit level, 
partly in more detail). On the whole, a distinction is 
made between up to 43 sectors, of which up to 30 are in manufacturing. Besides the traditional HH index, an adjusted index is also calculated within EU KLEMS with 
the aim of controlling for distortions where only few 
fi  rms report their information. See O’Mahony et al 
(2008), op cit.
5 CompNet is a research network in which indicators 
on the competitiveness of European countries are de-termined on the basis, amongst other things, of fi  rm- 
level data. The data used here are based on a 2014 
survey. See P Lopez- Garcia, F di Mauro and the Comp-
Net Task Force (2015), Assessing European competi-tiveness: the new CompNet microbased database, 
ECB Working Paper No 1764.6 Within CompNet, indicators are calculated according 
to the classifi  cation of industries according to NACE 
Revision 2 for up to 53 (2-digit) sectors.
7 However, it should be noted that the defi  nition of 
the relevant market plays an important role when cal-culating these indicators. In the case at hand, markets are defi  ned on the basis of relatively rough sector clas-sifi  cations and national borders. It cannot therefore be ruled out that the results would in some cases be dif-ferent given a more appropriate sectoral and regional classifi  cation.

average, is significantly positive and the esti -
mated mark- ups are also higher. This is particu -
larly reflected in the R&D- intensive manufactur -
ing industry and the less R&D- intensive other 
areas; sectors where trade unions are likely to 
be relatively strong. However, for the most part, 
the remaining results from the analysis con -
ducted thus far are qualitatively confirmed, in 
particular with regard to the grading of mark-  
ups between the industries. However, evidence 
of possible changes in the structural component 
is  weaker.25 The results indicate a decline in 
market power over time for the two non-  
manufacturing sector aggregates only. Employ -
ees’ bargaining power does not appear to have 
changed on the whole. It should be noted, 
however, that the assumption of an average par -
ameter for bargaining power inherent in the panel 
estimations is highly simplified given the hetero -
geneous labour market structures in Europe.26
Classification
The analysis presented here does not point to a 
long- term rise in mark- ups during the past 20 
years in the EU countries under review. Instead, 
the results reveal some signs of a decline in 
mark- ups. However, it should be noted that the 
scope of the underlying data and thus the basis 
for the analysis are limited.27 Nevertheless, the 
results are largely in line with other studies on 
European countries.28 Figures on market con -
centration do not suggest that there has been 
a broad- based increase either (see the box on 
pages 62 and 63). Indicators on the profitability 
of non- financial corporations do not show any 
evidence of sharp increases in returns on cap -
ital or profit ratios in the euro area (see the box 
on pages 55 and 56). These findings stand in 
contrast to those for the United States.29
A comprehensive assessment of the develop -
ments in the United States and Europe cur -
rently appears to be premature. Evidence on 
the development of price- cost margins is still 
rather limited and is not always clear. For in -
stance, a recent study for the United States for the period from 1992 to 2005 finds welfare 
gains in connection with advancing globalisa -
tion, which can be partly explained by lower 
mark- ups as a result of increased import com -
petition.30 However, should the evidence of in -
creasing mark- ups in the United States con -
tinue to be substantiated, the causes will need 
to be identified. For example, rising price- cost 
margins could be explained by both greater 
market power and an increasing importance of 
fixed costs.Mark- ups

an early stage25 The break dates calculated in the base model are used 
for this analysis.
26 See Deutsche Bundesbank, Wage dynamics amid high 
euro area unemployment, Monthly Report, December 
2016, pp 33-55. It is also possible that a structural break 
occurred at another point in time with this parameter.
27 For instance, the modelling of a one- off, immediate 
structural break in otherwise time- invariant mark- ups is re -
strictive.
28 Badinger (2007) finds evidence of declining mark- ups in 
the manufacturing industry but rising mark- ups in the ser -
vices industry for ten European countries in the period from 
1981 to 1999. Bassanetti et al (2010) confirm unchanged 
or decreasing mark- ups (ten European countries; period 
from 1982 to 2005). Christopoulou and Vermeulen (2012) 
estimate the Roeger model for eight EU countries in two 
periods (1981 to 1992 and 1993 to 2004) and find no in -
dications of systematic changes in mark- ups. Thum-  Thysen 
and Canton (2015) come to the conclusion that mark- ups 
in most of the services sectors that they examined declined 
over the period from 1996 to 2013 owing to regulations to 
promote competition. Montero and Urtasun (2014) find 
mark- ups in Spain remained virtually constant until the out -
break of the financial crisis and then tended to increase. 
Other country- specific studies using firm- level data suggest 
that pro- competitive effects in conjunction with globalisa -
tion have had a negative impact on mark- ups in the manu -
facturing industry. See H Badinger (2007), op cit; A Bas -

29 This is consistent with a forthcoming study by Gutiérrez 
(2017) which concludes that the share of economic gains 
in value added in the United States has risen since the 
1970s, while no significant increase was found for an ag -

Some of the factors which affect mark- ups are 
global phenomena. Greater import competition 
or increasing online trading should have a similar 
impact on mark- ups in the United States and in 
Europe, depending on the specific conditions.31 
However, there are also a number of region-  
specific factors. For instance, the European inte -
gration process is likely to have intensified com -
petition in the EU. One factor that may help ex -
plain US developments is that a large number of 
newer, internet- based firms, which in some cases 
have pronounced market power owing to net -
work effects, primarily have their origins and 
bases in the United States. Most of their Euro -
pean branches are located in countries that are not analysed here. In addition, the protracted 
economic crisis has had an adverse impact on 
the mark- ups of firms in Europe over the past 
few years. The extent to which mark- ups will rise 
again as the economy recovers remains to be 
seen. This normalisation could temporarily fuel 
general inflation pressures in European countries.Explanatory

Annex
Method to estimate price- cost 
margins
In a neoclassical growth decomposition model, the 
Solow residual is given by the difference between the 
growth rate of (gross) output and the contributions to 
growth from labour, capital and intermediate goods. 
Under a number of assumptions –  including profit 
maximisation and perfect competition – the Solow re -
sidual represents technical change.32 In the case of 
imperfect competition, Hall calculates the Solow re -
sidual as a weighted sum of changes to the output-  
capital ratio and to the rate of technical change, 
where the weights are functions of the mark- ups.33 
Regressing the Solow residual on the change in the 
(real) output- capital ratio therefore allows conclusions 
to be drawn about the mark- ups. However, in such 
estimations, technical change – which cannot be ob -
served directly – is included in the error term. If tech -
nical change has an impact on the output- capital 
ratio, this distorts the estimation results. Instrumental 
variables could be helpful in this regard; however, it is 
difficult to find suitable instruments.
Alternatively, the (dual) Solow residual can be deter -
mined under the assumption that firms endeavour 
to minimise their costs. According to Roeger, if both 
approaches are combined, the unobservable tech -
nical change drops out of the estimation equation.34 
Mark- ups can then be estimated on the basis of a 
simple regression of the (non- price- adjusted) Solow 
residual yt on the rate of change of the (nominal) output- capital ratio xt using the method of least 
squares:35
 yt=βxt+"t. (1)
In this representation, t indexes one year, εt is 
the error term and β stands for the Lerner index,36 Interpreting the Solow residual under imperfect competition
Roeger’s modifi-
cation of Hall’s approach31 It should be noted that there is no clear connection be -
tween online trading and the degree of competition. On 
the one hand, the internet has made it easier to compare 
prices, which should promote competition. On the other 
hand, online trading opens up greater opportunities for 
firms to offer customers differentiated and tailor- made 
products, which may restrict price competition. See Y Ba -
kos (2001), The emerging landscape for retail e- commerce, 
Journal of Economic Perspectives 15, pp 69-80.
32 In addition, it is assumed that technical change is Hicks-  
neutral and that returns to scale are constant. Hicks- neutral 
technical change means that technical change has a pro -
portional impact on the factors of production such that 
there is no change in their balance. Constant returns to 
scale means that a proportional change of one factor in the 
production resources changes output by this factor, too.
33 See R E  Hall (1988), The relation between price and 
marginal cost in U.S. industry, Journal of Political Economy 
96, pp 921-947.

35 In formal terms, this produces yt = (∆pt + ∆Qt) – 
αNt(∆w + ∆Nt) – αMt(∆mt + ∆Mt) – (1 – αNt – αMt)
(∆rt + ∆Kt) as well as xt = (∆pt + ∆Qt) – ( ∆rt + 
∆Kt), where ∆ is the difference operator and t indexes one 
year. Q, N and M give the natural logarithm of output as 
well as the factor inputs for labour and intermediate goods. 
p, w and m are the corresponding logarithmised prices; αNt 
and αMt are the shares of the relevant input factors in rev -
enue. (∆pt + ∆Qt) thus shows growth of the nominal out -
put value; (∆w + ∆Nt) and (∆mt + ∆Mt) show the 
growth rates of the costs for labour and intermediate 
goods. (∆rt + ∆Kt) shows the change in capital costs 
where Kt is the natural logarithm of real net capital stock 
and rt is the logarithmised user cost of capital.
36 The Lerner index is a measure of a firm’s market power. 
It is defined as (P – MC)/ P, where P is the price and MC 
the marginal costs of a firm, or as 1/|E|, where |E| shows 
the absolute price elasticity of demand. The index takes 
values between zero and one, with higher values indicating 
greater market power.Deutsche Bundesbank

As outlined in the main text, this approach initially 
allows the estimation of time- invariant mark- ups 
only. In addition, it is based on the assumption of 
constant returns to scale and the user cost of capital 
has to be approximated.37
Information on revenue, labour, intermediate costs 
and costs of capital is required to estimate the mark- 
ups. This analysis uses data from the OECD’s STAN 
database. 38 In order to ensure comparability of the 
data, only those countries are included which have 
the relevant data for 27 sectors dominated by pri -
vate firms for the period from 1995 to 2014 without 
any major statistical breaks. This group comprises 
the three major economies of France, Germany and 
Italy as well as Austria, Belgium, Denmark and Fin -
land.
Additions to this methodology enable dynamic as -
pects to be taken into consideration, too. To identify 
the cyclical impact, the Lerner index can be shown 
as the sum of a structural component β– and a cyc -
lical component γGAPt:
 βt=¯β+γGAP t, (3)
where GAPt is the macroeconomic output gap in 
year t.39 Estimations by the European Commission 
are used for the output gaps.
With a dummy variable ϕtT, which takes the value of 
one if t ≥ T and zero in all other cases, structural 
breaks can also be identified:40
 ycst=¯β1xcst+¯β2φT
txcst
+γ(xcstGAP ct+GAP ct)
+↵cs+γt+"cst, (4)
where ∆ is the difference operator. β–
1 shows the 
Lerner index prior to the structural break and β–
1 + 
β–
2 shows the index after the break.41 The model is 
estimated numerous times with the possible year in 
which the break occurs varying from 1999 to 2011. 
The model with the least sum of squared errors is 
chosen and a break test on the basis of a bootstrap -
ping method is carried out for this model.42 Further -
more, c stands for a country and s for a sector. The 
model is estimated in a panel in order to allow for a 
sufficient number of observations to identify the par -ameters. Country- sector dummies (αcs) as well as 
year dummies (γt) control for time- constant, unob -
servable country- sector- specific aspects and aggre -
gated shocks. The models are estimated using 
weights, thus ensuring that the impact of an obser -
vation is in proportion to the value added of the sec -
tor in 1996.
The method used here underestimates the scope for 
market power if revenue earned is shared with em -
ployees. Thus the estimation approach is expanded 
to include a parameter ( λ) for employees’ bargaining 
power. This is based on the change in the ratio of 
labour cost to cost of capital zt:43

37 With regard to the returns to scale, it should be noted 
that the estimation method results in an underestimation 
(overestimation) of the mark- ups for increasing (decreas -
ing) returns to scale. Moreover, measurement errors in the 
capital stock, for example, may distort the estimated mark- 
ups. See R Christopoulou and P Vermeulen (2012), Markups 
in the euro area and the US over the period 1981-2004: A 
comparison of 50 sectors, Empirical Economics 42, pp 53-
77.
38 One exception is user cost of capital (rt = ln(Rt)), 
which is approximated in accordance with conventional 
practice and in line with Hall and Jorgensen (1967) as: Rt 
= PI[i – π + δ], where i – π is a real interest rate, δ the 
rate of depreciation and PI the deflator for capital goods. 
A value of 10% is used for δ, the relevant deflator from the 
European Commission’s AMECO database is taken for PI 
and i – π is approximated using the real long- term interest 
rate according to the AMECO database, with any negative 
values being set to zero. See R E Hall and D W Jorgensen 
(1967), Tax policy and investment behavior, American Eco -
nomic Review 57, pp 391-414.

41 In principle, an estimation of time- varying firm- specific 
(or sector- specific) mark- ups would be preferable. Al -
though there are approaches for conducting such estima -
tions, these usually require firm- level data. See, for ex -
ample, J De Loecker and F Warzynski (2012), Markups and

tion in line with Roeger (1995), taking into account the 
aspect of bargaining power on the labour market. In for -
mal terms, this produces zt = (αnt -1)[( ∆wt + ∆Nt) –

The Eurosystem’s financial market 
infrastructure  – origin and future set- up
The Deutsche Bundesbank has the statutory mandate to arrange for the execution of domestic 
and cross- border payments and to contribute to the stability of payment and settlement systems.1 
Promoting the smooth operation of payment systems is also a fundamental task of the European 
System of Central Banks.2
The single European TARGET2 platform has been contributing towards fulfilling these obligations 
in the area of high- value payments for the last ten years. TARGET2 went live in November 2007 
as the Eurosystem’s first joint market infrastructure and quickly went on to become one of the 
biggest high- value payment systems in the world. The introduction of TARGET2-Securities (T2S) in 
June 2015 saw the single European settlement platform being expanded to include securities 
settlement.
The Eurosystem’s TARGET2 and T2S services provide the financial markets in Europe with a har -
monised infrastructure for the settlement of national and cross-  border payments and securities 
transactions in safe central bank money, thereby contributing to the integration of Europe’s 
money and capital markets and to the stability of the European financial system.
New developments and market requirements in the area of payments and securities settlement, 
efforts to further integrate European financial markets in line with the capital markets union 
(CMU) envisaged by the European Commission, as well as the increasing importance of fending 
off cyberattacks are the backdrop against which the Eurosystem is working towards further 
developing its market infrastructure.
This article provides an overview of the existing TARGET2 and T2S market infrastructure services 
and looks ahead to the ongoing projects which will expand upon the TARGET services offered by 
the Eurosystem.

Ten years of TARGET2 – a 
single shared platform for 
high- value payments
Around ten years ago – on 19 November 2007, 
to be precise  – the Eurosystem’s high- value 
payment system –  TARGET2  – went live and 
has since become synonymous in the European 
financial community and beyond with the quick 
and reliable settlement of urgent euro pay -
ments in central bank money. It ranks as one of 
the biggest high- value payment systems in the 
world, handling an average of 340,000 pay -
ments with a value of around €1.7 trillion every 
business day,3 a figure that equates to more 
than half of Germany’s annual gross domestic 
product. Germany’s TARGET2 component sys -
tem alone accounts for around half of the vol -
umes and more than one- third of the turnover 
(see the box on page 71).
TARGET2 operates on a single technical plat -
form and replaced the original linked system, 
TARGET, which was launched in 1999 with the 
introduction of the euro. This linked system 
consisted of the national RTGS systems4 of the 
participating central banks –  RTGSplus in the 
case of the Bundesbank – and the European 
Central Bank’s payment mechanism, which 
were technically interlinked via SWIFT.5
In the case of both the previous linked system 
and TARGET2, the acronym TARGET stands for 
Trans- European Automated Real- time Gross 
settlement Express Transfer and thus aptly de -
scribes the cornerstones of the joint payment 
system. Throughout Europe, highly automated 
urgent payments are processed in real time and 
with immediate finality on a gross basis – ie 
every payment is settled on an individual basis 
in central bank money. TARGET2, the second 
generation of TARGET, marked the first ever im -
plementation of a joint Eurosystem market in -
frastructure operating on a single technical 
platform – known as the Eurosystem’s single 
shared platform (SSP).In the early years of the single currency, TARGET 
successfully contributed to the implementation 
of the single monetary policy and the integra -
tion of European money markets. It was undis -
puted, however, that the linked system, with its 
very different national RTGS systems in some 
cases, would no longer be able to meet the 
needs of market participants in the long run 
and promote the vision of European integra -
tion. Against this backdrop, the Governing 
Council of the European Central Bank decided 
in December 2004 to develop a single technical 
platform for TARGET2. The ECB  Governing 
Council entrusted the Banca d’Italia, the 
Banque de France and the Deutsche Bundes -
bank (a team known as the 3CB) with the de -
velopment and future operation of the plat -
form. The Bundesbank was consequently able 
to incorporate key features of its former high- 
value payment system, RTGSplus, such as com -
prehensive liquidity management capabilities 
and liquidity- saving settlement in a gross settle -
ment system, as building blocks in TARGET2.
Technically, TARGET2 runs on a single platform, 
but in legal terms, it is structured as a multipli -
city of individual component systems. This 
means that each central bank is regarded as an 
independent system operator. The German 
component system is called “TARGET2-  
Bundesbank”. Customer support also remains 
in the hands of the national central banks 
(NCBs). The legal conditions of the individual 
systems have been harmonised to the greatest 
extent possible, however. Derogations are only 
possible in justified exceptional cases, such as 
in the event of national law constraints. This 
set- up reflects the principle of subsidiarity en -
shrined in the Treaty on European Union, be -
sides ensuring that customers are supported as 
far as possible by local experts.Ten years of

The enlargement of the European Union and 
the euro area has steadily increased the size of 
the TARGET2 family in recent years. At present, 
25 EU NCBs are using the SSP . In addition to the 
euro area NCBs and the European Central 
Bank, the NCBs of Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, 
Poland and Romania are also connected to the 
system. While participation is compulsory for 
euro area NCBs, those from the other EU coun -
tries are free to decide whether they wish to 
take part in TARGET2 and thereby provide their 
markets with access to the euro payment 
settlement system.
The Eurosystem uses TARGET2 to settle its 
monetary policy operations for the provision 
and absorption of liquidity. The SSP is therefore 
the central infrastructure for implementing 
monetary policy. Measured in terms of total 
volume, however, these transactions account 
for only a relatively small share. The bulk of the 
volumes and turnover in TARGET2 are gener -
ated, inter alia,  by banks which make extensive 
use of TARGET2 to settle their interbank pay -
ments, ie trade between banks in central bank 
balances, as well as the settlement of customer 
payments (see the chart on page 72).
Other settlement systems are also connected to 
TARGET2 via the ancillary system interface, 
such as retail payment, securities and foreign 
exchange settlement systems, including the 
SEPA- Clearer6 operated by the Bundesbank, via 
which customer payments (SEPA credit trans -
fers, SEPA direct debits and SEPA card clearing 
collections) of participating banks are settled. 
Six standardised settlement procedures, known 
as ancillary system interface (ASI) procedures, 
which are tailored to the specific needs of the 
individual ancillary systems, are used to settle 
the transactions from these ancillary systems 
via the accounts of the participants in TARGET2, 
and thus in central bank money.

TARGET2 is Europe’s biggest high- value 
payment system, ranking alongside the 
leading RTGS1 systems operated by the 
United States Federal Reserve Banks (Fed-
wire), the Bank of England (CHAPS) and 
the Bank of Japan (BOJ- NET).
Around half of the 340,000 payments 
processed on average every business day 
are generated by the German component 
system, TARGET2-Bundesbank, alone.
EBA CLEARING runs the pan- European 
high- value payment system EURO1, pro-
viding European banks with an infrastruc-
ture that complements TARGET2. EURO1 
differs from TARGET2 in that it is a (secure) 
net settlement system. This means that 
the balances that accumulate through the 
course of the day between the banks are 
only settled at the close of business in 
TARGET2, and thus in central bank money.

1 Given that the T2S DCAs (TARGET2-Securities dedicated cash 
accounts) form part of TARGET2 for legal purposes, bookings 
on the DCAs have been added to the TARGET2 statistics since T2S was launched on 22 June 2015. The cash leg of securities 
transactions, which to a large extent used to be netted and 
then settled via the ancillary system interface of TARGET2, is now therefore posted to the T2S DCAs on a transaction-by-transaction basis. 2 Not including bookings on T2S DCAs.

payment system for the settlement of high-  
value euro payments in central bank money 
with a fully harmonised range of services for all 
participants at uniform prices in all participat -
ing countries. By providing the option of con -
necting as either a direct or an indirect partici -
pant, the Eurosystem addresses, amongst other 
things, the challenges presented by the very 
heterogeneous European banking sector and 
the varied needs of the individual institutions.
In the case of direct participation, credit institu -
tions or, for example, authorised investment 
firms have one or several RTGS accounts of 
their own for the settlement of payments 
– known as PM accounts7 – as well as access to 
the information and control module (ICM), 
which operates in real time. Direct participants 
can use the ICM to view their liquidity position 
and the status of payments at any time and ac -
tively manage their liquidity using a variety of 
functions. Direct participation is open to super -
vised credit institutions in the European Eco -nomic Area (EEA), although this criterion is also 
deemed to have been met by EEA- domiciled 
branches whose parent groups are domiciled 
outside the EEA. This gives internationally ac -
tive banks domiciled outside the EEA the op -
tion of using their EEA- domiciled branch as a 
way of participating directly in the high- value 
euro payment system with settlement in central 
bank money. With the United Kingdom’s deci -
sion to leave the European Union and the asso -
ciated uncertainty regarding its continued 
membership in the EEA, this model has recently 
moved into the focus of interest of internation -
ally active large banks based in the UK.
Indirect participants settle their TARGET2 pay -
ments via a direct participant, ie they do not 
have their own account in TARGET2. They send 
and receive payments solely via the direct par -
ticipant acting on their behalf. Indirect partici -
pation is only available to credit institutions 
domiciled in the EEA.
Across Europe, around 1,600 financial institu -
tions are connected to TARGET2 as direct par -
ticipants and around 700 as indirect partici -
pants, with the German component system, 
TARGET2-Bundesbank, contributing roughly 
750 direct and around 170 indirect participants 
to these overall figures. The German market 
therefore accounts for almost 50% of all direct 
TARGET2 participants. This can be explained, 
above all, by a feature particular to the German 
market whereby, when compared with other 
component systems, a disproportionately large 
share of direct participants in TARGET2-  
Bundesbank use their RTGS accounts solely for 
the settlement of certain transactions, such as 
monetary policy operations, and not for pay -
ment transactions.
Direct participants can have their branches and 
correspondent banks – worldwide and without 
regional constraints – added to the TARGET2 
directory as what are known as addressable Possibility to

BIC8 holders. On top of the 1,600 direct and 
700 indirect participants, this adds more than 
49,000 additional payment recipients world -
wide who can be reached via TARGET2. Just 
like in the case of direct and indirect partici -
pants, most of the addressable BIC holders are 
domiciled in the EEA. Yet, even beyond the 
borders of the EEA, there are thousands of in -
stitutions around the globe that can be reached 
via TARGET2 (see the chart above). This plays a 
significant role in correspondent banking, in 
particular, which is fundamentally supported by 
TARGET2.
The SSP gave banks the opportunity to focus 
their technical access to TARGET2 on one coun -
try, thereby enabling them to consolidate their 
payment operations and reduce the liquidity 
buffers they held for payment purposes in the 
individual countries. The liquidity management 
functions introduced with TARGET2 also allow 
banks to comfortably manage their central 
bank liquidity throughout Europe.Market participants in Germany were already 
familiar with many of these functions from 
RTGSplus, which was one of the first ever RTGS 
systems to provide credit institutions with a 
notable array of options for managing their 
own liquidity. TARGET2 modelled itself on the 
RTGSplus system and adopted many of its func -
tions. This range of liquidity management cap -
abilities continues to make TARGET2 one of the 
world’s leading RTGS systems in operation 
today. These functions include, for example, 
the assignment of priorities, the possibility of 
liquidity pooling, and a limit- setting function.9

ment capabilities, TARGET2’s very design makes

liquidity- saving algorithms and takes mutual 
payments into account as coverage for settle -
ment purposes.
The successful design and development, 
smooth operation and ongoing needs-  driven 
further development of a market infrastructure 
such as TARGET2 would be impossible without 
systematically taking the needs of its users into 
account. Involving payment participants to a 
suitable degree in the discussion and decision- 
making process was therefore particularly im -
portant for the Eurosystem NCBs from the very 
outset. In Germany, cooperation between the 
Bundesbank and representatives of German 
banks takes place via the Payment and Settle -
ment Systems Working Group ( Arbeitskreis 
Zahlungs- und Verrechnungssysteme,  or 
AK ZVS). This working group provides a forum 
for debate and opinion forming with the aim of 
gaining early insights into the opinion of Ger -
man banks on the design of payment and 
settlement systems as a source of information 
for the (European) decision- making process. 
Members of the working group include the 
largest banks and ancillary systems participat -
ing in TARGET2-Bundesbank, the leading insti -
tutions of cooperative banks and savings banks, 
as well as the banking associations.
In recent years, TARGET2 has also become the 
focus of public attention, especially with regard 
to TARGET2 balances (see the box on pages 75 
and 76).
TARGET2-Securities: Europe’s 
hub for securities settlement
TARGET2-Securities (T2S) transfers the idea of 
TARGET2’s single technical platform to the area 
of securities settlement in central bank money. 
While TARGET2 contributed significantly to 
promoting the integration of Europe’s payment 
system infrastructure, the post- trade landscape 
remained highly fragmented and characterised 
by national monopoly structures for years after the euro was introduced. For market partici -
pants, this translated above all into complex 
structures, inefficiencies and high costs for the 
cross- border settlement of securities transac -
tions.
The Giovannini Group10 pinpointed the weak -
nesses in the post- trade landscape in reports 
published back in 2001 and 2003, identifying a 
total of 15 technical, legal and fiscal barriers 
that hindered efficient cross- border clearing 
and settlement. These barriers are still used 
today to assess the progress that has already 
been made towards greater harmonisation. 
T2S did a great deal to directly and indirectly 
dismantle six of the 15 barriers, primarily in 
technical areas.11
T2S is an integrated securities settlement ser -
vice that brings together the cash and secur -
ities legs of a DvP transaction12 on a single 
technical platform – the SSP , which the Euro -
system is already using for TARGET2 (see the 
box on page 78). Unlike TARGET2, T2S is cap -
able of processing multiple currencies, which 
means that non- euro area NCBs also have the 
option of making their national currencies 
available for settlement in T2S, thereby allow -
ing their market participants to take advantage 
of the benefits of T2S. In October 2018, Dan -
marks Nationalbank will be the first non- euro 
area NCB to connect its RTGS system to T2S, 
thus facilitating the settlement of securities in 
Danish krone via T2S from this date onwards.
Transactions in T2S are settled exclusively in 
central bank money. This feature, combined 
with real- time settlement and shorter settle -
ment chains, mitigates post- trade risks and 
thus boosts the stability of the financial mar -
kets in Europe. Settlement in central bank Integration

TARGET2 balances – mirroring developments 
in fi  nancial markets
Origin
TARGET2, the Eurosystem’s high- value pay-
ment system, may run on a single shared 
platform (SSP), but legally speaking, it is made up of multiple component systems operated by the national central banks 
(NCBs) and the ECB. Thus, both the Bundes-bank and the Banque de France will be in-
volved in a cross- border payment transac-tion
1 made in settlement of a German ex-
port to France, for instance. That transac-tion begins when the French importer’s 
commercial bank in France debits the pur-
chase amount from the importer’s account and submits a credit transfer in TARGET2 to 
the German exporter’s commercial bank in 
Germany. The Banque de France then debits 
the amount from the TARGET2 account it operates for the French commercial bank and posts a liability owed to the Bundes-
bank. For its part, the Bundesbank posts a 
claim on the Banque de France and credits 
the amount to the German commercial 
bank’s TARGET2 account. The transaction is 
concluded when the commercial bank credits the amount in question to the ac-
count it operates for the German exporter.2
At the end of the business day, all the intra-
day bilateral liabilities and claims are auto-
matically cleared as part of a multilateral netting procedure and transferred to the ECB via novation, leaving a single NCB 
liabil ity to, or claim on, the ECB.3 Viewed in 
isolation, the transaction used as an ex-
ample above leaves the Banque de France 
with a liability to the ECB and the Bundes-
bank with a claim on the ECB at the end of the business day. These claims on, or liabil-ities to, the ECB are generally referred to as TARGET2 balances.
1 Transactions are said to be cross- border transactions 
when the originators and benefi  ciaries are connected 
to TARGET2 via separate NCBs.
2 In transactions confi  ned to a national component 
system, the debit and credit entries on the TARGET2 
accounts of the commercial banks involved in the transaction would net each other out. National and 
cross- border transactions generate the same account-ing process in the commercial banks’ ledgers.

Central Bank of 5 December 2012 on a Trans- European 
Automated Real- time Gross settlement Express Trans-

Evolution
Historically, the evolution of TARGET2 bal-
ances can be broken down into four phases. 
In phase one, monthly TARGET2 balances 
were highly volatile at a low level, fre-quently fl  uctuating between positive and negative fi  gures. Germany’s current ac-
count surpluses were matched by a similar 
volume of capital exports by private actors 
(eg interbank loans), balancing out the Bundes bank’s TARGET2 transactions over-
all. The onset of the fi  nancial crisis in 2007 prompted a sharp rise in Germany’s TARGET2 balance. While banks domiciled in Germany 
continued to attract substantial safe haven 
fl  ows from abroad, the crisis of confi  dence 
reduced the volume of credit transfers to 
foreign institutions in crisis- hit countries to 
a trickle. The evolution of TARGET2 bal-
ances in phase two was a symptom of the crisis.
4 Conditions in fi  nancial markets eased 
in mid-2012, not least after ECB President Mario Draghi pledged to do “whatever it takes” to preserve the euro and the Euro-system announced its outright monetary 
transactions (OMT) programme. This initially 
sent TARGET2 balances broadly lower at the beginning of phase three, before they 
embarked, in phase four, upon a steady in-crease when the expanded asset purchase 
programme (APP) was launched. This fresh 
upturn in TARGET2 balances starting in 
2015 can largely be put down to the effects 
stemming from the technical settlement of 
the purchase programmes given that, for the most part, these programmes are cur-rently giving rise to cross- border transac-tions in TARGET2. Since the APP is to be 
extended beyond 2017, TARGET2 balances 
are likely to continue rising, all other things being equal.

money is also consistent with the CPMI13 Prin-
ciples for Financial Market Infrastructures14 and 
the European Union’s Central Securities De -
positories Regulation (CSD Regulation),15 both 
of which stipulate that central bank money 
should be used for settlement where practical 
and available. The Bundesbank therefore also 
supports the use of central bank money for the 
settlement of securities transactions. T2S gives 
market participants the tools they need to set -
tle their transactions in central bank money in a 
broad context, and these capabilities are now 
available for the simple and efficient settlement 
of cross- border transactions as well.
T2S provides the participating central securities 
depositories (CSDs) and their customer com -
munities with a settlement service, but is not, 
itself, a CSD. The safe custody of securities and 
the services this entails remain in the hands of 
the CSDs. Likewise, the contractual relationship 
with their customers remains unaffected by 
T2S. Although participation in T2S is voluntary, 
in 2012 virtually every euro area CSD plus four 
non- euro area ones signed the T2S Framework 
Agreement.
In July 2008, the Governing Council of the ECB 
gave the go- ahead to launch the T2S project 
and entrusted the developer and operator con -
sortium from TARGET2 – consisting of the Ger -
man, French and Italian NCBs, as well as the 
Banco de España (known as the 4CB) – with 
the development and subsequent operation of 
the platform. The T2S project thus marked a 
continuation of the Eurosystem NCBs’ success -
ful cooperation on TARGET2.
Involving market participants to an appropriate 
degree in the design and implementation of 
the T2S range of services was one of the main 
endeavours of the Eurosystem and the Bundes -
bank from the outset. The national user groups, 
which bring together T2S stakeholders from 
each country and offer a forum for the ex -
change of information, debate and opinion 
forming, play an essential role in this regard. 
The German T2S user group chaired by the Bundesbank was established back at the end of 
2006 as one of the first T2S user groups in Eur -
ope and has since become an integral part of 
the cooperation between the Bundesbank and 
the German financial market with regard to 
T2S.
T2S went live on 22 June 2015. The now 21 
participating CSDs migrated to T2S in a total of 
five waves between June 2015 and autumn 
2017.16 The German CSD – Clearstream Bank -
ing AG – which alone contributes just under 
40% to the overall T2S settlement volume, mi -
grated its settlement business to T2S as part of 
the fourth wave on 6 February of this year. The 
successful migration of this heavyweight CSD 
posed a major challenge for all the stakehold -
ers and was the result of years of preparatory 
work at both the European and national level. 
This achievement was due, not least, to the 
good cooperation with Clearstream and the 
early involvement of the customers in the ad -
justment, testing and migration process.
T2S handles an average of around 550,000 
transactions with an average total value of 
more than €800 billion every business day (see 
the chart on page 79).
One of the NCBs’ core responsibilities within 
the T2S set- up is to provide T2S dedicated cash 
accounts (DCAs) for their customers. These 
DCAs are used to settle the cash leg of secur -
ities transactions. Legally, they are part of the 
respective connected RTGS system, so in the 
case of euro- denominated DCAs, they belong 
to TARGET2. The DCAs opened by the Bundes -
bank are therefore subject to the legal pro-
visions and access requirements of the 
TARGET2-Bundesbank component system.T2S is not a

TARGET2-Securities (T2S) – an integrated platform 
for securities settlement in central bank money
T2S is a single technical platform which in-
tegrates the securities  accounts of central 
securities depositories (CSDs) and the cash 
accounts of national central banks (NCBs). 
The liquidity needed for settling securities 
comes from the RTGS systems which are 
run by the NCBs and connected to T2S – so from TARGET2 in the case of the euro. Once 
Denmark’s NCB joins the T2S system in 
October  2018, the Danish RTGS system will also be linked to T2S. Both T2S and TARGET2 
are run on the Eurosystem’s single shared 
platform (SSP).
Communication with T2S is via either an automated interface (application- to- application) or a graphical user interface (user- to- application), and the messages used are ISO 20022-compliant. CSDs or 
their customers with a direct technical link 
to T2S send their settlement instructions to T2S. There they undergo validation and, if 
need be, matching. They are then fed into 
the settlement process. In the case of night- time processing this is done in batches; dur-
ing the day it happens in real time on a transaction- by- transaction basis. The pro-
cess culminates in the posting of the secur-
ities and cash legs to the relevant T2S accounts . Bookings are fi  nal and irrevoc-
able.
To boost settlement effi   ciency, T2S also in-
corporates an auto- collateralisation func-
tion. Triggered when certain conditions are 
met, auto- collateralisation is a credit oper-
ation which enables transactions to be set-
tled in the absence of suffi   cient liquidity. 
This credit provided by the NCB in question 
is automatically secured using the security 
which is being settled or securities already 
held by the buyer.

If there is insufficient liquidity on a DCA to 
settle  a securities transaction, the auto-  
collateralisation function offered by T2S can be 
used under certain circumstances. This function 
generates the liquidity needed by triggering an 
automated credit operation at the relevant 
home central bank. While some individual 
markets   were already familiar with auto-  
collateralisation from their own national mar -
ket infrastructures, this function can now be 
offered across all the markets participating in 
T2S. Furthermore, it is also possible to use col -
lateral across national borders.
Customers of CSDs and NCBs can communi -
cate either directly or indirectly with T2S. If they 
communicate indirectly with T2S, there is no 
technical connection to T2S and their inter -
action is routed solely via the CSD’s or NCB’s 
interface. Eurosystem central bank customers 
that are indirectly connected on the cash leg 
do this using the TARGET2 value added services 
that have been developed specifically for 
T2S. These offer basic functions such as trans -
ferring liquidity between TARGET2 and T2S as 
well as viewing intraday DCA balances. T2S 
users that wish to actively manage their liquid -
ity, however, need to have a direct connection 
on the cash leg in order to take advantage of 
the full range of cash- leg functions offered by 
T2S. Noteworthy components of the full ser -vice package include liquidity monitoring and 
comprehensive reporting capabilities.
T2S was, and still is, a major challenge for the 
entire European post-  trade landscape. Pro -
cesses that had evolved over many decades 
and been tailored to suit the individual needs 
of each national market were broken up. The 
general thrust of T2S is to provide European 
market participants with a harmonised and 
standardised settlement service and to avoid 
replicating the specific features of national sys -
tems. T2S thus makes a valuable direct contri -
bution to forging integrated and harmonised 
European post- trade markets. Tangible benefits 
include the universal use of ISO 20022-compliant 
messages, a single settlement day for all par -
ticipants, and a harmonised set of rules on the 
finality of settlement instructions across 
T2S. Furthermore, T2S has become a significant 
catalyst for the further harmonisation of Eur -
ope’s post- trade markets. Stakeholders appre -
ciate that a harmonised environment allows 
them to leverage more of the benefits of the 
single, integrated settlement platform.
Besides this key contribution to harmonising 
Europe’s post- trade markets, and thus to dis -
mantling the Giovannini barriers mentioned 
earlier in this article, one of the most promising 
features of T2S is that it optimises pan-  Auto-

European liquidity and collateral management. 
T2S brings together the accounts of all partici -
pating CSDs and NCBs on a single technical 
platform, effectively eliminating the differences 
between domestic and cross-  border settle -
ment. On the cash leg, banks can settle secur -
ities transactions in any of the CSDs participat -
ing in T2S using just a single DCA on the T2S 
platform, so they can scale back the liquidity 
buffers they held in each individual market. As 
for collateral management, T2S gives partici -
pants a quick, efficient and cost- effective way 
of moving collateral across Europe to precisely 
where it is needed at any given time. The col -
lateral buffers that participants had to hold in 
individual markets on account of the complex -
ity of cross- border securities movements can 
therefore be dismantled. T2S, then, means that 
liquidity and collateral can be utilised far more 
efficiently and effectively.
To harness the new opportunities and potential 
offered by T2S, most market participants will 
need to rethink their existing structures and 
adapt to the new conditions – both technically 
and strategically. Similarly, the European re -
gimes governing the post- trade markets which 
entered into force in recent years – such as the 
CSD Regulation – have shaken up the under -
lying conditions, forcing participants to adjust. 
By successfully connecting to T2S, European 
market participants have impressively over -
come the technical and organisational chal -
lenges presented by the T2S project. There are 
probably many T2S stakeholders who, even 
after completing technical migration, still have 
not concluded their strategic reflections on 
how to reposition themselves in a changed 
market environment, and given how dynamic -
ally the post- trade landscape is evolving, those 
considerations look set to remain on the 
agenda. By rolling out T2S and the regulatory 
frameworks and pushing for greater harmon -
isation, the Eurosystem and the European 
Union have laid the foundations for a single, 
competitive, European post-  trade landscape. 
Market participants are now working towards 
(re)positioning themselves within the value added chain and capitalising on the particular 
opportunities and potential this presents for 
them. This may include expanding upon their 
existing service offerings or embracing new 
technologies and innovative business models.
Next steps in the evolution 
of the Eurosystem’s market 
infrastructure
The Eurosystem is working on the next steps 
for its market infrastructure amid new develop -
ments and market requirements in the areas of 
payments and securities settlement, efforts to 
further integrate Europe’s financial markets in 
line with the capital markets union17 envisaged 
by the European Commission, as well as the 
mounting importance of fending off cyber -
attacks.
The Eurosystem identified a total of three initia -
tives whose potential was analysed and fleshed 
out in greater detail during a formal investiga -
tion phase conducted in close cooperation 
with the market from September 2016:
– Settlement of instant payments in central 
bank money;
– Consolidation of existing TARGET2 and T2S 
services;
– Developing a European collateral manage -
ment system.
All three of these initiatives have since evolved 
into official projects aimed at developing and 
expanding the infrastructure offered by the 
Euro system. In June 2017, the ECB Governing 
Council approved the launch of the realisation 
phase of the TARGET instant payment settle -
ment (TIPS) project, which will see the Eurosys -

ments in central bank money as from Novem -
ber 2018. The projects to consolidate TARGET2 
and T2S as well as establish a Eurosystem col -
lateral management system (ECMS)18 were offi -
cially given the green light by the ECB Govern -
ing Council at its meeting on 6 December 2017.
The ECB Governing Council has again entrusted 
the development and subsequent operation of 
the three projects to the 4CB in a move which 
cements the status of the four largest NCBs in 
the Eurosystem as the Eurosystem’s provider of 
infrastructural services.
By bringing TIPS and the consolidation project 
to fruition, the Eurosystem will be expanding 
upon its current TARGET repertoire, consisting 
of TARGET2 and T2S, by adding a range of core 
services, which are described in greater detail 
below.
TARGET instant payment 
settlement (TIPS)
The implementation of the Single Euro Pay -
ments Area (SEPA) and the Payment Services 
Directive (PSD) has made cashless payments in 
Europe faster and more harmonised overall. 
Settling a euro- denominated credit transfer 
within the EEA now takes only one business 
day at most. However, given the advances in 
mobile communications technology, the in -
creasing use of mobile terminal devices, the 
mounting importance of internet retail, as well 
as the extensive real- time communication cap -
abilities offered by social media, many custom -
ers and enterprises expect to be able to ex -
change payments significantly faster and when -
ever it suits them, too. Internationally, these 
types of payments have become known as 
“fast payments”. The Committee on Payments 
and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), based at the 
Bank for International Settlements, defines fast 
payments as “payments in which the transmis -
sion of the payment message and the availabil -
ity of final funds to the payee occur in real time 
or near- real time and on as near to a 24-hour and 7-day (24/ 7) basis as possible”.19 In Europe, 
these “fast” criteria have led to these payments 
being known as “instant payments”, a term 
which even more accurately reflects the imme -
diate availability of final funds.
As long ago as December 2014, the Euro Retail 
Payments Board (ERPB)20 agreed to back the 
introduction of pan- European instant pay -
ments. The ERPB commissioned the European 
Payments Council – a body of credit institutions 
from the SEPA countries whose tasks include 
managing the procedural rules for processing 
SEPA payments – to develop a pan- European 
scheme for instant payments. The European 
Payments Council decided to draw up this set 
of rules on the basis of the SEPA credit transfer 
(SCT) and fittingly named it the SEPA instant 
credit transfer scheme (SCTInst). In November 
2016, following a market consultation, the 
document was published and entered into 
force one year later on 21  November 2017. 
Amongst other things, this scheme provides for 
the use of the message format based on 
ISO 20022 as well as IBANs and BICs. In add -
ition, it stipulates that the transferred funds 
should be available to the beneficiary no later 
than ten seconds after initiation by the origina -
tor’s payment service provider.
Following the ERPB decision, various clearing 
houses began to develop clearing solutions for 
instant payments. Many of these solutions, 
however, focus primarily on national markets.

20 The Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB) promotes the 
European single market for payments and contributes to 
further developing payment instruments and infrastructure. 
Chaired by a high- level representative of the ECB, the ERPB 
is composed of payment and credit institutions from the 
supply side, and consumers, retailers, businesses and public 
administrations from the demand side. Eurosystem NCBs 
take part in the meetings on a rotating basis. Being the 
largest NCB, the Bundesbank is present at most meetings

pan- European payments area created through 
SEPA, the ECB  Governing Council decided in 
September 2016 to also consider the prospect 
of the Eurosystem itself offering an instant pay -
ment settlement service with 24/ 7/ 365 avail -
ability, and initiated an investigation phase last -
ing just under nine months. During the investi -
gation phase, the user requirements for an in -
stant payment settlement service offered by 
the Eurosystem were devised in close cooper -
ation with market participants and then put to 
public consultation.
At the same time, the Eurosystem sounded out 
what the European user community expected 
from a Eurosystem settlement service, asking 
market participants to say exactly what poten -
tial they saw in instant payments as a financial  
instrument. Based on the responses, it is ex -
pected that just under a quarter of all payments 
will be submitted as instant payments by 2023. 
In addition, more than 80% of the participants 
are considering making full use (22%) or partial 
use (60%) of the instant payment settlement 
service offered by the Eurosystem.21 This feed -
back significantly exceeded the Eurosystem’s 
conservative volume estimates made at the be -
ginning of the investigation phase.
Based on the results of the market consult -
ations regarding a future instant payment 
settlement service offered by the Eurosystem, 
the ECB Governing Council approved the offi -
cial launch of the TARGET instant payment 
settlement (TIPS) project on 21 June 2017. TIPS 
is scheduled to start operating on 30 Novem -
ber 2018.
At the very outset of the project, the ECB Gov -
erning Council set the maximum price for set -
tling a payment at 0.20 eurocent (€0.0020) for 
the first two years following launch.22 This 
means that settling an instant payment via TIPS 
will cost about the same as a retail payment 
today. After the first two years of operation, 
the TIPS pricing policy will be reassessed in 
order to comply with the Eurosystem’s full cost 
recovery principle.The launch of TIPS will see the Eurosystem pro -
vide Europe’s financial markets with a harmon -
ised and standardised pan- European service for 
settling instant payments in central bank money 
24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a 
year. TIPS will enable payments to be settled 
irrevocably and with finality in central bank 
money within a matter of seconds around the 
clock on every day of the year – including at 
weekends and on bank holidays (see the box 
on page 83). TIPS is designed primarily for set -
tling instant payments denominated in euro, 
but like T2S, it is also capable of handling mul -
tiple currencies. This means that NCBs outside 
the euro area would also be able to make their 
national currencies available for settling instant 
payments in central bank money via TIPS.
As a means of settling instant payments in 
euro, TIPS is a stand- alone service of TARGET2. 
Therefore, participation in TIPS will essentially 
be subject to the same access requirements as 
for the TARGET2 component systems operated 
by each NCB. However, clearing houses and 
technical service providers will have the option 
to assume the function of an “instructing 
party” in TIPS, where they assume responsibility 
for a particular participant’s technical commu -
nication with TIPS without having a TIPS ac -
count of their own. This will allow clearing 
houses to route payments from their own 
group of users to other TIPS participants and 
thereby extend their own users’ reach.
TIPS participants will hold one or more 
TIPS DCAs in order to settle instant payments. 
These TIPS DCAs will be provided with liquidity 
transferred from TARGET2 to TIPS. Liquidity 
transfers to TIPS will be available during 
TARGET2’s usual operating hours. As TIPS pay -
ments are settled on a credit balance basis, the 
TIPS accounts will need to have ample liquidity, ECB Governing 
Council approves launch of TIPS projectTIPS is a stand- alone service of TARGET2

Settlement of an instant payment via TARGET instant 
payment  settlement (TIPS)
TIPS enables the fi  nal and irrevocable settle-
ment of payments in central bank money 
around the clock, 365 days a year – includ-
ing at weekends and on bank holidays  – 
with the money moving from the payer’s 
account to the payee’s account within the 
space of seconds. It thus supports the SEPA 
instant credit transfer scheme (SCTInst), the 
European Payments Council’s (EPC) rule-book for the settlement of instant pay-
ments.
Settlement of an instant payment via TIPS 
involves a number of different steps.
In step 1, a transaction conforming with the 
criteria laid down in the EPC’s rulebook is 
sent to TIPS by the TIPS participant (origin-
ator) or an instructing party1 appointed by it. Once TIPS receives this transaction, it is 
validated and the relevant funds are re-
served (step  2). TIPS then informs the counter party of the transaction (step  3). Once the counter party has confi  rmed the 
payment (step 4), the reservation becomes 
a posting to the TIPS accounts (step  5). After that, TIPS sends a confi  rmation to 
both participants or their instructing parties 
(steps 6 and 7). And with that, the funds 
have been transferred with fi  nality.
1 Whilst a TIPS participant can have a dedicated cash 
account, or TIPS DCA, of its own for settling instant 
payments via the service, an instructing party’s respon-
sibilities are confi  ned to technical communication with TIPS on behalf of a participant and it has no TIPS DCA of its own.

especially on weekends and TARGET2 closing 
days.23
As is the case with T2S, communication with 
TIPS will be based on messages compliant with 
ISO 20022. Regarding network connectivity, 
TIPS follows a neutral and network- agnostic 
approach. This will allow TIPS participants to 
choose their network providers based on their 
own needs, provided that the provider they 
choose meets the requirements set out by the 
Eurosystem.
TIPS will see the Eurosystem offering a service 
which complements the offerings of clearing 
houses. The Eurosystem will therefore be sup -
porting a total of three settlement channels 
(see the chart on page 85). The first enables 
payments to be settled as usual via TARGET2 in 
central bank money using RTGS services (see 
left column of the chart). Second, to help clear -
ing houses settle instant payments, the Euro -
system has been offering a dedicated ancillary 
system interface in TARGET2 – ASI 6 real- time – 
since November 2017. Using this interface, 
clearing houses can collateralise the settlement 
of instant payments by procuring cover in 
TARGET2 using central bank money (see middle 
column of the chart). Third, starting in Novem -
ber 2018, the TIPS service from the Eurosystem 
will complete the range of options (see right 
column of the chart). From that date, TIPS users 
will be able to route their payments to TIPS dir -
ectly or through an instructing party, ie via an -
other user, technical service provider or clear -
ing house.
The next generation of 
TARGET –  
TARGET2/ T2S consolidation
The Eurosystem’s single shared platform has 
been the technical platform for the operation 
of TARGET2 for a decade and also for T2S since 
June 2015. The TIPS project described above 
will add another service to the TARGET family 
as of November 2018.The consolidation project will migrate the Euro -
system’s TARGET family to a common platform 
–  the Eurosystem market infrastructure plat -
form (EMIP) – in a move which will transform 
the SSP into a unified, forward- looking and 
customer- oriented hub for TARGET’s high- value 
payments, T2S and TIPS services (see the box 
on pages 86 and 87).
– This project aims to make even greater use 
of shared infrastructure and security com -
ponents in an effort to exploit synergies and 
increasingly automate processes, thereby 
boosting efficiency levels overall. Its object -
ives include reducing the overall costs of 
running the shared infrastructure as well as 
increasing resistance to cyberattacks.
– The implementation of central liquidity man -
agement (CLM) will give bank treasurers a 
single point of reference for their central 
bank liquidity, which they can then allocate 
to the individual settlement services flexibly 
and conveniently.
– A  Eurosystem single market infrastructure 
gateway (ESMIG) will give customers a 
secure  and uniform means of accessing 
the Eurosystem’s range of financial market 
infrastructure services. Consistent use of 
ISO 20022-compliant messages across the 
Eurosystem’s entire range of services ensures 
that communication conforms to the latest 
standards.
One of the main objectives of the consolidation 
project, then, is to make the Eurosystem’s 
range of services, which is already highly val -
ued by market participants, even more user-  
friendly and fit for purpose.
Even before the start of the investigation phase, 
the core components and potential opportun -
ities of the future range of RTGS services were 
identified in close cooperation with the market. Communication

One major factor in this regard was the deci -
sion to extend the rollout of the ISO 20022 
standard into the RTGS sector. The systematic 
use of ISO  20022-compliant messages follows 
an international trend. Other major NCBs such 
as the US Federal Reserve System,24 the Bank of 
England,25 and the Bank of Japan26 are also 
working on introducing the ISO 20022 stand -
ard in their own high- value payment systems.
After the start of the investigation phase in 
September 2016, the user requirements for the 
future RTGS services were formulated in co -
operation with stakeholders and subsequently 
put to public consultation. German market par -
ticipants used this consultation to point out, 
amongst other things, that the complexity of 
introducing the ISO 20022 standard in high-  
value payments should not be underestimated. 
They stressed the importance of close cooper -
ation with the market when determining spe -
cific message formats and of granting a suffi -cient lead time for implementation and an ap -
propriate testing phase.
The realisation phase of the project began with 
the decision by the ECB Governing Council on 
6 December 2017. Launch is scheduled for No -
vember 2021. Some components of the con -
solidation project, such as common reference 
data management and access via ESMIG, are 
already needed to run TIPS, which is why they 
will be made available for these purposes as of 
November 2018.
In the further development of the Eurosystem’s 
market infrastructure, the consolidation pro -
ject, in particular, is of great significance to the 
Bundesbank. Within the 4CB, the Bundesbank German market

The modular set- up of future TARGET services
The consolidation project will see the tech-
nical consolidation of the individual service 
components in a way that will enable cus-
tomers to use them fl  exibly according to 
their needs. The modular set- up will be built 
around the central liquidity management 
(CLM) module, which will be a fl  exible 
source of liquidity for high- value payments 
and ancillary system settlement (RTGS ser-vices), securities settlement (T2S) and in-
stant payment settlement (TIPS). Each par-
ticipant’s central bank liquidity will be 
pooled in the main cash accounts located in the CLM. These main cash accounts will be 
used to settle monetary policy operations 
with the relevant NCB. Any credit line a par-
ticipant might have –  which as from the 
end of 2022 will be provided by the Euro-
system collateral management system 
(ECMS) – will also be linked to one of that 
participant’s main cash accounts. This means that monetary policy operations and high- value payments – which in the current TARGET2 set- up are settled together on the 
RTGS accounts – will, in future, be settled separately from one another. The CLM 
module will enable bank liquidity managers to manage, allocate and monitor their cen-tral bank liquidity across all services and ac-counts of a particular currency with fl  exibil-ity and ease.
Separate dedicated cash accounts (DCAs) will be set up for securities settlement in 
T2S, RTGS services and the settlement of in-stant payments via TIPS. At the end of each day, the balances on all of these DCAs can 
be combined with the main cash account balance for the purposes of calculating 
whether the participant fulfi  ls its minimum 
reserve requirements.

is responsible for developing the CLM and the 
future RTGS services. Taking charge of these 
two core components of the Eurosystem’s fu -
ture range of services will enable the Bundes -
bank to strengthen its role at the European 
level.
The further development of the Eurosystem’s 
market infrastructure is also bringing about 
changes in the structure of governance. The in -
tegration of the individual service offerings has 
significantly expanded the remit of what were 
until now dedicated national TARGET2 and T2S 
user groups, which are now generally involved 
in matters of payments, as well as securities 
settlement and collateral management. The 
AK ZVS working group, which once performed 
the role of Germany’s TARGET2 user group, 
now functions as the national stakeholder 
group in AMI- Pay, which has been newly estab -
lished at the European level.27 The T2S user 
group, meanwhile, has been incorporated into 
the national stakeholder group in AMI-  SeCo,28 which was formed through a merger of the 
previous T2S advisory group and COGESI.29 This 
reorientation of governance structures gives 
market participants an extensive and purpose -
ful voice on both current and future operations, 
besides facilitating the increasingly vital matter 
of interdisciplinary dialogue.
Summary and outlook
This year saw the Eurosystem celebrate the 
tenth anniversary of its TARGET2 high- value 
payment system, which laid the foundation for 
what has become a broadly based range of 
market infrastructure services offered by the 
Eurosystem. In the years ahead, the shared Bundesbank 
assumes respon-sibility for core components of consolidation project
Reorientation of 
governance structures takes account of increasing integration  of individual service  offeringsT2S and TIPS will largely be integrated into 
the new modular set- up in their current 
form. The T2S settlement process will con-
tinue to be supported by the auto- 
collateralisation function.
The high- value payments currently routed 
via TARGET2 and ancillary system settle-
ment will become integral elements of the 
future RTGS services. Payment settlement 
itself will remain much the same as it is in 
TARGET2, however. Like T2S and TIPS, the 
RTGS services will be capable of handling 
multiple currencies. As a result, every com-ponent of the platform will be able to han-
dle various currencies, creating an overall 
package which non- euro area NCBs can use fl  exibly for themselves and their customers. The contingency module, a familiar feature 
from TARGET2, will undergo further devel-
opment and reinforcement in an effort to enhance resilience against cyberattacks, in 
particular.Support functionalities such as common 
reference data management and joint data archiving will be available across all services. As is already the case, service- specifi  c mas-ter data will be accessible in each individual service.
The Eurosystem single market infrastructure 
gateway (ESMIG) will function as the main 
point of access to the individual services. It 
decouples the market infrastructure services from the network interface and is designed 
with multiple network service providers in 
mind. This means that communication will 
be network agnostic and not dependent on 
proprietary features of particular network 
providers. Communication with the individ-
ual services will be facilitated by an auto-
mated interface (application- to- application) 
and by each service module’s separate graphical user interface (user- to- 
application).

range of services offered by NCBs will be suc -
cessively expanded to include the settlement of 
instant payments in central bank money, a 
range of RTGS services that are even better 
suited to the market, as well as a common col -
lateral management system. At the same time, 
the infrastructure will be put on a common, 
forward- looking and customer- oriented foot -
ing underpinned by the very latest communica -tion and security standards. This will make it 
even more convenient, straightforward and 
efficient  for market participants to settle both 
their domestic and cross- border transactions in 
central bank money. The Eurosystem is thus 
playing an important role in taking the free 
movement of capital within the European 
Union to the next level and making the envis -
aged capital markets union a reality.Deutsche Bundesbank
