5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a wholeFollowing a sideways movement at the start
of the year, overall economic output roseagain significantly in the fourth quarter of2005. According to the figures of the FederalStatistical Office, real gross domestic product(GDP), after seasonal and work-day adjust-ment, increased by just under
1/C252% in the first
quarter. In particular, there was a sharp rise ininvestment in machinery and equipment, itslevel being 2
1/C254% up on the fourth quarter of
2005. However, construction investment fellconsiderably, mainly as a result of exception-ally unfavourable weather. Private consump-tion now formed a distinct counterweight tothis, after actually showing a decline betweenOctober and December. Overall, final domes-tic demand made a notable positive contribu-tion to growth, although it was largely offsetby negative changes in inventories. Foreigntrade and payments once again providedstrong stimuli to growth. As a result, season-ally and working-day adjusted real exports inthe first quarter were clearly up on the finalquarter of 2005. Although the growth in im-ports was almost as large, there was still apositive contribution to growth of
1/C253percent-
age point.
IndustryThe underlying trend in industrial output
remained expansionary in early spring. In sea-sonally and working-day adjusted terms, out-put in April increased by just under 1% onthe month. This offset the March downturnGDP in the first

6and matched the February level again. While
production of capital goods held up well, theconsumer goods sector, in particular, steppedup output.
In April, nominal exports of goods, at 4
1/C252%,
rose sharply on the month. At 21/C252%, imports
also showed considerable momentum. As
before, noticeable price movements played arole here. The trade surplus increased com-pared with March, when it had been com-paratively low.
The orders situation in industry is likely to
have remained quite good in recent months.Robust statistical data are still unavailable,however. The regional statistical office inNorth Rhine-Westphalia has not yet releaseddata for February and the following monthsowing to a strike-related processing backlog.For April, makeshift calculations by the Fed-eral Statistical Office (excluding North Rhine-Westphalia) show a year-on-year increase inthe value of orders placed amounting toslightly less than 5%. It should be noted,however, that April this year had three fewerworking days, ie almost 15% less, than Aprillast year. According to the Ifo business survey,orders in April and May were rated percep-tibly better than in previous months.
ConstructionFollowing a pronounced decline in March,
construction output expanded sharply in Aprilafter adjustment for seasonal and working-day variations. This was probably due mainlyto the situation returning to normal afterweather-related hold-ups in the first fewEconomic conditions in Germany*

7months of the year. April showed a 10% im-
provement on the weak first quarter; therewas a rise of about 1% on the last quarter of2005. The year-on-year increase went up to3
3/C254% in the month under review.
Demand for construction work, which is also
likely to have been adversely affected by theunfavourable weather during the wintermonths, picked up noticeably in April. Afteradjustment for seasonal and calendar effects,there was a 4
1/C252% increase on the figure for
March. This was also slightly better thanthe result for the final quarter of 2005. De-mand for housing construction, in particular,showed a sharp increase. A possible factorhere is that, following the winter period, anincreased number of building permits submit-ted before the end of 2005 (when the aboli-tion of the grant to homebuyers came intoeffect) were now being transformed into con-struction orders. The public sector, too, whichhad previously been restrained in terms ofnew projects, awarded more contracts againin April. Construction demand among indus-trial customers also improved somewhat onMarch.
Labour marketThe labour market has recently been showing
signs of a gradual improvement. According tothe initial estimate of the Federal StatisticalOffice, 38.75 million persons were in employ-ment in April in seasonally adjusted terms.This was 10,000 more than in March and vir-tually as many as in the previous year. For thefirst time in 14 months there was no year-on-year fall in the employment level. Followingthe long winter, many seasonal jobs were not
filled again until relatively late. The FederalEmployment Agency’s estimate of the num-ber of employees subject to social securitycontributions underwent a further slightdownward revision for the first few monthsof the year, although the decline was nolonger continuing at the end of the periodunder review. Government-assisted forms ofemployment saw little change on balance.There was a further slight decline in the scaleof assisted self-employment.
According to the figures of the Federal Em-
ployment Agency, there was a distinct de-crease in registered unemployment at theend of the period under review. After adjust-ment for seasonal variations, almost 4.6 mil-lion persons were officially registered as un-employed in May. This was 93,000 fewerthan in April and 350,000 fewer than in thesame month last year. The unemploymentrate fell from 11.3% in April to 11.0%. Thisclear drop in the rate of unemployment is duein part to the regular update of the numberof persons in the labour force, which now in-cludes persons receiving social assistance butable to work.
PricesPrices in the international energy markets re-
mained at a high level in May. At an averagecost of just over US$71, spot quotations for abarrel of Brent North Sea oil in May wereabout US$0.50 higher than in mid-April. Onlya slight change was perceptible during Junewith oil costing somewhat under US$70 perbarrel at the end of the reporting period.

8At the consumer level, seasonally adjusted
prices rose by 0.2% in May compared withApril. Seasonal food prices, in particular, wentup quite sharply, whereas energy prices re-mained at a high level. There was only a mod-est increase in the cost of services and hous-ing rents. The prices of industrial goodsshowed no change in seasonally adjustedterms. The annual rate of change in the CPIdeclined by 0.1 percentage point to 1.9%.The HICP inflation rate stood at 2.1%, com-pared with 2.3% in April. Excluding energyand unprocessed food, the figure was 1.0%.
Public finances
1
In the first quarter of 2006, the statutory
health insurance scheme posted a deficit ofjust over 31 billion, after recording a slight
surplus in the same period of 2005. Revenuefrom contributions barely exceeded the previ-ous year’s level.
2With contribution rates re-
maining almost unchanged, this reflected thestagnation in income subject to compulsoryinsurance. The weak employment trend, duenot least to the comparatively long, hard win-ter, played a role here.
Expenditure rose by 4
1/C252%, which was almost
twice the pace of one year previously. Spend-
ing on pharmaceuticals rose again by morethan 10%. In quantitative terms, the rise inspending on hospital treatment was the mostsignificant. It accounted for just over one-third of total expenditure and, at 5
1/C252%, like-
wise signified above-average growth. Therewas also a further notable rise of just over4% in expenditure on dental treatment.Compared with the low level of expenditurein the previous year following the changeoverto fixed subsidies for dentures, spending inthis area has risen considerably, but is stillmuch less than it was prior to the introduc-tion of the new rule on the financing of den-tures. There was a 4% rise in administrativeexpenditure.Quarterly

1In the short report on public finances which regularly
appears in the Monthly Report, the emphasis is on recent
outturns. The quarterly Monthly Reports (published in
February, May, August and November), by contrast, con-
tain a detailed description of general government budget
trends during the preceding quarter. For detailed statistic-
al data on budgetary developments and public debt, see
the statistical section of this report.
2In contrast to what happens in the statutory pension in-
surance scheme and the Federal Employment Agency,contribution receipts are recorded on an accruals basis in
the statutory health insurance scheme. Consequently, the
new rule stipulating the earlier transfer of social security
contributions by employers, which came into force at the
start of 2006, does not have a revenue-boosting effect
here.Consumer

9However, the unfavourable financial result for
the first quarter cannot be mechanically ex-trapolated for the entire year. One reason forthis is that the two tranches of the Federalgrant paid to cover non-insurance-relatedbenefits – the total amount of which hasbeen raised from 32.5 billion to 34.2 billion –
are paid in the second and fourth quarters.Furthermore, on 1 May the Act improvingcost-efficiency in pharmaceuticals supply(Gesetz zur Verbesserung der Wirtschaftlich-
keit in der Arzneimittelversorgung ) entered
into force and is intended to achieve savingsof almost 31 billion in this year alone. How-
ever, under the Act Accompanying the 2006Budget, the Federal grant will be cut back to31.5 billion next year, primarily in an attempt
to comply with the constitutional upper bor-rowing limit for central government. As therise in VAT will place additional pressure onthe statutory health insurance scheme, underthe existing funding system and in the ab-sence of any further cost-cutting measures,significant rises in the contribution rates seeminevitable next year.
The statutory long-term care insurance
scheme recorded a slight surplus in the firstquarter. However, this was due entirely to thefact that, as a result of the earlier transfer ofsocial security contributions by employers, theadditional contributions relating to earningspaid at the end of the month have not yetbeen recorded on an accruals basis in themonthly financial statistics for the long-termcare insurance scheme – as in the case of thestatutory health insurance scheme. Thus, inJanuary of this year, the contributions paid onDecember earnings as well as a large partof the contributions attributable to wages
earned in January were recorded as revenue.In the final annual result (financial statistics),the contributions will be allocated to theperiod in which they were generated. There-fore, in the annual statistics, a deficit ratherthan a slight surplus will be recorded for thefirst quarter. All in all, the underlying trends inthe financial development of the long-termcare insurance scheme remain unchanged.While growth in expenditure, at just over 2%,has actually accelerated, the development ofthe contribution base is likely to have beenweaker – as in the case of the statutory healthinsurance scheme. At the current contributionrate of 1.7%, further deficits and, therefore,the continued erosion of the reserves are inev-itable. Thus, the need for action is also evidentin this branch of the social security system.

10Securities markets
Bond marketIn April, the issue volume in the German
bond market, at 384.9 billion, was clearly
down on the month ( 3107.9 billion), thereby
reaching its lowest level since the beginningof the year. Redemptions and changes of asimilar amount in issuers’ holdings of theirown debt securities meant that there were nonet sales of domestic bonds and notes,whereas in March there had been net sales of326.5 billion. Net sales of foreign debt secur-
ities in the German market, which, at 38.3
billion, were also clearly down on the month(316.4 billion), were equivalent to the total
amount of funds raised (March: 342.9 bil-
lion).
The public sector increased its total indebted-
ness in the bond market by 31.5 billion in
April, compared with 311.0 billion in the pre-
vious month. Central government accountedfor30.9 billion of this amount. It primarily
issued two-year Federal Treasury notes(Sch/C228tze) for 36.1 billion net and five-year
Federal notes (Bobls) for 34.3 billion net.
Treasury discount paper (Bubills) and Treasuryfinancing paper were issued to a lesser extentas well ( 30.4 billion and 30.2 billion respect-
ively). By contrast, ten-year Federal bonds(Bunds) and Federal savings notes were re-deemed for 39.8 billion and 30.2 billion net
respectively. The state governments raised30.6 billion in the German bond market.
Credit institutions redeemed debt securitiesto the value of 34.1 billion net during theperiod under review, compared with net salesto the amount of 311.7 billion in March. At
35.9 billion, public Pfandbriefe saw the
largest net redemptions. The outstandingamounts of mortgage Pfandbriefe and debtsecurities from specialised credit institutionswere reduced by 32.0 billion and 30.2 billion
respectively. By contrast, other bank debtsecurities were issued for a net 34.0 billion.
Non-financial enterprises increased their debtin the German bond market by 32.5 billion in
April, compared with 33.9 billion in the previ-
ous month. On balance, they issued solelycorporate bonds with maturities of more thanone year. The amount of commercial paperoutstanding decreased by 30.4 billion.
Foreign investors were the sole net pur-chasers of domestic debt securities in April(36.2 billion), primarily investing in public sec-
tor securities ( 34.0 billion). By contrast, credit
institutions and domestic non-banks reducedtheir holdings of domestic bonds by 33.3 bil-
lion and 32.9 billion respectively. Credit insti-
tutions reduced their investment in publicand private debt securities by equal amounts,while non-banks sold primarily private sectorpaper ( 32.3 billion). Both non-banks and
credit institutions purchased foreign bondsand notes to the net value of 36.5 billion and
31.8 billion respectively.

11German equities were purchased exclusively
by domestic credit institutions ( 327.8 billion),
which sold foreign shares worth 31.2 billion
at the same time. Non-banks decreased theirholdings of both German and foreign equities(31.2 billion and 37.9 billion respectively).
Foreign investors reduced their investment inGerman shares – as they had done last yearbefore dividend payment dates – by 325.2
billion, thereby exclusively reducing theirportfolio investment.
Mutual fund sharesIn April, domestic mutual funds recorded net
inflows of 31.7 billion. While 33.3 billion ac-
crued to specialised funds open only to insti-tutional investors, mutual funds open to thepublic saw outflows, as in the previousmonth, amounting to 31.6 billion. Share-
based fund certificates, in particular, were re-turned ( 31.3 billion), as were certificates of
open-end real estate funds, money marketfunds and bond-based funds. Shares in for-eign mutual funds were sold in the Germanmarket for 30.6 billion net. The majority of
certificates were purchased by credit institu-tions, which increased their holdings of do-mestic mutual fund shares, in particular.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account ran a surplus – in
unadjusted terms – of 37.0 billion in April,
compared with one of 39.2 billion a month
earlier. There was a fall in the deficit on invis-ibles, which comprise services, income andcurrent transfers. However, this was accom-panied by a lower trade surplus on accountof seasonal and working-day effects.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the foreign trade sur-plus in April went down by 33.2 billion on the
month to 311.2 billion. However, after adjust-
ment for seasonal and working-day vari-ations, the surplus increased by 31
1/C252billion to
3121/C252billion. The value of exports of goods
increased by 41/C254%, whereas nominal imports
of goods increased by only 21/C252%. Between
January and April, exports were a seasonallyadjusted 6% up on the fourth quarter of2005 on average. At 8
3/C254%, imports rose even
more sharply.

actions fell by 30.7 billion on the month toSales and purchases

1232.6 billion. The reason for this was that the
deficit on services decreased by 31.0 billion to
31.1 billion. By contrast, net cross-border in-
come fell slightly by 30.1 billion to 30.8 bil-
lion. At the same time, the deficit on current
transfers went up by 30.1 billion to 32.4 bil-
lion.
In April, net capital exports arising from Ger-
man cross-border portfolio investmentamounted to 322.6 billion, following inflows
of funds ( 315.5 billion net) in the previous
month. The main reason for this was thatforeign investors – as they had done last yearbefore dividend payment dates – sold Ger-man shares on a large scale ( 325.2 billion). At
the same time, they cut back their investmentin domestic debt securities ( 36.2 billion, com-
pared with 325.8 billion in March), only ac-
quiring money market paper ( 37.0 billion).
German investors, on the other hand, addedforeign securities to their portfolios ( 34.3 bil-
lion net). Whereas they increased their hold-ings of debt securities – of bonds and notesas well as of money market paper ( 38.3 bil-
lion) – they sold foreign shares ( 34.6 billion).
In the area of direct investment, the outflowof funds continued in April ( 39.7 billion, com-
pared with 31.6 billion in March and 34.4 bil-
lion in February). Generally speaking, the netcapital exports can be attributed to the oper-ations of German enterprises ( 39.0 billion). It
was mainly domestic parent companies whoextended loans to their affiliates abroad. For-eign enterprises withdrew capital from Ger-many on a small scale ( 30.8 billion). Once
again, this was due mainly to credit flowsbetween affiliated enterprises.Major items of the balance of

and trade credits, as well as bank deposits andother assets, recorded net inflows of funds of320.6 billion in the month under review.
Enterprises and individuals, who, among otherthings, reduced their bank deposits abroad,recorded inflows of 32.0 billion. General
government, by contrast, transferred capitalabroad on a small scale ( 30.5 billion net). For
domestic credit institutions (excluding theBundesbank), financial resources from abroad

also recorded a decline in net claims ( 34.3 bil-
lion, excluding reserve assets), with trans-actions within the large-value payment sys-tem TARGET being a key factor in this.

15Investment and
financing in 2005Last year, the protracted process of bal-
ance sheet adjustment in the Germaneconomy came to an end, and theweak momentum of investment nowseems to have been overcome. At anyrate, the external financing of enter-prises increased again for the first timein several years, there was a somewhatsharper rise in investment in machineryand equipment, and the process ofrunning down inventories was halted.Although households and general gov-ernment cut back their fixed asset for-mation further, there was an overallincrease in real investment. However,domestic savings increased to an evengreater degree in 2005. A key factor inthis was the contribution from house-holds, whose accumulated financial re-sources added up to 5174 billion last
year and were higher than in 2004.General government, on the otherhand, recorded a “savings deficit” ofsome 582 billion in 2005, although this
was somewhat lower than in the previ-ous year. The following article providesa detailed description of the changedtrends in investment and its financingin 2005 on the basis of the latest fig-ures of the national accounts and ofthe flow-of-funds account. By contrast,the article on the profitability andfinancing of German enterprises,which is also printed in this Monthly
Report, is based on the Bundesbank’s
corporate balance sheet statistics.

16Overview of fixed asset formation and
saving
In 2005, investment expenditure increased
again following a prolonged sluggish trend.At just over 3% of disposable income, the ag-gregate net investment ratio, adjusted for de-preciation, was somewhat higher than thecorresponding figure in the previous threeyears. Nevertheless, this still falls well short ofthe level of investment seen in the 1990s, inparticular. Whereas at that time 3135 billion,
or almost 10% of disposable income, was in-vested on an annual average in the creationof new capital stock, since then only 375 bil-
lion, or 4%, has been invested on average inthe acquisition of non-financial assets.
In particular, producing enterprises
1increased
their net investment in 2005 by 37 billion to
330 billion. By contrast, households’ fixed
asset formation decreased again by 31/C252billion
to336 billion. The main reason for this was
the persistently weak level of construction ac-
tivity. On the other hand, there was a smallincrease in expenditure on investment in ma-chinery and equipment on the part of soleproprietors, who are classified under house-holds.
The aggregate net investment of the private
sectors (producing enterprises, financial inter-mediaries and households) was 365 billion in
2005, which is an increase of some 36 billion
compared with 2004. There was a noticeablydifferent scenario for general government,which cut back its gross capital formationagain in spite of relatively high new borrow-ing. At 329 billion in nominal terms, this wasthe lowest value since 1991. After deductingdepreciation of 335 billion, the fixed assets of
the government sector therefore contractedby36 billion.
The increase in savings by some 311 billion
was greater than the real investment growthof all domestic sectors. Savings amounted to3147 billion or just under 8% of disposable
income. Hence, the national saving ratio onceagain matched the average of the decadefrom 1991 to 2000. This increase in saving isattributable to the developments bothamong households and general government.Households expanded their savings by 35 bil-
lion to 3174 billion (including net capital
transfers received). General government cur-tailed its “savings deficit” by roughly thesame amount, although its dissaving still to-talled some 382 billion according to the def-
inition used in the national accounts for thewhole public sector, including net capitaltransfers made.
On the other hand, the enterprise sector,
which comprises both producing enterprisesas well as financial intermediaries, also con-tributed to overall saving. Thus, the produ-cing enterprises were able to increase theirsavings from retained profits year on year byaround 31 billion to 335 billion. In addition,
financial enterprises (mainly banks and insur-ance corporations) accumulated combinedprovisions of profits amounting to just over320 billion, thus equalling the 2004 figure.
1According to the classification scheme used in the Euro-
pean System of Integrated Economic Accounts (ESA 95),
this includes non-financial corporations as well as part-
nerships (so-called quasi-corporations). Sole proprietor-
ships, by contrast, are assigned to the household sector.Rise in real

18Owing to the somewhat sharper rise in do-
mestic saving compared with investment,Germany’s aggregate balance sheet last yearshowed net lending of just over 388 billion,
which was 36 billion higher than in 2004. In
relation to the disposable income of all sec-tors, too, the surplus rose again to 4.7%. Thismeans that, to this extent, the German econ-omy invested more financial resourcesabroad.

Trends in the overall financial flows
The national accounts data for saving and in-
vesting reproduced in this article show whichsectors had a net capital requirement and, bycontrast, which sectors were able to supplycapital. However, they generally do not allowany direct inferences to be drawn about theassociated financial flows. The underlyingoverall financial flows between the domesticsectors as well as with the rest of the worldexpanded last year by a greater margin thanmight be supposed at first when looking atthe net lending/net borrowing of the domes-tic sectors. For example, the financial invest-ment (ie the transaction-related increase in fi-nancial assets) of the domestic non-financialsectors rose in 2005 by about one-third to3164 billion, or almost 9% of disposable in-
come. On the other hand, the borrowing op-erations of these sectors, which had plum-meted in 2004, also increased again signifi-cantly, amounting to 385 billion, compared
with not quite 340 billion in 2004. It therefore
appears that the multi-year downward trendin financing activities, which had been evi-dent since the end of the stock market boom,came to an end last year. Even so, the finan-cial flows last year were still well below theirlong-standing average values.
The main reason for the turnaround were the
financial operations of producing enterprisesand the expansion of cross-border transac-tions, which had declined from 2001 to2004. The improved profitability of enter-prises apparently allowed them to actively ac-cumulate financial assets again in 2005, afterthey had acquired hardly any financial assetsin 2004. At just over 330 billion, their finan-
cial investment exceeded the prior-year figureby some 325 billion; however, it was still on a
low level in a longer-term comparison. Bycontrast, the financial asset acquisition ofhouseholds, which accounts for about 80%of the financial investment of all non-financialsectors, increased by merely 33 billion to
3135 billion. As in the preceding years, gen-
eral government curtailed its financial assetsfurther on balance. However, at 33
1/C252billion,
the reduction was smaller than in the previ-ous year.
The overall expansion of financial investment
by the non-financial sectors that was never-theless recorded mostly related to short-termassets, which accounted for almost 3115 bil-
lion last year; this corresponds to a year-on-year increase of 335 billion and was concen-
trated on bank deposits. The low interest ratelevel across the board was presumably one ofthe main reasons for this. By contrast, at 350
billion, longer-term financial investments

19were only slightly higher than in 2004. How-
ever, there were significant shifts within theindividual forms of investment. For example,there was a net reduction of longer-termbank deposits, especially in favour of invest-ments in mutual funds.
In keeping with this picture of a high liquidity
preference driven by low interest rates, the fi-nancing side of the non-financial sectors wasgeared heavily to the longer term. Thus,about 95% of financial resources procuredexternally had a maturity of more than oneyear. At 380 billion, the associated longer-
term financing volume remained largely un-changed in a year-on-year comparison. Thedemand for short-term financial resourceswas very low, amounting to 35 billion net.
However, in 2004, redemptions amounting to340 billion had been made in this segment.
On balance, the non-financial sectors furthercurtailed their bank debt in 2005, while bor-rowing operations in the securities marketslikewise decreased significantly. By contrast,there was a big increase in cross-border finan-cial loans and trade credits. At 330 billion,
these were drawn on more than they hadbeen in a long time.
By far the greatest part of the borrowing op-
erations of the non-financial sectors in 2005was attributable once again to the generalgovernment sector. The incurrence of liabil-ities by public authorities increased marginallyby3
1/C252billion vis-/C224-vis 2004 to 371 billion. Ad-
mittedly, producing enterprises also extendedtheir external financing somewhat, after theyhad curtailed their net debt in 2004. How-ever, at just over 315 billion, their borrowingoperations did not even amount to one-fifthof the new debt incurred by general govern-ment. Households reduced their net financialobligations to other sectors by 31
1/C252billion.

21almost 3250 billion. The bulk of this was
(gross) real investment with a value of 3215
billion in 2005, a year-on-year increase of 37
billion. This related in particular to investmentin machinery and equipment as well as higherinventories, whereas industrial constructioninvestment, at less than 370 billion, was once
again down on the year.
Enterprises increased their financial asset ac-
quisition again last year, which grew fasterthan their acquisition of non-financial assets.After barely enlarging their financial invest-ment in 2004, they invested just over 330 bil-
lion in financial assets in 2005. In addition toshort-term bank deposits, which accountedfor the greatest part of new financial invest-ment, they enlarged their bond portfoliosand increased their short-term financial loansto affiliated enterprises abroad as well as theirreceivables from trade credits in foreign busi-ness. By contrast, the sale of equity stakesheavily dented firms’ financial investment. In2005, they sold participating interests worth330 billion net, of which shares constituted
the largest part.
As in previous years, the financing needs of
the enterprises in 2005 was covered mostlyby their own financial resources. The internalfinancing ratio was almost 90%, the secondhighest value since 1991. In absolute terms,the self-generated financial resources in-creased only marginally to 3220 billion. How-
ever, this was still higher than real investment,which means that firms’ financial investmentcould be partially funded out of their ownfinancial resources.Thanks to their favourable financial situation,
firms had a very limited external financing re-quirement of only 316 billion. It is nonethe-
less noteworthy in comparison with the pre-ceding years that the multi-year phase ofdebt consolidation, which was reflected inter
alia in debt repayments, drew to a certain
close in 2005. The turnaround could be seenespecially in the case of loans from non-banks, which had still been redeemed to a€b n

ings amounted to 317 billion. Lending (in-
cluding trade credits) from abroad was evenhigher at 326 billion. In this context, almost
exclusively short-term funds were raised. Bycontrast, enterprises repaid bank loans onbalance for the fourth time in a row in 2005;although the volume of 311 billion was sig-
nificantly lower than the 344 billion of bank
debt repaid in 2004. On the other hand, thedemand for longer-term loans from foreigninstitutions showed a positive net result of310 billion. In total, firms reduced their out-
standing financial indebtedness, whether tobanks or other creditors, by 33 billion net. In
2004, net redemptions had totalled 380 bil-

than in the previous year, namely 33 billion,
from issuing their own securities. Firms mainlyresorted to bonded debt while simultaneouslyrunning down their level of money marketpaper outstanding. Countervailing develop-ments were also evident in the area of equityfinancing. Whereas enterprises recorded asurplus from public share offerings, not leastbecause of the higher stock market prices,they concurrently relinquished interests heldin private limited companies and other non-negotiable securities in the same amount innet terms, so that overall fund-raisingthrough equity issues balanced to zero.Development and structure ofcorporate debt
Following the consolidation of corporate debt
in the past few years, which resulted in size-able debt repayments in the enterprise sectoron balance, firms’ financial obligations roseagain marginally last year. However, at 31.9
trillion, the indebtedness of German produ-cing enterprises was still below the historicalpeak of 2002. In relation to gross valueadded, the level of borrowed funds in 2005was 150% – 12 percentage points less thanin 2002. In addition to the debt position, thedebt-equity ratio is often used in the inter-national context for evaluating the financialposition of the enterprise sector. As the na-tional account rules dictate that equity capitalis to be rated in the denominator at market-based prices, this variable proves to be muchmore volatile than the ratio of debt to valueadded. The ratio of 150% in 2002 thusdropped to 110% by the end of 2005, inter
aliaowing to the sharp rise in share prices on
the stock market. Measured by this coeffi-cient, the financial situation of German enter-prises in the first half of the 1990s was farless favourable than it has been of late. Atthat time, the comparable figure had aver-aged more than 150%.
In the past few years, a certain shift in em-
phasis has occurred within the debt structureof enterprises away from traditional bankloans. Although in 2005 bank loans were stillthe most important source of external finan-cing, accounting for about two-thirds of allborrowed funds, other forms of financinghave gained in importance. These include the

23incurrence of liabilities abroad as well as
security-based financing. Moreover, theaforementioned substitution of short-termfunds by long-term borrowing caused theproportion of short-term debt to decreasefurther in 2005. The proportion of short-termdebt dropped to 36% – that is 5
1/C252percent-
age points less than in 2000.
In addition to various debt indicators, the cost
of debt financing for enterprises has also im-proved in the last few years. Thus, in 2005,the gross interest burden dropped to 15% ofthe operating surplus – compared with 25%in 2000. The ratio of net interest paid to theoperating result decreased over the sameperiod from 15% to 9%. Both the radicalconsolidation measures taken by the enter-prises and the favourable interest rate envir-onment have contributed to this develop-ment.
Households’ borrowing, saving and
investment behaviour
In the aggregate, households funded their fi-
nancial and non-financial investments lastyear completely out of their own financial re-sources. As in 2004, they also repaid financialcredits on a small scale on balance. This wasmainly due to the declining demand forshort-term loans from sole proprietors – whoare included under households according toESA 95. On the other hand, longer-termfunds amounting to 33 billion net were raised
independently of their use.Debt of non-financial corporations

24The internally available financial resources,
which are composed of net capital transfersreceived as well as savings, expanded in 2005by just over 34 billion to 3174 billion. This in-
crease was attributable exclusively to highersavings. In 2005, they totalled just under3160 billion, an increase of 335 billion com-
pared with 2000. In the same period, the sav-ing ratio increased from 9.2% to 10.7% ofhouseholds’ disposable income. However, itshould be noted that in spite of this increase,the saving ratio in 2005 was still well belowthe average value during the first half of the1990s. In a longer-term comparison, the dif-ference is even greater. For example, the aver-age savings of households in the 1980s wasaround 13
1/C252% of disposable income, and a
decade earlier it was as much as 141/C252%. The
commonly expressed belief that Germanhouseholds are currently saving an exception-ally high amount therefore does not hold truein a long-term comparison.
Only about one-fifth of the available financial
resources was invested in real asset forma-tion, which mainly consisted in spending onhousing construction. After deducting depre-ciation, households’ net capital formationamounted to 336 billion, which was some-
what less than in 2004. In the 1990s, whendemand for private housing construction wasstill quite strong, the average annual realasset formation of households had beenalmost twice as high.
Last year, households increased their financial
assets by 3135 billion, which was 33 billion
more than in 2004. In this context, the prefer-ence for investment in securities, which hadalready been evident for many years, con-tinued. In 2005, the net inflow into securitiesincreased by 36 billion to 330 billion. How-
ever, this concealed very different develop-ments for the individual categories of secur-ities. For example, mutual fund shares, whichhad experienced a net reduction of 37 billion
in 2004, enjoyed a greater demand in 2005,attracting new net investment of 320 billion.
Judging by the sales transactions of Germanmutual funds open to the general public,there was a greater demand for share-basedfunds as well as for bond-based funds. Bycontrast, direct investment in the bond mar-ket, which had been exceptionally strong in2004, returned to normal with a score of 311
billion. This also applies to the acquisition ofshares and other equity, which had contract-ed sharply following the stock market boom.as a percentage of disposable income

26On balance last year, households only moder-
ately changed their pattern of investment inshares. In this context, profit-taking may haveplayed a role.
The “winners” of 2005 also included life in-
surance and pension insurance companies,which recorded inflows of nearly 330 billion
following 323 billion in the previous year.
Among other things, this significant increasewas due to buoyant business in government-subsidised supplementary pension plans aswell as the very high sales of traditional insur-ance products before the expiry of the associ-ated tax breaks at the end of 2004, which didnot show up in the trend in financial asset ac-quisition until a year later. In total, householdsinvested just over 350 billion in insurance cor-
porations and pension funds in 2005, whichwas two-fifths of their overall financial invest-ment. The increase in bank deposits in 2005was some 35 billion less than in the previous
year. At 344 billion, new investment in this
segment was also significantly lower than theaverage of previous years. On the other hand,households strongly increased their sight de-posits by 350 billion on account of the afore-
mentioned high liquidity preference.
Households’ financial assets and
indebtedness
The aggregate financial position of house-
holds, measured by their net financial assets,improved significantly in 2005. This was dueboth to higher financial investment and tothe stabilisation of their liabilities. At the endof 2005, the financial liabilities of householdsamounted to 31.57 trillion, which was only
360 billion, or 4%, more than at the end of
2000. In relation to their disposable income,households’ indebtedness declined duringthe same period from 113% to just over105%. In this context, there were significantshifts in the maturity pattern. Short-termloans, which traditionally are of fairly minorimportance, were greatly reduced, whereaslonger-term liabilities were increased. Thiswas due not least to the historically low inter-est rate level and the expectation that interestrates are more likely to rise in the longer run.All in all, the changes described above in thelevel and maturity pattern of household debthelped to substantially lower the amount ofinterest paid. In 2005, the interest burdenamounted to only 4% of disposable income.At the beginning of the 1990s, when the ab-solute level of household debt had been onlyhalf as high as in 2005 but the financingcosts had been significantly higher, the cor-responding ratio had been almost 6%.
As mentioned, the financial assets held by
households increased considerably in 2005,namely by over 3180 billion to 34.26 trillion.
However, about one-quarter of this increasewas due to corresponding valuation gains intheir portfolios. The sharp rise in financialassets pushed the financial asset-income ratioup to almost 290%. The ratio of net financialassets to disposable income grew even fasterowing to households’ very moderate borrow-ing. At the end of 2005, it was about 180%,which is 30 percentage points above the fig-ure three years earlier. Net financial assets perhousehold totalled just under 370,000. In-

at an estimated 34.8 trillion, households’
total net assets averaged 3190,000. Thus,
their net worth has increased in nominalterms by 360,000 or 3% per year since Ger-
man reunification. However, it should benoted that these mean values mask a widespread of financial assets and debts amongindividual households.
In spite of the sharp increase in share prices
and the significant juggling of investment ve-hicles, which is reflected in the transactionsof different items, there have been no greatshifts in the underlying structure of financialassets. However, investments in shares haveregained some ground compared with theirlow of 5% of all financial assets in 2002,reaching a share of 7% in 2005. The increasewas dented by the fact that many equitieswere sold on balance in the past few years.Bonds and mutual fund shares each con-tinued to make up about one-tenth of house-holds’ financial assets. If all securities itemsare added together, this form of investmentreached a total proportion of one-third andtherefore ranked second, only a little behindbank deposits. In addition, the proportionof claims on insurance companies and pen-sion funds was very stable at just over one-quarter.
A longer-term retrospective comparison,
however, shows quite significant structuralshifts in the portfolio of households. For ex-ample, households have considerably in-creased the share of their portfolio invest-ment since 1991. This is especially evident1991

29from the acquisition of mutual fund shares.
This segment’s share of all financial assetshad been only 4% at the beginning of the1990s. The increase of investments in mutualfunds was mainly at the expense of bank de-posits. Their share went down from 46% in1991 to 35% in the year under review. In thiscontext, longer-term bank products have losta lot more importance than short-term bankproducts. In particular, classical deposit ac-count saving has become less important. In
their saving and investment behaviour, Ger-man households in the aggregate have be-come more capital market-oriented and moreyield-sensitive, even though they continue toinvest primarily in banks and insurance cor-porations. This is all the more true if onebears in mind that bank and insurance prod-ucts have likewise been adapted to thestronger yield awareness of investors.

35Concentration risk
in credit portfoliosConcentration risk in credit portfolios
comes into being through an unevendistribution of bank loans to individualborrowers (single-name concentration)or in industry and services sectors andgeographical regions (sectoral concen-tration). It may be prudent for special-ised banks and credit institutions oper-ating at a regional level to acceptcredit concentrations so as to benefitfrom information advantages, for ex-ample, familiarity with local condi-tions. However, in the past 25 years,numerous banking crises have arisenfrom an increased concentration ofrisk. The effective management andlimitation of this risk by the banksthemselves is therefore of fundamen-tal importance. Besides simple model-free procedures, relatively advancedmodelling approaches can be used formeasuring and managing single-nameconcentration. By contrast, no general-ly accepted standardised methods forrisk-sensitive treatment of sectoral con-centration and the performance ofsuitable stress tests have yet emerged.Concentration risk and the internalmethods used to manage it will,amongst other things, be covered bythe Supervisory Review Process (Pillar 2)in future. Furthermore, the currentlarge exposure limitation provisions ofthe German Banking Act (Kreditwesen-
gesetz) also apply under Basel II.

36Definition of concentration risk
The term “concentration risk” in the context
of banking generally denotes the risk arisingfrom an uneven distribution of counterpartiesin credit or any other business relationships orfrom a concentration in business sectors orgeographical regions which is capable of gen-erating losses large enough to jeopardise aninstitution’s solvency.
Concentration risk can be considered from ei-
ther a macro (systemic) or a micro (idiosyn-cratic) perspective. From the point of view offinancial stability (macro perspective), thefocus is on risks for groups of banks which,for example, emerge from a joint concentra-tion in certain business lines or a joint regionalconcentration in lending. Economic disrup-tions which affect the group of joint borrow-ers or the region can therefore jeopardise thesolvency of an entire group of banks and thusput financial stability at risk.
1By contrast, the
primary focus in internal risk managementand from a supervisory point of view is onconcentration risk at the level of individual in-stitutions (micro perspective). This risk is notlimited to credit portfolios and may stemfrom various sources (see the chart onpage 37).
In lending business, not only a concentration
of borrowers but also a concentration ofcounterparties in trading activities or of cer-tain collateral instruments or collateral pro-viders may occur. Market risks – for example,large exposures in a particular currency – mayalso lead to concentration risk.Concentration in liabilities, such as a concen-tration of certain refinancing instruments orof investors or depositors, may also play animportant role. These concentrations belongmore to a bank’s general liquidity risk, how-ever. Furthermore, concentration risk is alsoinherent in the area of operational risk, forexample, through dependence on a particularIT system.
This article focuses on concentration risk at
the individual institution level (micro perspec-tive), specifically on concentration in creditportfolios, as this is generally considered tobe the most significant source of risk to thesolvency of banks.

Traditionally, a distinction is made between aconcentration of loans to individual borrow-ers – also termed single-name concentrationor granularity – and an uneven distributionacross sectors of industry or geographical re-gions (sectoral concentration). A further riskcategory consists of risks arising from a con-centration of exposures to enterprises con-nected with one another through bilateralbusiness relations. The resultant danger ofcontagion effects in the event of default onthe part of one of these borrowers has, how-
1However, concentration risk on the part of individual in-
stitutions can also be important from a macro perspective
if these institutions are relevant from a systemic risk point
of view.

This classification of concentration risk incredit portfolios into three categories essen-tially matches that contained in the Basel IIFramework.
4Moreover, the Framework de-
fines concentration in respect of individualcollateral providers or certain kinds of collat-eral as a further risk category. They constitutean indirect concentration risk as they have animpact only in the event of default.
This article sets forth reasons for the emer-
gence of concentration risk. It also providesan overview of model-free and model-basedapproaches to measuring such risk as well asempirical results for the German banking sec-tor. It concludes by showing how credit con-centrations are taken into account in banks’internal risk management as well as how theyare treated by banking supervisors.
Emergence of concentration risk
The emergence of concentration risk is closely
linked to the business strategy orientation ofbanks. In the 1970s, the acquisition of marketshares through an expansion of business vol-ume increasingly came to the fore. Banks pro-ceeded to grant long-term and sometimesunsecured loans of considerable nominalamounts without taking due account of theDeutsche BundesbankOverview of concentration risk

38credit risk. In many cases, a concentration in
individual economic sectors or certain groupsof borrowers also emerged. This resulted inlarge loan losses, leading to numerous bankinsolvencies and, in some countries, to bank-ing crises. During the US savings and loan cri-sis of the 1980s, for example, more than1,000 institutions operating at a regionallevel became insolvent owing to a high sec-toral concentration. In the mid-1990s, Scan-dinavia saw numerous bank failures followinga housing crisis. It was possible to avert bank-ing crises in other countries, including in Ger-many; however, in these countries, too, thebanks had to build up large loss provisions intheir lending business, not least as a conse-quence of concentration risk.
Over the past few years, banks have been
making greater efforts to identify and limitconcentration risk or to demand appropriaterisk premiums.
5In this context, their business
policy has developed from a purely volumemaximisation stance into an earnings andvalue-oriented business strategy.
However, credit concentrations can certainly
also be pre-planned and part of a bank’s busi-ness philosophy. Mortgage banks as well asbuilding and loan associations are examplesof specialised banks which deliberately incurcredit concentrations so as to benefit specific-ally from information advantages gainedfrom focusing on selected products and cer-tain categories of borrowers. The specialisedexpertise of these banks may even mean thattheir portfolios are of a particularly high qual-ity and thus have low default rates despitethe existence of considerable credit concen-trations.
The regional principle of savings banks and
cooperative banks is a further example of thefact that a business model can foster creditconcentrations, especially (regional) sectoralconcentration. Concentration risk may have aparticularly severe effect in regions with amonotonic economic structure. However, thenarrow regional focus is offset by informationadvantages owing to greater familiarity withthe clients’ local environment.
Relationship banking – which has traditionally
played an important role in Germany – canlikewise foster the emergence of concentra-tion risk. Under the “house bank principle”,banks are prepared to assume special respon-sibility for enterprises to which they lend,even in crisis situations. In some cases, thismay lead to banks granting loans which, asindividual transactions, would appear to beeconomically unprofitable or ought to be re-fused in view of the risk involved becausethey, for instance, increase single-name con-centration or sectoral concentration.
The aforementioned examples are not unique
in showing that the avoidance of concentra-tion risk is not a general objective. Somepapers in finance literature reach the conclu-sion that – under certain model assumptions –diversification may even be attractive only forbanks with a moderate level of risk. For in-stance, diversification through lending in add-itional industry sectors or geographical re-

39gions in which a bank has only very little busi-
ness experience can diminish the effective-ness of a bank’s risk management and, thus,increase the total risk.

A number of empirical studies also suggestthat sectoral concentration can be advanta-geous for banks provided that suitable riskmanagement procedures are used. It hasbeen shown – for Italian banks, for instance –that institutions with a high level of risk canimprove their risk/return profile by focusingon certain sectors.
7A study based on the
credit portfolios of German banks concludesthat higher concentration on certain sectorsand regions – as a rule – is associated withgreater profitability, even in risk-adjustedterms.
8
The above-mentioned historical examples aswell as more recent cases such as the insolv-encies of Enron, Worldcom and Parmalat,however, also show the dangers emanatingfrom concentration risk. The incurrence ofconcentration risk, therefore, requires this riskto be measured as precisely as possible, man-aged effectively and restricted in size.
Single-name concentration
The term “single-name concentration risk”
denotes the firm-specific (idiosyncratic) risk ina credit portfolio which arises from the creditrisk of large borrowers. Firm-specific riskcomprises the risks resulting from the poten-tial default of a single borrower or a legallyconnected group of borrowers. The term“single-name concentration risk” is used ifthe exposures to large individual borrowersaccount for the bulk of all loans in a portfolio.
By contrast, systematic risk – the second risk
component of a credit portfolio – comprisesall of the risks affecting several legally inde-pendent borrowers or the entire portfolio, forexample, the state of the economy orindustry-sector-dependent risks. Single factorrisk models such as the Asymptotic SingleRisk Factor (ASRF) model
9– which also serves
as the foundation for the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approaches for the calculation ofPillar 1 capital requirements under Basel II –are suitable for modelling this risk. The ASRFmodel assumes the existence of an infinitelygranular portfolio, ie a large portfolio inwhich each individual loan constitutes an in-significantly small share of the total portfolioexposure.
As the ASRF model does not take into ac-
count the firm-specific risk arising from a con-centration of single-name exposures, theportfolio’s overall risk can be underestimated.One solution is to extend this model bymeans of a granularity adjustment. The fol-lowing section first of all describes heuristicmethods of measuring concentration risk be-

Methods of measuring single-name
concentration/granularity
It is advisable to examine single-name con-
centration risk at the borrower level, includ-ing all relevant exposures. If a measurement isperformed on the basis of the individual ex-posures in a portfolio, however, the actualconcentration risk could be underestimated.This is because this risk does not lie in the po-tential loss of a single exposure but in the lossof all the credit exposures to the same bor-rower.
The approaches for measuring single-name
concentration can be broken down intomodel-free (heuristic) and model-basedmethods.
Ratios provide a simple approximation for
measuring exposure or borrower concentra-tions; for instance, the sum of the exposuresto the 20 (30, 50 etc) largest single borrowerscan be expressed in relation to a capital fig-ure. However, this capital covers not onlycredit risk, but also other banking risks, suchas those from trading activities. A comparisonof banks on the basis of this ratio may conse-quently be distorted.
The Gini coefficient provides a further
method of measuring single-name concentra-tion. This ratio can be interpreted as a con-centration index, ie a measure of the devi-ation of a distribution of exposure amountsfrom an even distribution. A coefficient closeto zero signifies a homogeneous portfolio inwhich all of the exposure amounts are distrib-uted equally; a coefficient close to one pointsto a highly concentrated portfolio. A funda-mental disadvantage of using the Gini coeffi-cient to measure concentration, however, isthe fact that the size of the portfolio is nottaken into consideration. For example, a port-folio with a few equal-sized loans has a lowercoefficient than a better-diversified, largercredit portfolio containing loans of differentamounts. Moreover, the Gini coefficient mayrise if a relatively small loan to another bor-rower is added to the portfolio despite thefact that this diminishes the concentration.For these reasons, the Gini coefficient is onlyof limited suitability for measuring single-name concentration risk.
The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is an-
other simple model-free approach for quanti-fying undiversified idiosyncratic risk. The HHIis defined as the sum of the squares of therelative portfolio shares of all borrowers.Well-diversified portfolios with a very largenumber of very small firms have an HHI valueclose to zero whereas heavily concentratedportfolios can have a considerably higher HHIvalue. In the extreme case of a single borrow-er, the HHI takes the value of one.
Neither the HHI nor the other aforemen-
tioned model-free methods of measuring ex-posure concentration can show the effects ofdifferent credit qualities, which are reflected,for example, in varying probabilities of defaultor in the collateral provided. One advantageof the model-based measurement of single-

41name concentration risk is the fact that they
are taken into consideration, for instance,via a granularity adjustment. Furthermore,model-based methods allow the single-nameconcentration risk to be expressed directly aseconomic capital, which is defined as the dif-ference between the Value-at-Risk
10at a
given confidence level and the expected loss.
The granularity adjustment for the ASRF
model constitutes an approximation formulafor calculating the appropriate economic cap-ital needed to cover the risk arising from thepotential default of large borrowers. The the-oretical derivation of this method is explainedbriefly in the box on page 41. The advantagesof the granularity adjustment as a formula-based solution are that it avoids relativelytime-consuming Monte Carlo simulations andsimplifies sensitivity analyses.
A specific proposal to incorporate single-
name concentration risk into the minimumcapital requirements under Pillar 1 of Basel IIwas proposed in the second ConsultativeDocument but later abandoned,
11not least
because of the extensive data requirementsand the high implementation burden. Both ofthese objections could be reduced consider-ably if only loans of or above a certain min-imum amount were taken into account in cal-culating the granularity adjustment. However,this approach would result in a higher capitalGranularity adjustment in the Basel II
IRB model
The granularity adjustment (GA) is an ex-
tension of the ASRF model which forms thetheoretical basis of the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approaches. Through this ad-justment, originally omitted single-nameconcentration is integrated into the ASRFmodel. The granularity adjustment can becalculated as the difference between unex-pected loss in the real portfolio and in aninfinitely granular portfolio with the samerisk characteristics.
In the following, /C11

modelled as a random variable. Since noanalytical formula for the unexpected lossof the actual portfolio exists in general, anasymptotic approximation of the granular-ity adjustment such as that presented byWilde
1is used.
An approximation formula for the granu-
larity adjustment is derived by applying asecond-order Taylor expansion to the quan-tile of the portfolio loss L. It can be shown
that the first derivative in this Taylor expan-sion is equal to zero since the expectedfirm-specific risk – conditional on the sys-tematic factor – disappears. Furthermore,the second derivative in the Taylor expan-sion can be written as

Empirical studies on single-name
concentration
A study conducted by Standard & Poor’s12in
2004 compared the concentration of the
credit portfolios of the 100 largest rated westEuropean banks. The degree of concentrationwas calculated as a percentage using theaverage of the 20 biggest loans to non-banksand the capital ratio of the relevant bank. Themedian concentration for this group of bankswas about 6.6%. The results for each countryare shown in the chart on page 42.
In a cross-country comparison, the participat-
ing German banks had an above-averageconcentration of exposures. However, the in-formative value of the study is limited by thefact that it focused only on the exposureamounts but failed to take into account theindividual probabilities of default and the ex-pected recovery rates.
In a recent Bundesbank in-house analysis of
58 real bank portfolios based on data onloans of 31.5 million or more
13from 2002,
both the HHI and the granularity adjustmentwere used to examine single-name concen-tration. The increase in the Value-at-Riskowing to the granularity adjustment – ie foridiosyncratic risk – which thereby came tolight ranged from 3% to 8% for portfolioswith at least 1,000 exposures. This resultsomewhat tempers the significance of single-name concentration as a risk category forportfolios of this size.
Furthermore, it was possible to establish an
approximately linear relationship between thegranularity adjustment and the HHI for theseportfolios (see the chart on page 43). At firstglance, this indicates that the HHI is suitableas a measure of single-name concentration,in particular in view of its relatively simple cal-culation method.

43ent borrower-specific probabilities of default
play a greater role than in the case of largeportfolios with low HHI values. Thus, for suchsmall portfolios, the granularity adjustmentleads to a wider dispersion around the linearregression line than in the case of more diver-sified portfolios with low HHI values, in whichthe effects of the different probabilities of de-fault tend to be evened out. This findingshows that, at least for relatively small port-folios for which idiosyncratic risk plays agreater role, a granularity adjustment holdsout more promise for providing informationthan the HHI.
Sectoral credit concentrations
Sectoral concentration in credit portfolios can
be broken down into concentration in certainsectors of industry and concentration in indi-vidual countries or regions. While commercialcredit risk models widely used in the financialsector usually measure both kinds of sectoralconcentration using a similar methodology,there are many differences from a theoreticalpoint of view. Credit concentration in indus-try sectors is a typical risk driver of corporateloans, while public and private borrowers canalso play a key role in the case of country risk.Moreover, country risk is a generic term fordifferent, partly interdependent risk categor-ies, eg political risk and transfer risk. By con-trast, concentration risk from exposures to in-dustry sectors arises from credit dependenciesbetween enterprises, resulting from a com-mon sector affiliation and the prevailing eco-nomic environment in that sector.In the ASRF model – on which the IRB risk-weight functions are based – all loans are as-sumed to be dependent on the same system-atic risk factor. This model feature ensuresthat the economic capital can be determinedseparately for every individual loan withouttaking the portfolio structure into account.Owing to the presupposed uniform correl-ation structure, the credit risk of a portfoliowith an uneven sectoral distribution may beeither overestimated or underestimated. Therisk contribution of sectoral concentration toa portfolio’s overall risk can therefore beestablished only if the model framework isenlarged.

44Methods of risk measurement for sectoral
concentration
An essential precondition for measuring sec-
toral concentration risk is a suitable sectoralclassification. The definition of the sectorsshould ideally enable direct allocation to indi-vidual risk factors. To put it simply, a sectoralclassification is ideal if the asset correlations
14
are high within a sector and low between dif-ferent sectors. Asset correlations within a sec-tor are often described in terms of statisticallycalibrated functions, for example, dependingon corporate turnover, while correlations be-tween sectors can be estimated, for example,from the time series correlations of the rele-vant sectors’ stock index returns.
The number of sectors is limited by data avail-
ability and the objective of a stable correl-ation estimation. The official statistics in Ger-many provide different and, in some cases,very detailed sector schemes, for example, inthe form of the economic sector key. Thesesector definitions were not developed withrisk measurement in mind, however, andtherefore do not necessarily fulfil a crucial cri-terion for measuring risk, namely to combinewithin a sector those enterprises whose creditrisk is linked or dependent on the same riskfactor owing to their activities in the sameeconomic sector.
The model-free measurement of sectoral con-
centration risk uses, for example, measuresbased on the HHI. For the purposes of meas-uring sectoral concentration, the HHI is de-rived from the summation of the sectors’squared relative shares of the credit portfolio.If the portfolio shares are weighted with arating or if risk-weighted assets are used in-stead of the exposure amount, such a meas-ure can also take into account the riskiness ofthe individual exposures.
Heuristic measures such as the HHI, in prin-
ciple, can provide a ranking of portfolios inthe order of their concentration risk. How-ever, they have two limitations: firstly, they donot take into consideration any differences incredit risk dependence between the sectorsand, secondly, the HHI does not supply anyinformation on the economic capital neededto cover the risks.
By contrast, traditional multi-factor models
take sectoral concentration into account byassigning sectors to risk factors. The amountof risk hinges on the correlations between theindividual factors (see the box on page 45).This model framework can be used to deter-mine the (marginal) risk contribution of theindividual loans to the overall portfolio’s eco-nomic capital. To put it simply, the marginalrisk contribution in this case describes theadditional risk which arises when a furtherloan is added to the existing portfolio. Inthese models, sectoral concentration risk isimplicitly factored into the marginal risk con-tributions.
Multi-factor models are typical examples of
model-based approaches to measuring sec-toral concentration. This category of ap-proaches also includes simplified procedures,the goal of which is to apply transparent,

45A multi-factor model for the measurement of sectoral concentration
The simplified model below shows the basic
structure of multi-factor models often used inbanking practice. These models can be usedto determine the total risk of a credit port-folio, taking single-name and sectoral concen-tration into account. For simplicity, we con-sider only default risk and not the risk of rat-ing migrations. Furthermore, each borrowercan be uniquely assigned to one of a total ofSsectors. Under these assumptions, a latent
variableX

46formula-based measurement techniques with
as few data requirements as possible. Exten-sions to the ASRF model are an example ofthis.
15A similar course is being followed with
models which retain the structure of a multi-factor model but are easier to apply in bank-ing practice owing to reduced data require-ments.
16The suitability of such simplified
models, especially their accuracy in measur-ing portfolio risk, is still the subject of on-going research.
An important application purpose of simpli-
fied, formula-based models with parsimoni-ous data requirements is as a benchmark formore complex models. Moreover, credit insti-tutions for which more complex modelswould not be suitable from a cost-benefitperspective may gain more information fromsimplified models than from the heuristicmethods which they may previously have ap-plied.
Empirical studies on industry
concentration
A more recent empirical study on industry
concentration and its significance for banks’credit risk is based on the distribution of loansin the corporate sectors of the Belgian,French, German and Spanish banking systems(broken down into 11 industry sectors).
17Al-
though there were slight deviations for indi-vidual countries, all in all a fairly similar sec-toral distribution came to light for these fourEuropean countries. This allows two conclu-sions to be drawn. Firstly, naive portfolio di-versification across national borders does notnecessarily also improve industry diversifica-tion. Secondly, it is to be expected that thefollowing results on the amount of sectoralrisk could be applied to other countries in asimilar way.
The presented aggregate sectoral distribution
of the German banking system had an HHIvalue of 18% (calculated from the portfolioshares of the individual sectors); individualbanks reported a much higher HHI value fortheir bank-specific portfolios, however. In thecase of a portfolio of corporate loans with anHHI value of just under 70% – which, accord-ing to individual studies of banks, is quiterealistic – economic capital would be around37% higher compared with a portfolio whichreflects the aggregate sectoral distribution ofthe German banking system (see the box onpage 48).
However, in order to be able to classify the
observed marked increase in economic capitalowing to sectoral concentration in terms ofits significance for the overall bank’s risk pro-file, it should be borne in mind that corporateloans usually account for only a part of thecredit portfolio. Especially in the case of

47smaller regional banks – for which a higher
industry concentration tends to be expected –retail business is, as a rule, much more im-portant than corporate loan business. As re-tail business is only weakly correlated withthe industry sectors, this alleviates the capitaleffect for the bank as a whole. However, themeasured increase in economic capital showsthat industry concentration is a source of riskthat has to be taken seriously.
Credit risk owing to regional
concentration
Alongside industry concentration, regional
concentration is a further key element of sec-toral concentration. The risks resulting fromregional concentration are different from therisks arising from industry concentration inthat, for instance, the risk of contagion forother regional sectors and/or countries is ofparticular importance. For example, the Asiancrisis of 1997-98 spread from Thailand acrossthe entire East Asian economic area and in-tensified the crisis which the Japanese bank-ing sector had been suffering since the begin-ning of the 1990s.
The term “country-specific risk” covers all of
the risks in connection with internationalbusiness, the direct cause of which lies in theeconomic, social and/or political environmentof a particular foreign country and which arespecific to that country or geographical re-gion. “Country risk” includes, for instance,legal risk, sovereign risk and transfer risk.

To identify the impact of higher sectoral concen-
tration on economic capital, a series of six credit portfolios of increasing sectoral concentration is examined. The benchmark is the portfolio already used for the comparison across countries; it is created by aggregating the sectoral distribu-tion of 2,224 German banks and will hereinafter be referred to as the benchmark portfolio. The sample portfolios 1 to 5 are obtained from this benchmark portfolio by gradually increasing the portfolio share of the capital goods sector. The portfolios 1 to 5 obtained in this fashion display visible similarities to the sectoral distribution of selected banks. The table below shows the sectoral distribution in the individual portfolios and the Herﬁ  ndahl-Hirschman Index, which is 
calculated as the sum of the squared relative 
sector shares in the credit portfolio. 
The adjacent chart shows the economic capital 
for the six corporate credit portfolios. If the economic capital ratio calculated for portfolio 5 is compared with the benchmark portfolio, a rise 
from 7.8 to 10.7 percentage points, ie a relative 
increase of 37%, is established.
Economic capital is deﬁ  ned as the difference 
between the Value-at-Risk at a 99.9% conﬁ  -
dence level and the expected loss and calculated 
in a multi-factor model using Monte Carlo simul-ations. The factor and sectoral correlations are 
estimated from time series of stock index returns of the respective sectors. The asset correlation between two enterprises in different sectors 
ranges from 3% to 23% and averages 14%. By 
construction, there is a uniform asset correlation of 25% within each sector. For all borrowers in a portfolio with negligible single-name concentra-tion, a uniform probability of default of 2% and a uniform expected loss given default of 45% 
are assumed.

49As in the case of industry or single-name con-
centration, various model-free methods – forexample, the HHI – and model-based ap-proaches can be used to quantify country-specific concentration risk. The methods arelargely the same as those for industry concen-tration.

centration risk lies in the modelling of com-plex interdependency structures and conta-gion effects between individual countries.Moreover, the individual components ofcountry risk are difficult to quantify. Againstthis background, country risk is often sub-sumed into a single risk factor. Interdepend-encies with other countries can then, for ex-ample, be determined from the correlationbetween the stock index returns of the coun-try in question and those of other countries.This basically allows country risk to be incorp-orated into a multi-factor model in the sameway as industry concentration risk.
Concentration risk from contagion
effects between enterprises
More recent empirical studies conclude that
interdependencies between the credit risks ofindividual enterprises cannot be fully ex-plained by observable risk factors such assector-dependent stock indices.
18Interde-
pendencies between enterprises owing to bi-lateral business relations also contribute tothe emergence of risks. Concentration infirms which are connected through businessrelations is more risky than lending to enter-prises without such ties. This is also referredto as micro contagion.
This kind of concentration risk at the micro
level is, in terms of the strength of dependen-cies, positioned between single-name con-centration and sectoral concentration. In thecase of single-name concentration, enter-prises are classified as a single risk entity ifthey are so closely interlinked that, were oneenterprise to fail, the other enterprises wouldalso most likely fail. By contrast, sectoral con-centration takes weaker interdependenciesinto account, namely affiliation to the sameeconomic sector.
The measurement of micro contagion risk is
fraught with considerable difficulties. Themathematical structure of the models dis-cussed up to now is, in some cases, very com-plex and difficult to implement empirically.The availability of suitable data on bilateralbusiness relations and the resultant interde-pendencies represent a key problem. Com-pared with the measurement of granularityand sectoral concentration, there is still along way to go before generally acceptedmodels for micro contagion risk are available.

50has heightened the focus on concentration
risk in banks’ internal risk management strat-egies. A classic instrument for restricting con-centration on individual counterparties or sec-tors is the strict use of internally definedcredit limits. These are traditionally applied togeographical regions and also serve to limitsingle-name concentration. It should beborne in mind, however, that these creditlimits are not only set according to the risk in-volved but may also reflect a bank’s strategicobjectives.
The fact that banks choose different refer-
ence measures makes it more difficult tocompare their upper credit limits. Credit limitsmay differ, for example, with regard to theamount of undrawn commitments which aretaken into account or the extent to whichand at what value collateral is included. An-other key issue concerns the bank’s internaldefinition of the borrower, ie to what extentare persons or enterprises other than the con-tracting party, whose default risk is closelylinked to that of the contracting party, in-cluded.
Apart from credit limits, new innovative fi-
nancial products may also offer additionalmeans of limiting concentration risk. Theseinclude, for example, portfolio diversificationthrough the sale or securitisation of sub-portfolios and the purchase of credit deriva-tives. Initial steps towards an intra-grouptransfer of risk with the aid of structured fi-nancial products also appear promising witha view to reducing single-name and sectoralconcentration, especially in the case of creditinstitutions whose lending is confined to bor-rowers from a certain region.
If concentration risk is to be limited effective-
ly, it must first be measured adequately. As ageneral rule, it must be borne in mind thatthe type of business and, in particular, thescope and diversity of the lending operationsmean that the methods applied by the indus-try in measuring and managing concentrationrisk may vary considerably in terms of theircomplexity. Cost considerations undoubtedlyalso play a role in this respect. For instance,the lending business of an internationally op-erating investment bank with a multitude ofcapital market-oriented and mark-to-markettransactions places different demands on riskmanagement and the risk models which ituses than the classic, book-value-orientedlending business of a small credit institutionoperating at a regional level.
It is to be expected, however, that, as innova-
tive, often capital market-based financialproducts become more and more widelyused, smaller credit institutions will in futurealso increasingly use model-based methodsof internal risk measurement and manage-ment. Internal risk models can be either de-veloped in-house or acquired from commer-cial providers. Hybrid forms are also possible.Typical examples are the above-mentionedmulti-factor models which, in individualcases, may differ from one another substan-tially, for instance, with regard to the numberof risk factors or their definition.

51models have the advantage of being able to
support risk management activities with re-spect to the allocation of capital for the indi-vidual operations. They thus also provide ameans of allowing concentration risk to be in-corporated into the terms and conditions.This does not mean that the terms and condi-tions are already prescribed by the model, butrather that customer account managers havea model-based, risk-sensitive terms and con-ditions proposal at their disposal.
Stress tests are a further key element of the
risk management of credit concentrations.They can be used, for example, to establishthe impact of certain stress scenarios on sec-toral concentration. Possible loan losses may,for instance, spread further owing to interde-pendencies between sectors. Thus, a crisis inthe automotive industry can spill over to an-cillary industries, such as mechanical engin-eering and the chemicals industry, and alsolead to loan losses there. The inclusion ofsuch complex interdependency structures im-poses high demands on the performance ofstress tests. Conversely, stress tests can bringhidden interdependencies to light.
Supervisory treatment of credit
concentration risk
Various standard risk limits for credit concen-
tration have resulted from banking super-visors’ interest in institutional protection.Apart from the restriction of large exposuresto individual borrowers or single borrowerunits, the focus is on transparency with re-gard to single-name concentration risk. Thus,for instance, a duty to report large exposuresto the Reichsbank was already introduced inthe early 1930s in reaction to bank failuresduring the Great Depression. Since the FifthAct amending the Banking Act came intoforce in 1994, the provisions of the GermanBanking Act have essentially been based onEC legislation.
19
Nowadays, credit institutions which – pursu-ant to section 2 (11) of the Banking Act – areexempted from having to apply the provisionsof the Banking Act concerning trading bookbusiness are obliged – pursuant to section 13of the Banking Act – to notify the DeutscheBundesbank of exposures to a single borrow-er which amount to or exceed 10% of theirliable capital. The individual large exposurelimit is set at 25% of liable capital; the overalllarge exposure limit, ie the sum of all large ex-posures, is set at 800% of liable capital(standard quantitative limits). Large exposuresmay be incurred only on the basis of a unani-mous decision by all of an institution’s man-aging directors. Exposures which exceed theindividual large exposure limit require the ap-proval of the Federal Financial SupervisoryAuthority (BaFin). Moreover, the amount bywhich a large exposure exceeds the individuallarge exposure limit is to be backed in full byliable capital. In the case of trading book insti-tutions, the aforementioned limits apply tothe banking book; however, for overall busi-ness – consisting of banking book and trad-Inclusion of

These quantitative stipulations are supple-
mented by the organisational requirementsregarding risk management laid down in sec-tion 25a (1) of the Banking Act which origin-ated from the requirements concerning themonitoring of large exposure risks.
In order to identify country concentration risk
at German banks at an early stage and pru-dentially monitor it, pursuant to the GermanCountry Risk Regulation (L/C228nderrisikoverord-
nung), credit institutions must also submit
quarterly reports on the volume of externalloans in accordance with section 25 (3) of theBanking Act. This concerns credit institutionswhose lending volume to borrowers domi-ciled outside the EEA, Switzerland, the USA,Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealandexceeds a total of 310 million.
20
The Committee of European Banking Super-visors (CEBS) is at present reviewing the ef-fectiveness of the large exposure rules inforce in Europe. CEBS is not confining itself tothe current approach but is also examining– in consultation with the banking industry –how regional and sectoral concentration riskcan be captured and managed. This reviewserves the purpose of advising the EuropeanCommission which, pursuant to Article 119of the amended Banking Directive, mustpresent a report on the functioning of thelarge exposure rules by 31 December 2007.Concentration risk will also be taken into con-sideration in the Supervisory Review Process(SRP) in future. The term “concentration risk”is broadly defined in the new Basel Frame-work and covers on and off-balance sheetassets and liabilities, including internal pro-cesses and transactions; in this context, lend-ing business is seen as the most importantsource of risk.
21Banks are urged to consider
concentration risk in their internal risk man-agement and their assessment of capital ad-equacy under Pillar 2.
22In particular, regular
stress tests of major areas of credit concentra-tion are recommended.
23This is consistent
with the goal of improving the risk sensitivityof the minimum regulatory requirements.CEBS is currently consulting the banking in-dustry with regard to implementing thesestipulations, but also in respect of the moni-toring of concentration risk under the SRP . Atpresent, credit institutions are merely required –as part of the Minimum requirements forrisk management (Mindestanforderungen an
das Risikomanagement) (qualitative stand-
ard), which serves to implement Pillar 2 at anational level – to manage their key risks andthe associated concentration risk (Generalpart 2.2 Risk, paragraph 1 of the Minimumrequirements for risk management). As forcounterparty risk, suitable measures areneeded to ensure that key overall business

53risks (eg sectoral risk, the distribution of ex-
posures by size category and risk category,and, where appropriate, country risk andother concentration risks) can be managedand monitored (Special Part BTR 1 Counter-party risk, paragraph 6 of the Minimum re-quirements for risk management).
The monitoring of concentration risk is sup-
plemented by the disclosure requirementsprovided in Pillar 3. In future, credit institu-tions will also have to submit informationabout concentration risk in their reports oncounterparty risk. Thus, for instance, theymust disclose the pattern of exposures acrosskey regions, in each case broken down by keyasset classes. Added to this is the pattern ofexposures to sectors and groups of borrow-ers. Finally, they must also report on impairedand past due items, broken down by key sec-tors, groups of borrowers and important re-gions.
Outlook
The limitation and prudent management of
concentration risk in credit portfolios is a keyelement of risk management in all credit insti-tutions irrespective of their business policyorientation. Banking supervisors, for theirpart, contribute to this by setting large expos-ure limits and monitoring banks’ internalmanagement of concentration risk as part ofthe Supervisory Review Process. Furthermore,market discipline – which has a direct impacton refinancing terms – can provide additionalincentives to avoid concentration risk. This isthe case, for example, if external credit as-sessment institutions take credit concentra-tion into account for a bank’s rating or if con-centration risk is disclosed under Pillar 3 ofBasel II.
Concentration risk will remain a particular
challenge for the risk management of creditinstitutions and for banking supervision in fu-ture. The relatively general requirements andfreedom of choice regarding methodologiesin Pillar 2 of Basel II allow new knowledge tobe taken into account in the measurementand management of concentration risk. Atthe same time, credit institutions and bankingsupervisors have a common interest in the de-velopment of adequate management proced-ures and should continue their dialogue.

on pages 58-59.)
In 2004, up to which extrapolation re-
sults are available, German firms’profits showed a clear improvement.This was helped, first, by buoyant busi-ness activity in what had again becomea more benign cyclical setting. Second,exceptionally strong positive working-day effects were a factor that made anincrease in output possible without amatching rise in wage costs. Further-more, firms’ financial viability showeda marked improvement in 2004.
Overall economic environment
In 2004, the German economy pulled out of
the protracted sluggish phase that had lastedfrom mid-2000 to mid-2003. On an annualaverage, real gross domestic product (GDP)increased by more than 1% in working-day-

56adjusted terms, after declining by1/C254%i n
2003. Taking into consideration the excep-
tionally large number of working days – 2004was a leap year and many public holidays fellon a weekend – the increase amounted tomore than 1
1/C252%. As explained in greater de-
tail below, this positive calendar effect left anobvious mark on corporate profits. In 2004,real gross value added in the sectors recordedin the corporate balance sheet statistics roseby as much as 3%, compared with a rise of2
3/C254% in trade and industry as a whole.1In
nominal terms, growth was 31/C252% in each
case. The well above-average performance ofthe enterprise sector under investigation here– in which, at the end of the period under re-view, just under three-quarters of the aggre-gate value added by the business sector wasproduced – was due mainly to the fact thatthe production sector, as the kernel of thecorporate balance sheet statistics, benefitedto a particular extent from the positive calen-dar effect and the dynamic world economy.
Economic developments in Germany in 2004
were characterised by the unbalanced de-mand structure. Weak domestic activity con-trasted with a 9
1/C254% growth in real exports, al-
though exports to non-euro-area countrieswere still lagging behind the general expan-sion of the relevant sales markets. The mainreason for this was the continuing strong ap-preciation of the euro, especially against theUS dollar, which had started in the autumn of2000 and had been accelerating considerablysince mid-2002; following a sharp rise in 2003(12%), the euro’s effective exchange rate (ona weighted average against 23 currencies)went up by a further 4% in 2004. At thesame time, imports also grew quite sharply at7%. Shifts in exchange rates, the high importcontent of exports and the marked deceler-ation in the depletion of inventories all playeda part in this. In purely mathematical terms,two-thirds of GDP growth was sustained bythe rise in real net exports and one-third bychanges in inventories. By contrast, as in2003, domestic final demand failed to gener-ate any expansionary stimuli for growth. TheGerman economy therefore remained suscep-tible to disruptive external influences. This be-came especially clear in the second half of2004, when there was a lull in exports result-ing in a sideways movement of the economy.
Among the components of domestic final de-
mand, real spending on new machinery andequipment and on other plant grew by 2
1/C252%
and 13/C254% respectively in 2004. Measured by
the large need for replacement investmentsand the favourable financing conditions, theincrease was quite moderate, however. Con-struction investment, by contrast, continuedits downward trend and was 2
1/C254% down on
the year. Government consumption was like-wise declining. Private consumption overshotits low prior-year level by
1/C252%, with the flat
underlying cyclical trend being obscured bythe positive working-day effects. Households’weak propensity to consume was due mainlyto their constrained income situation, higher
1The growth in real value added of all sectors in 2004, at
2%, was markedly slower than that of the business sec-
tor, mainly because there was a decline in the value
added of public service providers. The still clearly positive
gap between the growth rate of aggregate value added
and real GDP is due to the fact that taxes on products,

57inflation and a further rise in the propensity
to save. Overall, households’ nominal dispos-able income in 2004 was 2% more than in2003; in real terms it increased by no morethan
1/C252%, however.
The small growth in wages and salaries in2004 was due mainly to the difficult employ-ment situation, which prompted moderationin negotiated pay rates. At 1
1/C254% on a month-
ly basis, they rose almost 1 percentage pointmore slowly than in the year before. The in-crease in actual earnings was again clearlylagging behind the average increase in nego-tiated pay rates, which amounted to no morethan
1/C252%. At the same time, there was a 2%
rise in labour productivity per employee – des-pite the sharp expansion in part-time work,above all, in the form of low-paid part-timework. This was due mainly, first, to thecyclical strengthening of productivity growth.Second, the additional working days in 2004boosted production. This was accompaniedby only a minor increase in wage costs be-cause the majority of employees draw a fixedmonthly salary. Overall, unit labour costs (cal-culated on an hourly basis) declined by 1
1/C252%.
Owing to higher productivity growth alongwith a simultaneous minor increase in thecompensation of employees (
1/C254%), which in-
cludes not only wages and salaries but alsoemployers’ social contributions, entrepreneur-ial and investment income increased by noless than 11
3/C254% in 2004. The aggregate
profit ratio, as defined in the national ac-counts, therefore showed a further sharp riseand, at 31
1/C252%, achieved its highest figure
since 1991, the start of the series for Ger-many as a whole; in 2000, the figure hadamounted to 27
3/C254%. In 2004, the operating
surplus of non-financial enterprises (includingthe imputed entrepreneurial income of non-corporations) amounted to 18
1/C254% of national
income, compared with 153/C254% in 2000.
Profitability
In line with the aggregate earnings trend, cor-
porate profits in the production, trade, trans-port and business-related services sectorsshowed a sharp increase in 2004.
2The annual
result before taxes on income was 11% up onthe 2003 level when it had fallen to its cyclicallow.
3At31351/C252billion, the previous peak of
2001 was also exceeded for the first time (by4%). The methodological differences com-pared with the national accounts mentionedat the beginning of this article, which are ex-plained in greater detail on pages 58-59,
2The following study for 2004 is based on around
60,000 annual accounts. The statistical base therefore
comes quite close to the dataset in the preceding years
of just under 70,000 annual accounts. The data from the
annual accounts were extrapolated using (partly esti-
mated) data from the turnover tax statistics. The text

itions of enterprises in the investigated economic sectors
overall for the period 2002 to 2004. The appendix tables

58Deutsche BundesbankComparability of data from the corporate balance sheet statistics and the national accounts,
including the financial accounts
The Bundesbank regularly reports on German
enterprises’ profitability and financing on thebasis of its corporate balance sheet statistics,
1as
well as on investment and financing in Germanybased on the financial accounts (including the fi-nancial assets and liabilities accounts),
2which
are likewise compiled by the Bundesbank, and,in turn, form part of the national accounts. Theinvestment and financing of German enterprisesare also analysed in this context. However, itshould first be noted that the two articles referto different reporting years. This is due mainlyto the fact that, owing to the (in some cases)considerable time lag in the compilation of thebalance sheets, the current corporate balancesheet statistics are available significantly laterthan the more strongly aggregated financial ac-counts data. The national accounts figures onthe profitability of non-financial enterprises,which, in accordance with the concept of ESA95, include quasi-corporations (ie general part-nerships and limited partnerships, as well as de-rived legal forms of business organisation), arealready available a good two months after theend of the reporting year. The data from boththe corporate balance sheet statistics and fromthe national accounts are still provisional whenfirst published and may be revised in the follow-ing years.For various reasons, the two sets of figures, aswell as the analyses based on them, are compar-able only to a limited extent. The most import-ant differences are described below.
– The most striking difference concerns the re-
porting sample. In the relevant flow and
stock figures of the national accounts, includ-ing the financial accounts, sole proprietor-ships are not assigned to the enterprise sectoras in the corporate balance sheet statistics,but to the household sector instead. By con-trast, production, trade, transport, and busi-ness-related services (ie not the entire non-financial sector) are captured in the corpor-ate balance sheet statistics, which means thatcomparing the levels of the aggregates ofthe two sets of figures is uninformative inmost cases.
– As far as the income statements are con-
cerned, the national accounts include neitherextraordinary earnings, nor holding gainsand losses.
3However, heavy valuation losses
were incurred precisely at the beginning ofthis decade, leaving a deep mark on enter-prises’ income statements, and have there-fore been recorded in the Bundesbank’s cor-porate balance sheet statistics. The main rea-sons for this were the decline in share prices,particularly in 2001 and 2002, the depreci-

59ation of the US dollar, and the revaluation of
property assets that become necessary inmany cases. The valuation-related discrepan-cies between the two sets of statistics appearasymmetric insofar as increases in the valueof corporate assets are entered in the annualaccounts only in exceptional cases owing tothe principle of applying the lower of cost ormarket value in accounting.
– The income statements also differ to the ex-
tent that the cost of depreciation of tangiblefixed assets in the corporate accounting sys-tem is based on their book values and – withthe exception of special depreciation allow-ances – is deducted at the statutory linear ordegressive rates, whereas, in the national ac-counts, write-downs are determined by thereplacement prices of the assets based on lin-ear rates. These methodological differencesare significant particularly in periods of sharpincreases in the prices of capital goods, orfollowing amendments to tax depreciationrules.
– Furthermore, a major methodology-related
difference is evident when determiningequity. For example, the level of equity in thefinancial accounts is calculated on the basisof market values in accordance with the pro-visions of ESA 95, whereas the annual ac-counts in the corporate balance sheet statis-
tics – which are single-entity annual accounts –contain book values in accordance with theaccounting rules of the German CommercialCode. As the market values are generally wellabove the book values, both a higher level ofequity and a higher equity ratio are shown inthe financial accounts.
– Finally, the financial accounts currently re-
cord only the receivables and liabilities ofnon-financial enterprises vis-/C224-vis the othersectors. This means that intra-sectoral creditrelationships do not play any role here. In ef-fect, therefore, only a minority of tradereceivables and trade payables, as well as ofadvance payments made and received, areshown, ie mainly those in relation to enter-prises abroad and to sole proprietors con-tained in the household sector. However,credit relationships from deliveries of goodsand advance payments to or from Germannon-financial enterprises are excluded.
Moreover, there are a number of other meth-
odological differences that are less importantand therefore not discussed in detail here.

60were not a major factor in the reporting year
because developments in the financial andasset markets did not result in any majorvalue adjustments or extraordinary write-downs in the corporate balance sheets. Ac-cording to the national accounts figures, non-financial enterprises’ profits increased by theeven higher margin of 16% in the reportingyear. However, the very marked decline ofalmost 5% in the previous year should betaken into account in this context. Taking2003 and 2004 together, the increase in cor-porate profits as per the national accountswas 10
1/C252%, compared with an 81/C252% rise
shown in the income statements in the cor-porate balance sheet statistics.
There was a clear improvement in profitability
in 2004 even if the quite sharp increase inbusiness activity is taken into consideration.The gross return on sales, which is the ratioof the annual result before taxes on incometo sales, went up by
1/C254percentage point to
33/C254%. The last time such high figures were
recorded was in 1998 to 2001. On average,profitability returned to normal again in2004.
The increase in the annual result after taxes
was 12% in 2004, which was, in fact, evensomewhat greater than the growth of grossprofits. The main reason for this was that therise in taxes on income, at 7
1/C252%, was lower
than the rise in gross profit. A likely contribu-tory factor in this context is that, at the begin-ning of 2004, corporation tax was loweredagain to 25% after being temporarily raisedto 26.5% at the start of 2003 in order to fi-nance the rebuilding work needed to repair%

61the damage caused by flooding, particularly
in eastern Germany, in summer 2002. Theaverage income tax burden on the gross an-nual result therefore fell from 23% in 2003 to22
1/C252%, and the gap compared with the
period 1997 to 2004, which was 24%,widened further. Owing to the very sharp in-crease in the result after tax, the net returnon sales rose by
1/C254percentage point to 3%. It
should be noted, however, that the recordedamount of income tax includes, besides tradeearnings tax, only corporation tax (includingthe solidarity surcharge) but not the incometax payments of non-corporations (partner-ships and sole proprietorships). For this rea-son, the net return on sales, as a profitabilityratio, is suited to showing the trend of netprofits rather than highlighting their level.
All major economic sectors recorded in the
corporate balance sheet statistics shared inthe improvement in profitability in 2004, al-beit to a varying extent. Manufacturing, forexample, with an increase of 5
1/C252% in its
gross annual result, was considerably belowthe average rate of growth, even thoughbusiness activity had picked up markedly. Thiswas due mainly to weak performance in thechemicals industry and in the manufactureof motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers,where the appreciation of the euro depressedmargins in business with non-euro-area coun-tries. Added to this was the sharp increase inthe cost of essential primary products, iecrude oil in the chemicals industry and steelin the motor vehicles sector. Furthermore,special accounting effects played a part in thecar industry. The sectors of the economywhich are geared more towards the domesticmarket, such as the food and drink industry,
were hampered by persistently weak con-sumption. In terms of the sectoral picture as awhole, the rather poor performance in somesectors was not offset by the very largegrowth in profits, say, in the manufacture ofbasic metals, which has been benefiting forseveral years from a global boom in demand.The gross return on sales in manufacturing,at 4%, remained virtually unchanged in2004. This was still more than
1/C252percentage
point below the figures in the period from1998 to 2001.
The persistent weakness of private consump-
tion in Germany in 2004 not only impairedearnings trends in some parts of the con-sumer goods industry but also left its mark inthe income statement of the retail trade (in-cluding the sale and repair of motor vehicles).Given minor growth in sales, the gross annualresult went up by no more than 4%. This wasa lower increase than in the other major eco-nomic sectors. By contrast, the wholesaletrade, transport, and business-related servicesrecorded double-figure growth in profits.Business in these sectors is usually linked veryclosely to industrial activity, which, as men-tioned above, picked up strongly in 2004.The gross returns on sales continued to showwide differences, however; they ranged be-tween 2
1/C252% in the wholesale trade to 81/C252%
in the case of business-related services. It isstriking that, given a further sharp decline inbusiness activity, the construction sector wasable to significantly boost its pre-tax profits.This was due to a marked decline in all themajor cost items.Positive

62Income and expenses in detail
Gross revenue in 2004 was consistent with
the above-mentioned sharp growth in thegross value added of the economic sectorscaptured by the corporate balance sheet stat-istics. Gross revenue, which is the sum ofsales and changes in stocks of finished goodsand other own work capitalised, increased by3
1/C252%, having fallen in the two previous
years. This increase was sustained by manu-facturing business activity, which grew by4%. According to the official statistics, indus-trial export sales rose considerably moresharply, at 9
1/C252%, than sales to domestic cus-
tomers (31/C252%). At 61/C252%, the wholesale trade
achieved even stronger growth in gross rev-enue. The sales volume of business-relatedservices grew by 3% and that of transport en-terprises by 2%. In the retail trade, it wasonly 1% higher than before and in the con-struction sector as much as 6
1/C252% lower.
On the income side, however, the rise ingross revenue in 2004 contrasted with asharp 10
1/C252% decline in interest and similar in-
come and a 7% fall in other income. Themain reason for the decrease in the amountof interest and similar income, which wasmore than one-fifth down on its 2001 peak,was that market interest rates were fallingagain, while the annual average level ofinterest-bearing assets showed a further in-crease (2%). The large decline in other in-come was due mainly to smaller dividend dis-tributions and a further reduction in extraor-dinary income. This means that this compon-ent has more than halved since 2001 and2002, when large amounts had been realised,Enterprises’ income statement*

63not least owing to the liquidation of hidden
reserves. Total income increased by 3% in thereporting year, having fallen by just under 2%in the two previous years.
Total expenses before taxes on income in-
creased somewhat more slowly (2
1/C252%) in
2004, thus creating leeway for the improve-ment in the gross annual result. The rise in ex-penses was curbed mainly by lower personnelexpenses, depreciation, interest and similarexpenses, and operating taxes. Moreover,other expenses rose by no more than
1/C252%.
Other expenses include rental and leasing ex-penditure, research and development costs,advertising expenses and transfers to the spe-cial tax-allowable reserve; they account for asmuch as one-seventh of total expenses be-fore taxes on income.
Materials were a considerable cost-driving
factor in 2004, increasing in terms of value by5% and thus noticeably more sharply thangross revenue. This was due mainly to thesharp rise in the cost of raw materials, con-sumables and supplies and of purchased mer-chandise, which was, in turn, due to thesurge in import prices for commodities andintermediate products. While crude oil be-came one-fifth more expensive in the marketsin 2004 in euro terms, prices of non-ferrousmetals and of iron ores and scrap metal wentup, on a euro basis, by more than one-quarter. As expected, the increased cost ofraw materials, consumables and supplies se-verely affected manufacturing, the wholesaletrade (for which trading with refined petrol-eum products is of considerable importance)and transport (on account of higher fuelcosts). The cost of materials tends to be of
minor importance for business-related ser-vices, although the increase in that sectorwas likewise considerable. By contrast, ex-penditure on goods in the retail trade in-creased by only 1%. Besides rather weak con-sumer demand, this was due to the fact thatthe prices of imported finished products fellagain, mainly owing to the appreciation ofthe euro.
Personnel expenses showed a further fall in
2004 (-1%), even though it was not asmarked as in the year before. The share ofthis cost item in gross revenue fell to 18%,compared with 19
1/C252% in 1997. The slight de-
cline in personnel expenses was connectedwith the continuing shedding of jobs alongwith overall moderate wage growth. Accord-ing to the official statistics, the number ofemployees in the economic sectors understudy here, in which more than 85% of em-ployed persons in trade and industry work,fell by 1% in 2004. The loss of jobs in theconstruction sector was especially severe(-3
1/C252%). Furthermore, the increase in wages
in this sector was very small, leading to asharp fall in personnel expenses. In manufac-turing, personnel expenses rose by 1% on theback of a 1
1/C252% fall in employment. In the
other sectors of the economy, the number ofpersons in employment either declined mar-ginally or remained unchanged. Accordingly,there was a slight increase in personnel ex-penses in the wholesale and retail trade, thelevel for business-related services remainedunchanged on the year and, following asomewhat sharper increase in 2003, declinedagain in the transport sector.Total expenses

64In both relative terms and as an absolute
amount, the decline in depreciation chargeshad a greater impact on the cost accountthan did the decrease in personnel expenses.The depreciation of tangible fixed assets (in-cluding amortisation and write-downs of in-tangible fixed assets) was reduced for thefourth time in succession (-4
1/C252%). This is
mainly a reflection of weak investment in theperiod from 2001 to 2003. Other depreci-ation, which accounts for roughly 10% of alldepreciation charges, fell by as much as17%, having already declined by a similaramount in 2003. This was essentially due tothe fact that write-downs of receivables, se-curities and other long-term equity invest-ments continued to show a trend towards alower, normal level after increasing rapidlybetween 2000 and 2002 – mainly on accountof huge share price losses in the stock mar-kets. In 2004, they were more or less back attheir 1998 and 1999 level.
Interest expenditure declined by 4% in the re-
porting year, thus undershooting the 2001peak figure by 17%. This was due, first, to afurther fall in the average annual level ofinterest-bearing liabilities at both the longand short end. Another factor was the furtherslight fall to 4
1/C252% in the average rate of inter-
est to be paid by the enterprises. With simul-taneously declining interest income and ex-penses, net interest and similar expenses re-mained virtually unchanged. Measured bysales, this item amounted to just over
1/C252%.
The moderate overall growth of expenses in2004 was helped by the fact that enterprisespaid 4
1/C252% less in operating taxes. Roughly95% of this consisted of excise duties, whichfell by 1
1/C252%. A factor in this was that energy
consumption dropped in the wake of thehigh oil prices, thus lowering the amount ofmineral oil tax to be paid by the enterprises.Furthermore, the increases in tobacco tax of1 March and 1 December 2004 were morethan offset by the decline in demand for to-bacco products.
Sources and uses of funds
The total inflow of funds to the enterprises in
the sectors of the economy considered hereamounted to 3132 billion in 2004.
4This was
6% more than one year earlier, although itstill fell over 40% short of the peak figurereached in 1999. The increase in the report-ing year was sustained solely by growth in in-ternally generated funds, while the inflow ofexternal funding was negative. This meansthat total asset formation in 2004 – as in2003 – did not fully absorb the internal inflowof resources. Rather, given still quite moder-ate gross capital formation and a renewed li-quidation of financial assets, liabilities wereredeemed. This might have something to dowith the enterprises’ efforts to focus more oncore competencies following the sharp ex-pansion in financial assets in 1999 and 2000;especially owing to stock market corrections,this had led to substantial wealth losses andbalance sheet problems in the ensuingperiod.

65The inflow of resources from internal fund-
ing, which had fallen by nearly one-fifth in2003, increased by 6% again in the reportingyear. This was the result, first, of significantlylarger capital increases from profits andfrom contributions to the capital of non-corporations. Second, there was also an in-crease in provisions. Although depreciationallowances were 6% lower, they were still byfar the most important source of corporatefunding at 83% of the total inflow of capitalresources.
Developments in external funding were
marked by the ongoing reduction in shortand long-term liabilities totalling almost 311
billion. This was assisted, first, by the continu-ing net repayment of bank loans. Further-more, there was a marked reduction in pay-ments received on account of orders, whichhad increased in the two previous years. Onbalance, only 33 billion came from affiliated
companies in 2004, compared with 321 bil-
lion and 315
1/C252billion in 2002 and 2003 re-
spectively. In terms of external funding, a cer-tain counterposition to this was formed bythe increase in the capital of corporations,which went up from virtually nothing in 2003to310
1/C252billion. This was markedly less than
in earlier peak years but, owing the reductionin the overall cash flow, its share of the totalsources of funds, at 8%, was comparativelylarge. At almost 25% of funds raised, thetotal increase in capital from both internaland external sources was considerably higherthan the average ratio in the period from1997 to 2004.Enterprises’ sources and uses of funds*

66With regard to the uses of funds, the forma-
tion of non-financial assets has become moreimportant again over the past few years. Thisis due mainly to the fact that the decline inthis area between 2000 and 2003 was con-siderably weaker than in the case of financialasset formation. Furthermore, investmentwas stepped up again in 2004, while financialasset formation remained negative. At theend of the period under review, 81% of totalresources flowed into real assets, which wasthe highest figure since the start of the series.Gross investment in new tangible fixed assetsgrew by 12
1/C252% in 2004, in fact. As a result,
with declining depreciation, net investment,too, was positive again. The declining trendin inventories continued, however. Overall, itappears that, in the reporting year, internalinvestment was again representing more ofan alternative to sharp “external growth” (inthe form of other long-term equity invest-ments) than had been the case during theboom period of 1999-2000.
The decline in financial asset formation in
2004 of almost one-fifth was due mainly tothe fact that enterprises provided no morethan 39 billion for the acquisition of other
long-term equity investments; this was merelyhalf the 2003 amount and less than one-thirdof the budgets for 1999 and 2000. Moreover,in contrast to earlier years, there was barelyany further increase in cash holdings. Therewas a marked expansion in securities, how-ever. The accumulation of receivables wasalso stepped up, albeit only in the short-termrange. This mostly involved receivables fromaffiliated companies. At the same time, fol-lowing sharp falls in the three precedingyears, trade receivables showed scarcely anyfurther decline – possibly as a result of busi-ness activities picking up.
Balance sheet trends and balance sheet
ratios
The upturn in the economy as a whole in
2004 as well as a clear improvement in profit-ability left their mark on the corporate bal-ance sheets in the economic sectors under re-view. This was reflected more in the structureof the balance sheets than in their growth,however. At 1%, the overall volume of assetsand capital did not grow any more stronglythan on an average of the period from 2001to 2003. The increase was therefore still wellbelow the high rates of expansion in 1999(6
1/C252%) and 2000 (4%) Broken down by eco-
nomic sector, the picture is rather mixed,however. At 2%, growth in the balance sheettotal of enterprises in the manufacturing sec-tor – in 2004 the main beneficiary of the cyc-lical improvement – was somewhat strongerthan the aggregate figure. This also applies tothe wholesale and retail trade and to trans-port. By comparison, the assets and capital ofbusiness-related services showed no morethan a slight increase. In construction therewas a further sharp decline (of more thanone-tenth) in the balance sheet total owingto the ongoing process of structural adjust-ment. This signifies a contraction of no lessthan one-third compared with the most re-cent peak in 1999.

67year, however, insofar as the stock of non-
financial assets increased by 2% following adecline in the previous two years. This meansthat its share of the balance sheet total wentup slightly to 22
1/C254%. Earlier, this ratio had
shown a steady decline from 231/C252% in 1997
to 22% in 2003. The stock of intangible fixedassets in 2004 was, in fact, 8
1/C252%u po nt h e
year. Inventories continued to shrink in the re-porting year, however, resulting in no morethan 1% overall growth in non-financialassets.
Financial assets, too, increased at roughly the
same pace in the reporting year. Their overallmoderate growth was due, first, to a sharp,16
1/C252% increase in the portfolio of securities.
One motive for the enterprises may havebeen to build up financial reserves for invest-ment projects or acquisitions of other long-term equity investments at a later date.Second, the stock of cash resources and re-ceivables showed no more than below-average growth at
1/C252% in each case. The
book value of other long-term equity invest-ments increased by 1%, which was the weak-est growth since the new database was intro-duced in 1997.
Structural changes are even more noticeable
on the capital side than on the asset side ofthe balance sheet. Thanks to the greater re-tention of profits described above and the in-creased injection of external resources, thestock of equity increased by 7
1/C252%. At the
same time, liabilities showed a further declineof 1
1/C252%, mainly on account of the repayment
of bank loans. Taken together, these two de-velopments led to the share of equity in theEnterprises’ balance sheet*

68balance sheet total rising sharply to 23%.
This means that the equity ratio was no lessthan 6
1/C252percentage points above its 1997
level. The relative share of liabilities and provi-sions declined accordingly. Liabilities becameeven less significant in terms of corporate fi-nancing, while provisions continued expand-ing up to the end of the reporting period. In2004, they accounted for 25% of total liabil-ities and provisions, compared with 22
1/C252%i n
1997.
All the economic sectors under review shared
in the positive development in relation toequity. Manufacturing enterprises did recorda below-average increase of 3
1/C252% but,
owing to the moderate balance sheetgrowth, the equity ratio (which was alreadycomparatively high) showed a further rise to27%. The other sectors consistently achieveddouble-digit rates of equity growth, althoughtheir equity ratios were in some cases wellbelow the comparable figure for manufactur-ing. Yet again, it was the construction sectorwhich showed the lowest figure, at 8%, eventhough this represented a doubling of theratio of liable funds to the balance sheet totalcompared with the low reached in 2001. In2004, the equity ratios in the other sectorsranged between 14
1/C252% in the retail trade
and 231/C252% in the wholesale trade.
A number of other balance sheet ratios alsopoint to a marked improvement in firms’ fi-nancial base in the reporting year. Thus, theratio of long-term equity and liabilities tototal capital showed a further increase to45
1/C252% – the highest figure since 1997. More-
over, at 111/C252%, it exceeded the stock of fixedBalance sheet ratios*

69assets by a greater margin than before. In the
short-term range, cash resources and receiva-bles covered 90% of liabilities, comparedwith 86
1/C252% and 871/C252% respectively in 2002
and 2003. Enterprises’ ability to pay theirdebts likewise improved in the reporting year.The ratio of the cash flow to liabilities andprovisions, which is a measure of firms’ liquid-ity, came to 15
1/C252%, and was thus roughly on
a par with the average for the period from1998 to 2003.
Summary
The surmounting of the period of persistent
slow growth in 2004 was reflected in an obvi-ously more favourable trend in profitabilityfor firms in manufacturing, the wholesaleand retail trade, transport, and the business-related services sector. Nevertheless, excep-tionally strong, positive working-day effectswere a factor in this insofar as it was possibleto use the additional working days to increaseoutput with a relatively small increase inwage costs, since the majority of employeesdraw a fixed monthly salary. Without this ex-ceptional effect, the increase in corporateprofits would undoubtedly have been notice-ably smaller. However, the sharp rise in profitsin 2004 merely led to German enterprises’profitability, measured by gross return onsales, reverting to its “normal level” after themajor strains in the preceding years causedby sluggish business activity and large write-downs of balance sheet assets.
Nevertheless, in the 2004 financial year, in-
vestment failed to keep pace with the positivetrend in profitability, even though the markedincrease in investment in non-financial assetswas a positive development. Enterprises alsoused the stronger injections of internal andexternal capital to make a further reductionin their liabilities, in particular, to banks. Inbalance sheet terms, this resulted in a furtherexpansion of the equity base. Not only themarked increase in the equity ratio but alsoother balance sheet ratios show that Germanfirms took a major step forward in 2004 interms of their efforts to improve their finan-cial viability. This means that the conditionsfor a strengthening of corporate growth alsoimproved substantially. As far as it is possibleto tell, these positive trends are likely to havecontinued in the ensuing period. They havenow also led to higher investment activity.
