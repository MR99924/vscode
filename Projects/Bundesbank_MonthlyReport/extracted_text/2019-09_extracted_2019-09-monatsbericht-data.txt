Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The German economy got the third quarter off 
to a sluggish start, too. This was due primarily 
to export- oriented industry, where the down -
turn continued. The more domestically oriented 
areas are still on an upward path, however. The 
situation on the labour market has remained 
good, even though employment growth in the 
past few months was significantly lower than 
last year. In conjunction with the optimistic 
outlook for consumers’ income, this fuelled pri -
vate consumption. Construction activity has 
continued to flourish as well. The economic 
dichot omy thus appears to have continued for 
the time being. However, it is uncertain 
whether these cyclical upward forces have 
been strong enough to form an adequate 
counterweight to the slumping industrial sec -
tor. Therefore, German GDP could once again 
have contracted slightly in the third quarter.
As things currently stand, when viewed in isol -
ation a contraction in GDP in two consecutive 
quarters does not represent cause for concern 
just yet. Such a situation does not necessarily 
mean the end of a period of economic expan -
sion, either, as in this case the contraction in 
economic activity has been confined largely to 
manufacturing. From today’s vantage point, 
only a slight decline in GDP is to be expected 
overall, even including the second quarter. 
Such a decline should currently be seen as part 
of a cyclical return to normality as the German 
economy emerges from a period of high cap -
acity utilisation. In any case, aggregate capacity 
utilisation is currently still likely to be slightly 
above average and could reach normal levels 
towards the end of the year. However, there 
are still considerable downside risks, in particu -
lar in the international environment, and it re -
mains unclear whether industrial activity will recover before the downturn spills over to 
more domestically oriented economic sectors.
Industry
Industrial production continued its slump in 
July 2019, falling significantly on the month in 
seasonally adjusted terms (-¾%). A substantial 
decline (-1¼%) was also recorded in compari -
son with the average of the second quarter. 
Though the timing of the summer holidays 
played a certain role in this respect, it was not 
the main factor behind the continued slacken -
ing in production. Producers of intermediate 
goods decreased their production particularly 
strongly (-2¼%). The production of capital 
goods was also cut back considerably (-1%), 
though this decline was spread broadly across 
the different economic sectors. For example, a 
perceptible decline from the second quarter 
was recorded in machinery and equipment, in 
the manufacture of computer, electronic and 
optical products and in other transport equip -
ment. The manufacture of cars and car parts 
fell particularly sharply. However, according to 
information provided by the German Associ -
ation of the Automotive Industry (VDA), the 
number of cars manufactured rebounded 
strongly in August; their average for the July 
and August period remained around the level 
of the second quarter. This suggests that the 
dampening holiday effects were particularly 
pronounced in motor vehicle production. Pro -
duction of consumer goods in July was virtually 
unchanged compared with the second quarter.
Industrial orders fell sharply in July 2019. After 
seasonal adjustment, they were down consid -
erably on the month (-2¾%) and also fell sig -
nificantly (-1¾%) compared with the average 
of the second quarter. However, when making 
a comparison with orders received in the 
second quarter, it should be noted that these 
were characterised by numerous large orders, German econ -
omy probably

particularly in June. Excluding the volatile large 
orders, orders received, in fact, contracted only 
slightly (-½%) in the reporting month. Industrial 
orders excluding large orders have thus been 
moving sideways since May, albeit at a weak 
level. From a regional perspective, demand for 
industrial goods in July was down from the pre -
vious quarter across the board. Orders from 
non- euro area countries fell particularly sharply 
(-3%). Domestic orders and orders from the 
euro area declined much less strongly (-¾% in 
both cases), each being lifted by other trans -
port equipment, which was influenced by large 
orders. With regard to the main groupings, 
manufacturers of consumer goods suffered the 
sharpest decline (-3%), while the producers of 
intermediate and capital goods had to cope 
with a smaller, but nonetheless substantial cut 
in orders (-2% and -1¼% respectively).
Industrial sales slid downward in July, at virtu -
ally the same pace as industrial production. 
Nominal sales declined steeply in seasonally ad -
justed terms, both compared with the previous 
month (-1%) and with the average of the 
second quarter (-1½%). Sales of both inter -
mediate and capital goods were down consid -
erably. In the case of the latter, this was primar -
ily attributable to the automotive sector, which 
saw a very steep fall in sales, particularly in Ger -
many and the rest of the euro area. By con -
trast, sales figures for the mechanical engineer -
ing sector were slightly higher than in the 
second quarter. Manufacturers of consumer 
goods only had to cope with a marginal fall in 
sales. With regard to the regional sales mar -
kets, the decline was primarily attributable to 
the euro area. While sales in Germany dropped 
perceptibly, they were up in non- euro area 
countries. In July 2019, nominal goods exports 
rose distinctly on the month (+¾%). An in -
crease was also recorded in both nominal and 
real terms (1% in each case) compared with the 
average of the admittedly very weak second 
quarter. In line with industrial sales, growth in 
exports to non- euro area countries contrasted 
with a significant decline in exports to the euro 
area in terms of value. After seasonal adjust -Industrial sales

ment, nominal imports of goods were down 
perceptibly in July 2019, however, both on the 
month (-1½%) and compared with the average 
of the second quarter (-1¼%). Sliding import 
prices, caused by lower energy prices, played 
an important role here, which meant the de -
cline was much weaker in price- adjusted terms 
(-¼%).
Construction industry
After seasonal adjustment, construction output 
was slightly higher (+¼%) in July 2019 than the 
previous month, which had undergone a small 
upward revision, and thus reached the average 
level of the second quarter. This was due to a 
marginal rise recorded by the main construc -
tion industry, supported by higher output in 
building construction. By contrast, the slight 
reduc tion in activity in finishing trades had a 
slight dampening effect (-¼%). Orders received 
in the main construction sector in the second 
quarter (up to which data are available) de -
clined steeply from the previous quarter 
(-5½%), but this development is also to be seen 
as more of a return to normal following the 
sudden spike in new orders due to major con -
tracts at the beginning of 2019. The persist -
ently high equipment utilisation and the reach 
of orders in the main construction industry, as 
expressed in surveys conducted by the Ifo Insti -
tute, also suggest that construction activity will 
continue to flourish for the time being.
Labour market
In July 2019, employment continued its moder -
ate upward movement of the past few months, 
with the number of employed persons up by 
14,000 on the month after seasonal adjust -
ment. Employment increased on the year by 
374,000 persons, or 0.8%. This was mainly 
thanks to strong growth in jobs subject to so -
cial security contributions, which has eased 
considerably of late, however. The largest in -
crease was recorded in health and social work activities and in business- related services (ex -
cluding temporary agency employment). By 
contrast, the number of filled jobs subject to 
social security contributions in manufacturing 
was down slightly, and there was a steep de -
crease in the temporary employment sector. 
The leading indicators for labour market de -
mand continued to lose ground and are now 
only slightly expansionary. The number of job 
vacancies is still very high, however.
The seasonally adjusted number of persons 
registered as unemployed went up slightly in 
August 2019. The Federal Employment Agency 
recorded 2,29 million unemployed persons, 
4,000 more than in July. The unemployment 
rate remained unchanged at 5.0%. 31,000 
fewer persons were registered as unemployed 
than in August last year. Due to the economic 
slowdown, the month- on- month increase was 
related to the number of job seekers receiving 
unemployment benefits under the statutory in -
surance scheme. Unemployment amongst job 
seekers receiving the basic welfare allowance 
was unchanged. The scope of labour market 
policy measures is unlikely to have influenced 
the development; the increase in overall under -
employment was similar to that in unemploy -
ment. The unemployment barometer of the 
Institute for Employment Research (IAB) de -
clined again, suggesting a further rise in un -
employment in the next three months.
Prices
Given the prospects of subdued demand, crude 
oil prices fell markedly in August 2019 and 
were down by 7½% on the month. This was a 
considerable drop of just under one- fifth on 
the year. In mid-  September, prices spiked fol -
lowing the production losses in Saudi Arabia 
and, as this report went to press, the price of a 
barrel of Brent crude oil had gone up to US$65. 
Crude oil futures were still trading at discounts, 
however. The discount on crude oil futures was 
US$3½ for deliveries six months ahead and 
US$5½ for deliveries 12 months ahead.Slight rise in

After seasonal adjustment, prices were down 
slightly overall at the import level in July. This 
was mainly attributable to energy, where prices 
continued to decline. By contrast, prices for the 
imports of other goods were unchanged. Im -
port prices were down considerably on the 
year due to cheaper energy products (-2.1%). 
Domestic producer prices, for which data for 
August are already available, fell slightly in July 
and August due to energy. There was no 
change in prices of other goods, and the year- 
on- year figure for manufactured articles was 
still in positive territory (+0.3%).
Consumer prices as measured by the Harmon -
ised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) were 
down slightly in August after seasonal adjust -
ment. One reason for this was energy prices, 
which continued to fall on the back of lower 
crude oil prices. Furthermore, non- energy in -
dustrial goods were cheaper. By contrast, food 
prices surged considerably once again and 
prices for services picked up slightly. Annual 
HICP inflation fell slightly to 1.0% (excluding 
energy and food, to 0.8%). As in July, a key 
factor in the low year- on- year rates was an 
arithmetic one- off effect caused by methodo -
logical changes to the package holidays sub-  
index at the beginning of the year in conjunc -
tion with the construction of the HICP as a 
chain- linked index with weightings that are up -
dated annually.1 By contrast, the year- on- year 
rate of CPI, which is not subject to this effect, 
was significantly higher at 1.4% (compared 
with 1.7% in the previous month). The one- off 
effect affecting package holidays will also 
dampen headline and core HICP inflation this 
month and next.
Public finances
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
In the second quarter of 2019, the statutory 
health insurance (SHI) scheme as a whole (com -
prising the health insurance institutions and the health fund) posted a deficit of just over €½ 
billion, putting it €½ billion higher on the year. 
Although the health fund halved its deficit to 
just short of €½ billion, the health insurance 
institutions ran a deficit of €½ billion. One year 
previously, they had recorded a surplus of €½ 
billion. Approximately one- third of the deterior -
ation in the result posted by the health insur -
ance institutions was due to somewhat lower 
supplementary contribution rates. According 
to  data from the Federal Ministry of Health, 
the  average supplementary contribution rate 
charged by the health insurance institutions 
was 0.99% around the middle of the year. It 
was thus down by just under 0.1 percentage 
point on the year.
The health insurance institutions’ revenue, 
which mainly consists of transfers from the 
health fund, grew by 3½%. Lower supplemen -
tary contribution rates dampened the increase 
in contribution receipts by ½ percentage point. 
Expenditure growth, at 5%, accelerated fur -
ther, despite being curbed by ½  percentage 
point by one- off effects from the previous year. 
Although growth in spending on hospital treat -
ment, a large expenditure item, was again dis -
tinctly lower at 3% and only slightly exceeded 
the adjustment to services charges, the increase 
in outlays on pharmaceuticals accelerated sig -
nificantly to +5½%. The rise in expenditure on 
remedies and therapeutic appliances, sickness 
benefits and travelling expenses was far above 
average. Other expenditure on benefits experi -
enced a large increase, as it has done since the 
beginning of the year, as a result of payments 
under the Care Staff Strengthening Act (Pflege -
personal-Stärkungsgesetz).
The health fund’s revenue grew by 4% on the 
year. In comparison with the start of the year, 
growth accelerated particularly owing to ma -
terially higher revenue from contributions on 
pensions. These reflected the impact of 
“mothers’ pensions”, which had been ex -
tended at the start of the year, including retro -Barely any

spective payments for the entire first quarter. 
Reduced supplementary contribution rates and 
lower minimum contributions for self- employed 
persons had a dampening effect. The fund’s 
expenditure, which largely comprises payments 
to the health insurance institutions, saw a 
somewhat weaker rise than revenue.
In autumn 2018, the group of SHI estimators 
had forecast a moderate deficit in the health 
fund for 2019 as a whole. Transfers are again 
being made from reserves to the innovation 
and structural funds. To date, the economic 
downturn has not had a perceptible impact on 
the development of employee compensation 
and pensions. In the first half of the year, the 
result was also somewhat more favourable 
than it had been a year earlier, given reduced 
transfers to both funds. However, additional 
expenditure could arise in the second half of 
the year. All in all, the health fund could, as be -
fore, post a moderate surplus for the year as a 
whole.
Last autumn, the group of estimators had pre -
dicted a rise of 4½% in spending by health in -
surance institutions for the year as a whole. In 
the preceding years, increases had regularly 
been overestimated. If the recent development 
continues, these estimates might now even 
turn out to be somewhat too low. Although 
the average supplementary contribution rate 
remains above the cost- covering level of 0.9% 
projected last autumn, it is uncertain whether 
the health insurance institutions will post an -
other surplus.
Public long- term care 
insurance  scheme
The core area2 of the public long- term care in -
surance scheme recorded a surplus of €1 billion 
in the second quarter of 2019. One year earlier, 
it had posted a deficit of just under €1 billion. 
This considerable improvement is due to the 
sharp increase in the contribution rate. Since 
the beginning of the year, the rate has stood at 3.05% (plus an extra 0.25 percentage point for 
childless persons) and is, therefore, ½ percent -
age point higher than before. This spurred rev -
enue growth of 26½%. Since the beginning of 
the year, revenue has also included payments 
made by the health insurance institutions to 
the long- term care insurance scheme under the 
Care Staff Strengthening Act .Another surplus

At 7%, expenditure rose sharply on the year. 
Higher care allowance payments and pension 
contributions for those providing care for a 
relative caused an even stronger expansion in 
cash benefits of 9% overall. Growth in benefits 
in kind accelerated to 5½% on the year. How -
ever, outlays on fully inpatient care, a major ex -
penditure item, again remained virtually un -
changed.
Expenditure growth appears unlikely to decel -
erate over the remainder of the year. It could 
even accelerate on account of continued ef -
forts to improve the care situation. This not -
withstanding, a significant surplus is also likely for the year as a whole, after a deficit of €3½ 
billion in 2018. This is primarily attributable to 
the sharp rise in contribution rates, resulting in 
additional revenue of €7½ billion. In future, 
however, demographic change will place a 
considerable strain on the finances of the long- 
term care insurance scheme. It is vital that this 
fact is given due consideration in the debate on 
further benefit expansions. Overall, it is likely 
that, looking ahead, the contribution rate of 
the long- term care insurance scheme will con -
tinue to rise significantly, even without such 
discretionary increases in expenditure.
Securities markets
Bond market
Gross sales on the German bond market in July 
2019, at €122.7 billion, were higher than in 
June (€95.1 billion). However, after taking ac -
count of redemptions, which also increased, 
and changes in issuers’ holdings of their own 
debt securities, the outstanding volume of 
domestic  bonds contracted by a net €7.9 billion 
after having already decreased by €2.3 billion 
in June. Foreign debt securities worth €5.3 bil -
lion were placed in the German market, which 
meant that the outstanding volume of domes -
tic and foreign debt instruments in Germany 
receded by €2.6 billion on balance.
The public sector redeemed its own bonds in 
the amount of €7.6 billion net in the reporting 
month. It was primarily central government 
that reduced its capital market debt on balance 
(€12.6 billion). The redemptions were focused 
on ten- year Federal bonds (Bunds) (€21.6 bil -
lion). This contrasted with net issuance of five- 
year Federal notes (Bobls) worth €4.6 billion 
and Treasury discount paper (Bubills) at €3.7 
billion. The Federal states and local govern -
ments issued bonds to the tune of €5.1 billion 
on balance.

while other financial institutions issued bonds 
on a small scale.
Domestic credit institutions increased their cap -
ital market borrowing by €0.7 billion net in the 
reporting month. This principally involved debt 
securities issued by specialised credit institu -
tions (€1.6 billion), among which are public 
promotional banks, for example. There was

ing volume of other bank debt securities that 
can be structured flexibly. This contrasted with 
mortgage Pfandbriefe, which were redeemed 
for €1.8 billion net.
Domestic credit institutions emerged as sole 
buyers in July, acquiring debt securities for €4.5 
billion net. For the most part, it was foreign 
paper that was bought. The Bundesbank’s 
bond portfolio declined by €2.6 billion for 
oper ational reasons. Foreign investors and 
domestic  non- banks also reduced their bond 
investment by €2.3 billion and €2.2 billion net, 
respectively.
Equity market
The reporting month saw hardly any new 
shares being issued by domestic firms on the 
German equity market (€0.1 billion). Sales of 
foreign shares in Germany rose by €2.6 billion 
in the same period, however. Domestic non-  
banks were dominant on the buyers’ side of 
the market, adding shares worth €2.7 billion 
net to their portfolios. Foreign investors bought 
equities for €1.6 billion net, while domestic 
credit institutions sold shares for €1.6 billion on 
balance.
Investment funds
Domestic investment funds registered a moder -
ate inflow of funds amounting to €5.9 billion in 
July, the vast majority of which went into spe -
cialised funds which are reserved for institu -tional investors (€5.2 billion). Among the asset 
classes, the chief beneficiaries of the new funds 
were mixed securities funds and open- end real 
estate funds (€3.8 billion and €2.1 billion, re -
spectively). By contrast, bond funds recorded 
outflows amounting to €1.8 billion. Foreign 
mutual funds sold share certificates on the 
German  market for €3.6 billion in net terms. It 
was almost exclusively domestic non- banks 
that emerged as purchasers of investment fund 
shares in the reporting month (€8.5 billion). 
Domestic credit institutions acquired units for 
€1.4 billion on balance, while foreign investors 
reduced their fund portfolio in Germany by 
€0.4 billion.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €22.1 billion in July 2019. The result was 
€1.2 billion up on the level of the previous 
month. This was attributable to an increase in Net redemptions

the goods account surplus, which outweighed 
the reduction in the invisible current transac -
tions balance comprising services as well as pri -
mary and secondary income.
In the reporting month, the surplus in the 
goods account increased by €5.7 billion on the 
month to €23.4 billion. In this context, exports 
of goods expanded more sharply than imports.
Germany recorded a deficit of €1.3 billion in 
invisible current transactions in July, compared 
with a surplus of €3.2 billion one month earlier. 
The turnaround was largely attributable to 
greater deficits in the services and secondary 
income accounts. In the services account, the 
deficit widened by €3.0 billion to €5.4 billion. 
Receipts grew, with higher receipts, above all, 
in charges for the use of intellectual property, 
in travel and in transport outweighing the de -
cline in IT services, in particular. However, ex -
penditure rose at an even stronger pace than 
receipts, chiefly owing to the usual seasonal 
expansion in travel expenditure. The deficit in 
the secondary income account widened by 
€1.3 billion to stand at €4.6 billion, with re -
ceipts decreasing, notably on account of lower 
general government revenue from current 
taxes on income and wealth. In addition, ex -
penditure went up slightly, given the increased 
payments by general government and non-  
government sectors to non- residents. Net re -
ceipts in primary income fell marginally by €0.2 
billion to €8.7 billion. Receipts contracted, par -
ticularly on account of lower dividend income 
from portfolio investments. The decline in ex -
penditure was somewhat weaker, which was 
also largely attributable to lower dividend pay -
ments.
Against the backdrop of market expectations 
of further interest rate reductions, cross- border 
portfolio investment saw funds in the amount 
of €10.8 billion net flow out of Germany in July 
2019, compared with €19.8 billion in June 
2019. This resulted mainly from the fact that 
domestic investors acquired foreign securities

group loans (€6.5 billion). On top of this, they 
boosted their equity capital in Germany (€1.7

equity capital (€2.2 billion) and granting intra-  
group loans (€2.0 billion).Other statistically recorded investment – which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these

The impact of wages on prices in Germany: 
evidence from selected empirical analyses
The impact of wages on prices has recently attracted a great deal of attention, both within aca -
demic circles and in the monetary policy debate. Despite the recent acceleration of wage growth, 
underlying inflation has risen only sluggishly, in Germany as well as in the euro area. This obser -
vation calls for a more precise analysis of the impact of wages on prices. In particular, the present 
investigation focuses not only on the scale of the impact, but also whether it might have dimin -
ished over time.
This article presents the results of selected empirical analyses examining the impact of wages on 
prices – a phenomenon known as pass- through – in Germany. On the basis of German firms’ cost 
structure data for 2016, the percentage share of labour costs in the sales of goods and services 
that are contained in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) is calculated. A compar -
able analysis is performed using input- output tables. Moreover, the impact of wages on prices is 
assessed based on a simulation using the Bundesbank’s macroeconometric model. Lastly, a struc -
tural time series model is employed to address the question of how the relationship has evolved 
over the period since 1970. Overall, the analyses indicate that the elasticity of consumer prices to 
a change in wages is currently around one- third. This means that a 1% increase in labour costs 
would ultimately push consumer prices up by around 0.3%. The econometric studies additionally 
show that the pass- through of wage changes to consumer prices takes place gradually over sev -
eral years.
Although the extent of the pass- through to consumer prices has diminished since the 1970s, there 
has been little change since the financial crisis of 2007-08 and, more recently, it has remained 
roughly stable. It must be taken into account, though, that such econometric studies of the pass- 
through typically focus on the cyclical component of inflation, i.e. deviations of the observed 
variables from their long- term trends.
The analyses indicate overall that the cyclical impact of wages on prices is still intact. Accordingly, 
the acceleration of wage growth in Germany over the past few years should, ceteris paribus, be 
reflected in a gradual rise in inflation.Deutsche Bundesbank

The multidimensionality 
of the impact of wages 
on prices
Wage dynamics are a central element in analys -
ing and forecasting price developments. The 
macroeconomic elasticity of price changes to 
changes in wages, however, is affected by a 
large number of factors and also depends on 
which wage and price variables are being 
examined.
In the theoretical model of a closed economy 
with perfect competition, where goods prices 
are set in line with marginal costs, goods prices 
rise or fall at the same rate as unit labour costs.1 
However, in the real world, changes in unit la -
bour costs are not necessarily passed through 
completely to price changes. This is because 
firms usually have a certain price- setting power 
and can set their prices somewhat higher than 
their costs. They therefore generally have the 
option of cushioning changes in unit labour 
costs by adjusting their mark- ups.2 This is espe -
cially the case where changes in prices are 
costly for firms because, for instance, the ad -
justments themselves involve additional costs 
or they have reason to fear a decrease in their 
market share.It should also be noted that the impact of unit 
labour costs on prices is not identical to the im -
pact of other wage variables, such as compen -
sation per employee or collectively agreed 
wages, as unit labour costs already reflect the 
results of endogenous adjustment processes. If, 
for instance, compensation per employee in -
creases, reducing mark- ups is not the only way 
for firms to cushion this rise in labour costs. An -
other option is to reduce labour demand, ei -
ther by cutting the average number of working 
hours or by laying off employees. This would 
increase measured labour productivity, with 
unit labour costs either rising less strongly or 
even remaining unchanged.3 At the same time, 
lower labour demand could lead to a contrac -
tion in aggregate demand, which puts down -
ward pressure on mark- ups and prices (pur -
chasing power character versus cost character 
of wages).4 The impact of wages and unit 
labour  costs on prices can thus be different.5Overview of

2 This holds, for instance, under monopolistic competition.
3 This holds wherever factors of production can be substi -
tuted, i.e. where labour input can be offset by higher cap -
ital input. Substitutability also depends on the scope of 
employment protection legislation.
4 In such a situation, mark- ups would behave pro- cyclically.
5 Gumiel and Hahn (2018) show, for instance, that wages 
and unit labour costs can respond differently to supply and 
demand shocks. For instance, following a demand shock, 
by the time the rise in unit labour costs peaks, growth in 
consumption per employee has already begun to contract.Deutsche Bundesbank

In general, the more labour- intensive produc -
tion is, the greater the impact of wages on 
prices.6 Since labour intensity of production 
can vary across sectors, the impact of wage 
changes on prices should vary by sector. Both 
the gross value added (GVA) deflator, which is 
often used in empirical studies to approximate 
the price of domestic production, and unit la -
bour costs are therefore aggregates of indus -
trial and services sectors with different wage 
structures and price- setting strategies.
The macroeconomic GVA deflator, however, is 
not the target variable of monetary policy. In 
the euro area, the target variable is the HICP , 
which can be approximated relatively closely by 
the consumption deflator. Unlike the GVA de -
flator, this deflator also contains prices of im -
ported consumer goods and inputs. These 
prices, however, are likely to be set largely in -
dependently of domestic labour costs, apart 
from those associated with domestic trading 
activities.7 The impact of domestic wages on 
consumer prices is accordingly likely to be 
smaller than that on the GVA deflator. In add -
ition, part of the goods produced domestically 
are not sold domestically but exported. As a re -
sult, associated (labour) cost changes might 
not necessarily be passed through to consumer 
prices.8 As a result, depending on the size of 
the variation of sectoral wage and price move -
ments, the pass- through of wages to the GVA 
deflator and to the HICP is likely to be different. 
The same conclusion holds for the pass- through 
to sub- components of the HICP .
Lastly, the impact of wages on prices and thus 
all the relationships described above are likely 
to be time varying, since the structure of the 
economy being studied is constantly chan -
ging.9 Examples of changing trends include 
(national and international) competitive pres -
sure, the global commodity price cycle and 
technology transfer, labour force mobility, 
unions’ bargaining power and firms’ ability to 
offshore, the monetary policy strategy and thus 
possibly inflation expectations, as well as the 
fiscal policy framework. These factors are likely to impact both on the pass- through of wages 
to prices and on their trend pattern.10
Against this backdrop, the present article exam -
ines the impact of wages on prices in Germany 
using a variety of wage and price variables as 
well as several different analytical approaches. 
Pass- through is in principle defined here as 
elasticity, i.e. the ratio of a percentage change 
in prices to a percentage change in wages. It is 
also important to distinguish between a static 
and a dynamic relationship between wages 
and prices. In the static context, price elasticity 
can be determined using statistical methods. 
By contrast, in a dynamic context, pass- through 
has to be estimated econometrically. This esti -
mation can account for macroeconomic feed -
back effects. Such feedback effects are taken 
into account, for instance, in the Bundesbank’s 
macroeconometric model, which is used for Sectoral

6 If perfect competition is assumed, it can theoretically be 
shown that the pass-  through of wages to prices corres -
ponds to the labour cost share (see the Annex on pp. 32 ff.).
7 By the same token, the cost situation of foreign firms and 
their price- setting strategies can be expected to play a 
stronger role.
8 The same holds for the prices of goods produced domes -
tically, which are classified as investment or government 
consumption. Although these are contained in the GVA de -
flator, they only feed into the consumption deflator via in -
puts, if at all.
9 For the United States, Peneva and Rudd (2017) find a de -
crease in the impact of wages on prices, whereas for the 
euro area (including Germany), Bobeica et al. (2019) gener -
ally find an unchangingly strong pass- through, which, 
however, is likely to be somewhat more moderate owing 
to the existing low inflation environment. Possible changes 
in the relationship between wages and prices are also very 
relevant to the monetary policy debate. To substantiate this 
point, at their press conference in March 2019 Draghi and 
de Guindos (2019a), for instance, pointed out that “we’ve 
got to be patient in terms of pass-through [from wages to 
prices] (…) because the mechanism whereby increasing the 
cost, wages and also other parts of the cost components 
are transferred into prices, has changed structurally in the 
last few years. You’ve seen this in the United States and 
you’re seeing this in Europe now”. They were referring 
there to the following statement in Yellen (2015): “move -
ments in labor costs no longer appear to be an especially 
good guide to future price movements” and: “the 
wage-price spiral no longer seems to provide a useful de -
scription of the U.S. inflation process”. At the same time, at 
their press conference in July 2019 Draghi and de Guindos 
(2019b) emphasised that “over the medium term under -
lying inflation is expected to increase, supported by (…) 
stronger wage growth”.
10 In other words, the relationships could also depend on 
the position of the business cycle and on the type of shock 
driving the wage change.Deutsche Bundesbank

preparing the macroeconomic forecasts for 
Germany that feed into the Eurosystem’s pro -
jections (see also the box on pp. 19 ff.).
In the first analysis, the share of labour costs in 
goods and services contained in the HICP is de -
termined for 2016 based on various firms’ cost 
structure data. This is used to derive conclu -
sions on the pass- through of wage changes to 
changes in consumer prices. The second analy -
sis presents the results of econometric analyses 
for the period since 1970. It addresses not only 
the pass- through of hourly wages to the con -
sumption deflator but also the effects on the 
GVA deflator. In addition, to facilitate compari -
son with various academic studies, the pass-  
through of unit labour costs to these two price 
variables is examined. This article also investi -
gates whether the estimated pass- through has 
diminished over time.
Firms’ labour cost shares 
as a proxy for the impact of 
wages on prices
A comparison of a firm’s labour costs with total 
sales provides an initial proxy for the pass-  
through of wages to prices. It is, in fact, pos -
sible to demonstrate theoretically that, under 
certain conditions, labour cost shares corres -
pond to the pass-  through of wages to prices 
(for more, see the exposition in the Annex on 
pp. 32 ff.). At the macroeconomic level, it must 
be noted here that – as mentioned in the pre -
ceding section – not all goods and services pro -
duced domestically are intended for private 
consumption. This means that, to start with, 
labour cost shares are calculated for individual 
firm and services sectors whose products are 
contained in the HICP .11 These shares are then 
weighted in accordance with the HICP basket 
of goods in order to ultimately determine the 
labour cost share of headline HICP . This share 
can then be understood as an indicator of 
pass- through of wages to consumer prices.12Data on the cost structure of firms in Germany 
are published annually by Germany’s Federal 
Statistical Office for some 70 sectors of the 
economy. The reporting entities range from 
those which manufacture prepared meals and 
dishes via furniture manufacturers to catering 
services providers. They mostly provide, on an 
annual basis, data about their expenditure on 
individual production components, such as 
purchased goods, raw materials used or 
wages.13 This wage expenditure and all other 
expenditure can be expressed as a percentage 
of total sales in that respective economic sector 
in order to determine labour cost shares and 
shares of other expenditure at a disaggregated 
level. At the same time, the difference between 
sales and the sum of all expenditure provides 
an approximation of the mark-ups tacked on to 
costs in the respective business sectors.14
The sectors of the economy for which cost 
data are available, however, are subject to a 
different statistical classification than goods 
and services, which are contained in the HICP 
basket of goods.15 In order to calculate the 
labour  cost share of the HICP , economic sectors 
have to be assigned to HICP components at the Various analyt -

11 In an ideal scenario, firm- level microdata would be used 
here; however, such data are not available.
12 Since the data are not available for all sectors and la -
bour cost shares in inputs and the share of imported goods 
can only be estimated, the result should be understood as 
a proxy.
13 See Federal Statistical Office (2019a) to (2019c). Wage 
expenditure includes remuneration and social security con -
tributions along with, where available, data on temporary 
work and wage labour.
14 The impact of foreign trade is largely excluded in this 
study. One factor omitted here is that part of the goods 
contained in the HICP is imported. With regard to these 
goods, which, directly and indirectly, account for around 
one- fifth of consumer spending, domestically paid wages 
are likely to matter only for trade. Another factor omitted 
here is that certain goods produced domestically are pri -
marily destined for export. The proxy for the pass- through 
of wages to prices was thus calculated under the assump -
tion that the labour cost share of the goods in a sector 
destined for sale domestically corresponds to the labour 
cost share of the goods of the same sector destined for a 
foreign market.
15 Whereas firms and service providers are classified ac -
cording to the Nomenclature statistique des activités 
économiques dans la Communauté européenne (Statistical 
classification of economic activities in the European Com -
munity (NACE)), HICP components fall under the classifica -
tion of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP).Deutsche Bundesbank

Transmission of wage changes to prices in 
the  Bundesbank’s macroeconometric model
A wage shock not only has a direct impact 
on goods prices through the changed cost 
situation resulting from the shock, it also 
has indirect effects. These include, in par-
ticular, the impact of higher wages on the 
labour market and the real economy. 
Amongst other things, these are relevant 
for the development of productivity and are 
therefore signifi  cant with regard to the ad-
justment process of prices to a new wage 
level.
Structural models, such as the structural 
vector autoregressive model (SVAR) in the 
main text, or semi- structural macroeco-
nomic models, such as the Bundesbank’s 
macroeconometric model, are suitable ana-
lytical instruments for taking account of 
these repercussions. For the long term, the 
central behavioural equations in this model 
are derived from neoclassical theory. In the 
short term, prices do not fully adjust, and 
the model behaviour is determined to a 
greater extent by the demand for goods. 
This model serves not only as a core instru-
ment for producing macroeconomic projec-tions for Germany – which feed into the 
semi- annual euro area forecasts by Eurosys-
tem experts that are published by the ECB 
in June and December1 – but it is also regu-
larly used for scenario analyses and policy 
simulations. This allows, for example, the 
effects of an assumedly exogenous rise in 
wages on consumer prices to be estimated. 
Here, in addition to the direct effects that 
are evident from the price variable behav-
ioural equations, the impact of wages on 
the labour market and components of ag-
gregate demand – which in turn have re-
percussions on price development  – can 
also be taken into account in the context of 
the full model.
In the price block of the econometric 
model, both the defl  ators of the expend-
iture components as well as various com-
ponents of the Harmonised Index of Con-
sumer Prices (HICP) are explained. Here, 
1 In this context, the model is chiefl  y responsible for 
merging the projections for the sub- aspects of the 
German economy into a coherent overall macroeco-
nomic picture.

wage variables feed in as determinants to 
varying degrees in each case. With regard 
to HICP , the more volatile components of 
energy and food as well as the HICP core 
components of services and industrial 
goods excluding energy are considered sep-
arately.2 Crude oil prices and agricultural 
producer prices in the EU are the respective 
key infl  uencing factors for the energy and 
food components of HICP . To explain the 
HICP core components and the defl  ators for 
investment and government consumption, 
Phillips curve equations3 expanded with 
esti mated long- term relationships are used. 
In this long- term relationship, the impact of key cost components on prices is captured 
through import prices ( Ptm) as well as unit 
labour costs (ULCt):
ln(Pt)=↵1+↵2ln(ULC t)+↵ 3ln(Pm
t)
+"t.
In this modelling framework, it is therefore 
assumed that wage infl  ation will not have 
an effect on prices over the long term pro-
vided that productivity rises to the same 
extent , so that the wage costs per unit pro-
duced remain unchanged.
Over the short to medium term, alongside 
the changes in import prices and unit labour  
costs, the level of aggregate capacity util-
isation (Xt) also affects price development. 
If required, additional explanatory variables 
(Zt), such as the interest rates on commer-
cial or residential mortgages as a measure 
of user cost of capital, are included:4
ln(Pt)=β1"t1+β2ln(ULC t)+
β3ln(Pm
t)+β 4Xt+β5Zt+ut.
Within the price block, a link between con-
sumer price movements according to HICP 
and the general domestic price trend is 
achieved fi  rst by including the defl  ator of 
aggregate domestic demand as a determin-
ant of the HICP core component. Second, 
in the behavioural equation for the defl  ator 
2 When modelling the individual price variables, an ad-
equate degree of homogeneity is desired on the one 
hand so that the price variables move largely in parallel 
in simulations over the long term. On the other hand, 
individual infl  uencing factors should also be given suf-
fi  cient consideration.
3 A detailed description of the Phillips curve approach 
and its application within the price projection can be 
found in Deutsche Bundesbank (2016).
4 The specifi  cation presented here is purely for illustra-
tive purposes. Any delays or modifi  cations to the dif-
ferent variables are not shown. In order to factor in 
any dependencies between the equations in the price 
system consisting of the defl  ators of investment, the 
HICP core components and the defl  ator of govern-
ment consumption, the short- term relationships are 
estimated using a system approach.Response of selected model variables

of private consumption expenditure, it is 
ensured that, in simulations, it develops 
broadly in line with aggregate HICP , com-
prising food, energy and the core compon-
ent.5
In order to investigate the degree of trans-
mission of wage changes to prices within 
the context of the model, a permanent ex-
ogenous rise in effective gross hourly wages 
paid6 of 1% over their baseline level was 
simulated.7 Here, no consideration is taken 
of the extent to which this wage infl  ation is 
refl  ected in negotiated wage rates and 
what proportion, if any, is attributable to 
wage drift, or of the causes of the rise in 
wages.8 Instead, the analysis focuses on the 
macroeconomic impact of an increase in 
wages paid by employers and on the trans-
mission channels that are relevant to price 
development.9
If the price block of the model is viewed in 
isolation, the higher gross hourly earnings 
lead to a rise in prices, which, according to 
the estimation of the behavioural equa-
tions, is subdued at fi  rst but gradually inten-
sifi  es over a number of years. At the same 
time, however, the simulations of the over-
all model account for employers responding 
to the higher wage costs by adjusting their 
demand for labour.10 The results show an 
immediate decline in total number of hours 
worked compared with the baseline level 
without the wage shock. However, as this 
response to higher wage costs itself lags 
behind the growth in hourly earnings, 
households’ disposable income initially 
rises. For a time, households use the add-
itional purchasing power to increase their 
consumption expenditure, with a portion 
going into savings. With the transmission of 
the wage shock to prices progressing in the 
second and third years of the simulation 
period, however, rising consumer price in-
fl  ation has a dampening effect on real earn-ings. The domestic price level, which in-
creases as a result of the wage shock, re-
duces price and cost competitiveness, caus-
ing exports to increasingly fall below their 
baseline level. In principle, the increased 
wage costs also constitute an incentive for 
enterprises to substitute labour with capital. 
Overall, however, this is outweighed by the 
impact of macroeconomic activity on in-
vestment, so the reaction is muted. Imports 
become more price competitive compared 
with domestic production on the one hand, 
5 It is also taken into account that fl  uctuations in en-
ergy prices are generally refl  ected to a lesser degree in 
the consumption defl  ator than in HICP .
6 There is no noteworthy effect on the outcome of the 
simulation if a rise in hourly employee wages that also 
include employer social contributions is implemented 
instead.
7 Here, it is assumed that wages rise due to an ex-
ogenous shock. Accordingly, possible causes for the 
increase in wages are not taken into account, and po-
tential repercussions on wages resulting from the re-
sponses of other macroeconomic variables following 
the wage shock are not factored in to the analysis. The 
role of different structural shocks in the transmission of 
wage changes to prices in the euro area was, for in-
stance, analysed on the basis of simulations using the 
ECB’s New Area- Wide Model (see European Central 
Bank (2018)).
8 In principle, it would be possible to use the central 
wage equation in the macroeconometric model to 
trace the root causes of a rise in wages negotiated by 
the bargaining parties. The specifi  cation used to model 
negotiated wages largely corresponds to the one pre-
sented in Deutsche Bundesbank (2018). In the model, 
it is assumed that effective gross wages and salaries 
paid move in line with negotiated wages over the long 
term, but deviations above the estimated behavioural 
equation are possible over the short to medium term. 
If effective wages experience stronger growth than ne-
gotiated wages – referred to as positive wage drift – 
this can, within the context of the model, be attribut-
able to the labour supply being more heavily utilised 
compared to the long- term observed average.
9 Furthermore, this analysis assumes that the macro-
economic effects of higher wages in Germany in the 
observation period do not cause any response in Euro-
pean monetary policy and that there is no reaction in 
bilateral exchange rates vis- à- vis the euro. This is in line 
with the analytical framework that is generally used for 
projections, in which interest rate and exchange rate 
movements are predetermined in the technical projec-
tion assumptions.
10 The higher potential earnings also incentivise 
households to expand their labour supply. This would 
have implications for labour force participation, the 
unemployment rate and thus feedback loops to 
wages, too. However, these do not feed into this 
assess ment, as the higher wage level is assumed as 
given.Deutsche Bundesbank

deepest possible level of disaggregation. It 
should be noted that, for goods in the HICP 
(food and non- energy industrial goods), the 
cost structure in both the production sector 
and in retail trade is relevant since this index 
reflects final consumer prices in retail trade.16 
Information on the labour cost share is avail -
able, on the whole, for more than half of the 
HICP basket of goods. Therefore, the coverage 
of goods, at four- fifths, is considerably greater 
than that of services, at one- third.17 If it is 
assumed , moreover, that the wage expenses 
are likely to be relatively low18 with regard to 
rents and energy, which together account for 
around one- fifth of the HICP , and these com -
ponents are factored into the analysis, HICP 
coverage of data on the cost structure rises to 
around two- thirds.
Thanks to the above classification of the labour 
cost shares of individual economic sectors, in 
keeping with the Federal Statistical Office’s cost 
structure survey, to the components of the HICP basket of goods, direct labour cost shares 
of the HICP and the HICP special aggregates19 
can be identified; however, these do not con -
tain the wage expenses resulting from inter -yet, on the other hand, are dampened by 
declining aggregate demand. As a whole, 
the simulation outcomes obtained using 
the macroeconometric model initially show 
an increase in gross domestic output as an 
immediate reaction to the wage shock. 
However, this drops below its baseline level 
as early as the second year.11 Since the de-
cline in the total number of hours worked is 
greater, productivity per hour rises at fi  rst.12 
This limits the impact of higher gross wages 
on unit labour costs and thereby on prices. 
This effect expires over the medium term, 
however, and unit labour costs exceed their 
benchmark to a similar degree as effective 
hourly earnings. In accordance with the 
elasticities in the behavioural equations for 
the individual price variables estimated for 
the macroeconometric model, the con-
sumer price level is, after four years, only 
around 0.3% higher than its baseline level 
without the wage growth. Consequently, price elasticity in relation to a wage shock 
would be only around 30%. In the event of 
a 1% wage shock, the annual rate of infl  a-
tion would thus be around 0.1 percentage 
point higher than in the baseline scenario in 
each year of the four years.
11 A monetary policy response to the higher infl  ation 
rate would amplify the decline in gross domestic prod-
uct compared to the baseline scenario. See Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2013).
12 The extent to which the reduced total number of 
hours worked would be accompanied by employment 
losses is dependent on whether and how the average 
number of hours worked per employee responds to 
the altered circumstances. If it falls as a result of lower 
demand, the response in the number of employees 
would be less pronounced than that accounted for in 
the total number of hours worked. The possibility of 
compensating by adjusting working hours is more 
likely in cases of temporary shocks and/ or good cyclical 
positions, for example.
16 To this extent, the labour cost share in the various sub -
sectors of retail trade is relevant. In addition, production 
sector goods, which likewise contain labour cost shares 
that can be derived from the production sector’s cost struc -
ture, also feed into retail trade’s “services purchased”.
17 On the whole, suitable economic sectors can be found 
for more than 80% of the food products contained in the 
HICP and for even as much as around 90% of the non-  
energy industrial goods contained in the HICP . In retail 
trade, which is downstream from production, a suitable 
classification can be found for a large share of industrial 
goods; however, the aggregate “retail sales of food prod -
ucts” must be used for all food products. In the case of 
services, the fact that data on “other services” are collected 
only every four years reduces the quantity of useful data. 
Assuming no distinct change in cost structures in two 
years, data for 2014 are used in this analysis for some ser -
vices subsectors (laundering and dry- cleaning, hairdressing 
salons and funeral parlours) in order to achieve a greater 
degree of coverage.
18 Data on wage expenditure in these areas are patchy 
and indicate very small values, such as, for instance, 4% in 
the manufacture of refined petroleum products or electric 
power generation.
19 These encompass energy, unprocessed and processed 
food, non- energy industrial goods and services.Deutsche Bundesbank

mediate products (see the chart on p. 24). In 
2016, these direct labour cost shares for both 
groups of goods (non-  energy industrial goods 
and food) accounted collectively for around 
one- fifth20 and were slightly higher in the pro -
duction sector than in retail trade.21 The labour 
cost share of sales is somewhat greater for ser -
vices, at one- quarter.22
The distribution of wage expenditure by HICP 
special aggregates ranges from 5% to over 
30% for food and from just over 10% to just 
under 50% for non- energy industrial goods23 
(see the chart on p. 25). The range of wage ex -

goods, is relatively small. Only the production Direct labour

20 For Australia, D’Arcy et al. (2012) find a labour cost 
share of one- fifth only for trade.
21 In the case of food and non- energy industrial goods, 
the production and retail trade sectors are aggregated by 
using the cost share for goods in retail trade as a weight of 
the production sector.
22 For services, where available, cost structure data for 
large firms (total sales of €250,000 and up) are used since, 
in this case, small firms can affect the overall data. Small 
firms are often run by the proprietors themselves or family 
members, who are not being paid for their work and 
whose “wages” therefore do not show up as part of wage 
expenses.
23 For goods, only the matches at the industrial producer 
level are taken into account, as fewer matches can be cre -
ated at the retail trade level. For instance, for the HICP food 
sub- index there is only one single match at retail trade 
level.Deutsche Bundesbank

of goods such as boats shows a significantly 
higher labour  cost share; the importance of this 
product for private consumption, however, is 
marginal. For services, the labour cost shares in 
the individual HICP areas are vastly more differ -
ent, ranging from 10% to over 50%. This re -
flects the highly diversified nature of the com -
ponents for services covered in the HICP . High 
labour cost shares are to be seen particularly in 
labour- intensive services such as hairdressing or 
dry- cleaning, yet these only make up a small 
portion of the basket of goods. By contrast, the 
labour cost share for services with a distinct 
weight in the HICP , such as telecommunica -
tions, amounts only to a little more than 10%.
However, the wage expenses directly contained 
in the HICP that have been calculated in the 
analysis thus far using cost structure data are 
likely to understate the actual figure. This is be -
cause firms purchase commodities and other 
resources in order to produce the final goods 
or services offered to the consumer. These 
intermediate inputs also entail wage expenses, 
which must be added to those already calcu -
lated. According to cost structure data, the 
labour  cost shares of intermediate goods pro -
ducers usually account for around one- quarter 
of sales. Significantly lower or higher values are 
rare. This labour cost share can be weighted by 
the expenditure on goods and raw materials obtained from the cost structure data. As the 
intermediate inputs themselves contain both 
direct and indirect labour cost shares, they are 
incorporated into the calculation at all stages 
of the production of final goods, ultimately 
yielding wage expenses of around 40%.24 
However, taking into account that calculations 
made using input- output tables reveal that 
around one- fifth of goods and raw materials 
are imported (for more information, see the 
box on pp.  26 ff.) and are thus largely inde -
pendent of the domestic wage setting, total 
wage expenses are likely to amount to closer to 
one- third.25
If the wage expenditure included in the HICP 
components of rents and energy, which is likely 
to be very low – accounting for roughly one-  
fifth of HICP – is also taken into consideration, 
then labour costs probably make up just under 
30% of headline HICP . The overall difference 
between goods and services is not very large, 
partly because many services that are relevant 
in the HICP are not traditional craft trade ser -
vice activities.26 Assuming that higher wages 
are fully passed through to prices, at least in 
the long term, price elasticity for wages can be 
expected to amount to around one- third, ac -
cording to the cost structure analysis.

The labour cost share of consumption: 
an analysis with input- output tables
Input- output tables1 provide comprehensive 
information on the interconnectedness of a 
country’s economy both nationally and 
internationally. This information may be 
used, amongst other things, to break down 
the value of household consumption ex-
penditure for the goods and services of 
each industrial sector into the components 
of net taxes, transport costs, and the nom-
inal contribution of production factors. This 
latter component comprises imported inter-
mediate goods, gross value added, taxes 
less subsidies, and international transport 
margins incurred during the production 
process. In this context, gross value added 
covers compensation of employees, mixed 
income, and capital income. The nominal 
shares of the labour and capital production 
factors in overall consumption expenditure 
may be interpreted, under certain condi-tions, as elasticity in consumer prices with 
regard to the individual factors.2
In a further step, information on the com-
position of the Harmonised Index of Con-
sumer Prices (HICP) and its sub- components 
can be derived from the composition of 
consumption according to the revenue 
account .3 Similar to the allocation of cost 
structure data in the main text, however, 
this requires the industrial sectors, accord-
ing to which consumption in the input- 
output tables is structured, fi  rst to be 
aligned with the composition of the HICP 
consumer basket by category of goods.4
1 The “World Input- Output Table” compiled by the 
World Input- Output Database (WIOD) is used here. For 
further information, see Timmer et al. (2015) and the 
website www.wiod.org
2 Under the assumptions presented in the Annex (see 
p. 32 ff.), wages in relation to turnover correspond to 
the elasticity of infl  ation with regard to wage growth. 
Given certain assumptions, the same relationship can 
be established for all other production factors.
3 With regard to the production- related linkages of in-
dividual categories of goods described in what are 
known as Leontief inverses, household consumption 
expenditure for a certain category of goods can be 
broken down entirely into the components of domes-
tic gross value added, direct and indirect imports, taxes 
less subsidies, and international transport margins. 
Contributions to the HICP special aggregates, for in-
stance, may be determined depending on how the 
categories of goods are aggregated.
4 The idea of breaking down household fi  nal con-
sumption expenditure into input factors is not new. 
Eurostat (2008), for example, points to the possibility 
of creating input- output tables for fi  nal consumption. 
However, there is no single approach to implementing 
this for the countries of the euro area. Nevertheless, in 
order to harness the information in the input- output 
tables for the analysis of price dynamics in Germany, 
the following methodology was applied: the linkages 
between the data on household fi  nal consumption ex-
penditure in the WIOD according to the classifi  cation 
of products by activity (CPA) and the classifi  cation of 
individual consumption by purpose (COICOP) were es-
tablished based on the COICOP 1999 and CPA 2008 
correspondence tables lists in Eurostat’s Reference And 
Management Of Nomenclatures (RAMON). The 
weights in the fi  nal consumption input- output tables 
were approximated using four- digit COICOP weights 
as well as other publicly available data. For Germany, 
the Federal Statistical Offi   ce published fi  nal consump-
tion input- output tables up to 2004.Breakdown of the HICP consumer basket

On balance, 62% of the input factors intro-
duced for the production of household 
consumer goods in 2014 can be traced 
back to gross value added within the Ger-
man economy. Taxes less subsidies and 
international transport margins make up 
14%. Just under a quarter were caused by 
direct and indirect imports, the proceeds of 
which thus benefi  ting non- residents. Ser-
vices had the largest share of gross value 
added, food products the largest share of 
imports, and energy the largest proportion 
of net taxes and transport margins.
As described in the introduction, individual 
input factors can be further differentiated 
using the information contained in the 
input- output tables. Within domestic gross 
value added, it is possible, for instance, to 
differentiate between employee compensa-
tion and mixed income on the one hand 
and capital income on the other. Retail and 
wholesale trade can also be differentiated. 
Looking at HICP services, for example, 
which have the highest share of gross value 
added among the HICP special aggregates, 
it can be seen that not even half of this 
gross value added is attributable to labour 
income. Consequently, the labour share in 
HICP services is only slightly higher than for 
food or non- energy industrial goods. This is 
because both of these special aggregates 
require an especially large amount of retail 
and wholesale trade, which is very labour- 
intensive. Only the labour cost share for the 
production of energy goods decreases sig-
nifi  cantly, at 18%.Breakdown of domestic gross value

longer period of time.27 In such a context, it is 
possible to estimate not only the level of pass- 
through, but also whether this relationship has 
changed over time. To this end, various struc -
tural vector autoregressive models (SVARs) with 
time- varying parameters, which take the inter -
dependencies of wages and prices into ac -
count, are estimated for Germany from 1970 
onwards.28 Both the deflator of private con -
sumption expenditure, which exhibits very simi -
lar time series characteristics to the HICP (the 
actual monetary policy target variable), and the 
GVA deflator, as the indicator of domestic price 
developments, are selected as price values. 
Both the impact of hourly wages and that of 
unit labour costs are examined.29 It should be 
borne in mind that the analysis addresses the 
interaction between the cyclical components of 
the variables under consideration; changes in 
longer- term relationships are not assessed.30
Beginning with an examination of the unit 
labour  costs and the GVA deflator (see the 
chart on p. 29), a fairly close correlation can be 
identified between their rates of change up to 
the mid-1990s. After this point, the correlation 
weakens, since the behaviour of profit mark-  
ups has changed over time. The SVAR esti -
mates confirm this visual impression.31 It ap -
pears that the pass- through of unit labour costs 
to the GVA deflator in the 1970s amounted to 
just over one- third after one year, increasing to 
a little over one- half after four years. Since the 
mid-1990s, however, the pass- through has de -
clined markedly. It currently accounts for less 
than one- third after one year, and after four 
years, it amounts to only two- fifths. Overall, 
the values of the empirically estimated pass-  
through are significantly lower than neoclas -
sical production theory would suggest. This is 
most likely due to the fact that, in this theory, 
profit mark- ups are not determined endoge -
nously.
However, a different picture emerges for the 
pass- through of hourly wages to the GVA de -
flator.32 Having remained relatively stable since 
the 1970s, it most recently amounted to around two- fifths after one year and roughly three-  
fifths after four years. The various degrees of 
pass- through of unit labour costs and hourly 
wages to the GVA deflator can be explained by 
breaking down the growth rate of the GVA de -
flator into hourly wages, hourly productivity 
and profit mark- ups. In principle, it may be as -
sumed that wage increases are reflected in 
higher prices, lower profit mark- ups or in -
creased productivity. Increases in productivity 
themselves result either in lower prices or 
higher wages, or are reflected in higher profit 
mark- ups. Against this backdrop, the SVAR an -
alysis indicates that the cyclical relationship be -
tween the GVA deflator and unit labour costs 
in Germany has become somewhat looser over 
the past few decades. However, this is not pri -
marily driven by wages, but rather by product -
ivity. Overall, the estimated pass- through of 
hourly wages is – in contrast to the implications

the period from the first quarter of 1970 to the first quarter 
of 2019 (data vintage: May 2019) are used for the analysis. 
Up to and including 1991, the data relate to western Ger -
many; from 1991 onwards, they relate to Germany as a 
whole. They were chain- linked and scaled in such a way 
that the annual average of the data for western Germany 
in 1991 corresponds with the annual average of the data 
for Germany as a whole.
28 The SVAR estimates with time- varying parameters are 
made with the help of the Bayesian Estimation, Analysis 
and Regression (BEAR) toolbox (see Dieppe et al. (2018)). 
All specifications take into account four lagged values of 
the endogenous variables.
29 Here, hourly wages are defined as the compensation 
received by employees per hour worked, and unit labour 
costs are defined as hourly wages relative to the real GVA 
per hour worked.
30 This means that the model- implied relationship be -
tween wage and price fluctuations from their respective 
stochastic trends is being examined. See also the box on 
p. 31.
31 The VAR model includes the annualised quarterly rates 
of change of unit labour costs and of the GVA deflator. The 
pass- through of unit labour costs to the GVA deflator is 
defined as a cumulated impulse- response function of the 
rate of change of the GVA deflator relative to that of unit 
labour costs following an identified shock to the latter.

of neoclassical production theory  – greater 
than that of unit labour  costs. This is presum -
ably due to the fact that the estimation ap -
proach based on hourly wages is less restricted 
in econometric terms than the unit labour 
costs- based approach, and therefore captures 
the changed behaviour of profit mark- ups more 
flexibly. This means that the pass-  through can 
be quantified more reliably.
In the case of the consumption deflator, the 
pass- through of unit labour costs has declined 
even more strongly than for the GVA deflator.33 
Since the 1970s, it has decreased from 10% to 
around zero after one year, and from 35% to approximately zero after four years. The pass-  
through of hourly wages to the consumption 
deflator has also declined. In recent years, 
however, it has been considerably greater than 
zero, and currently amounts to 10% after one 
year and 22% after four years.
Generally speaking, it appears that the pass-  
through to the consumption deflator is signifi -
cantly lower than the pass- through to the GVA 
deflator. There are three reasons for this: first, 
private consumption expenditure includes a 
significant proportion of imported goods, the 
prices of which are likely to be largely inde -
pendent of domestic wage developments. 
Second, estimates show that the pass- through 
of wages to the other deflators is higher than 
to the consumption deflator. Finally, it is the 
gross value added excluding taxes on goods 
which is being examined, whilst indirect taxes 
account for a substantial share of consumer 
prices.
The pass-  through of wages to prices changes 
very little if the estimations also use the un -
employment rate as a proxy for aggregate cap -
acity utilisation.34 In the context of the SVAR 
estimation, this merely affects the established 
stochastic trend of inflation (see the box on 
p. 31).
Conclusion and outlook
Overall, the results of the various analyses indi -
cate that the pass- through of wages to con -
sumer prices amounts to approximately one-  
third. A 1% change in wages thus results in a 
change of consumer prices by around 0.3%.

The stochastic trend of inﬂ  ation
The main text’s analysis using the structural 
vector autoregression (SVAR) model is based 
on data from 1970 through to the current 
year. Over this long period of almost 50 years, 
it is likely that changes to the underlying 
structural conditions will have been extremely 
signifi  cant as to how infl  ation has developed 
in Germany. These include, for instance, the 
reunifi  cation of Germany, the increasing 
global ties of the German economy, the rising 
competitive pressure due to globalisation, and 
the different monetary policy environment fol-
lowing the launch of the single monetary pol-
icy for the euro area. On top of this, there was 
the “Great Moderation”, a prolonged period 
starting in the mid-1980s during which infl  a-
tion rates fell signifi  cantly around the world.1
These kinds of changes in the underlying eco-
nomic conditions are typically refl  ected in 
changing trends in macroeconomic variables, 
such as the infl  ation rate. The SVAR approach 
used in the main text depicts such infl  uences 
as changes in the stochastic trends of the ana-
lysed variables produced by the estimated 
model. By contrast, the pass- through from 
wages to prices in this model refers solely to 
the interaction between the cyclical compon-
ents of wages and prices.2
The model shows that the stochastic trend of 
infl  ation in Germany – as measured by both 
the gross value added defl  ator and the private 
consumption defl  ator – saw a distinct decline 
in the period from 1970 to 1999. Since then, 
both stochastic trends have been relatively 
stable.
If the unemployment rate is included in the 
SVAR estimation as an approximation value for aggregate capacity utilisation, there is 
markedly higher variation in the stochastic 
trend of infl  ation over the medium term. This 
could mean that capacity utilisation had a 
major impact on the stochastic trend of infl  a-
tion. Conversely, the model could, at least in 
some cases, incorrectly attribute the strong 
cyclical fl  uctuations in the registered un-
employment rate to the trend.
The stochastic trend of the private consump-
tion defl  ator in both variants has remained 
relatively stable since 2002, with a growth 
rate of around 1½%. The trend of the gross 
value added defl  ator has stood slightly above 
this level in recent years. This likely refl  ects 
structural differences between the individual 
components of gross value added that are 
associ ated with different sectoral price trends.

trend in their analysis of the wage- price pass- through, 
but do not elaborate on it further. Bobeica et al. (2019)

econometric analysis of how they trend by adjusting 
both the wage and the price variables for infl  ation ex-
pectations.Stochastic trends in the annual rate of

However, it takes considerably longer than one 
year for the cyclical adjustment of prices to a wage shock to be largely complete. Examining 
the consumption deflator since 1970, there is 
some evidence to support the argument that 
the pass- through of wage shocks to prices has 
weakened in Germany. In any case, the decline 
has been only slight since the financial crisis of 
2007-08, and has come to a halt in recent 
times. In this context, it is also important to 
note that, since the start of the 2000s, the sto -
chastic trend of the inflation rate in Germany, 
which was determined using the SVAR model, 
has no longer been declining; rather, it has 
been trending sideways. The cyclical impact of 
wages on prices should therefore not be greatly 
affected by the estimated trend seen in recent 
times. With this in mind, there is much to sug -
gest that the above- average wage growth ex -
perienced in Germany over the past few years 
will result in a gradual rise in inflation.
Annex
The wage- price relationship in 
economic theory
The starting point for these considerations on the 
long- term wage- price relationship period is neoclas -
sical production theory.35 Assume that, in a model of 
an open economy, the aggregate of goods pro -
duced domestically by a representative firm Yt may 
be characterised by a Cobb- Douglas production 
function with constant returns to scale:36

where Nt denotes labour input, Kt capital input, Mt 
imported intermediate goods, and At total factor 
productivity.37 The nominal costs per unit of labour 
amount to Wt, the nominal costs per unit of capital 
Rt and the nominal costs per unit of imported inter -
mediate goods Ptm. It is additionally assumed that 
the representative firm behaves rationally, that all 
goods and factor markets are characterised by per -
fect competition and that there are no price rigid -
ities.
According to the first- order conditions for optimal 
labour input, nominal costs per unit of labour corres -pond in the long- term growth equilibrium to the 
marginal revenue product of labour.

where Pt describes the deflator of domestically pro -
duced goods. Alternatively, the ratio of the aggre -
gate nominal wage bill to sales of the goods pro -

city of labour.38
After solving expression (1) for the deflator Pt , taking

36 In- house analyses show that, in the short to medium 
term, a CES specification with a substitution elasticity that 
may diverge from 1 matches the aggregate production 
function of the German economy more closely than the 
Cobb- Douglas specification used here, which assumes a 
substitution elasticity of 1.
37 In this form of presentation, domestically produced 
intermediate goods are already reduced to the three basic 
input factors: labour, capital and imported intermediate 
goods.
38 This relationship serves as a justification for the calcula -
tions based on enterprises’ cost structure. In the analysis, 
the pass- through is defined as the wages to sales ratio.Deutsche Bundesbank

tained as a function of the growth rates of wages 
per unit of labour less labour productivity. Put differ -
ently, in a growth equilibrium, inflation corresponds 
to the growth rate of unit labour costs measured by 
the goods produced domestically.39

Consequently, in the long- term neoclassical equilib -
rium, unit labour costs and prices grow at the same 
rate. With regard to the impact of wages per unit of 
labour on prices, it should be noted, however, that 
labour productivity is likewise a function of factor 
prices that can be determined using conditional fac -
tor demand. Expressed in growth rates, this is writ -
ten as

Under perfect competition on the factor markets, 
the representative firm responds to a change in 
wages by substituting labour with capital or imports 
until labour productivity has returned to the higher 
wage level. This effect counteracts wage pressure on 
prices, which means that the elasticity or pass-  
through between labour costs and prices, as shown 
in Equation (4), merely corresponds to α1 < 1.
⇡t=lnAt+↵1lnWt
+↵2lnRt
+ (1↵1↵2)lnPm
t. (4)
In summary, it may be noted that neoclassical pro -
duction theory, under the assumption of perfect 
competition on the factor markets and the goods 
market, suggests that the pass- through between 
wages and prices should be determined in the long 
term by the ratio of the nominal wage bill to the 
value of the domestic supply of goods. The impact 
of changes in unit labour costs measured by domes -
tically produced goods on prices should, moreover, 
be greater than is the case for changes in wages.
This outcome does not change even if the assump -
tion of perfect condition is discarded and monopol -
istic competition with constant or exogenously vari -
able mark- ups is assumed. It is conceivable, how -
ever, that – especially over the short and medium 
term  – the identified relationships change if the 
mark- up in the model is endogenously determined in a time- varying manner.40 The pass- through can 
also change as a result of imperfections on the fac -
tor markets.41 In this respect, search and matching 
frictions capture a large number of market imperfec -
tions in the labour market, such as heterogeneities, 
information deficits or indivisibilities.42 In particular, 
it is assumed that labour input is not infinitely divis -
ible, as employees and employers first have to find 
each other in a time- consuming and resource-  
intensive manner.43 Although the model- based pass- 
through of costs per labour unit Wt to prices still cor -
responds to the above- described constant α1, the 
costs per labour unit Wt are composed of the wage 
per employee ωt, plus the expected search costs of 
hiring one employee κq(θt), less expected savings 
from not having to hire another employee in the 
next model period:44
Wt=!t+
q(✓t)(1σ)β
q(✓t+1). (5)
The function q(θt) here represents the aggregate 
ratio of advertised vacancies Vt to newly filled pos -
itions Mt while κ describes the costs of advertising a 
vacant position for one model period. Under the as -
sumption of a Cobb- Douglas matching function, the 
rate q is a function of labour market tightness θt, 
defined as the aggregate ratio of advertised vacan -
cies to the number of unemployed persons Ut. The 
expected savings on search costs – the last term in 
the above equation – additionally depends on the 
exogenous job separation rate σ as well as the time 
preference rate β.Pass- through of

40 For instance, modelling consumption patterns at the 
level of individual product varieties (deep habits) leads in 
equilibrium to countercyclical movements in firms’ mark-  
ups; see Ravn et al. (2006).
41 For the sake of simplicity, solely the impact of imperfec -
tions in the labour market is discussed below. For the im -
pact of imperfections in the financial markets, see, for ex -
ample, Brzoza- Brzezina et al. (2013).
42 See Pissarides (2000).
43 The following theoretical considerations are based on 
the model assumption that the representative production 
firm acquires labour input Nt on a frictionless market from 
a temporary employment agency at a price of Wt per unit. 
Following successful recruitment, the temporary employ -
ment agencies compensate the formerly unemployed 
workers with the wage ωt. See Christoffel and Kuester 
(2008).

According to Equation (6), the trend- adjusted, log-  
linearised and then differenced version of Equation 
(5), search costs may lead to the cost per unit of la -
bour not rising at the same rate as an increase in 
wages per employee.45 The pass- through of employ -
ees’ wages to prices is therefore reduced by the fact 
that, because of the search costs, wages per labour 
unit represent only a part of total labour costs.
In summary, it may therefore be stated that the 
model- based pass- through between wages per em -
ployee and the deflator of domestically produced 
goods depends on labour market search costs,46 the 
production elasticity of labour input, and, possibly, 
variations in the mark-  ups.47 Furthermore, search 
and matching theory makes it clear that – especially 
over the short to medium term – it is important to 
include labour market tightness in the empirical esti -
mations in order to control for the resulting variation 
in labour costs and to obtain an unbiased estimator 
of the wage- price pass- through.
Neoclassical production theory as well as search and 
matching theory explain the relationship between 
wages and prices solely in terms of the cost side. In 
this vein, there is no variable that explicitly repre -
sents fluctuations in aggregate capacity utilisation or 
aggregate demand, which –  especially over the 
short to medium term – have empirical relevance. If 
it is instead assumed in a New Keynesian modelling 
approach that rational firms are unable to adjust 
their prices frictionlessly and that the aggregate 
price level can therefore adjust only gradually, firms 
take into account not only current marginal costs 
but also future marginal costs in their price setting.48 
The optimal price Pt* is given by the weighted sum 
of future expected marginal costs λt:49

where Et denotes the expectation operator. If this 
relationship is rewritten and a price index is formed 
from the percentage (1 – θ) of enterprises that can 
adjust their prices in each period and the percentage 
θ of enterprises that are unable to adjust their 
prices,50 a simple New Keynesian Phillips curve is ob -
tained:⇡t=(ˆλtˆpt)+βEt[⇡t+1] (8)
Κ is what is known as the “slack” parameter. This 
indicates how strongly inflation – conditional on in -
flation expectations – responds to aggregate cap -
acity utilisation, which is usually measured as real 
marginal costs, the output gap, the unemployment 
gap or the unemployment rate. New- Keynesian the -
ory thus attributes the direct transmission channel 
between aggregate capacity utilisation and prices to 
price rigidities. A direct relationship between nom -
inal wages and the inflation rate does not exist in 
the simple New Keynesian model, however.51
The wage- price relationship in 
the national accounts
A relationship between wage or labour compensa -
tion and prices may likewise be derived from the na -
tional accounts. The starting point for this is gross 
value added (GVA), which is, by definition, the sum 
of compensation of employees and gross operating 
surplus, with the latter variable being composed of

ployee amount to roughly 19% of an average employee’s 
wage per month. This does not yet take account of any 
training costs that are incurred at the beginning of the em -
ployment relationship; see Silva and Toledo (2009). As the 
German labour market is more highly regulated, the cost 
per newly hired employee is likely to be higher in Germany. 
As a consequence of the more regulated labour market, 
however, the average length of time an employee in Ger -
many stays in a single job is longer than it is in the United 
States (see Hertweck und Sigrist (2015)). For this reason, 
such costs tend not to be paid as frequently in Germany as 
in the United States.
47 These factors also apply to gross value added, but not 
to the aggregate demand deflator. In this case, the pass-  
through is also reduced by the share of imports. This also 
applies to its individual components, such as the consump -
tion deflator.
48 See Calvo (1983) or Rotemberg (1982) for an alternative 
modelling of price rigidities.
49 For any given variable xt, its percentage deviation from 
the long- term stationary equilibrium is defined as ^xt = ln xt 
– ln ¯x. This assumes that ¯x is stationary either inherently or 
in efficiency units.
50 The price index is formed as follows:    
Pt= [(1✓)(P⇤
t)1−"+✓(Pt−1)1−"]1
1",  
where –ε describes the price elasticity of demand.
51 In an extended New Keynesian model with unemploy -
ment and wage indexation, it is possible to show that the 
wage growth rate depends directly on the inflation rate as 
well as the unemployment rate and, therefore, a direct re -
lationship between wages and prices does exist; see Galí 
(2011).Deutsche Bundesbank

operating surplus/ mixed income, net taxes on pro -
duction, and depreciation less net taxes on goods 
and services:
GVA=W+S+NPATXS+| {z }
gross operating surplus ( GOS ).
If the ratio of gross operating surplus (GOS ) and 
employee compensation (W ) is denoted by μ , there 
results for the GVA deflator (GVAd ), i.e. the ratio of 
nominal and price- adjusted value added:
GVAd=GVAn
GVAr=W
GVAr(1 + µ).
inflation measured in terms of the GVA deflator in -
flation thus corresponds to the sum of the growth 
rates of unit labour costs (ULC ) and the mark- up:
⇡GVA
t=lnW tlnYt| {z }
lnULC t+lnµ t.
In the hypothetical case of constant mark- ups, the 
growth rate of the GVA deflator – just like the rate 
of price increase of the supply of goods in neoclas -
sical production theory – corresponds to the growth 
rate of the associated unit labour costs. In order to 
create a relationship between employee compensa -
tion and the private consumption deflator, the ex -
penditure identity of GDP (GDP ) is used. Following 
this, GDP corresponds to the sum of private final 
consumption expenditure (C ), general government 
spending (G ), investment (I ), and the external bal -
ance (X-IMP ). Furthermore, in line with the income 
account, GDP is produced by gross value added plus 
net taxes on goods (TXS ):
GDPTXS=C+I+G+XIMPTXS
=GVA.
Dividing the equation by real gross value added, 
the GVA deflator is found as the weighted sum of the deflators of the individual expenditure compon -
ents:
 
 
 
 GVAd=Cr
GVArCd
+(G+I+X−TXS)r
GVAr ⇥
(G+I+X−TXS)d−IMPr
GVArIMPd.
Transposing the equation after the consumption de -
flator (Cd) and substituting the GVA deflator gives
Cr
GVArCd=ULC (1 +µ)+IMPr
GVArIMPd
−(G+I+X−TXS )r
GVAr
⇥(G+I+X−TXS )d. (9)
It should be noted that this relationship is true in 
terms of the level and not in logarithms. Following a 
number of transformations, this results in
lnCd= lnULC + ln(1 + µ)lnCr
GVAr
+ ln 
GVA +IMP
GVA!
ln 
GVA +IMP
GVA +IMPXCIMP!
, (10)
where XCIMP  = G + I +X –TXS  denotes all other 
aggregate demand. The sum of the first two terms 
on the right- hand side of this equation corresponds 
to the GVA deflator. The other three summands re -
flect the difference between the deflator of private 
consumption expenditure and the GVA deflator. The 
first of these summands is the inverse real consump -
tion ratio. The second summand contains the impact 
of import prices. The last term reflects the fact that 
the prices of other expenditure components may dif -
fer from those of consumer goods and it also cap -
tures the impact of taxes on goods and services on 
the deflators of the expenditure components.Relationship

State government budgets:  
analysis of detailed results for 2018
State government finances have been in good shape in recent years. Last year saw their core 
budgets close with a surplus of €13½ billion. In structural terms (that is, particularly after adjust -
ing the outturns for financial transactions and cyclical effects) and adding off- budget entities and 
local government, the surplus came to as much as €33½ billion, which is €9½ billion higher than 
the 2017 outturn. Every federal state showed a structural surplus.
That said, major differences still persist among the federal states. Low interest rates are easing the 
added strains imposed by above- average debt. Even so, widely differing interest expenditure is 
still clearly a major factor. Only some of Germany’s state governments are spending less on other 
fiscal items or generating higher revenue in order to fully offset their heavier interest burden. Tax 
revenue levels remain within a relatively narrow range among the non- city states, as they do for 
the city states, thanks to the large-  scale redistribution of revenue under the state government 
revenue- sharing scheme. This scheme makes allowance for the city states having additional 
needs. Against this background, they have far higher levels of revenue and expenditure relative 
to the size of their populations.
The available financial statistics data have been specifically prepared to better detect how each 
state government’s revenue, expenditure and fiscal balances evolved last year. The data used 
should nevertheless be interpreted with caution. For example, financial transactions (such as 
acquisitions of equity) are defined too broadly in some instances, producing structural outturns 
which sometimes overstate the economic reality. This matters, not least because of the debt 
brake, which is generally based on these structural indicators. All in all, a great deal still needs to 
be done to improve the underlying statistical data, such that the results they deliver are more 
informative and more readily comparable across federal states. The onus here is particularly on 
the Stability Council, which plays a crucial role in fiscal surveillance in Germany.Deutsche Bundesbank

State government fiscal data 
and their comparability
The Bundesbank’s Monthly Report comments 
every three months (in February, May, August 
and November) on how state government 
budgets as a whole are performing. This is 
based on the monthly cash figures for the core 
budgets. Equivalent data on off- budget gov -
ernment entities and local government are not 
available until a later date.
An article in the October 20181 edition of the 
Bank’s Monthly Report gave a more detailed 
account of fiscal developments in the individual 
federal states, with the data used there having 
been prepared specifically for this purpose. The 
Bank now intends to make summaries of the 
previous year’s budget outturns and a com -
mentary on selected aspects a regular feature 
in its Monthly Report – starting with the present 
article on developments in 2018. The aim here 
is to present the outturns in a more informative 
and harmonised manner, such that the data 
better reveal how fiscal results have evolved 
over time and across state governments. These 
regular articles will include off- budget entities, 
reclassify some expenditure and revenue items 
and adjust the fiscal data to take account of 
special factors with a particular focus on “ad -
justed structural outturns”, which are calcu -
lated as follows:2
– Entities which are not included in the core 
budget but form part of the government 
sector (off- budget entities) and local govern -
ment are assigned to the respective state 
government to take account of the fact that 
federal states transfer tasks to these entities 
to a varying extent. Off-  budget entities in -
clude reserves for infrastructure develop -
ment and civil servant pensions, higher edu -
cation institutions and construction units, 
but not market- oriented enterprises under 
state ownership. Furthermore, including 
local government makes the non- city states 
more readily comparable with the city states, which always include this level of govern -
ment in their calculations.
– Financial transactions reported in the finan -
cial statistics are excluded from the outturns. 
Fundamentally, financial transactions merely 
reallocate financial assets, which means that 
they are, in effect, budget- neutral. For ex -
ample, cash expenditure in the form of a 
loan (= increase in receivables) or cash rev -
enue from the sale of shares in an undertak -
ing (= reduction in equity holdings) is disre -
garded, so it leaves the balance unchanged. 
Many debt brakes (including that of central 
government) adjust for financial transactions 
in much the same way. The national ac -
counts, which form the basis for calculating 
the Maastricht deficit, likewise exclude 
finan cial transactions from the fiscal bal -
ance. However, unlike the financial statistics, 
the national accounts do not closely follow 
the classification in the budget, but instead 
reflect the economic nature of the transac -
tions. For example, if a federal state offsets 
repeated losses at an entity, the national ac -
counts would post a deficit- increasing trans -
fer, even if the budget reports this as an ac -
quisition of equity (financial transaction) (see 
also p. 41 and pp. 44 f.). Appropriate and 
desirable as such adjustments may be, they 
need to be examined more thoroughly on a 
case- by- case basis, which would go beyond 
the scope of this article.
– Financial statistics data include the state 
government revenue- sharing scheme with 
all the cash flows during the reporting year. 
In this article, the data are adjusted for the 
lagged settlement of payments under the 
scheme. These settlement payments are 
posted to corresponding reporting years on 
an accruals basis so as to eliminate distor -
tions in cross- state comparisons and over 
time.Quarterly

– Data are adjusted for cyclical effects, render -
ing them more comparable over time. This is 
done using the Bundesbank’s cyclical adjust -
ment procedure, which is currently based on 
the spring 2019 macroeconomic forecast. As 
a result of this, the state government out -
turns are also comparable with each other, 
which is not the case with the debt brake 
surveillance work of the Stability Council.3
– Data should ideally also be adjusted for any 
sizeable one-  off effects (relative to the 
budget volume of the federal state in ques -
tion). Otherwise, they will overshadow 
underlying developments. Suitable data are 
available only for the core state government 
budgets in 2018 (monthly cash statistics of 
the Federal Ministry of Finance). However, 
adjusting the data for these payments will 
probably eliminate the most substantial one- 
off effects.
Yet for all such adjustments, the underlying 
data still have some shortcomings, and these 
also make it more difficult to compare the cal -
culated fiscal balances. One common short -
coming is the absence of key information, 
which prevents the data from reflecting eco -
nomic substance as rigorously as the national 
accounts figures (which are not available at a 
federal state level). More needs to be done on 
this front, then, to boost the informative value 
of the data. The onus here is particularly on the 
Stability Council, given its role in monitoring 
compliance with the national debt brakes and 
the EU fiscal regime in Germany. This function 
ought to make the Council especially keen to 
have a comprehensive and comparable set of 
underlying data, since they are, after all, used 
for the reports on the budgetary situation and 
the fiscal forecasts on which the Council’s deci -
sions are based. The independent advisory 
board of the Stability Council, whose members 
include an expert from the Bundesbank, has re -
peatedly called for improvements to the data 
quality.4Budget outturn of federal 
states as a whole
Core state government budgets posted a sur -
plus of €15½ billion in the monthly statistics at 
year- end 2018. Later closing entries reduced 
this figure to €13½ billion. Many federal states 
topped up their reserves with the closing en -
tries, which in turn boosted the surpluses of 
off- budget entities. The latter closed the year 
on aggregate with a surplus of €6½ billion. 
Local government likewise recorded a high 
cash surplus of €9½ billion. Altogether, the sur -
plus for state and local government came in 
total to €29½ billion (see the table on pp. 42 f., 
number 15). This was €7½ billion up on the fig -
ure for 2017 (see the table on pp. 48 f., num -
ber 1).

– that is, after adjustment for financial transac -
tions, and cyclical and one- off effects – is more 
favourable still.… eliminate

Financial transactions weighed heavily on the 
outturn. The standard budget categories under 
the financial statistics framework showed a net 
burden to the tune of almost €10 billion (see 
the table on pp. 42 f., number 2). Eliminating 
such transactions leaves a reported surplus of 
€39½ billion, i.e. €11½ billion more than in the 
previous year. This is a case in point with regard 
to shortcomings in the underlying statistical 
data. From an economic vantage point, part of 
the adjustment item does not represent a shift 
within financial assets, which means that it 
should not be considered as a financial transac -
tion. Half of the reported net burden from 
finan cial transactions was due to guarantees in 
respect of HSH Nordbank, for example. But this 
ultimately constitutes an absorption of loss. 
Probably, other losses recorded by unprofitable 
entities have been absorbed and posted in the 
financial statistics as an acquisition of assets, 
too. At all events, the recognition of the guar -
antees in the financial statistics will be im -
proved as from the 2019 reporting year. From 
now on – as in the national accounts – they 
will no longer be posted as financial transac -
tions.
The cyclical component provided continuing 
tailwinds for state government finances in 
2018, coming in at €4½ billion (see the table 
on pp. 42 f., number 5), which was only slightly 
up on the previous year’s figure.6 The balance 
adjusted for the cyclical component declined 
accordingly.
The cyclical component identified here differs 
significantly, in some cases, from the figures 
calculated by numerous federal states using 
their own cyclical adjustment procedures. In 
particular, the tax- smoothing procedures are 
less suited to eliminating cyclical effects and 
thus bringing structural growth trends to light. 
Added to this is the fact that differences in the 
specific methods employed by the individual 
federal states make it all but impossible to 
compare the results properly.7In 2018, two car makers were ordered to pay 
fines totalling €2 billion into the state govern -
ment budgets of Lower Saxony and Bavaria. 
The Federal Ministry of Finance reports these 
amounts as significant one- off effects (see the 
table on pp. 42 f., number 6).8 Similar one- off 
effects were not listed for earlier years, nor are 
any such effects immediately apparent, which 
is why no further adjustments were made to 
the outturn for 2017.
Overall, then, the budgetary situation in the 
federal states (and their local governments) 
was exceptionally good last year. Adjusted for 
the aforementioned factors, the structural sur -
plus (see the tables on pp. 42 f., number 7 and 
pp. 48 f., number 7) rose significantly, climbing 
from €24 billion in 2017 to €33½ billion in 
2018 (1.0% of GDP). The €1½ billion decline in 
the interest burden played no more than a 
minor part in this improvement. The adjusted 
structural primary surplus (that is, the structural 
fiscal balance adjusted for the net interest bur -
den; see the table on pp. 48 f., number 9) in -
creased by €8 billion.
2018 outturns in individual 
federal states
Given this exceptionally favourable overall out -
turn, all the federal states registered an ad -
justed structural surplus for the first time (see 
the table on pp. 42 f., number 7; to improve 
comparability across federal states, the vari -
ables in question are shown on a per inhabitant 
basis).9 Every state government posted a strong

6 Compared with the data reported in the October 2018 
edition of the Monthly Report, the cyclical component in 
2017 is €3 billion higher due to revisions.
7 Federal states’ cyclical adjustment procedures are dis -
cussed in Deutsche Bundesbank (2017), p. 38 and p. 41.
8 The aforementioned guarantee charges for HSH Nord -
bank are also shown there, but they have already been 
eliminated due to their classification as financial transac -
tions.

achieving by far the strongest result, which was 
three times the German average, while North 
Rhine-  Westphalia was at the other end of the 
table, at roughly two- thirds of the national ref -
erence figure. Results were somewhat better in 
Bremen, Saarland and Brandenburg.
The statistical difficulties discussed above are 
also an issue when it comes to comparing data 
across federal states. For instance, some out -
turns are overstated in cases where financial 
transactions that were eliminated on the ex -
penditure side were not used to acquire assets 
of value. Also, a lack of data means that it is 
not possible to adjust for any one- off effects at 
the local government level or in off- budget en -
tities.
For an illustration of these problems, one need 
only look at Bremen and Saarland, two federal 
states which receive consolidation assistance 
on condition that they limit their structural def -
icit. Bremen, for example, made a large capital 
injection into a hospital enterprise in 2018. This 
transaction is recognised in the city state’s 
budget – and in the financial statistics based on 
those data – as an acquisition of equity. How -
ever, that equity is not expected to generate an 
adequate return in the form of profit distribu -
tions or capital appreciation. This is why this 
transaction does not represent an acquisition 
of financial assets under the rules for Germa -
ny’s national accounts but, instead, constitutes 
a capital transfer that affects the fiscal balance. 
In Saarland, meanwhile, the state theatre 
(Theater  Saarbrücken) has been receiving cap -
ital injections for many years to offset its losses. 
Apparently, these capital injections are none -
theless being posted as acquisitions of equity in 
the reported state government core budget fig -
ures.10 In principle, capital transfers used to ab -
sorb losses should already be recorded as such 
in the financial statistics.
Another example may be found in North Rhine- 
Westphalia, where major guarantee calls by the 
former WestLB were apparently routinely 
posted as financial transactions (loans) on a number of occasions in the past, even though 
no financial assets of value were acquired as a 
result. The same goes for the aforementioned 
guarantee call in connection with HSH Nord -
bank in Hamburg and Schleswig- Holstein. 
Starting this year, however, guarantee calls will 
be recognised in the financial statistics in the 
same way as they are shown in the national 
accounts, i.e. as capital transfers. This means 
they will affect the structural outturn.

discussed at greater length in the box on pp. 51f.

that adjusts the structural outturns for any con -
solidation assistance (granted only on a tem -
porary basis). Applying the same approach to 
Saarland would shrink that federal state’s ad -
justed structural surplus to a smaller residual, 
while Bremen would post a distinct deficit.
Debt levels and interest 
burdens  vastly different
Expenditure on interest varies a great deal from 
one federal state to another (see the table on 
pp. 42 f., number 13, and the chart on p. 46), 
mainly because they each have different levels 
of debt (see the table on pp. 42 f., number 22). 
At the end of 2018, for instance, per capita 
debt was almost four times the national aver -
age in Bremen, but less than one- third of the 
national reference figure in Bavaria and Saxony.
Most federal states paid down a notable vol -
ume of debt in 2018 (see the table on pp. 48 f., number 22). Bremen, by contrast, saw a further 
marked increase in its level of debt, even 
though it had no fiscal deficit to cover. Bremen 
did, however, assume the debt of one institu -
tion of higher education, a transaction which is 
recognised as a capital transfer in the national 
accounts but not recorded at all on the ex -
penditure side of the financial statistics. But this 
fact alone fails by some margin to explain the 
growth in Bremen’s stock of debt. Indeed, it 
would appear that Bremen, facing an impend -
ing need for temporary funding, took out add -
itional (mostly non- interest- bearing) cash ad -
vances. Debt levels rose somewhat more 
quickly still in Hamburg, chiefly because the 
guarantees issued in respect of HSH Nordbank 
were credit- financed. At the same time, it 
would appear that funds were set aside. With 
the exception of Hesse and North Rhine-  
Westphalia, the fiscal balance (see the table on 
p.  42 f., number  1) will have overstated the 
evolution of debt levels. Hesse saw its debt de -
cline largely owing to the debt relief that was 
provided by the state- owned WIBank for cash 
advances taken out by local government. In ef -
fect, responsibility for this debt has been trans -
ferred to a newly established off- budget entity 
(the “Hessenkasse”). However, owing to the 
structure chosen, the underlying debt statistics 
used here (Federal Statistical Office, Fachserie 
14, Reihe 5) no longer include this debt, though 
they do draw attention to this fact.12
Local governments in other federal states are 
still highly indebted with cash advances in 
some cases. The federal states of Saarland, 
Rhineland- Palatinate and North Rhine-  
Westphalia, for instance, have outstanding 
local government cash advances of well above 
€1,000 per capita on average. In July, as a con -
clusion from the work of the Commission on 
Equivalent Living Conditions, the commission 
members from the Federal Government floated

cross- state consensus being reached, which 
appears unlikely at present. Ultimately, the 
onus of responsibility for local government 
finances  is not on central government, but on 
the individual federal states. The latter oversee 
local government budgets and run the local 
government revenue- sharing scheme. The posi -
tive fiscal situation in the federal states should 
make it easier for them to quickly roll out pro -
grammes like the one in Hesse.
Like debt levels, there are also variations in the 
calculated average rates of interest (see the 
table on pp. 42 f., number 23) paid by the state 
governments, although such differences are of 
less significance. It would seem that such aver -
age interest rates are not founded on risk pre -
miums charged for exceptionally high levels of 
debt – rather, the key factors are differences in 
interest rate fixation periods, in the percentage 
of loans taken out during years when rates 
were low, and in hedging operations.
High debt servicing costs can look somewhat 
less substantial when they are offset by returns 
on assets. The resulting net interest burden 
shows interest expenditure less interest income 
(there is no adjustment for other returns on 
assets, such as dividends, because they are not 
reported consistently as a separate item in the 
financial statistics). As shown in the table on 
pp.  42 f., number  8, the net interest burden 
was in fact slightly negative in Bavaria and only 
slightly positive in Saxony, while at the other 
end of the scale, Bremen was quite some way 
behind Saarland, despite its high interest in -
come. The figure for Berlin is also well above 
the average. By contrast, Hamburg’s sizeable 
interest income offset some of the city state’s 
high interest expenditure.
Federal states faced with higher interest bur -
dens turned out to be more frugal elsewhere in 
their budgets last year. This explains why the 
adjusted structural primary balances (i.e. the 
structural balance excluding the net interest 
burden, see the table on pp. 42 f., number 9) 
were mostly better for those federal states with Risk premiums

higher interest burdens. This primary surplus 
was highest in the city states, with Hamburg 
ranking first. Of the non-  city states, Saarland 
posted the best figure.13 On the other hand, 
there are the federal states with small interest 
burdens. In this category, Saxony recorded the 
smallest adjusted structural primary surplus, 
closely followed by Brandenburg and Bavaria.
Changes compared with 2017
The adjusted structural balance for Germany’s 
federal states as a whole improved by just over 
€110 per capita compared with 2017 (see the table on pp. 48 f., number 7).14 There was a 
very broad spectrum of outturns across the 
federal states, however, with Hamburg’s 
strongly improved balance proving to be a par -
ticularly striking feature and with Berlin suffer -
ing the strongest deterioration. On balance, 
the outturn in those federal states with below- 
average figures for 2017 showed a somewhat 
stronger improvement.
There are a variety of reasons why some federal 
states fared better than others. Berlin, for in -
stance, saw what was by far the strongest 
growth in personnel expenditure (see the table 
on pp.  48 f., number  11), with a move that 
brought, in particular, Berlin salary levels closer 
to the national average. Second, Berlin’s fixed 
asset formation also increased exceptionally 
strongly (see the table on pp. 48 f., number 15) 
after many years of low spending in this area. 
And, third, like in the new federal states, there 
were lower central government grants for in -
frastructure reconstruction in eastern Germany, 
which left the outturns worse off than in the 
previous year.
Hamburg, by contrast, benefited from consid -
erably higher revenue, with tax revenue (ad -
justed for payments under the state govern -
ment revenue-  sharing scheme and for later 
settlements, see the table on pp. 48 f., num -
ber 18) playing the biggest part in this. Adjust -
ments to multipliers for real estate tax and 
trade tax or a higher real estate acquisition tax 
were immaterial in this regard (see the table on 
pp. 48 f., numbers 24 to 26). Another source of 
relief for Hamburg was the decline in adjusted 
primary expenditure (see the table on pp. 48 f., 
number  16a), which was mainly due to de -
creasing fixed asset formation.Structural bal -

Diffi   culties in analysing consolidated data
In its 2006 “Berlin judgement”, the Federal 
Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungs-
gericht, BVerfG) was critical of the offi   cial 
fi  nan cial statistics.1 Partly in response to 
this, the Federal Statistical Offi   ce has re- 
included government entities hived off from 
the core budgets (off- budget entities).2 
Data on expenditure and revenues as re-
quired by law are collected from these 
entities  for the fi  nancial statistics, but other 
accounting systems, such as commercial 
double- entry bookkeeping, are often used. 
The available information must then be re-
classifi  ed to fi  t into the required fi  nancial 
statistics categories, and in some cases sim-
plifying assumptions need to be made. 
Moreover, the classifi  cation systems used 
for the core budgets do not draw a clear 
distinction between payments to off- budget 
entities and those to market- oriented public 
companies (and return fl  ows from such 
entities ). This creates a state of affairs in 
which payment fl  ows between the entities 
of a federal state might not be correctly 
consolidated in all cases, meaning that fi  g-
ures are then overstated.
Financial statistics reclassify payments in 
some areas in order to avoid errors. For ex-
ample, transfers to off- budget entities for 
pension provision, which are booked as 
personnel expenditure in the budgets, are 
adjusted accordingly.
There is no direct consolidation of transfers, 
however. This means transfers reported in 
the core budgets and off- budget entities 
are likewise aggregated if they are intra- 
entity transfers. In this respect, the consoli-
dated result for the transfers is overstated. 
Only the overarching budget category (i.e. 
current or capital revenue and expenditure) 
is consolidated. The outturn of this over-arching category is thus less than the sum 
of the subcategories.
In principle, the above- mentioned consoli-
dation of the overarching categories is 
based on information taken from the rev-
enue side.3 This can lead to additional prob-
lems. If, for instance, a local government 
records revenues from one of its one- off 
entities, this amount is deducted from the 
revenue of the core budget and an equal 
amount subtracted from the corresponding 
expenditure group of the off- budget entity. 
The consolidation therefore does not change 
the local government’s total balance. It is, 
however, conceivable that the correspond-
ing expenditure in the off- budget entity 
was recorded  in a different manner or at a 
different time. In this case, the consolidated 
superordinated group for expenditure would 
be understated. The total expenditure is 
reduced  even though no expenditure to be 
consolidated was recorded. If, however, 
revenues from other government entities 
are not recognised as such, the consoli-
dated expenditure and revenue groups are 
overstated. This is to be expected for fee 
revenues from other government entities. 
For the majority of recipients, no distinction 
is made as to whether such fees originate 
from an intra- government payment or from 
third parties.
1 See BVerfG, 2 BvF3/ 03, paras 204 and 58.
2 However, the reporting population is subject to 
repeated  change caused by spin- offs, mergers, liquid-
ation of off- budget entities and sectoral reassign-
ments. In this respect, it is not always easy for ac-
counting departments to recognise whether or not a 
transaction partner is allocated to the government 
sector. Ultimately, it would appear to make sense for 
the accounting system to assign the units automatic-
ally using a public register.

Detailed data on payments between state en -
tities are vital for preventing errors in the con -
solidated view of individual budget categories. 
Saarland’s capital spending is a case in point. 
Due to shortcomings in the data, the financial 
statistics reported a negative aggregate figure 
for the (consolidated) federal state level. This 
means that expenditure developments during 
the reporting year were understated accord -
ingly. This did not distort the fiscal balance, 
however (see the box on pp. 51 and 52).15
Selected aspects
The state government revenue- sharing scheme 
and supplementary general central government 
transfers are intended to minimise differences 
in per capita financial capacity between the 
federal states. Local government tax revenue is 
included up to 64% (with adjustments being 
made for the use of differing multipliers). Fur -
thermore, the population of city states is given a 35% higher weighting. If the accruals- based 
tax revenue (see the table on pp. 42 f., num -
ber 18 and the chart on p. 50) is considered 
only for the non- city states, the differences re -
maining under the revenue- sharing scheme 
are, in fact, moderate.16 Thus, Hesse17, which 
yields a particularly high revenue, was 5½% 
higher than the figure for the non-  city states, 
and Saxony and Saxony-  Anhalt were 7% below Decline in 
spending in 
Saarland over -

State govern -
ment revenue- 
sharing scheme 
largely levelling 
out tax revenueIn principle, fi  scal balance errors can also 
arise from payment fl  ows within a state. For 
example, sometimes apparently no expend-
iture was recorded in the fi  nancial statistics 
if an off- budget entity transferred a profi  t 
to the core budget, provided this transac-
tion was not recorded in the income state-
ment. This meant that a revenue was re-
corded in the core budget but that the off- 
budget entity did not book any expenditure 
and thus the (consolidated) balance ap-
peared too favourable. On the other hand, 
compensation payments from the core 
budget to off- budget entities were also ap-
parently not always recognised as income 
in the latter, which resulted in the consoli-
dated result  being understated. Such 
sources of error appear to have been effect-
ively rectifi  ed in the meantime.
The bottom line is that, in spite of progress 
in some areas, the adjustment of state out-turns for payments between government 
entities is still unsatisfactory. In order to im-
prove the quality of data, efforts could be 
made towards achieving a harmonised 
account ing system for all entities that be-
long to the general government sector. 
There should at least be a clear differenti-
ation between the payment fl  ows to other 
parts of the respective state and others. In 
addition, a further subdivision of payments 
to other levels of government and a clear 
classifi  cation of payments to non- government 
entities would make sense. Under section 
49a of the Budget Principles Act (Haus-
haltsgrundsätzegesetz), it is the task of cen-
tral and state government to take account 
of statistical requirements in government 
accounting.4
4 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2018b), p. 67.
15 It appears that Saarland experienced some inconsisten -
cies concerning payments in connection with redemptions 
of long- term securities. One off- budget special fund hold -
ing debt instruments issued by Saarland posted repayment 
return flows from the core budget as revenue affecting the 
fiscal balance. In the core budget, the redemption of long- 
term securities financed by other entities was not taken to 
the fiscal balance. Against this background, it would ap -
pear that the capital expenditure has been understated.
16 Unlike in the government financial statistics, the rev -
enue of the states providing contributions is reduced by the 
payments under the state government revenue- sharing 
scheme.
17 Bavaria achieves a higher financial capacity in the state 
government revenue- sharing scheme, since this involves 
adjustment for its considerably lower real estate acquisition 
tax and its significantly lower multipliers for business tax 
and property tax.Deutsche Bundesbank

it. If the special- purpose grants for reconstruc -
tion in eastern Germany are added to this, their 
shortfall is reduced further to below 4%. How -
ever, before the ex ante redistribution of turn -
over tax receipts as the first stage of the gov -
ernment revenue- sharing scheme, the range 
(relative only to the federal state level) among 
the non- city states was still between 46% 
below the average in Saxony-  Anhalt to 32% 
above it in Bavaria.18 The burden from the 
equalisation stages totalled €700 per capita of 
the population in Bavaria, while the inflows in 
Saxony-  Anhalt (including the “special assis -
tance”) were as much as almost twice as high.
The per capita receipts from fees varied much 
more strongly (see the table on pp. 42 f., num -
ber 19 and the chart on p. 50). They were at by 
far their highest in Hamburg, while, in Thurin -
gia, they amounted to no more than just over 
half of the national figure. One reason for these 
differences is the varying degree to which tasks 
that lie within the responsibility of each of the 
federal states are outsourced to enterprises 
outside the government sector. This means 
that the relevant receipts from fees and staff 
costs, operating expenditure and investments 
are no longer recorded in the government 
finan cial statistics presented here. Matters of 
superregional importance in individual federal 
states also sometimes play a role, such as the 
port in Hamburg. Thus, a higher recorded level 
of receipts from fees does not necessarily go 
hand in hand with a greater burden on the 
general public of a federal state. Moreover, this 
indicates additional budgetary leeway only if 
they increase the cost coverage rate (i.e. if the 
expenditure is not correspondingly higher ei -
ther).
Furthermore, in connection with fees, there are 
apparent problems in consolidating transac -
tions between government entities in individual 
federal states. For instance, in some federal 
states, such as in North Rhine-  Westphalia, 
there are off- budget entities that manage and 
rent out administrative property. In this case, 
rent payments from the core budget are paid to this off- budget entity. These amounts are 
evidently not consolidated, but instead re -
corded as expenditure of the core budget and 
revenue of the special fund (in this instance as 
sales which are classified as fees). In effect, this 
results in double- counting under property 
costs, since the rents and the operating ex -
penses and financing costs covered by them 
are added together.
Thus, the adjusted total receipts and expend -
iture (see the table on pp. 42 f., numbers 21 
and 16) are easier to compare between federal 
states if the fees are deducted on the expend -
iture and the revenue side. In addition, interest 
rates are then also deducted on the expend -
iture side. The range is then significantly nar -
rower (see table on pp. 42 f., numbers 21a and 
16b).Strong disper -

Among the non- city states, adjusted per capita 
primary expenditure was highest in Saxony-  
Anhalt. However, this was accompanied by a 
very high level of central government transfers 
on the revenue side (see the table on pp. 42 f., 
number  20). Saxony-  Anhalt was closely fol -
lowed by Hesse and Bavaria, which had the 
highest levels of tax revenue. Saarland was at 
the other end of the spectrum: low primary ex -
penditure was offset by above- average interest 
expenditure and below- average revenue.19 The 
correspondingly adjusted primary expenditure 
of the city states was far higher than the fig -
ures for the non- city states. Despite a signifi -
cantly lower level of tax revenue and a very 
high interest burden, Bremen reported mark -
edly higher primary expenditure than Ham -
burg.
Caution is advisable when comparing individual 
revenue and expenditure categories across fed -
eral states – as addressed on pp. 52 f. For ex -
ample, the extent to which core areas, such as schools and childcare, are outsourced to non-  
government enterprises can vary greatly across 
federal states. In some cases, these enterprises 
are still receiving central government transfers, 
whereas primarily higher personnel costs and 
other operating expenditure would be recorded 
if there were no outsourcing. Transactions be -
tween government entities are also not always 
consolidated in a satisfactory manner in the 
government financial statistics. Thus, the com -
parisons for individual expenditure categories 
allow no more than tentative conclusions to be 
drawn about how economically a federal state 
uses funds or to what extent it performs ser -
vices. Nonetheless, a number of differences ap -
pear noteworthy.
With regard to personnel expenditure, new 
federal states have considerably lower pension 
obligations owing to a below- average number 
of recipients of civil servant pensions (see the 
table on pp. 42 f., number 28). The same also 
applies if payments for special pension provi -
sions and supplementary pension schemes for 
government employees before 1990 are in -
cluded (see the table on pp. 42 f., number 11b). 
By contrast, new federal states have higher ex -
penditure for current employees (see the table 
on pp.  42 f., number  11a) due, not least in 
many cases, to sizeable staffing levels in rela -
tion to the number of inhabitants (see the table 
on pp. 42 f., number 27). In addition, having a 
larger percentage of employees who are not 
civil servants, which eases the burden stem -
ming from pension payments, leads to add -
itional expenditure on social security contribu -
tions. However, the expenditure of the city 
states on current employees was still consider -
ably higher than that of the new federal states. 
This is particularly true of Hamburg, which col -
lected high fees at the same time. Expenditure 
was especially low in Schleswig- Holstein. In 
addition to relatively low staff numbers, this 
was also due to a below- average level of remu -
neration. Pay levels varying more greatly than Highest adjusted

before along with the diverging costs of living 
within Germany can make staff recruitment 
easier in urban areas. At the same time, the 
burden on financially weak federal states would 
tend to be eased with regard to staffing costs. 
Pay levels in the public sector would then also 
be more likely to reflect local differences in pri -
vate sector pay.20
Bremen reported the highest figure for trans -
fers to households (see the table on pp. 42 f., 
number 14), closely followed by North Rhine-  
Westphalia. Saxony-  Anhalt and Saarland were 
at the other end of the table. However, in 
Saxony-  Anhalt, at least, this is likely to be due 
to a different classification. Here, some social 
benefits, otherwise provided by local govern -
ment, are provided at state government level 
and are not recorded as transfers there, but ra -
ther as other operating expenditure. This ex -
penditure was also particularly high in this in -
stance (see the table on pp. 42 f., number 12). 
The extent to which this plays a role in Saarland 
cannot easily be derived from the data at 
present.21 In order to assess the burdens in in -
dividual federal states from transfer expend -
iture (social benefits), it should be noted that 
these are partly offset by central government. 
For instance, central government completely 
reimburses the costs of the basic allowance for 
the elderly and for persons with reduced earn -
ing capacity and almost half of the accommo -
dation costs of those receiving unemployment 
benefit II. Thus, net expenditure in these areas, 
which is ultimately relevant to the regional cost 
burden, was not only much lower, there was 
also considerably less disparity between federal 
states. Central government implicitly absorbs 
differences in the cost burden in this respect. 
An even somewhat greater shift to central gov -
ernment might be worth considering.22
Expenditure on fixed asset formation is a focal 
point when considering infrastructure develop -
ment. Expenditure varied substantially, with 
spin- offs and geographical features specific to 
certain federal states also likely to have played 
a part in this. Bavaria posted the highest per capita figure (see the table on pp. 42 f., num -

non- government entities that do not belong to 
the government sector. Current comprehensive 
data, broken down by government function, 
which include the grants to such entities, exist 
at present only in the national accounts for 
general government.
It would be desirable to have near- time access 
to financial statistical data for each federal 
state with a breakdown by government func -
tion. Furthermore, additional data would be 
important for consolidating transactions be -
tween government entities for individual cat -
egories of households, too. Double counting 
and other biases can scarcely be avoided with -
out a system that is closely coordinated be -
tween state governments, local governments 
and off- budget entities.
Starting this year, guarantee calls will no longer 
be shown as financial transactions in the gov -
ernment financial statistics (in line with the na -
tional accounts). As a result, they will then es -
sentially have a detrimental effect on the re -
ported adjusted structural balance. Expenditure 
on equity purchase will continue to be recog -
nised as a financial transaction. However, if suf -
ficient yields are not expected from this, it 
would be an economic imperative to record 
such expenditure as transfers in the financial 
statistics, like in the national accounts. This would also create greater pressure to ensure 
the proper classification of items when drawing 
up the budget. The effectiveness of the debt 
break could be better safeguarded in this way.
Clear and unbiased data are important for as -
sessing the finances of the individual federal 
states. The situation and structure of the con -
solidated state and local government budgets 
reflect political decisions regarding how a state 
performs its tasks and what spending this in -
volves. In addition to meaningful budgetary 
data, it would be beneficial for federal states to 
agree on result indicators for major functions 
and to publish the figures. Examples of this are 
performance indicators of educational out -
comes or the quality and availability of child -
care or transport infrastructure. Federal states 
possess a relatively broad range of legislative 
and organisational powers. The current positive 
budgetary situation should make it easier for 
the states to use these powers to provide ser -
vices that are in line with needs. Meaningful 
performance indicators would also make it eas -
ier to assess the various specific strategies 
adopted by the individual federal states. One 
advantage of federalism is being able to learn 
from such specific state- level approaches and 
make better use of future opportunities in this 
way.Transferring

Longer- term changes in the unsecured 
interbank money market
The turnover in the unsecured interbank money market has been dropping since the financial cri -
sis, but in particular since 2015. Important factors driving this development are changes in the use 
of monetary policy instruments and innovations in banking regulation. In terms of monetary pol -
icy, the high levels of excess liquidity as a result of asset purchases for monetary policy purposes, 
in particular, are currently a key factor. Another relevant issue is that the spread between the 
Eurosystem’s main refinancing rate and the deposit facility rate is significantly reduced compared 
to the first ten years of the monetary union.
The decrease in turnover in the overnight money market is particularly striking. At last count, 
EONIA panel banks granted other institutions just roughly one- twentieth of the average lending 
volume of 2008. This segment of the interbank money market is therefore virtually inexistent. As 
more banks hold excess central bank reserves than before, fewer banks seek liquidity on interbank 
money markets, causing a direct drop in turnover.
Lower turnover and a decrease in the spread versus key interest rates reduce the interest income 
that can be achieved per lending relationship. This leads to a reduction of the supply on the inter -
bank money market. In many cases, lower interest income no longer covers the fixed counterparty- 
specific (monitoring) costs. Consequently, only few institutions are able to lend profitably in the 
interbank money market, and not all those seeking to obtain central bank reserves on the market 
will be able to fund themselves at terms commensurate with their respective counterparty risk. In 
the absence of intermediation through money markets, institutions’ marginal liquidity and refi -
nancing costs will be determined by the key interest rates set by the Eurosystem, which are inde -
pendent of counterparty risk. At times, these rates can therefore be more favourable than market 
conditions. Banking sector risks are therefore no longer fully reflected in refinancing costs, which 
may impair the efficiency of the allocation of financial and ultimately also of real resources.
In the interests of an efficient allocation of resources in the euro area, the objective must there -
fore be to strive for a more rather than less market- based management of banks’ liquidity. Going 
forward, if the Eurosystem reduces excess liquidity in the long term, possibly combined with a 
re- enlargement of the interest rate spread between the main refinancing rate and the deposit 
facility rate, banks would have greater incentives to trade liquidity in the market again.
At the same time, it must be taken into account that various changes in the regulatory treatment 
of money market transactions between banks have created conditions which could make it more 
difficult to revitalise the interbank money market. However, the positive turnover developments 
during various periods with declining levels of excess liquidity since 2009 suggest that the possi -
bility of a revival of interbank money markets and a simultaneous reduction of the intermediation 
role of the Eurosystem should not be ruled out in the long term.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Banks trade central bank reserves in the inter -
bank money market. Commercial banks’ con -
duct of business, for instance processing pay -
ments, causes constant fluctuations in the bal -
ances of their accounts with the central bank. 
The interbank money market allows banks to 
balance these short-  term liquidity fluctuations 
by trading with one another. If an individual 
bank temporarily has a shortage of central 
bank reserves, it can borrow central bank re -
serves from other banks in order to meet min -
imum reserve requirements and make pay -
ments on behalf of customers. If the redistribu -
tion of liquidity among banks is readily possible 
via money markets, banks need not maintain 
any systematic liquidity buffers in the form of 
central bank reserves over and above their re -
serve requirements.
Central banks exert a significant influence on 
banks’ liquidity management through their use 
of monetary policy instruments: for instance, 
central banks may, on demand, provide their 
monetary policy counterparties with any add -
itional liquidity they require individually by 
means of standing facilities or through regular 
credit operations.1 In addition, central banks 
can provide the banking system with excess 
liquidity  in the form of central bank reserves 
through asset purchases, even in the absence 
of individual or aggregate demand from banks 
for additional central bank liquidity.
The Eurosystem has taken both paths, in par -
ticular with the full allotment in monetary pol -
icy refinancing operations that was introduced 
at the end of 2008 and has been extended re -
peatedly and with the creation of very large 
volumes of excess liquidity2 as a result of the 
expanded asset purchase programme (APP). 
With these and additional measures, the Euro -
system has fundamentally changed the basic 
conditions for banks’ liquidity management 
within the euro area. On top of that, there 
have also been changes to the regulatory envir -onment, especially in terms of capital require -
ments and liquid ity regulations.
The present article will outline the resulting 
longer- lasting changes in the unsecured inter -
bank money market based on various publicly 
available indicators. These include interest rates 
and/ or interest rate spreads as well as market 
turnover and relevant stock variables, in par -
ticular banks’ liquidity position vis- à- vis the 
Euro system.
Unsecured interbank money 
market: changes in liquidity 
and interest rate conditions
Basics
Through their short- term liquidity manage -
ment, banks traditionally ensure their capacity 
to pay by borrowing the required funds in the 
interbank money market. Banks’ capacity to 
pay is key not just for the institutions them -
selves but also from their clients’ point of view. 
Bank clients trust that they can access their due 
account balances at all times and can carry out 
payments. Ultimately, banks that conduct ma -
turity transformation can only meet this crucial 
interest of their clients permanently if they 
themselves are able to procure the central bank 
reserves required for deposit withdrawals in the 
interbank money market in due time. Market 
access of this nature requires a minimum de -
gree of confidence on the part of an institu -
tion’s potential creditors in the interbank 
money market.3Banks’ liquidity

1 From commercial banks’ perspective, the interest rate dif -
ferential between the central bank’s credit and deposit 
rates is an important factor in determining the attractive -
ness of central bank credit operations compared to loans in 
the interbank money market.
2 Excess liquidity generally means banks’ aggregate reserve 
balances with the central bank in excess of the institutions’ 
potential aggregate reserve requirements. For the Eurosys -
tem, it makes sense to define excess liquidity as, for in -
stance, “current accounts (including minimum reserve bal -
ances) plus deposit facility minus reserve requirement (as 
an average for the respective maintenance period)”.

Unsecured interbank money market – defi  nition and 
institutional  aspects
In unsecured transactions in the interbank 
money market, the bank granting credit 
does not take in any collateral to cover itself 
against the eventuality of the recipient bank 
being unable to fully repay the loan. Trans-
actions in the unsecured interbank money 
market are often conducted via telephone 
in the form of bilateral over- the- counter 
(OTC) credit agreements and are based on 
ongoing business relations between institu-
tions.1 In practice, one of the key prerequis-
ites for a credit transaction to be concluded 
between banks is probably for the credit- 
granting institution’s risk management unit 
to determine the set of potential counter-
parties in addition to setting limits for each 
institution deemed to be creditworthy. The 
main parameters underlying individual 
transactions in the unsecured interbank 
money market are loan amount, maturity 
and interest rate.2 Transactions of this kind 
are often carried out as overnight transac-
tions, which means that the credit amount 
becomes due on the very next business day.
Prominent measures of interest rate condi-
tions in the unsecured interbank money 
market are the transaction- based EONIA for 
overnight lending and the EURIBORs for 
lending in various maturities; both are pub-
lished by the European Money Markets In-
stitute (EMMI).3 These measures are import-
ant sources of summary information for 
Eurosystem monetary policy makers in their 
assessment of the effectiveness and effi   -
ciency of the direct monetary transmission 
mechanism in the interest rate channel, i.e. 
regarding the transmission of policy rates to 
banks’ marginal liquidity and funding costs. 
However, they also serve as reference rates 
for derivative instruments, which fi  nancial 
market players use to manage interest rate 
risk, amongst other things. In fi  nancial mar-kets, the prices of such derivative instru-
ments – e.g. interest rate swaps – often 
serve as the basis for the valuation of cap-
ital market instruments and may also be 
used to gauge policy rate expectations.4
1 If banks purchase unsecured bank bonds with a 
short (residual) maturity, this may also be interpreted 
as an unsecured interbank money market transaction. 
That segment of the market is, however, disregarded 
for the purposes of this article.
2 In principle, further parameters, e.g. the payment 
systems used for settlement, may be determined on an 
individual basis.
3 Please note the ongoing reform initiatives, for in-
stance, the potential replacement of the EONIA with 
the ECB’s euro short- term rate (€STR) or the transition 
to a hybrid methodology for the EURIBORs. See also 
European Central Bank (2018).

However, under normal circumstances, it is not 
profitable for banks to hold excess central bank 
reserves. Banks therefore regularly seek to hold 
their assets4 not as central bank reserves but in 
the form of more lucrative investments. Trad -
itionally, both aspects together – maintaining a 
bank’s capacity to pay while at the same time 
avoiding unnecessary, unprofitable buffers in 
the form of central bank reserves – have consti -
tuted a main objective of banks’ liquidity man -
agement.
Banks can also play an active role in the inter -
bank money market by accepting other banks’ 
deposits in addition to the activities resulting 
from business with non- banks and by issuing 
money market loans to other institutions. 
Whether such transactions are profitable from 
banks’ perspective and are therefore conducted 
in meaningful degree depends, crucially, on 
various underlying conditions, in particular the 
design of monetary policy instruments and on 
banking regulation.Balanced liquidity conditions 
before the financial crisis
Since the introduction of the euro in 1999, 
there was, for a long time, virtually no change 
to the basic conditions in the euro area inter -
bank money market that were determined by 
monetary policy (see the chart above). The 
banking system had to participate in the Euro -
system’s weekly refinancing operations in order 
to be able to fulfil aggregate reserve require -
ments.5 The Eurosystem maintained balanced 
liquidity conditions via limited allotments in re -
financing operations: the banking system’s ag -

period, amounted to little more than the re -Liquidity man -

serve requirement.6 Institutions balanced any 
remaining volatility in their central bank bal -
ances as a result of their business operations by 
participating in the interbank money market.7 
Banks’ marginal willingness to pay for an inter -
bank loan was broadly equivalent to the inter -
est rate of the Eurosystem’s main refinancing 
operations.8
Banks needed an economic incentive to lend 
out central bank reserves in excess of their min -
imum reserve requirements in money market 
transactions with other banks. The Eurosystem 
created this incentive by maintaining a con -
stant 100 bps spread between the minimum 
bid rate for the main refinancing operations 
and the interest rate on the deposit facility (de -
posit facility rate). Compared to the marginal 
willingness to pay of banks with remaining 
liquid  ity needs, banks would have foregone a 
considerable amount of interest by using the 
deposit facility as opposed to lending in the 
interbank market.9 It was therefore a straight-  
forward decision to offer any central bank re -
serves not needed to meet reserve require -
ments to other institutions with liquidity needs 
via the interbank money market rather than 
making use of the Eurosystem’s deposit facility. 
Given the aggregate shortage of central bank 
reserves, the equilibrium of short- term inter -
bank money market rates was slightly above 
the minimum bid rate in the Eurosystem’s main 
refinancing operations.10
From the summer of 2007 onwards, interbank 
markets around the world experienced ten -
sions. A loss of confidence in one another in -
creased banks’ sensitivity to potential counter -
party risks. This was also evident in rising inter -
est rates (and/ or increasing risk premia11) in the 
interbank money market. From the perspective 
of an individual bank providing liquidity, higher 
interest rates seemed justified: first, a broad 
loss of confidence had the potential to make it 
more expensive for the individual bank to ob -
tain liquidity for itself. Second, interest rates on 
interbank money market loans had to reflect 
the changes in the assessment of counterparty- specific credit risks. During this period, the 
Euro system initially deployed various discretion -
ary measures to stabilise interest rate condi -
tions in the interbank money market in the 
euro area without, however, altering the mon -
etary policy framework for the interbank money 
market as a whole.12 This changed when the 
initial liquidity crisis evolved into a full- blown 
financial crisis in the autumn of 2008, resulting 
in ever greater turmoil also in the euro area. In 
October 2008, the Eurosystem decided that re -
financing operations would be carried out 
through a fixed- rate tender procedure with full 
allotment at the interest rate on the main refi -
nancing operations.13 At the same time, the 
interest rate corridor created by the Eurosys -
tem’s key interest rates was narrowed. In par -
ticular, the Governing Council of the ECB re -
duced the differential between the main refi -
nancing rate and the deposit facility rate to 50 
bps for a limited period until January 2009.Incentives for

From 1999 until June 2007, it averaged less than €1.1 bil -
lion.
7 Against sufficient collateral, the Eurosystem provides 
banks with additional liquidity at all times through the mar -
ginal lending facility. However, it charges a significantly 
higher interest rate than the main refinancing rate, mean -
ing that the Eurosystem’s monetary policy counterparties 
do not make systematic use of this instrument.
8 It should be noted that banks do not have to maintain 
the central bank balances necessary to fulfil the Eurosys -
tem’s minimum reserve requirements on a daily basis, but 
only averaged across a maintenance period of several 
weeks.
9 Given balanced liquidity conditions, the gross interest 
rate loss, in other words before risk costs, would have been 
slightly above 100 bps. In actual fact, the Eurosystem’s 
counterparties made no systematic use of the deposit facil -
ity until the liquidity and later the financial crisis, with the 
exception of a transitional phase following the introduction 
of the euro. Average stocks in the deposit facility were less 
than €0.3 billion between 2000 and 2006.
10 Other major central banks achieved similar results in 
managing short- term interest rates in the interbank money 
market through an overall comparable use of instruments.

Full allotment policy and 
narrower  interest rate corridor: 
demand- driven excess liquidity
From this point onwards, fixed- rate full allot -
ment provided a cap for banks’ funding costs14 
– and therefore effectively limited the willing -
ness to pay for short- term loans in the inter -
bank money market of institutions with a de -
mand for liquidity. At the same time, the in -
crease in the deposit facility rate relative to the 
main refinancing rate reduced the interest fore -
gone by banks with excess reserves who made 
use of the deposit facility rather than offering 
surplus liquidity to other banks.15 Against the 
backdrop of a higher perception of risk, lending 
in the interbank money market had become 
less attractive given a narrower corridor width, 
while holding excess liquidity in the deposit fa -
cility had become more attractive than before. 
Both measures therefore resulted in the Euro -
system partially replacing the trading of surplus 
liquidity that had previously taken place on the 
interbank money market. The extent of the 
intermediation via the Eurosystem’s balance 
sheet was evident in the temporary surge in ex -
cess liquidity from close to zero to an average of 
more than €200 billion in the fourth quarter of 
2008. However, this demand- driven increase in 
excess liquidity soon proved to be largely revers -
ible when the corridor width was widened 
again in the first half of 2009, essentially shortly 
after the financial crisis reached its peak.
Institutions enjoying a high level of confidence 
in the markets continued to use money market 
transactions for their liquidity management 
during this period, which meant that there was 
a certain remaining turnover in the interbank 
money market. During this phase, short- term 
interbank money market rates fell below the 
interest rate on main refinancing operations in 
some instances.16 For institutions with excess 
central bank reserves it was still profitable to 
pass on their excess liquidity to banks with high 
creditworthiness. The aggregate excess supply 
of central bank reserves meant that, at times, 
interest rates for money market transactions moved towards the deposit facility rate. When 
excess liquidity fell in conjunction with the 
widening of the corridor at the beginning of 
2009, money market rates temporarily returned 
towards the interest rate on the main refinan -
cing operations.
From May 2009 onwards, the Eurosystem re -
duced the interest rate differential between the 
main refinancing operations and the deposit 
facility, until it remained at just 25 bps from 
Novem ber 2013 for roughly two years. This 
reduced  width of the effective interest rate cor -
ridor resulted primarily from the Governing 
Council lowering the main refinancing rate in 
order to alter the monetary policy stance with -
out at the same time reducing the deposit facil -
ity rate. As key interest rates increasingly ap -
proached the zero lower bound, the Eurosys -
tem was initially reluctant to lower the deposit 
facility rate to zero and then into negative ter -
ritory.17 For banks, the foregone interest as a 
result of holding excess central bank reserves 
(as compared to the main refinancing rate or 
the representative interbank money market 
rate) consequently fell sharply. All other things 
being equal, this further reduced the incentives 
for horizontal adjustment in the distribution of 
liquidity18 among euro area banks.Full allotment

counterparty for monetary policy credit operations and had 
sufficient (unencumbered) collateral.
15 Whereas holding excess liquidity in the deposit facility 
would, up until then, have involved foregone interest of 
roughly 100 bps before the cost of risks, the interest rate 
gap between the EONIA and the Eurosystem’s deposit 
facility  averaged roughly 27 bps in the period from 8 Octo -
ber 2008 to 20 January 2009 against a backdrop of signifi -
cantly positive aggregate excess liquidity.
16 For more on the behaviour of short- term money market 
rates and the impact of longer- term Eurosystem credit 
oper ations, see also Abbassi, Fecht and Tischer (2017).
17 It was not until the deposit facility rate was lowered into 
negative territory at -10 bps and subsequently further re -
duced up until 2016 that the interest rate differential be -
tween the main refinancing rate and the deposit facility 
rate widened to 40 bps (as of March 2016).
18 Although demand-  driven excess liquidity can generally 
be considered a suitable indicator for tensions in the inter -
bank money market when only short- term Eurosystem 
credit operations are utilised, the increasing compression of 
the maximum possible interest margins in the interbank 
money market in itself already considerably limited the use -
fulness of this interpretation of excess liquidity as a crisis 
indicator.Deutsche Bundesbank

Favourable long- term 
refinancing  operations and 
asset purchases: structural 
excess  liquidity
Moreover, the monetary policy framework for 
the interbank money market changed starting 
in the summer of 2009 because the Eurosys -
tem repeatedly offered refinancing operations 
with very long maturities19 and at very favour -
able interest rates as compared to market con -
ditions. Overall, the Eurosystem’s counterpar -
ties reduced their recourse to regular refinan -
cing operations with shorter maturities follow -
ing the allotment of the long- term tenders. 
Nevertheless, the large- scale use of long- term 
credit operations created additional excess 
liquid  ity on a large, and in some ways unpre -
cedented scale. The high levels of excess liquid -
ity were no longer predominantly a symptom 
of tensions in interbank money markets, but 
were, first and foremost, a consequence of the 
very favourable conditions of the long-  term 
refinan cing operations offered by the Eurosys -
tem. Although the level of excess liquidity was 
determined by the individual demand of banks, 
the long maturities of refinancing operations 
and, at times, the lack of early repayment op -
tions meant that it was, for a sustained period, 
structural in nature.
Excess liquidity with a structural character may 
also be produced by central bank asset pur -
chases. Of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy 
asset purchase programmes, this is particularly 
true of the APP which the Governing Council of 
the ECB adopted in early 2015. Asset purchases 
under this programme led to a strong increase 
in the central bank reserve balances of euro 
area banks on a scale far exceeding that of pre -
vious increases in excess liquidity as a result of 
the long- term refinancing operations.Relationship between excess 
liquidity  and interest rates 
in the unsecured interbank 
money market
If central banks use their liquidity operations to 
produce balanced liquidity conditions, their ob -
jective is generally to anchor short- term interest 
rates roughly at the level of the key interest 
rate.20 Under the orderly market conditions 
prevailing before the financial crisis, the Euro -
system and many other central banks were 
pretty successful: short- term unsecured inter -
bank money market rates were fairly stable 
and, on average, did not deviate much from 
the level of key interest rates.21 Central banks 
being able to successfully steer short-  term 
interest rates in the interbank money market is 
an important prerequisite to ensuring that 
changes in key interest rates effectively influ -
ence the interest rate conditions banks offer 
their retail clients.22 These conditions are, in 
turn, relevant factors for developments in the 
real economy and price dynamics.
Once excess liquidity increases from balanced 
liquidity conditions, average short- term interest 
rates on the interbank money market will drop

19 To date, the Eurosystem has conducted four series of 
such refinancing operations with very long maturities of 
one year or more: 1. In 2009, a total of around €614 billion 
was provided in three longer- term refinancing operations 
using a full allotment procedure, each running for around 
12 months. 2. At the end of 2011/ beginning of 2012, a 
total of more than €1 trillion was drawn by credit institu -
tions in two longer- term refinancing operations with a ma -
turity of three years. 3. From the summer of 2014 onwards, 
a first series of a total of eight targeted longer- term refi -
nancing operations (TLTRO) with maturities of up to four 
years were offered, which was used by Eurosystem coun -
terparties to the tune of €432 billion in total. 4. From the 
spring of 2016 onwards, four further targeted longer- term 
refinancing operations (TLTRO II) with maturities of four 
years each were carried out (roughly €740 billion).
20 The key interest rate is usually also the interest rate 
which is (at least approximately) used for those liquidity 
operations with which the central bank manages the bank -
ing system’s liquidity position. For the Eurosystem, this key 
interest rate is the interest rate on the main refinancing 
operations or, where the variable rate tender procedure is 
applied, the minimum bid rate in the main refinancing op -
erations.

as a result of the excess supply of central bank 
reserves.23 The degree to which money market 
rates converge towards the deposit facility rate 
at very high levels of excess liquidity likely de -
pends on various different factors.
From the perspective of the banks providing 
loans in the interbank money market, these 
factors could include the risk premium they de -
mand vis- à- vis a risk- free investment with the 
Eurosystem. Both for institutions that lend and 
for those that borrow, regulatory factors might 
also play a role. Creditors could demand com -
pensation for the capital charges that they 
must provide for unsecured loans. In turn, 
debtors that are restricted by the leverage ratio 
might expect a compensation, in the form of 
an interest rate deduction, for the extension of 
their balance sheet. When credit risk premia 
and a potential surcharge for the regulatory 
cost of an interbank loan (see the box on 
p. 67 f.) exceed the opportunity costs equal to 
the interest rate differential between the inter -
est rate that can be achieved in the interbank 
money market and the Eurosystem’s deposit 
facility rate, money dealing is no longer profit -
able for the institution providing liquidity.24
The relationship between the banking system’s 
aggregate liquidity position and interbank 
money market rates can be illustrated graphic -ally. As credit risk premia and potential regula -
tory costs do not vary with the width of the 
interest rate corridor, it would make sense to 
examine, in particular, time periods with a con -
stant spread between the main refinancing rate 
and the deposit facility rate.25 Moreover, the 
time periods should be characterised by a tran -
sition from roughly balanced liquidity condi -
tions to phases of increased excess liquidity. 
Based on these criteria, the two periods 13 May 
2009 to 7 May 2013 (with a policy rate spread 
of 75 bps) and 13 November 2013 to 8 Decem -
ber 2015 (with a policy rate spread of 25 bps) 
are especially suitable for graphical analyses 
(see the chart above).

Money markets and fi  nancial regulation
Besides monetary policy, changes in the 
regulatory framework are another key rea-
son why the conditions for banks’ liquidity 
management have changed. In order to 
meet new liquidity requirements, banks 
must hold a certain percentage of assets 
– which depends on the expected infl  ows 
and outfl  ows in various types of fi  nancing – 
that can be relatively easily converted into 
central bank reserves. Likewise, there are, in 
some instances, tighter risk management 
and precautionary requirements for banks, 
especially regarding capital. Many of these 
rules were introduced or revised since 2008 
in response to the fi  nancial crisis.
A bank granting an unsecured interbank 
loan exchanges safe central bank liquidity 
on the assets side for a claim vis- à- vis an-
other bank. The lending bank must there-
fore hold additional capital for the event of 
a potential default of this credit claim. Con-
sequently, the interest rate also has to re-
fl  ect the opportunity costs of the capital 
required as backing. While borrowing funds 
in the interbank money market as a precau-
tion increases the stock of risk- free central 
bank reserves and allows additional pay-
ments to be settled, it also involves a bal-
ance sheet extension, which is likewise 
asso ciated with regulatory costs. A balance 
sheet extension also affects what is known 
as the leverage ratio; if binding, this makes 
intermediation between banks –  usually 
asso ciated only with low margins – signifi  -
cantly less attractive.
The aftermath of the fi  nancial crisis also 
saw comprehensive new liquidity rules 
being adopted for banks, including the 
liquidity  coverage ratio (LCR) and the net 
stable funding ratio (NSFR). The NSFR aims 
to ensure that institutions have a sustain-able funding structure and to limit overreli-
ance on short- term wholesale funding.1 
Short- term fi  nancing instruments make 
banks particularly vulnerable as creditors 
can withdraw their funds at short notice, if 
necessary. The LCR requires banks to hold a 
buffer in the form of high quality liquid 
assets (HQLA) to cover the net cash out-
fl  ows over the next 30 days. Ideally, such 
assets may be sold or exchanged for central 
bank reserves within a short period of time 
and without a markdown. Hoerova et al. 
(2018) show that banks with a lower liquid-
ity position relied more heavily on central 
bank credit during the two crisis periods 
2008-09 and 2011-12.2 Had European 
banks complied with these ratios, they 
would, in principle, have been more resili-
ent to outfl  ows of liquidity and the need for 
additional liquidity provided by the central 
bank would have been at least partially re-
duced.
The impact of liquidity rules on the inter-
bank money market can be attributed both 
to payments made in relation to the trans-
actions that fall within the LCR’s 30- day 
horizon and to the classifi  cation of central 
bank reserves as HQLA. The introduction of 
new regulatory standards thus affects how 
attractive the provision of and recourse to 
interbank credit is.3 Interbank loans with a 
1 See also Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
(2014).
2 The Hoerova et al. (2018) study shows that the use 
of central bank refi  nancing during the two crisis 
periods 2008-09 and 2011-12 was negatively correl-
ated with the LCR and NSFR proxies generated from 
balance sheet variables.
3 The same applies to the attractiveness of participat-
ing in liquidity- providing central bank operations. 
Using a theoretical model, Bech and Keister (2017) 
show that liquidity regulation can – depending on the 
design of the central bank’s collateral framework  – 
also have an effect on the transmission of central bank 
liquidity operations to money market rates.Deutsche Bundesbank

residual maturity of less than 30 days do 
not usually affect LCR compliance signifi  -
cantly.4 Money market transactions with a 
maturity of more than 30 days initially 
improve  borrowers’ LCR as their stock of 
HQLA rises, yet they are not required (until 
30 days before the loan matures) to record 
LCR- relevant outfl  ows of central bank 
liquidity . By contrast, lenders’ LCR deterior-
ates as the infl  ow of HQLA at maturity will 
not occur within the next 30 days and can, 
therefore, not initially be included.5
In addition to regulatory costs stemming 
from liquidity and capital requirements (in-
cluding the leverage ratio), there may be 
potential costs for assessing counterparty 
credit risk (monitoring costs) and possible 
extra costs related to the establishment of 
new customer relationships (e. g. checking 
the identity of new customers or what are 
referred to as know- your- customer rules). 
The additional costs incurred by both the 
lender and the borrower must be compen-
sated by a corresponding interest rate de-
duction or premium.
In some cases, interactions with the central 
bank benefi  t from preferential regulatory 
treatment. For instance, in terms of liquidity 
requirements, transactions with the central 
bank are subject to a roll- over assumption.6 
In other words, regulators do not assume 
an outfl  ow of the central bank reserves that 
an institution has obtained by participating 
in a monetary policy refi  nancing operation. 
Furthermore, in terms of capital require-
ments, central bank deposits are treated 
preferentially, with a risk weight of 0%, as 
compared to a potentially risky provision of 
central bank liquidity to other commercial 
banks. Differences in regulatory costs may, 
therefore, render interbank money market 
transactions less attractive compared with 
transactions with the central bank.4 Providing central bank liquidity to other banks for a 
period of less than 30 days reduces HQLA in the form 
of central bank reserves. However, unless stipulated 
otherwise in Article 33 of Commission Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2015/ 61, this is approximately offset 
by an expected infl  ow of liquidity within the LCR hori-
zon. Simi larly, borrowing central bank liquidity in the 
interbank money market for a period of less than 30 
days does not lead to a substantial change in the LCR 
given that the borrowed central bank funds (HQLA) 
will fl  ow back out upon maturity.
5 According to the estimates of Bonner and Eijffi   nger 
(2013), it was observed that banks close to the regula-
tory minimum requirement raised more funds and pro-
vided less liquidity for more than 30 days following the 
introduction of a similar liquidity rule in the Nether-
lands.
6 The roll- over assumption presumes that – at the sole 
initiative of an institution – central bank credit may be 
extended beyond the initial maturity.Deutsche Bundesbank

exceed it.26 By contrast, when there is a marked 
increase in excess liquidity, money market rates 
move towards the deposit facility rate. For the 
periods with a constant key interest rate spread 
that we consider in our analysis, we find that 
for levels of excess liquidity of about €50 billion 
to €200 billion (as much as €400 billion in 
excep tional cases), forecasts of the average 
money market rates solely on the basis of the 
banking system’s average liquidity position are, 
at best, inaccurate.27 This suggests that the 
relation ship between excess liquidity and short- 
term money market rates varies over time and 
is influenced by additional factors.
The decline in the money market rates can be 
slower in segmented markets because it is pos -
sible that only part of the excess liquidity is 
offered on the market. In non- segmented mar -
kets, on the other hand, money market interest 
rates may converge towards the deposit facility 
rate when excess liquidity is at a relatively low 
level. Besides any segmentation of the money 
market, the spread (stipulated by monetary 
policymakers) between the main refinancing 
rate and the deposit facility rate also plays an 
important role. All else being equal, a larger 
spread between these policy rates would amp -
lify the initial absolute decrease in interest rates 
due to the creation of excess liquidity. The dis -
tribution of excess reserves in the banking sys -
tem is important as well.28 The higher the con -
centration of excess liquidity, the more banks 
are reliant on money market transactions to 
meet the bank- specific reserve requirements if 
they do not want to make use of central bank 
credit operations.29 Thus, because of the 
greater market power of the few banks holding 
excess liquidity, the fall of the interest rates to -
wards the deposit facility rate would be slower. 
Finally, bank- specific risk premia of transactions 
that were actually carried out and were cap -
tured in the Euro OverNight Index Average 
(EONIA) may also be reflected in the weighted 
average interest rates and lead to upward pres -
sures at given levels of excess liquidity.Developments in interbank 
money market activity based 
on aggregated indicators
Changing liquidity and interest rate conditions 
have a major effect on the incentives to lend 
on the interbank money market and are re -
flected in money market turnover. Only a 
limited number of aggregated indicators are 
available for the development of turnover in 
the unsecured interbank money market. There 
is a long time series of daily turnover data avail -
able for the transaction- weighted EONIA index, 
which measures the average interest rates of 
unsecured interbank loans that mature the next 
business day (i.e. normally “overnight”).30 Apart 
from short and medium- term fluctuations, the 
pronounced downward trend in turnover over 
the last decade is particularly striking (see the 
chart on p. 72). This decline in turnover was 
interspersed with temporary recoveries, but re -
mains ongoing. At present, turnover is increas -
ingly approaching zero.Changing

26 In the period 1999 to 2007, money market rates when 
liquidity conditions were balanced were, on average, 
mostly above the minimum bid rate of the main refinancing 
operations.
27 Thus, excess liquidity totalling around €170 billion may 
go hand in hand with money market rates of around 9 bps 
above the deposit facility rate (1st reserve maintenance 
period 2010) as well as of more than 32 bps above the de -
posit facility rate (9th reserve maintenance period 2011). 
When excess liquidity totalled just above €400 billion, 
there were interest rate spreads of around 6 bps (2nd re -
serve maintenance period 2013) as well as of 20 bps (12th 
reserve maintenance period 2011).
28 See Afonso, Armenter and Lester (2018).
29 This may be illustrated by means of the following hy -
pothesis. If the banking system’s excess liquidity were held 
in its entirety at only one institution, the willingness of all 
the other banks to pay for central bank liquidity would de -
pend on the main refinancing rate. Conversely, if the excess 
liquidity were distributed evenly across the banking system 
so that all banks already held excess liquidity, they would 
hardly be prepared to pay more than the deposit facility 
rate for it.
30 According to the EONIA Benchmark Determination 
Methodology of the European Money Market Institute 
(EMMI), all unsecured interbank money market loans that 
are granted by EONIA panel banks from one TARGET busi -
ness day to the following TARGET business day (overnight 
transactions) are captured. At the end of August 2018, the 
panel comprised 28 banks domiciled in the EU. Daily turn -
over from 1999 is available, for example, in the ECB’s Stat -
istical Data Warehouse (see the chart on p. 72).Deutsche Bundesbank

Evidence of a drop in turnover in the interbank 
overnight money market can also be obtained 
from payments data. Central banks are able to 
determine money market activity by using suit -
able algorithms.31 Depending on market condi -
tions, analyses of this kind are subject to a high 
level of uncertainty and can only identify money 
market transactions that are settled using a 
gross settlement transfer system such as 
TARGET2  . However, secured and unsecured 
transactions can only be distinguished to a 
limited extent, if at all. According to recently 
published evidence, the volume of overnight 
loans granted on the interbank money market 
fell from around €80 billion in the years 2009 
to 2010 to around €6 billion in September 
2017, after daily turnover of well over €100 bil -
lion was recorded for mid-2008.32 This is a de -
cline comparable to that of EONIA turnover.
A variety of reasons may have caused this pro -
longed downward trend that we observe. One 
view is that, as awareness of default risk in the 
banking sector grew in the wake of the finan -
cial crisis, transactions that had been con -
ducted in unsecured markets shifted to secured 
market segments.33 As an example, secured 
overnight trading on platforms such as Eurex 
GC Pooling gained in importance relative to un -
secured EONIA turnover. Overall, however, GC 
Pooling turnover shows a momentum similar to 
that of EONIA turnover.
Moreover, the downward trend in EONIA turn -
over could be partially attributed to a switch of 
transactions to longer maturities. The ECB 
Money Market Survey that was conducted dur -
ing the period 2003 to 2015 permits inferences 
with regard to longer- term trends in turnover 
in the interbank money market in various ma -
turity segments. However, the survey results 
show that not only overnight transactions but 
also – and to a particular extent – transactions 
with longer maturities decreased. From 2015 
onwards, the gradual introduction of the liquid-
ity coverage ratio (LCR) as part of the imple -
mentation of Basel III probably tended to in -
crease incentives to conclude longer- term transactions (see the box on p. 67 f.). Aggre -
gate results from the German institutions sub -
ject to the Eurosystem’s money market statis -
tical reporting (MMSR) indicate that the share 
of longer- term borrowing in the unsecured 
interbank money market has increased slightly 
since 2017. At the same time, this finding is not 
attributable to an absolute increase in longer-  
term transactions but to a decrease in shorter- 
term transactions.
During the early years of the monetary union, 
from 1999 to 2005, the institutions participat -
ing in the EONIA panel provided other banks 
with overnight transactions of, on average, €39 
billion. In the years that followed, the EONIA 
turnover measured proved to be relatively 
robust  despite the liquidity crisis that was build -
ing up in 2007 and, later, the financial crisis, 
and actually even rose temporarily. This finding, 
which at first glance does not square with the, 
at that time, frequently used image of a market 
that was “freezing” or “drying up” can be ex -
plained by the temporary switch from longer-  
term to shorter- term transactions amid stressed 
market conditions. However, the decline in 
turnover which began in 2009 and has fol -
lowed a steady downward trend since 2015 
was accompanied by a marked decrease in in -
dicators of tensions in money markets.34 This 
could suggest that the long- term decrease in 
turnover is not primarily a reflection of tensions 
in the money markets.35Payments data

rates; see Deutsche Bundesbank (2014a).
35 Based on the Bundesbank’s credit register for loans of 
one million euro or more, Bednarek, Dinger and von West -
ernhagen (2016) come to the conclusion that there is no 
evidence to support the assertion that the interbank money 
market in Germany “either collapsed or succumbed to par -
alysis”. The study documents that outstanding interbank 
liabilities in the period 2003 to 2012 fluctuated surprisingly 
little. This is largely consistent with the comparatively stable 
trend in EONIA turnover during this period.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

Over the long term, the development of aver -
age EONIA turnover has run counter to excess 
liquidity levels since 2008. This has become 
particularly apparent since the beginning of 
2015. A roughly tenfold increase in excess li -
quidity, from less than €200 billion to almost 
€2 trillion as a result of the asset purchases for 
monetary policy purposes, was accompanied 
by a decrease in average EONIA turnover from 
more than €25 billion to about one- tenth of 
this amount (going to press, the average for 
2019 stood at below €2.5 billion).36 The inverse 
long- term relationship between excess liquidity 
and money market turnover is not a mere coin -
cidence. On days when refinancing volumes 
rise sharply, turnover in the unsecured inter -
bank overnight money market falls consider -
ably. Over extended periods, there is a statistic -
ally significant link between an increase in the 
volume of monetary policy refinancing or ex -
cess liquidity and a decrease in money market 
turnover.37 The literature also contains refer -
ences to these links. Heijmans et al. (2016) 
show on the basis of turnover figures derived 
from payments data that total overnight turn -
over in the euro area interbank money market 
decreased from around €90 billion to around 
€75 billion as a result of the two three- year 
tenders allotted by the Eurosystem at the end 
of 2011 and the beginning of 2012, which led 
to a massive rise in excess liquidity. According 
to Garcia- de- Andoain et al. (2016), the Eurosys -
tem’s refinancing operations during the crisis 
years 2008 to 2011 crowded out demand in 
the interbank money market. They point out 
that only during the sovereign debt crisis in the 
period 2011 to 2013 is it possible that the 
liquid ity provided by the Eurosystem may have 
supported the provision of interbank loans to 
banks domiciled in Italy, Greece and Spain.
Evidence from the 
 Eurosystem’s money market 
statistical reporting
A systematic collection of high- frequency (turn -
over) data of the unsecured interbank money market transactions has been available since 
2016 by means of the Eurosystem’s MMSR.38 
The MMSR dataset contains transactions of 
more than 100 banks domiciled in Germany. 
Money market transactions with other banks 
have to be reported, as well as transactions 
with other financial institutions, public institu -
tions and large non- financial corporations.39 
The types of transactions include, amongst 
others, all interbank loans in the form of (over -
night) deposits and call accounts. Selected ag -
gregates of these statistics, including in particu -
lar unsecured interbank transactions, are regu -
larly published by the Bundesbank.
The decline in unsecured overnight lending by 
German institutions subject to the MMSR re -
porting requirement to other banks is particu -
larly striking.40 These transactions have slumped 
by around 66% since mid-2017. Whereas daily 
turnover initially totalled around €12 billion, 
unsecured overnight lending at present shows 
a volume of only around €4 billion (see the 
chart on p.  73). These transactions are eco -
nomically comparable to the transactions 
underlying the EONIA index; however, the re -
porting population in terms of the reporting in -
stitutions is different.41
During the same period, the volume of over -
night borrowing by the German banks subject 
to the MMSR from other banks was almost Inverse relation -

36 To some extent, the decline in EONIA turnover is also 
likely attributable to a drop in the number of participants 
on the EONIA panel.
37 This is borne out by a regression of the daily changes in 
EONIA turnover to the first four lags of the daily changes in 
refinancing volume or excess liquidity, the EURIBOR- OIS 
spread, and three lags of the daily changes in EONIA turn -
over in the period January 2006 to January 2019.

time series are made available through the Bundesbank’s

39 Transactions that are classified as “wholesale” pursuant 
to the Basel III framework are reported. A large share of 
short- term interbank transactions can be allocated to

halved, falling from just under €5 billion to 
around €2.5 billion.42 On average, around 42% 
of this turnover is accounted for by creditor in -
stitutions domiciled in non- euro area countries, 
with a volume- weighted average interest rate 
of just under -0.48%.43 The average rate for 
corresponding transactions with German banks 
was around -0.38%, which was slightly above 
the deposit facility rate in that period. The 
interest rate spread is due to the fact that banks 
domiciled in the euro area are generally able to 
hold their euro liquidity directly with the central 
bank. For this reason, they are usually only pre -
pared to provide other banks with central bank 
liquidity at rates above the deposit facility rate. 
For institutions domiciled outside the euro 
area, this possibility is not given as a matter of 
principle, which is why they are willing to place 
euro liquidity with other banks at lower interest 
rates. Accepting liquidity at interest rates below 
the deposit facility rate and passing it on is thus 
a remaining incentive to trade for German 
banks.44Discussion, conclusion and 
outlook
The Eurosystem’s monetary policy since the 
finan cial crisis, but also changes in banking 
regulation, have significantly altered the envir -
onment for the unsecured interbank money 
market. In particular, the Eurosystem’s large-  
scale asset purchases for monetary policy pur -

42 The collection of deposits from non- banks by institu -
tions subject to reporting under the MMSR increased by 
around €5 billion over the same period. As opposed to 
transactions between banks and non- banks, the interbank 
money market is characterised, amongst other things, by 
the fact that lenders and borrowers have, in principle, ac -
cess to central bank accounts under identical terms. By 
contrast, the prices for transactions between banks and 
non- banks are influenced by a large number of additional 
factors. An asymmetry as regards central bank access usu -
ally leads to differences in the pricing of interbank transac -
tions compared to transactions with non- banks.

ning of 2015, as well as the narrowing of the 
interest rate differential between the main refi -
nancing rate and the deposit facility rate have 
had a profound impact on turnover in the un -
secured overnight segment – to the extent that 
this part of the interbank money market has 
basically ceased to exist.
Since a considerable part of the banking sys -
tem holds surplus central bank reserves, there 
are fewer banks seeking liquidity in the short-  
term interbank money market. Therefore, insti -
tutions can only invest surplus reserves in the 
interbank money market on particular occa -
sions and at rates slightly above the deposit 
facility  rate. As a result, interest income from 
sporadic transactions has decreased to the ex -
tent that it often does not suffice to cover the 
costs of monitoring potential borrowers. The 
mismatch between counterparty- specific moni -
toring costs and the interest income that is 
achievable at low money market turnovers can 
lead to institutions participating in Eurosystem 
monetary policy operations at a fixed, uniform 
interest rate, even when overall excess liquidity 
is high yet unevenly distributed. As a result, 
banks’ marginal liquidity and refinancing costs 
are currently harmonised by the Eurosystem, 
such that a bank’s marginal refinancing costs 
do not always reflect its counterparty risk.
An active money market may involve peer 
monitoring and can have a disciplining effect 
on market participants if the counterparty risk 
is reflected in risk premia.45 In recent years, 
however, the benefits of an active interbank 
overnight money market have been called into 
question, especially in the United States.46 It is 
true, the argument goes, that the interbank 
money market can be efficient in allocating 
central bank liquidity and, to a certain extent, 
discipline banks. However, activity in the inter -
bank money market would be a waste of re -
sources if, on the other hand, the central bank 
were able to supply additional central bank 
reserves  to an unlimited extent and at negli -
gible marginal costs.47With regard to the United States with its strong 
capital market tradition in comparison to con -
tinental Europe, this argument seems worthy 
of discussion. There, the success or failure of 
financial institutions is also determined by cap -
ital markets, as a loss of confidence can make 
it more expensive for institutions to obtain 
finan cing on a lasting basis. What is more, 
there is no comparable tradition of borrowing 
from the central bank, neither in short nor in 
long maturities. If US banks were forced to bor -
row central bank funds, they would remain 
stigmatised and would have to expect the mar -
kets to lose confidence in them. Under those 
circumstances, it is conceivable that institutions 
are already sufficiently disciplined by the capital 
markets. A largely efficient allocation of finan -
cial and real resources could potentially be 
achieved by an adequate reflection of the risks Refinancing

46 These ideas originated, amongst others, with Martin 
and McAndrews (2008) and have recently been revisited in 
speeches by Dudley (2017) and Bostic (2019).
47 The starting point in the euro area at that time already 
differed considerably from that in the United States. As the 
Eurosystem has always paid interest on banks’ minimum 
reserve holdings at the main refinancing rate, they do not 
constitute a cost factor from the banks’ viewpoint. Thus, 
the Eurosystem had always taken into account to a limited 
extent the thoughts emanating from the United States. In 
addition, the Eurosystem always made the deposit facility 
available to banks, which meant that although holding ex -
cess liquidity entailed interest foregone for banks in the 
euro area, the loss was less than for banks in the United 
States.Deutsche Bundesbank

on banks’ balance sheets in their longer- term 
financing costs.
However, such conditions do not apply in the 
euro area. The Eurosystem purchases and holds 
a sizable stock of covered bank bonds under 
the APP .48 Moreover, for quite some time now, 
the Eurosystem has replaced a significant frac -
tion of the longer- term financing needs of insti -
tutions that they would otherwise cover, at 
least in part, in capital markets with various ser -
ies of long- term refinancing operations. And 
finally, full allotment in the Eurosystem’s refi -
nancing operations, recourse to which is not 
stigmatised in an equivalent manner, is avail -
able to a broad range of counterparties in the 
banking sector at comparatively favourable 
interest rates. This is why the exercise of mar -
ket discipline is less pronounced in the euro 
area compared to the United States. In the 
interest of an efficient allocation of resources, it 
seems advisable for the euro area to reduce Eu -
rosystem intermediation and return to a more 
market- based refinancing of banks, including 
through the interbank money market.
The positive developments in turnover in vari -
ous intermittent periods with declining levels of 
excess liquidity since 2009 suggest that the 
possibility of reviving the interbank money mar -
ket and simultaneously reducing the Eurosys -
tem’s role as an intermediary should not be ruled out in the long term. Even after 2009 
there were episodes in which the interbank 
money market was hardly impaired by monet -
ary policy conditions. For example, in the 
period between end-2010 and mid-2011 a sig -
nificant differential between the main refinan -
cing rate and the deposit facility rate meant 
that it was unprofitable for the majority of 
banks that were able to obtain short- term 
liquid ity via the markets to obtain short- term 
central bank refinancing.
The systematic reduction of excess liquidity, 
possibly in conjunction with a widening of the 
differential between the main refinancing rate 
and the deposit facility rate, could boost incen -
tives for liquidity adjustment between banks in 
the market. That said, it must be conceded that 
various adjustments in the regulatory treatment 
of interbank money market transactions have 
created conditions that could impede a revival 
of the interbank money market. However, it 
would be desirable in the medium term to 
strengthen market mechanisms in the refinan -
cing of banks and to contain the role of mon -
etary policy operations in the compliance by 
banks with regulatory standards.Objective of effi -

The performance of German credit 
institutions  in 2018
German credit institutions’ profitability deteriorated in 2018. Profit for the financial year before 
tax fell from €27.5 billion in 2017 to €18.9 billion in 2018. Thus, at 0.23% of total assets, the 
return on assets dipped to a level which, in recent times, was only lower during the financial cri -
sis. However, the last few years have been characterised by a period of above- average growth in 
profitability. An analysis over a longer period reveals that the return on assets corresponds to the 
average for the past 20 years.
The year- on- year decrease in profit for the financial year was primarily driven by a fall in three 
components: the trading result (-€2.1 billion), the result from the valuation of assets (-€3.1 billion) 
and the extraordinary result (-€3.5 billion). In the second half of 2018, a challenging market envir -
onment brought about by downward trends in the financial markets caused income from secur -
ities and financial investment business to suffer. According to information in credit institutions’ 
annual reports, this prompted them to step up risk provisioning for securities in the liquidity 
reserve. However, thanks to the continued favourable situation in the domestic economy, they set 
aside only minimal risk provisions for lending.
At €87.2 billion, net interest income remained below its long- term average. In directly interest-  
related business, German banks still managed to improve their result by €0.7 billion to €71.8 
billion. The net interest income of credit institutions with interest- driven business models, such as 
savings banks and credit cooperatives, however, stagnated despite dynamic credit growth. In 
comparison with the previous year, administrative spending remained roughly constant at €88.1 
billion.
This year, credit institutions have to overcome a number of hurdles: large and globally operating 
companies have issued profit warnings, while trade disputes are set to mount and, potentially, 
escalate. Yet the greatest challenge on the horizon is adjusting to a longer- term low interest rate 
environment.Deutsche Bundesbank

Banks’ business environment 
and structural data
The economy was markedly weaker in 2018, 
not only in Germany and in the euro area, but 
throughout the world. In addition, trade dis -
putes and heightened political tensions inflated 
risks to the economic outlook. However, the 
economic slowdown was confined to those 
economic areas associated with exports; the 
domestic economy remained in good shape.
This also explains how it was possible to con -
tinue recording robust credit growth despite the 
weak economy. Loan growth was particularly 
steep, especially for longer- term loans.1 The ex -
pansion of loans to non-  financial corporations 
and to households for house purchase was more 
dynamic than in 2017; however, the annual 
growth rate for consumer loans remained un -
changed.2 This was bolstered not just by the low 
interest rate environment, but also by rising in -
comes, job security and soaring real estate prices.
Despite a very accommodative monetary policy 
stance around the world, the market environ -
ment was particularly challenging, especially in 
the second half of 2018. During the reporting 
year, the S&P 500 fell by just over 6%, with the 
CDAX even declining by more than 20%. This 
was the biggest drop within one year for both 
indices since the 2008 financial crisis. The 
downward trend in stock markets, which could 
be seen in more haircuts on securities than in 
the previous year, also took its toll on the per -
formance of German banks.
The following analysis of credit institutions’ 
profit and loss accounts covers a total of 1,484 
institutions (previous year: 1,538 banks) with 
total assets of €8,062 billion derived from indi -
vidual accounts3 prepared in accordance with 
the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetz -
buch) .4 Total assets fell by 2.3% on the previ -
ous year (€8,251 billion). The financial market 
environment remained challenging, forcing the 
German banking sector to undergo a number 
of changes in 2018, too. With the prevailing low interest rates continuing and competitive 
pressure intensifying, also due to new competi -
tors from the fintech sector entering the mar -
ket, the need to cut costs and the trend to -
wards mergers did not let up. Changes in the 
banking sector during the reporting year were 
also reflected in statistical reclassifications, 
which often complicate year- on- year compari -
sons. As in previous years, the most mergers 
were reported by savings banks and credit co -
operatives. At the end of 2018, there were four 
fewer institutions in the savings bank sector 
and 40 fewer in the credit cooperative sector 
than at the beginning of the year. However, the 
total assets and share of the savings bank sec -
tor in the German banking market rose to 
€1,268 billion (previous year: €1,180 billion), or 
15.7% (previous year: 14.3%), in part due to 
Landesbank Berlin AG being assigned to this 
category of banks for the first time. Credit co -
operatives increased their total assets by €43.1 
billion to €911 billion and thus represented 
11.3% of the aggregate total assets across all 
categories of banks (previous year: 10.5%).
Two institutions that previously belonged to 
the category of Landesbanken have since been 
assigned to different categories of banks fol -

1 Among non- financial corporations, medium and long-  
term loans rose by €39 billion on balance in 2018, and 
short- term loans by €7 billion. Loans to households for 
house purchase rose by €54 billion on balance in the same 
period, and other loans by €9 billion. See Deutsche Bun -
desbank (2019a).
2 In December 2018, the annual growth rate of loans was 
5.3% for loans to domestic non- financial corporations, 
4.6% for loans to households for house purchase and 5.1% 
for consumer credit. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2019a).
3 Some, but not all, credit institutions also apply Inter -
national Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in addition to 
the provisions from the Commercial Code at the individual 
or group level for the group accounts. This can lead to dif -
ferent results due to a number of conceptual differences.

5 Following the sale of the former Landesbank HSH Nord -
bank to financial investors Cerberus and JC Flowers, it is

desbank Berlin AG, which has sold those lines of business 
that are typical for Landesbanken and now operates under 
the name “Berliner Sparkasse”, was assigned to the cat -
egory of savings banks for the first time in the reporting

Methodological notes
Data based on individual accounts 
prepared  in accordance with the German 
Commercial Code and on monthly balance 
sheet statistics 
The results from the profi  t and loss accounts are 
based on the published annual reports of the in-
dividual institutions in accordance with the pro-
visions set forth in the German Commercial 
Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) and the Regulation 
on the Accounting of Credit Institutions (Verord-
nung über die Rechnungslegung der Kreditinsti-
tute). They differ in terms of their conception, 
structure and defi  nitions from the International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)1 for publicly 
traded banking groups. This means that – from a 
methodological viewpoint – business perform-
ance and certain balance sheet or individual 
profi  t and loss items are not comparable across 
the national and international accounting frame-
works. For reasons of comparability within Ger-
many, it is advisable to consider the individual 
accounts when analysing fi  nancial performance. 
The fi  gures for balance sheet capital (total 
equity), total assets and other stock variables are 
not obtained from the annual reports but are 
taken as annual average values on the basis of 
the monthly balance sheet statistics reported for 
the institution as a whole.
Reporting group
The reporting group for statistics on banks’ 
profi  t and loss accounts (profi  t and loss statistics) 
includes all banks that are both monetary fi  nan-
cial institutions (MFIs) and conform to the defi  n-
ition of a CRR credit institution as defi  ned in Art-
icle 4(1) number 1 of Regulation (EU) No 575/ 2013 
and are domiciled in Germany. Branches of for-
eign banks that are exempted from the provi-
sions of Section 53 of the German Banking Act 
(Kreditwesengesetz), banks in liquidation and 
banks with a fi  nancial year of less than 12 months 
(truncated fi  nancial year) are not included in this 
performance analysis.
Reclassifi  cations
As in the monthly balance sheet statistics, a ser-
ies of reclassifi  cations in the banking categories 
included in the banking statistics were also car-
ried out in the profi  t and loss statistics in the 
2018 reporting year. This means there is some-times limited comparability with the prior- year 
fi  gures for the affected banking groups. “DB 
Privat- und Firmenkundenbank AG” was created 
through the merger between “Deutsche Bank 
Privat- und Geschäftskunden Aktiengesell-
schaft”, which had up to now been assigned to 
the “regional banks and other commercial 
banks” category, and “Postbank AG”, which had 
up to now been classifi  ed as a “big bank”. “DB 
Privat- und Firmenkundenbank AG” has been as-
signed to the category of “big banks” as of this 
reporting year. “DSK Hyp AG” (formerly “SEB 
AG”) is no longer assigned to the “regional 
banks and other commercial banks” category, 
and has instead been assigned to the “mortgage 
banks” category. Two banks have been re-
assigned from the “Landesbanken” category: 
“HSH Nordbank” now belongs to the “regional 
banks and other commercial banks” category 
and “Landesbank Berlin AG” has been assigned 
to the “savings banks” category. “Wüstenrot 
Bank Aktiengesellschaft Pfandbriefbank” no 
longer belongs to the “mortgage banks” cat-
egory, and has instead been assigned to the “re-
gional banks and other commercial banks” cat-
egory.
Calculation of the long- term average
At the launch of monetary union in 1999, the 
reporting group relevant for calculating the 
money supply and for monetary analysis was 
uniformly defi  ned by the ECB for the euro area 
as a whole and designated as the monetary 
fi  nancial  institutions (MFI) sector. Unlike the 
population of banks used for the Bundesbank 
analysis up to that point, building and loan asso-
ciations are also included. Except where another 
time period is explicitly mentioned, the calcula-
tions with regard to the longer- term average 
will, in future, cover the years since the launch of 
monetary union, i.e. from 1999 to 2018.
1 IFRS- based fi  nancial statements are of relevance, for 
instance, to matters of macroprudential analysis and 
oversight, concentrating on systemically important 
banks and their international business activities (includ-
ing their foreign subsidiaries). For details, see Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2013).Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
September 2019

The aggregate total assets of the Landesbank 
sector decreased from €940 billion to €804 bil -
lion. Altogether in 2018, the Landesbanken 
made up 10.0% of total assets across the entire 
reporting population, compared with 11.4% in 
the year before. The category of mortgage 
banks also changed following reclassifications6 
and changes to business policy as a result of 
legacy loans.7 Despite losing two institutions, 
the mortgage bank category continued, when 
measured in terms of total assets, to make up 
2.9% of all institutions, as in the previous year. 
Structural changes in the banking sector may 
also lead to shifts in the importance of lines of 
business and sources of income for the cat -
egories of banks. Following the merger of 
Deutsche Postbank AG with Deutsche Bank 
Privat- und Geschäftskunden AG,8 interest-  
driven business increased for the category of 
big banks. However, the total assets of this cat -
egory of banks fell from €2,400 billion to 
€2,293 billion, in particular due to declining de -
rivatives positions. Nevertheless, at 28.4% (pre -vious year: 29.1%), big banks still account for 
the largest share of the German banking sector 
in terms of total assets.

In 2018, German credit institutions reported 
profit for the financial year before tax of €18.9 
billion. Tax of around €6.8 billion was due, 
leaving profit for the financial year after tax of 
€12.2 billion. Thus, profit for the 2018 financial 
year decreased significantly in comparison with 
the previous year by 31.2% (before tax) and 
39.2% (after tax). None of the categories of 
banks were able to match their profit for the 
2017 financial year before tax. Big banks, in Significantly

particular, reported a considerable drop in 
profit for the financial year before tax in the 
reporting year: down by €1.7 billion to €1.1 bil -
lion. The regional and other commercial banks’ 
profit for the financial year contracted by €1.5 
billion to €2.2 billion. Before tax, the Landes -
banken even reported a loss for the financial 
year of €1.0 billion. Savings banks and credit 
cooperatives performed best in the reporting 
year; their profit for the financial year before 
tax amounted to €8.3 billion and €6.3 billion, 
respectively. This means that the figures for pri -
mary institutions9 were down on the year, too 
(by €1.6 billion and €0.9 billion, respectively).
Credit institutions topped up their reserves 
from profit for the financial year by a total of 
€8.4 billion (previous year: €12.7 billion). These 
allocations to the reserves contained net trans -
fers to the fund for general banking risks pursu -
ant to Section 340g of the Commercial Code10 
amounting to €6.8 billion, which are recog -
nised as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital 
under prudential regulations. In this profit and 
loss analysis, these allocations are interpreted 
as profit distribution.11 The business results thus 
meant a further strengthening of the regula -
tory equity base in 2018 as well. Taking into 
account the net losses brought forward of €4.7 
billion, the German banking sector shouldered 
a balance sheet loss of €1.0 billion in the re -
porting year. Credit institutions’ equity ratio12

6.27%.13 German credit institutions thus raised 
their average equity ratio – also in light 
of  tighter regulatory requirements set by 
 Basel III14 – for the seventh consecutive year.
The return on equity before tax, calculated as 
the ratio of profit for the financial year before 
tax to balance sheet equity, provides informa -
tion on the rate of return on the equity em -
ployed. As profit for the 2018 financial year fell 
far short of the amount recorded in the previ -
ous year and, at the same time, credit institu -
tions’ equity was much stronger than in the 
previous period, the return on equity before tax 
was also lower, slipping 1.89 percentage points 
to 3.74% (after tax: 2.40%). At 7.25% (previous 
year: 9.44%) and 8.20% (10.11%) before tax, 
the savings banks and credit cooperatives bore 
the best returns on equity, even if these were 
also lower than in the previous year. The return 
on equity declined considerably for the other 
categories of banks. For instance, it was down 
to 2.09% for mortgage banks (previous year: 5.49%), to 1.14% for big banks (2.88%) and, 
above all, to -2.45% for Landesbanken (1.85%) 
on the back of the loss they generated for the 
financial year.
As cited above, one reason that returns on 
equity were lower was because credit institu -
tions had strengthened their equity base in pre -
vious years. Having a good equity base enables 
institutions to make the most of profitable in -
vestment opportunities that arise at short no -
tice and could have a positive impact on their 
future earnings potential. It also usually im -Return on equity

13 When interpreting the data on the equity base, which 
are calculated as annual average values, it should be borne 
in mind that the amounts transferred from the profit for 
the respective financial year do not increase the balance 
sheet equity until the year after the annual accounts are 
adopted, while withdrawals from equity items are to be 
deducted when the annual accounts are prepared at the 
latest.
14 The capital conservation buffer to be maintained was 
increased from 1.25% in 2017 to 1.875% in 2018. The 
phase- out of capital positions which are no longer eligible 
under the Basel III regulations and the phase- in of capital 
deductions also continued in 2018.Deutsche Bundesbank

proves financing conditions. Furthermore, with 
a sound equity base, German credit institutions 
can hedge the financial risk of unexpected 
losses. Given the challenging profitability situ -
ation, this is essential, particularly in case the 
economy takes a turn for the worse.
German credit institutions reported a return on 
assets (ratio of profit for the financial year be -
fore tax to total assets) of 0.23% in 2018. Thus 
both the return on equity and the return on 
assets were at their lowest level since 2010. 
The Landesbanken and big banks generated 
the lowest return on assets (-0.13% and 0.05%, 
respectively). The primary institutions gener -ated the highest return on assets, although it 
clearly fell for both savings banks (from 0.84% 
to 0.65%) and credit cooperatives (from 0.84% 
to 0.70%). Although these figures are much 
worse than in the previous year, the primary 
institutions were still more profitable than on 
average since 1999. Mortgage banks (0.09%) 
are among the categories of banks with lower 
earnings; however, in a long- term comparison, 
their return on assets in 2018 was above aver -
age. In comparison, other categories of banks 
performed rather poorly in the reporting year.

(0.11%) failed to match either the prior- year fig -
ure or the long- term average for their category, 
as did the big banks and Landesbanken.
Lower cost efficiency
The cost/ income ratio provides an indication of 
institutions’ cost efficiency. It is the ratio of ad -
ministrative spending to gross earnings15 (nar-
row definition) or to operating income16 (broad 
definition). The lower this ratio, the more in -
come is left over after deducting administrative 
spending and the more cost- efficiently the en -terprise has been operating. The efficiency of 
the German banking sector under the narrow 
definition improved from 76.2% to 75.5% on 
the back of an increase in gross earnings and a 
nominal decrease in administrative spending. 
Under the broad definition, it deteriorated from 
71.9% to 73.1%, as trading results and other 
operating results were down on the previous 
year.
When interpreting the cost/ income ratio, it 
should be borne in mind that its magnitude is 
influenced by the typical business and cost 
structure of a given category of banks. Al -
though big banks should benefit from econ -
omies of scale, they have been among the 
banks with the worst cost/ income ratio for 
years. However, during the year under review, 
they were able to slightly improve their 
cost/ income ratio under the broad definition 
from 88.7% to 87.9%. Regional banks and 
other commercial banks also improved from 
67.8% to 66.1%. However, significant changes 
in cost efficiency in comparison with the previ -
ous year can usually be attributed to changes 
in the reporting sample and special effects. The 
cost/ income ratio of mortgage banks improved 
strikingly from 70.2% to 59.8% due to the im -
proved net interest income of one institution. 
By contrast, the cost efficiency of the Landes -
banken deteriorated markedly from 72.5% to 
76.5%, as the composition of this category of 
banks changed significantly. For building and 
loan associations, the cost/ income ratio under 
the broad definition deteriorated sharply in 
comparison to 2016 and 2017 (from 66.2% 
and 66.3%, respectively, to 88.6%), as elevated 
withdrawals in those years from the fund re -
quired by the building and loan association 
rules were booked as income.

is much to suggest that cost efficiency among 
German institutions continues to be weak. In 
a  European comparison of 190 large institu -
tions carried out by the European Banking 
Author ity (EBA),17 the group of 20 German in -
stitutions included  in the sample had the worst 
cost/  income ratio. At over 80%,18 it was well 
above the average of 64.6% for the European 
sample as a whole.
Breakdown of profit for the 
financial year
Net interest income lower 
than average
Interest income in the narrower sense is gener -
ated by directly interest- related business, i.e. by 
lending and money market transactions and by 
fixed- income securities and debt register claims. 
During the year under review, the deposit facil -
ity remained at -0.40% and institutions con -
tinued to receive negative interest income on a 
portion of their invested funds, particularly de -
posits held at the central bank.19
German institutions’ interest income from dir -
ectly interest- related business increased on the 
previous year by €1.3 billion to €152.2 billion. It 
thus went up for the first time since 2011, but 
this was solely attributable to developments in 
the big banks category. Their interest income in 
the narrower sense rose by €5.9 billion to a 
total of €29.4 billion. First of all, the signifi -
cance of directly interest- related business for 
big banks increased due to the change in the 
composition of this category of banks. Further -
more, big banks disclosed in their annual re -
ports that they generated higher interest in -
come in their business with banks in the United 
States. Other categories of banks were unable 
to boost their income in directly interest- related 
business, despite higher lending growth. For 
example, this income fell from €25.6 billion to 
€25.0 billion (2.18% of total assets to 1.97%) 
for savings banks, from €18.6 billion to €18.0 
billion (2.14% to 1.96%) for credit coopera -tives, and even more significantly from €7.9 bil -
lion to €7.0 billion (3.34% to 2.99%) for mort -
gage banks. The low interest rates continued 
to lead to lower interest income, as institutions 
became increasingly unable to benefit from 
loans that were issued when interest rates were 
higher. Furthermore, maturing proprietary in -
vestments such as securities and promissory 
notes had to be replaced by lower- yielding in -
vestments.
Lending growth was dynamic in the year under 
review, and the demand for savings and loan 
contracts also increased. The targeted savings 
amounts under these contracts could therefore Cost efficiency

17 The sample is reviewed annually, includes only large in -
stitutions, and is therefore not representative of the entire 
German banking market or the entire European banking 
market. See European Banking Authority (2018). The aver -
age cost/ income ratio for German banks according to the 
profit and loss statistics is 75.5% under the narrow defin -
ition and 73.1% under the broad definition, which is better 
than the level determined by the EBA for 20 large German 
financial institutions.
18 In its analysis, the EBA calculates the cost/ income ratio 
as administrative and depreciation expenses in relation to 
total net operating income.
19 The treatment of negative interest in the profit and loss 
account under the Regulation on the Accounting of Credit 
Institutions (Verordnung über die Rechnungslegung der 
Kreditinstitute und Finanzdienstleistungsinstitute)  has yet to 
be decided. Offsetting expenses against income and assets 
against liabilities is prohibited by Section 246(2) sentence 1 
of the Commercial Code. If interest income is reported in

(+1.5%, after +0.9% in 2017 and +0.7% in 
2016). This development reflected not only 
higher real estate prices but also the increasing 
use of savings and loan contracts by consumers 
to secure the current low lending rates for fu -
ture loans. At the same time, owing to the 
negative interest rate environment and the zero 
lower bound for deposits, the interest paid on 
deposits in new savings and loan contracts in 
the year under review were similar to the de -
posit rates for alternative forms of deposit.
Lending business makes a positive contribution 
to net interest income, as lending rates contain a mark-  up on the yields obtainable from a 
comparable alternative investment in the 
money market or financial market (assets- side 
margin contribution).20 Owing, in particular, to 
the competitive pressure in the banking mar -
ket, margins on new loans narrowed further in 
2018, irrespective of debtors’ creditworthi -
ness.21 According to institutions, however, mar -
gins on riskier loans eased to a lesser extent.Margins in

In addition to income from directly interest-  
related business, interest income also includes 
current income22 and income from profit trans -
fers.23 This item also includes distributed in -
come from group companies or subsidiaries.24 
In the year under review, current income fell by 
€1.0 billion to €10.0 billion, while profit trans -
fers climbed by €2.0 billion overall to €5.4 bil -
lion. This increase was driven by a one- off ef -
fect among big banks resulting from a transfer 
of reserves pursuant to Section 340g of the 
Commercial Code from one big bank to an -
other. The bulk of this transferred profit there -
fore did not result from operational business 
and so cannot be interpreted as having en -
hanced profitability during the year under re -
view.
Overall, German institutions’ interest income in 
the year under review rose by €2.2 billion to 
€167.6 billion (2.08% of total assets, compared 
with 2.00% in the previous year). Big banks in -
creased their interest income significantly from 
1.26% of total assets (€30.2 billion) to 1.65% 
(€37.9 billion), and regional and other commer -
cial banks raised theirs from 2.25% (€25.6 bil -
lion) to 2.45% (€25.6 billion). Compared to the 
previous year, Landesbanken also boosted their 
interest income relative to total assets (from 
2.74% in 2017 to 3.08%). By contrast, interest 
income fell for savings banks (from 2.42% to 
2.17%, or from €28.6 billion to €27.5 billion), 
for credit cooperatives (from 2.33% to 2.13%, 
or from €20.3 billion to €19.4 billion) and for 
mortgage banks (from 3.35% to 2.99%, or 
from €7.9 billion to €7.0 billion).
Due to the exceptional interest rate environ -
ment, some institutions increasingly charged 
negative interest on large corporate deposits 
and, in some cases, on large deposits made by 
wealthy retail customers as well in the year 
under review.25 Almost a third of less significant 
institutions stated that they had, on average, 
already charged negative interest on overnight 
deposits as at the end of 2018.26 According to 
the MFI interest rate statistics, institutions in 
December 2018 charged an interest rate of -0.03% for new overnight deposits from non-  
financial corporations, compared to -0.02% in 
January of the same year. Nevertheless, the vol -
ume of overnight deposits increased from €430 
billion to €446 billion. For retail deposits, how -
ever, negative interest rates were still the ex -
ception. In December 2018, institutions offered 
an interest rate of 0.02% on average for new 
overnight deposits from retail customers. In 
January of the same year, it was 0.03%. The 
deposit interest rate for the majority of retail 
deposits in 2018 thus often exceeded the 
(negative) market rate. Deposits in the report -
ing year therefore still constituted an attractive 
form of investment from the perspective of re -
tail customers, with the volume increasing from 
€1,319 billion to €1,433 billion.
Much like the handling of negative interest in -
come, positive and negative interest expend -
iture is netted out in the figures reported by 
institutions. In spite of the negative amounts 
factored into the net figure, interest expend -
iture in 2018, at €80.5 billion, was up 0.7% 
compared to the previous year, in particular 
due to an increase in interest expenditure at 
big banks.27 Yields on bank bonds increased 
marginally by 18 basis points, while yields on 
mortgage Pfandbriefe rose by 13 basis points.28
Interest expenditure was higher than in the 
previous year for big banks (from 0.66% of 
total assets to 0.83%, or from €13.8 billion to 
€18.1 billion), regional and other commercial 
banks (from 0.89% to 0.98%, or from €9.3 bil -
lion to €9.4 billion), and Landesbanken (from Current income

2.02% to 2.42%, or from €19.0 billion to €19.4 
billion). Interest expenditure was lower for sav -
ings banks (from 0.56% to 0.44%, or from 
€6.6 billion to €5.6 billion) and credit coopera -
tives (from 0.43% to 0.33%, or from €3.8 bil -
lion to €3.0 billion), but it fell to a lesser extent 
than interest income.
The institutions engaged in a high degree of 
maturity transformation in the year under re -
view. In the prevailing low interest rate environ -
ment, customers preferred to invest their 
money in sight deposits they can access at 
short notice, as this allows them to flexibly 
move their funds when interest rates rise. At 
the end of 2018, the sight deposits of German 
non- banks exceeded their time deposits by 
70%, whereas the ratio at the end of 2010 was 
still balanced.29 This contrasts with the in -
creased demand for loans with a long interest 
rate fixation period30 to lock in the low interest 
rate level. At the end of 2018, 81.6% of loans 
issued by German institutions to domestic cus -tomers were loans of a long- term nature, 
whereas this figure was just 75.7% at the end 
of 2010.
However, the interest rate environment, par -
ticularly the flat yield curve and the zero lower 
bound for retail deposits, hampered the gener -
ation of income from maturity transformation. 
The already rather flat yield curve flattened fur -
ther during the reporting year. The yield on 
bearer debt securities outstanding with a re -
sidual maturity of more than one year and up 
to two years increased between December 
2017 and December 2018 from -0.6% to 
-0.4%; at the same time, the yield on bearer 
debt securities outstanding with a residual ma -
turity of more than nine years and up to ten 
years fell from 0.5% to 0.4%. The interest rate 
differential therefore narrowed to 0.8 percent -High degree of

age point. For institutions that did not pass on 
negative interest rates at the short end to their 
depositors, the earnings potential offered by 
maturity transformation was even more limited.
Net interest income, which is still the most im -
portant income component for German banks, 
is calculated by netting out interest income and 
interest expenditure. It amounted to €87.2 bil -
lion in the year under review, representing an 
interest margin (net interest income in relation 
to total assets) of 1.08%. On account of their 
interest- based business model, primary institu -
tions contributed a substantial proportion of 
this amount: €38.3 billion in total, compared to 
€38.5 billion in the previous year. However, 
savings banks and credit cooperatives were less 
profitable in the field of interest business than 
in the previous year and compared to their 
long- term average, with their interest margins 
falling to 1.73% and 1.80%, respectively, from 
1.87% and 1.90% in the previous year. By con -
trast, big banks increased their contribution to 
the aggregate net interest income of the Ger -
man banking sector due to the increased sig -
nificance of interest business as a result of mer -
gers. Overall, the net interest income of big 
banks increased by €3.4 billion to €19.8 billion, 
i.e. from 0.68% of total assets in the previous 
year to 0.86%. However, more than half of the 
difference to the previous year is explained by 
the aforementioned one- off effect. Without 
this one- off effect, the interest rate margin of 
this category of banks would only have risen to 
0.77%. In addition, regional and other com -
mercial banks made a significant contribution 
to the net interest income of the German bank -
ing sector with €14.2 billion, which corres -
ponds to an interest margin of 1.47% (previous 
year: 1.36%). Mortgage banks’ interest- related 
business was also more profitable than in the 
previous year. Their net interest income in -
creased from €1.4 billion, or 0.58% of total 
assets, in the previous year to €1.7 billion, or 
0.74% of total assets. In this context, factors 
such as the progressive scaling- back of one in -
stitution that has not taken on any new busi -
ness in several years had a positive impact. Ac -cording to information provided in their annual 
reports, mortgage banks also benefited from 
good financing opportunities in the bond mar -
ket and the Pfandbrief market. Overall, how -
ever, the net interest income of the German 
banking sector in the year under review re -
mained lower than its long- term average, des -
pite higher volumes in traditional lending busi -
ness for some categories of banks and the still 
favourable financing conditions for institutions 
financed by the capital markets. Income was 
adversely affected, amongst other things, by 
the fact that institutions passed on negative 
interest rates to depositors to only a minor ex -
tent and that strong competition limited earn -
ings potential in lending business.

Overview of the results of the 2019 LSI stress test
Since 2013, the Bundesbank and the Fed-
eral Financial Supervisory Authority have 
been surveying the German credit institu-
tions under their direct supervision every 
two years on the impact of the low interest 
rate environment. This year, around 1,400 
small and medium- sized credit institutions 
(less signifi  cant institutions, or LSIs) took 
part in the supervisory LSI stress test as well 
as the associated survey on the profi  t out-
look and resilience.
The aim of the survey was to gain a com-
prehensive insight into the individual profi  t 
expectations of participating credit institu-
tions and to identify at an early stage poten-
tial risks that might arise, above all, in a set-
ting of persistently low interest rates. The 
results will be taken into account in future 
supervisory activities.
As part of the survey, credit institutions’ 
planning and forecast data as well as earn-
ings simulations were obtained for fi  ve 
interest rate scenarios defi  ned by super-
visors (constant interest rate level, positive 
interest rate shock of +200 basis points, 
negative interest rate shock of -100 basis 
points and inverse turn in the yield curve, 
each as at 1  January 2019, as well as a 
gradual interest rate rise of 40 basis points 
annually); static balance sheet structures 
were assumed over a period from 2019 to 
2023.
The evaluations of the planning and fore-
cast data show that the low interest rate 
environment continues to put German 
credit institutions under considerable strain, 
particularly those with business models that 
are predominantly reliant on interest in-
come. At the starting point of the survey, 
the return on total assets (ratio of pre- tax 
profi  t for the fi  nancial year to total assets) 
was already at a historic low of 0.42%. 
Over the fi  ve- year planning horizon, the in-stitutions still expect the return on total 
assets to climb slightly to 0.46%, despite 
planned balance sheet growth of around 
12%. However, roughly half of the institu-
tions anticipate that the interest rate level 
will rise, considerably in some cases, com-
pared with the survey cut- off date. This was 
a refl  ection of the market expectations pre-
vailing when the survey was conducted in 
the second quarter of 2019; however, given 
the prospective interest rate developments 
since then, the planning forecasts of these 
institutions are likely, in hindsight, to have 
been too optimistic. On the other hand, in-
stitutions that were not expecting an inter-
est rate reversal in the survey period there-
fore also projected a signifi  cantly more con-
servative development in net interest in-
come. These institutions would only 
manage to stabilise the return on total 
assets at roughly the current level by scaling 
back the build- up of contingency reserves.
Compared with the previous survey, many 
more institutions now also plan to pass on 
negative interest rates on deposits. While 
only about one in four institutions were 
considering this in 2017, more than 40% 
of  institutions now state that they have 
already  priced negative interest rates on 
deposits  into their planning forecasts. This 
proportion even increases to around two- 
thirds should the interest rate level continue 
to fall.
Overall, the tendency seen in previous years 
towards increased risk- taking is continuing. 
For around one- third of the institutions par-
ticipating in the survey, the individual plans 
envisage a decrease in the (sometimes com-
fortably met) common equity tier 1 capital 
ratios up until 2023, particularly due to 
the  planned increase in the ratio of risk- 
weighted assets to total assets.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
September 2019

At present, banks are still earning adequate 
margins on housing loans, especially from 
higher- interest existing business. In terms of 
collateralisation, there is evidence of a mod-
erate rise in loan- to- value ratios for new 
business over the past three years.
Institutions also plan to increase net fee and 
commission income to stabilise their earn-
ings. At the same time, administrative ex-
penses are expected to be only marginally 
higher in comparison to growth in total 
assets.
A comparison of the supervisory interest 
rate scenarios shows that all scenarios en-
tailing rising interest rates have a positive 
impact on the return on total assets in the 
medium to long term. In the short term, 
however, interest rate rises have a negative 
impact due to valuation effects on securities 
caused by discounting and may also poten-
tially lead to additional credit losses, espe-
cially for institutions that take more risk. In 
addition, interest rate rises reduce net inter-
est income in the short run as a result of 
maturity transformation. Even if interest 
rates were to rise gradually, net interest in-
come would only start to recover in the me-
dium to long term. This is due mainly to the 
combination of long interest rate fi  xation 
periods on the assets side and short interest 
rate fi  xation periods for customer deposits. 
As a result of this, the interest rate on 
shorter- term liabilities adjusts to the new 
interest rate level more rapidly than the 
interest rate on longer- term assets.
Furthermore, the simulations show that a 
drop – signifi  cant in some cases – in profi  t-
ability would be likely in the medium to 
long term given a persistent or intensifying 
low interest rate environment and in the 
event of an inverse turn in the yield curve. 
The longer the low interest rate setting 
lasts, the more persistent the repercussions 
for profi  tability and hence also for capital 
accumulation. At present, this is still being 
counteracted by good capitalisation and suffi   cient risk provisioning at the majority of 
institutions.
In addition to the survey, simulations on 
material risk categories and drivers of in-
come were collected in the core part of the 
LSI stress test (particularly net interest in-
come and net fee and commission income 
as well as credit and market risk), in each 
case applying  a macroeconomic baseline 
and stress scenario defi  ned by supervisors 
for a three- year time horizon. The German 
LSI stress test (with its two supervisory scen-
arios) thus complies with the harmonisation 
of supervisory LSI stress tests that is being 
pursued in the SSM. The aim is to test the 
credit institutions’ resilience, taking into 
account  adverse stress factors such as an 
increase in defaults in the credit portfolio as 
well as a sudden rise in credit spreads or 
falling asset prices. Thus, over a three- year 
stress horizon, the aggregate common 
equity tier 1 capital ratio would fall from 
16.5% in 2018 to 13.0% in 2021. The main 
driver of this decrease is the assumed in-
crease in write- downs in the credit port-
folio. The LSI stress test results are subject 
to an extensive supervisory quality assur-
ance process and are used as part of the 
Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process 
(SREP) to determine the Pillar 2 guidance, 
amongst other things. Institutions with es-
pecially noteworthy results are subjected to 
intensifi  ed supervision.
As in 2017, data on other side effects of the 
low interest rate environment were col-
lected this year. The focus was on lending 
for residential and commercial real estate as 
well as developments in lending standards 
in corporate lending business. Further infor-
mation on the results of the LSI stress test 
and the surveys on real estate and lending 
standards is available on the Bundesbank’s 
website at https://www.bundesbank.de/en/

vision of services to customers. Account man -
agement fees are an example of this. Institu -
tions generated further commission income 
from the brokerage of real estate, savings and 
loan contracts and insurance. Furthermore, net 
commission income is boosted when custom -
ers conduct securities or custody transactions. 
Commission expenses arise when the bank it -
self makes use of services, for example for sales 
and brokerage. The net commission income 
generated by German institutions in 2018 fell 
by €1.0 billion on the previous year to €29.5 
billion, but in relation to total assets just man -
aged to stay on a par with the previous year’s 
level at 0.37%. Net commission income there -
fore made up only one quarter of operating in -
come, as in the previous year. In non- interest 
business, too, competition is likely to have in -
creased and led to falling commission margins, 
particularly for payment transactions and 
standardised products that customers require 
little advice for.The gradual introduction of account manage -
ment fees continued to be a key factor contrib -
uting to primary institutions’ commissions busi -
ness. For savings banks, the changed reporting 
sample also had a substantial impact. The net 
commission income of savings banks and credit 
cooperatives increased from €7.6 billion and 
€5.0 billion to €8.8 billion and €5.2 billion, re -
spectively. Their commission margins (net com -
mission income in relation to total assets) are 
the highest of all the various categories of 
banks at 0.63% and 0.57%, respectively, and 
remained virtually unchanged on the previous 
year.31 Due to changes in the reporting sample, 
the net commission income of big banks in -
creased by €0.4 billion to a total of €10.6 bil -
lion, or 0.46% of total assets. As in previous 
years, big banks were the category of banks 
generating the largest share of operating in -
come from commissions business, at 34.5%. By 
contrast, the net commission income of re -
gional banks and other commercial banks fell 
by €1.9 billion to €3.8 billion. In addition to 
changes in the reporting sample, the outsour -
cing of consultancy and sales services by indi -
vidual regional and other commercial banks 
was a significant factor here. The commission 
margin of this category of banks fell from 
0.54% to 0.40%, well below the long-  term 
average. For building and loan associations and 
mortgage banks, commissions paid in the year 
under review once again exceeded commis -
sions received. Net commission income for 
these institutions was once again negative, 
standing at -0.21% and -0.03% of total assets, 
respectively, as these institutions made a 
greater number of commission payments for 
the brokerage of real estate financing.Net commission

31 The commission margin, however, needs to be inter -
preted with caution, as the stock of banking assets, i.e. 
total assets, is practically unaffected by commissions busi -
ness. However, as the commission margin and changes in 
it also depend on total assets, using the commission mar -
gin to draw conclusions about the significance and devel -
opment of non- interest business is only possible to a 
limited extent. A more meaningful assessment is possible 
through an additional comparison of net commission in -
come and net interest income or of net commission in -

Administrative spending 
remains  high
Administrative spending encompasses staff 
costs and other administrative spending, in -
cluding depreciation of and value adjustments 
to tangible and intangible assets, but excluding 
depreciation of and value adjustments to assets 
leased. At 50.2%, staff costs accounted for just 
over half of German institutions’ administrative 
spending. Alongside the rise in negotiated 
wages and salaries, higher social security costs 
and spending on pensions32 also limited the 
scope for reducing staff costs. In addition, de -
mand for highly qualified staff increased owing 
to digitalisation campaigns and the need to im -
plement supervisory requirements.33 Socially re -
sponsible staff cutbacks, through phased retire -
ment contracts, for instance, and smaller bonus 
payments nonetheless also resulted in total 
staff costs declining slightly by €0.3 billion to 
€44.3 billion in 2018.
On aggregate, other administrative spending 
remained unchanged at €43.8 billion.34 How -
ever, at big banks, it increased significantly on 
the year from €14.8 billion to €16.3 billion, but 
dropped from €8.3 billion to €6.9 billion for re -
gional and other commercial banks. The differ -
ences stemmed mainly from merger- based 
changes to reporting groups35 among these 
categories of banks. In much the same way as 
for the primary institutions, the retail- oriented 
business model of the institution classified as a 
big bank for the first time in 2018 causes higher 
administrative expenses. Other administrative 
spending includes, for example, investment in 
product development, information technology, 
and digitalisation. This expenditure is used to 
maintain long- term competitiveness and boost 
future cost efficiency or market power in the 
hope that these factors will have a positive im -
pact on profitability in the years to come. This 
item also covers the costs arising from reorgan -
isation and restructuring measures, such as 
consultancy fees and severance payments. 
Other expenses stemmed from the need to 
adapt to new regulatory requirements. Clos -ures of branches and offices reduced other ad -
ministrative spending in 2018, resulting in 
lower costs for maintaining premises.
General administrative spending decreased 
from €88.4 billion in 2017 to €88.1 billion. In 
relation to total assets, it reached 1.09% – its 
highest level since 2003 (previous year: 1.07%). 
During the reporting year, it remained highest 
at the primary institutions, although, in a long-

1.69% to 1.65%) and credit cooperatives (from 
1.66% to 1.59%), as in the previous years. 
These institutions have a very dense network of 
branches and appear to have made significant 
savings by thinning them down over the last 
few years. The number of branches fell from a 
total of 20,711 at the end of 2016 to 18,434 at 
the end of 2018. The group of Landesbanken 
affected by structural changes likewise reduced 
administrative spending to 0.68% of total 
assets. However, from a long- term perspective, 
the expenditure of the Landesbanken remained 
above average. The group of mortgage banks 
affected by reorganisation and restructuring 
measures saw administrative costs rise to 
0.42% of total assets (previous year: 0.38%). 
For big banks, at 1.17% of total assets, admin -
istrative costs not only exceeded the previous 
year’s figure (1.06%), but also the long- term 
average.Deterioration in the net result 
from the trading portfolio
At €3.5 billion, or 2.9% of operating income, 
the net result from the trading portfolio made 
only a very small contribution to operating in -
come in 2018. Compared to the previous year, 
the trading result was €2.1 billion lower; in re -
lation to total assets, it fell from 0.07% to 
0.04%. The institutions’ trading result was 
hampered, in particular, by losses from secur -
ities transactions that could not be offset by 
interest- related and foreign exchange business. 
The trading result represented a major com -
ponent of income for big banks (at €2.2 billion, 
or 7.2% of operating income) and Landesban -
ken (at €0.6 billion, or €8.8% of operating in -
come) only. Although, together, both categor -
ies of banks continued to generate the lion’s 
share (81.6%) of the overall trading result, the 
trading result in relation to total assets none -
theless sank from 0.15% to 0.10% for big banks 
and from 0.11% to 0.08% for the Landesban -
ken.
During the reporting year, the institutions again 
mainly carried out own- account trading in fi -
nancial instruments on behalf of clients. Some 
institutions scaled back or abandoned propri -
etary trading altogether.36 The latter was partly 
due to balance sheet reduction requirements 
imposed by the European Commission in the 
context of EU state aid procedures. In addition, 
changes to business policy are likely to have 
had a dampening effect on proprietary trading 
during the reporting year, owing to stricter 
regulatory requirements, amongst other fac -
tors. The trading result has become less volatile 
over the last few years, but has continued to 
experience fluctuations. While the institutions 
achieved a profit of €11.4 billion in 2005 but 
recorded a loss of €18.7 billion in 2008, the 
trading result has fluctuated during the past Reduced trading

36 Proprietary trading covers all transactions in financial 
instruments carried out by the credit institution in its own 
name and on its own behalf. It is not performed on behalf 
of clients; instead, its purpose is to generate short- term 
profits. However, it also involves the risk of losses.Deutsche Bundesbank

2016 and €7.1 billion in 2012.
Other operating income low
The other operating result is a summary item 
used to record income and charges from oper -
ating business that have no connection to net 
interest income, net commission income or the 
trading result.37 Aggregated across all banks, it 
fell from €1.3 billion to just €0.4 billion (0.3% 
of operating income). It was therefore also sub -
stantially lower than its long- term average of 
€2.1 billion and boosted the profitability of 
German institutions only slightly during the re -
porting year (0.01% in relation to total assets 
after 0.02% the year before). Leasing transac -
tions made a significant contribution, particu -
larly at car financing institutions (just under 
€0.2 billion). Commodities transactions by 
credit cooperatives generated just under €0.2 
billion. Other business lines, including real es -
tate business, generated €0.3 billion. Other 
taxes reduced the balance by €0.2 billion.
In the reporting year, the other operating result 
contributed significantly to the result from on -
going business operations at regional and other 
banks only; however, amounting to €0.98 bil -
lion, or 5.1% of operating income, it was there -
fore also lower than in the previous year for 
this category of banks. Positive other operating 
results were also reported by savings banks 
(€0.7 billion, or 0.06% of total assets), credit 
cooperatives (€0.4 billion, or 0.04%) and Lan -
desbanken (€0.2 billion, or 0.02%). The big 
banks, by contrast, reported a negative balance 
of -€1.9 billion; this was equivalent to -6.1% of 
operating income, or -0.08% of total assets. In 
their annual reports, they attributed this to ex -
penses from the marking- up of provisions, 
transfers to provisions for litigation and re -
course risks, and changes in value arising from 
non- trading derivatives. For building and loan 
associations, this item contracted significantly 
to €14 million in comparison to the two pre -
ceding years, in which it had amounted to €707 million and €717 million, respectively. In 
both 2016 and 2017, building and loan associ -
ations had made considerable withdrawals 
from the fund required by the building and 
loan association rules;38 the other operating re -
sult reported by the building and loan associ -
ations in these preceding years was higher by

also contains withdrawals from and transfers to the fund

Deterioration in the net 
valuation  result
At -€6.7 billion, or -0.08% of total assets, the 
net valuation result39 in 2018 was favourable in 
a long- term comparison, reflecting the fact 
that, although the economy was slower, it re -
mained robust. However, the burden was €3.1 
billion higher than the year before.
In particular, the profitability of individual insti -
tutions40 with legacy shipping loans was con -
siderably curtailed by the need for provisioning. 
It was necessary to recognise loss allowances 
as part of the restructuring of non- performing 
loans, but also owing to higher economic risks, 
including those stemming from escalating trade 
disputes. During the reporting year, in order to 
improve portfolio quality, the institutions fol -
lowed up on or made the decision to sell parts 
of their non- performing shipping loans to in -
vestors or special purpose entities.Overall, however, the institutions only made 
minimal additional risk provisions in lending 
business. According to sectoral data, the fact 
that the domestic economy remained in good 
shape and business and consumer insolvency 
figures were in decline,41 leading to positive 
credit risk developments, meant that write- ups 
were even permitted in some cases owing to 
the need to reverse individual and general pro -
visions for lending business. Generally speak -
ing, the level of credit risk provisioning was 
thus very low in 2018.
In their annual reports, a large number of Ger -
man institutions reported higher write- downs42 
and value adjustments for securities in the li -
quidity reserve which, owing to yield increases 
and the general downward trend in the capital 
markets, were particularly necessary in the 
second half of 2018. According to the annual 
reports, some institutions compensated for the 
large haircuts on these securities partly by re -
versing undisclosed reserves pursuant to Sec -
tion 340f of the Commercial Code. Nonethe -
less, overall, these reserves were stocked up 
during the year.
The largest contributions to the negative net 
valuation result of the German banking sector 
were made by the Landesbanken, at -€2.6 bil -
lion, or -0.33% of total assets, and by regional 
and other commercial banks, at -€1.6 billion, or 
-0.16% of total assets. Alongside the decline in 
stock prices at the end of the reporting year,

The impact of fi  ntech innovations on profi  tability 
in the banking sector
In recent years, fi  ntech innovations have 
taken on an increasingly important role in 
banking business. Fintech innovations are 
technology- driven innovations in banking 
products, applications and processes, which 
even go as far as fi  nancial agents adopting 
previously unknown business models.1
Fintech innovations often initially result in 
higher costs due to the necessary invest-
ment in IT restructuring operations. In the 
medium term, however, they lead to cost 
savings, e.g. by increasing the automation 
of business processes, enhancing the qual-
ity of individual processes and exploiting 
specialisation effects – by stepping up co-
operation with other service providers, for 
instance. New sources of revenue are also 
conceivable, e.g. through new or improved 
products, new business areas and access to 
supraregional markets via online services.
However, fi  ntech innovations can also have 
a negative impact on banks’ profi  tability. 
Greater competition posed by online ser-
vices and new market players, for example, 
increases pressure on margins and drives 
up  competition for specialised IT staff, in 
particular. The technology- driven business 
environ ment also makes it possible to run 
business models which focus on marketing 
fi  nancial services via large platforms, mean-
ing that a small number of providers can 
provide services to as many customers as 
they want, even across national borders, 
and thus ramp up competitive pressure 
even further.
In the German banking sector, it would ap-
pear based on various indicators that fi  n-
tech innovations are paving the way for 
major changes in the banking sector. For 
example, investment in IT infrastructure has 
risen signifi  cantly in recent years. Similarly, 
numerous collaborations between banks and other service providers have been ob-
served.2
But it is not yet possible to make any ro-
bust, general statement about the current 
impact of fi  ntech innovations on profi  tabil-
ity in the banking sector, as the scale of the 
actual phenomenon is diffi   cult to gauge 
due to a lack of appropriate defi  nitions. 
Moreover, the implications for profi  tability 
are highly complex and thus diffi   cult to ac-
count for in statistical terms. For example, 
the extent to which the impact of increased 
IT and cyber risks on banks’ profi  tability can 
be attributed to fi  ntech innovations requires 
some clarifi  cation.
There are additional obstacles to assessing 
how things will develop in future. Statistical 
observations in a dynamic market environ-
ment serve merely as snapshots and leave 
only very limited scope to draw conclusions 
on the evolution of business models and 
the competitive landscape. There is also un-
certainty regarding the impact of external 
factors such as future changes in tech-
nologies,3 customer behaviour and societal 
aspects .4 Unpredictable patterns of re-
sponse by the banking sector to external 
developments also render it diffi   cult to 
make medium- term forecasts.
1 The Financial Stability Board (FSB) defi  nes the term 
“fi  ntech” as “technologically enabled innovation in 
fi  nan cial services that could result in new business 
models, applications, processes or products with an 
associated material effect on fi  nancial markets and 
institu tions and the provision of fi  nancial services” 
(source: FSB Monitoring of FinTech, available online at 
https://www.fsb.org/work-of-the-fsb/
policy-development/additional-policy-areas/
monitoring-of-fintech/).
2 According to PwC’s fi  ntech cooperation radar, there 
were 197 new collaborations between banks and fi  n-
tech fi  rms in 2018 (projected value) compared with 
162 in 2017 and 22 in 2014, for example.

legacy risks from shipping loans. The Landes -
banken were the only category of banks whose 
net valuation result relative to total assets was 
worse in the reporting year than the long- term 
average, as in the preceding two years. Credit 
cooperatives (-€0.9 billion) and savings banks 
(-€0.7 billion), in particular, posted a distinctly 
more negative net valuation result in 2018 than 
in 2017. The net valuation result for mortgage 
banks also decreased significantly from €32 
million in the previous year to -€341 million in 
the reporting year (or from 0.01% of total 
assets the year before to -0.15%). In their an -
nual reports, the mortgage banks put the de -
terioration of their net valuation result down to 
the formation of specific provisions for legacy 
loans and provisions to better mitigate interest 
rate risk. In addition, the group of reporting in -
stitutions within the category of banks changed 
in comparison to the previous year. Building 
and loan associations, meanwhile, were able to 
improve their net valuation result, making a 
positive contribution of +€22 million to the 
profit for the financial year before tax of this 
category of banks. According to the informa -
tion in the annual reports, besides the low 
need for provisioning for building loans, the 
planned liquidation of financial and capital in -
vestments had a positive impact on the result, 
since the market values of the fixed- rate secur -
ities sold generally exceeded their nominal 
prices.
Deterioration in extraordinary 
result
Standing at -€6.9 billion, the balance in the 
extraordinary account43 markedly reduced 
banks’ net income. Big banks and regional and 
other commercial banks accounted for the bulk 
of this figure, at -€2.2 billion and -€2.7 billion, 
respectively. The result from financial invest -
ment business was negative at -€0.9 billion. 
This was €2.5 billion down on the previous 
year, reflecting the challenging financial market 
environment. In particular, value adjustments in 
respect of participating interests and securities treated as fixed assets were €2.2 billion lower 
and write- downs on such assets were €0.3 bil -
lion higher than in 2017. Charges arising from 
profit transfers were the main component of 
extraordinary profit and loss; they climbed by 
€1.4 billion to a total of €5.7 billion during the 
reporting year, clearly exceeding the previous 
year’s figure. The main influencing factor here 
was the expenditure entry for profit transfers at 
one big bank, which constituted the offsetting 
counterpart to an income entry for profit trans -
fers under net interest income at another big 
bank.44 Extraordinary profit or loss in the nar -
rower sense (-€0.5 billion)45 and the result from 
loss absorption (€0.2 billion) made a smaller 
contribution to the negative balance in the 
extraordinary account than in the previous 
year.
Outlook
Since the end of 2018, the economic outlook 
for Germany has become bleaker again. On -
going international trade disputes, which are 
curbing economic activity, as well as the uncer -
tainties associated with the United Kingdom’s 
planned withdrawal from the European Union 
are playing a part in this.

In light of the ongoing slowdown in the indus -
trial sector, a greater need for value adjust -
ments and write- downs in lending business 
and in banks’ securities trading is probably to 
be expected this year. To prepare for a poten -
tially prolonged economic downturn, institu -
tions need to price their loans in a risk-  
appropriate manner.
At its meeting in September 2019, the ECB 
Governing Council decided to lower the de -
posit facility rate by 10 basis points to -0.5%. It 
expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at 
their present or lower levels until it has seen 
the inflation outlook robustly converge to a 
level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within 
its projection horizon, and such convergence 
has been reflected in underlying inflation dy -
namics. In addition, it announced that net pur -
chases under the asset purchase programme would resume at a monthly pace of €20 billion 
from 1 November. Banks will therefore have to 
operate in an environment of persistently low 
interest rates, which is likely to include negative 
rates on deposits held at the central bank. Even 
the introduction of a two- tier system for re -
serve remuneration, which exempts part of 
credit institutions’ excess liquidity holdings 
from the negative deposit facility rate, will not 
fundamentally alter this key challenge.
Brexit will see banking activities relocated from 
the United Kingdom to the rest of the EU, 
which may change the competitive situation 
and market dynamics. Through further consoli -
dation, institutions can optimise processes and 
improve their competitiveness in the long term. 
They also need to cultivate or create a cus -
tomer focus by pressing ahead with digitalisa -
tion campaigns.Growing risks in
