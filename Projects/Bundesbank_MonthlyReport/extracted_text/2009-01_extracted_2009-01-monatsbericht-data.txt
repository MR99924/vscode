5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Industry
In response to the sharp deterioration in the
order situation, industry has now significantly
cut back its output. Following a further de-
cline in September and October, output fell
again by a seasonally adjusted 3.5% in No-
vember. On average, industrial output in Oc-
tober and November was 5.1% down on the
average of the third quarter. Hardly any major
sector of the economy has remained un-
affected by the economic slowdown recently.
Producers of intermediate and capital goods
reported very sharp losses in output, whereas
the consumer goods sector, which, as experi-
ence has shown, is less susceptible to cyclical
fluctuations, was less severely affected. Indus-
trial output in November was 7.0% down on
the year after calendar adjustment.
There was a further marked deterioration in
industrial orders in November. The seasonally
adjusted decline in demand for industrial
products, at 6.0%, was hardly any less pro-
nounced than at the beginning of the fourth
quarter. Taking the average of October and
November, industrial orders were 13.3% down
on the summer quarter. Compared with the
previous year, the volume of orders in No-
vember was down by nearly one-quarter in
calendar-adjusted terms. The decline in de-
mand affected foreign and domestic business
to much the same extent. In sectoral terms,
orders of intermediate and capital goods fell
substantially, whereas manufacturers of con-
sumer goods suffered limited losses.Output

6The sharp economic downturn also had a dis-
cernible dampening effect on industrial sales
in the fourth quarter. On an average of Octo-
ber and November, industrial turnover was
41/C252% down on the average of the third quar-
ter. While domestic sales have been declining
perceptibly since September, there has been a
dramatic decline in export business recently.
For example, nominal exports of goods in
November were more than 10% down on
the month in seasonally adjusted terms after
holding up at a high level up to that point.
The decline in imports, at 51/C252%, was less pro-
nounced. This meant that the foreign trade
surplus went down to 3103/C254billion in the re-
porting period, compared with 3153/C254billion
in the previous month.
Construction
Seasonally adjusted construction output in
November remained at the previous month’s
low level. Taking the average of October and
November, construction activity was 1.0%
down on the summer quarter. The decline in
output in civil engineering was greater than
that in the building industry. There are barely
any signs of stimulus for the construction in-
dustry at present after seasonally adjusted
construction demand in October – more re-
cent figures are unavailable at present – fell
back down to the depressed level recorded in
August.
Economy as a whole
There is likely to have been a sharp fall in real
GDP in the fourth quarter of 2008 after ad-
justment for seasonal and calendar effects.Economic conditions in Germany*

7The main reason for this was probably the
marked cutback in manufacturing output in
response to the perceptible decline in de-
mand both in Germany and abroad. The fact
that a large number of enterprises extended
their usual plant shutdown over the Christ-
mas holiday period also had a dampening
effect. Given the persistent weakness in de-
mand for housing construction, the construc-
tion sector was adversely affected by the now
cyclically weak trend in industrial construction
investment and the fact that public sector im-
pulses from the economic stimulus package,
adopted in November, had not yet had time
to take effect. The decline in activity in the
production sector also affected value added
in the services sector. Moreover, the unfavour-
able economic outlook had a negative impact
on private consumption, even though the re-
tail trade sector appeared satisfied on the
whole with its earnings from the 2008 Christ-
mas trading period and new passenger car
registrations rose sharply.
According to initial provisional data from the
Federal Statistical Office, real GDP went up,
on an annual average, by 1.3%, or 1.0%
after adjustment for working-day variations
in 2008, despite the marked slowdown in
economic activity in the second half of the
year. From a cyclical perspective, the year was
one of considerable contrasts; the dynamic
start to the year was followed by a slowdown
in economic activity which slid into a sharp
decline in output towards the end of the year.Labour market
The rapid economic slowdown is increasingly
taking its toll on the labour market. In De-
cember, the seasonally adjusted number of
persons out of work who are covered by the
statutory insurance scheme went up for the
second month in succession. Unlike in No-
vember, the increase was greater than the
decline in the number of unemployed per-
sons receiving the basic welfare allowance.
The total number of persons without work
showed a slight rise again for the first time in
three years, namely by 18,000 to 3.18 mil-
lion. The unemployment rate remained un-
changed at 7.6% (due to rounding). In 2008,
the unemployment rate, at 7.8%, was, on an
annual average, 1.2 percentage points lower
than in 2007.
The fact that the rise in unemployment was
not higher is probably due to the fact that en-
terprises are making increasing use of short-
time working arrangements. At all events,
there was a sharp rise in such registrations up
to December. According to an initial estimate
by the Federal Statistical Office, the season-
ally adjusted official employment figure
went up again slightly in November to 40.48
million, ie 483,000, or 1.2%, more than a
year earlier. There was, however, a further
decline in the willingness of enterprises to
recruit new staff. The Ifo employment barom-
eter showed a further perceptible decline in
December. There was also a considerable fall
in the number of job vacancies subject to
regular social security contributions reported
to the Federal Employment Agency.2008 annual

8Prices
Prices in the international crude oil markets fell
sharply again in December against the back-
drop of the continuing deterioration in the
global outlook for growth. On a monthly aver-
age, the spot price for Brent North Sea oil, at
US$44, was down US$11 on the November
figure. Prices had been tending to rise again
since the end of December, however. The
heightened geopolitical tensions and cutbacks
in production by the OPEC countries are also
likely to have played a part in this. As this
report went to press, the spot price stood at
US$461/C252. In the futures markets, the pre-
miums were still very high; US$93/C254was being
charged for six-month deliveries and US$181/C254
in the case of 18-month deliveries.
In November, seasonally adjusted import
prices were down by an average of 2.9% on
the month. This amounted to a year-on-year
decrease of 1.3%. This was due primarily to
the decline in crude oil prices. Intermediate
goods also became significantly cheaper. For
this reason, there was also a month-on-
month decline in import prices, even if energy
is excluded. There was also a fall of 1.2% in
the seasonally adjusted prices of domestic in-
dustrial products. Much as in the case of im-
ports, the decline in the energy component
was markedly sharper than for other goods.
In the case of industrial producer prices, how-
ever, the year-on-year rate of inflation was
+5.3%.
There was a further fall in consumer prices in
December. The cost of goods and services
was down by a seasonally adjusted 0.3%overall on the month. The price of fuel fell by
7.3% on the month and by as much as just
over 20% in the case of heating oil. By
contrast, fruit and vegetables became signifi-
cantly more expensive, which was due to
weather-related factors. There were, how-
ever, price reductions in the case of other
food products. The prices of industrial prod-
ucts and services went up slightly in seasonal-
ly adjusted terms. The annual rate of change
according to both the national consumer
price index (CPI) and the Harmonised Index of
Consumer Prices (HICP) fell from 1.4% in No-
vember to 1.1% in December. In 2008, the
CPI inflation rate was 2.6%. The equivalent
HICP figure was 2.8%, which was the sharp-
est increase since 1994.
Public finances1
Local government finances
According to the most recent data of the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, local government re-
corded a high surplus ( 323/C254billion) in the
third quarter of 2008, just as it had done one
year previously. Revenue increased by just
over 3% (+ 311/C252billion), meaning that the
year-on-year rate fell in comparison with the
first half of the year. The growth in tax rev-
enue accelerated (+101/C252% or just over 311/C252
billion) and was once again considerably

9stronger in eastern Germany. The main rea-
son for the overall tax revenue growth wasthe favourable development of local businesstax (+13
1/C252% after deducting the share accru-
ing to state and central government) whichonce again saw rising receipts, despite theshortfalls expected as a result of the businesstax reform and the deterioration in the under-lying economic conditions. There was also afurther marked rise in inflows from local gov-ernment’s share of income tax (+12%). Inaddition, the strong increase in revenue fromcategories of grants from state governmentwhich are largely linked to the level of taxrevenue continued (+8%). By contrast, re-ceipts from fees remained at the same levelas in 2007 and, following the sale of a shareportfolio by the city of D/C252sseldorf in 2007, in-come from asset realisations even droppedconsiderably, as did other administrative andentrepreneurial income, particularly as a re-sult of the year-on-year drop-out of a largeone-off dividend distribution by the Munichpublic utilities. After adjustment for thesenon-recurrent effects, local government’sfinancial situation again improved perceptibly.
Following the very strong increase in the pre-
vious quarter – which was possibly exagger-ated by late postings from the first quarter –the rise in total expenditure was somewhatmore moderate at 3
1/C252%(311/C252billion). The
main reason for this was the more subdueddevelopment of personnel expenses andoperating expenditure, which both went upby 3
1/C252% (or just under 31/C252billion). Personnel
expenditure in eastern Germany grew morethan twice as fast following the adjustmentof earnings to the west German level whichwas implemented up to the middle pay
groups. The overall rise in social benefits waseven somewhat lower (+1
1/C252%), with a con-
tinued decrease in accommodation costs forlong-term unemployed persons. The increasein expenditure on fixed assets continued butwas not as strong as before (+4
1/C252%). In the
previous two quarters, the growth rates forsome expenditure categories appeared to bedistorted in connection with the introductionby many local governments of the double-entry bookkeeping system. The data quality isnow likely to have improved considerably.However, the Federal Statistical Office still ex-pressed reservations about the data for cer-tain expenditure items for the cumulativetotal from the first three quarters.

10Overall, local government budgets developed
very favourably during the first three quarters
of 2008. The expected tax revenue shortfalls
from the business tax reform in the amount
of31 billion and the marked increase in ne-
gotiated pay rates for staff have so far been
more than offset by the overall positive devel-
opment of tax receipts and the sharp rise in
revenue from categories of grants from state
government which are largely linked to the
level of tax revenue. Even if there is a marked
slowdown in the fourth quarter, the surplus
for 2008 as a whole could still somewhat
exceed the 2007 surplus ( 381/C252billion). The
cumulative surplus for the first three quarters
of 2008 amounts to 351/C252billion and is thus
just under 32 billion higher than one year pre-
viously.
However, the surpluses were only partly used
to reduce credit market debt and liabilities to
other public sector budgets ( 381 billion com-
pared with 384 billion at the end of 2007). By
contrast, the volume of cash advances actual-
ly increased further during this period (by
31/C252billion to 329 billion at the end of
September). This reflects an ongoing differen-
tiation of the budgetary positions of individ-
ual local governments. Aggregate results of
federal states show a continued concentra-
tion of problem cases, particularly in Saar-
land, Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-
Westphalia. As a general principle, the fed-
eral states’ budgetary rules for local govern-
ment only allow short-term use of cash ad-
vances. Local governments which cannot bal-
ance their budgets without this financing in-
strument ought to subject themselves to tight
spending limits. The marked slowdown thatis now expected for 2009 and the revenue
shortfalls in connection with fiscal stimulus
measures that have already entered into force
and those still to come will further exacerbate
many local governments’ debt problems. In-
cluding these local governments in invest-
ment programmes to overcome the current
macroeconomic slowdown ultimately re-
quires enabling them to bear any follow-up
costs.
Securities markets
Bond market
In November 2008, the issue volume in the
German bond market was up on the month,
amounting to 3161.9 billion in gross terms
(compared with 3149.9 billion in October).
Owing to lower redemptions and taking ac-
count of changes in issuers’ holdings of their
own bonds, net sales of domestic debt se-
curities amounted to 349.2 billion, compared
with net redemptions of 318.1 billion in Octo-
ber. At the same time, the outstanding amount
of foreign debt securities in the German mar-
ket decreased (- 312.5 billion), as it had done
in the preceding months already; the decline
affected mainly euro-denominated securities
(-37.5 billion).
Among domestic borrowers, German credit
institutions tapped the bond market for the
greatest amount in November ( 325.2 billion).
Most activity was focused on the purchase
of other bank debt securities which can be
structured flexibly ( 336.0 billion). These in-
flows of funds did, however, include issues ofSurplus for

anteed by the government. In addition, asmall quantity of mortgage Pfandbriefe wasalso sold. The outstanding volume of publicPfandbriefe and of debt securities issued byspecialised credit institutions decreased by34.8 billion and 36.3 billion respectively.
The public sector placed 321.1 billion in the
German capital market in November. Centralgovernment was the primary issuer with netsales of 319.4 billion. In particular, it issued
ten-year Federal bonds (Bunds) worth 38.6
billion and five-year Federal notes (Bobls)worth 36.2 billion. Treasury discount paper
(Bubills), two-year Federal Treasury notes(Sch/C228tze) and Federal savings notes were is-sued for 33.3 billion, 31.4 billion and 30.1 bil-
lion respectively. By contrast, the outstandingvolume of thirty-year Bunds decreased by30.8 billion. The outstanding amount of Fed-
eral Treasury financing paper remained prac-tically unchanged. On balance, state govern-ments issued 31.7 billion worth of debt secur-
ities, less than they had issued in October(33.2 billion).
In the reporting month, German enterprises
tapped the bond market for 32.9 billion,
somewhat more than in October ( 32.3 bil-
lion). In net terms, these were all bonds withoriginal maturities of more than one year.
Domestic non-banks were the main pur-
chasers of debt securities in November. Theyinvested 318.6 billion in the bond market,
predominantly in German debt instruments(316.8 billion). Domestic credit institutions in-
vested 311.4 billion which, on balance, in-volved solely German bonds ( 325.6 billion).
Foreign investors added German debt secur-ities worth 36.8 billion net to their portfolios,
compared with the previous month whenthey had sold them for 313.7 billion.
Equity marketIn November, domestic enterprises – the ma-
jority of which were listed companies – issued31.2 billion worth of new shares in the Ger-
man equity market. By contrast, the out-standing volume of foreign equities in theGerman market fell significantly, as in previ-ous months (- 36.2 billion). Equities were pur-
chased solely by foreign investors ( 34.1 bil-
lion). Resident non-banks reduced their equityportfolios by 35.4 billion and German credit
institutions sold stocks worth 33.7 billion.Sales and purchases

12Mutual fund shares
In the reporting month, domestic mutual
funds recorded a net inflow of 36.1 billion
compared with an outflow of 319.8 billion in
October. On balance, the additional capital
was channelled solely into specialised funds
reserved for institutional investors. By con-
trast, German mutual funds open to the
general public once again recorded outflows
(31.2 billion). Share certificates were sold in
money market funds ( 31.0 billion), open-end
real estate funds ( 30.7 billion), bond-based
funds ( 30.4 billion) and mixed securities-
based funds ( 30.3 billion). Equity-based funds
and mixed funds, by contrast, recorded mod-
erate inflows ( 30.9 billion and 30.2 billion re-
spectively). Foreign funds traded in the Ger-
man market suffered further outflows of
funds in November (- 30.3 billion), albeit to a
lesser extent than in the previous month
(-319.5 billion).
German non-banks were the principal invest-
ors in mutual funds, buying shares worth
36.8 billion. Foreign investors increased their
portfolios of German mutual fund shares
only slightly ( 30.1 billion). By contrast, Ger-
man credit institutions sold share certificates
worth 31.2 billion net.
Balance of payments
In November, the surplus on Germany’s cur-
rent account – in unadjusted terms – stood at
38.6 billion and was thus 35.7 billion down
on the month. This was due to a sharp de-
cline in the trade surplus. By contrast, invisiblecurrent transactions, which comprise services,
income and current transfers, reverted to a
positive balance.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, in November the for-
eign trade surplus went down by 36.7 billion
on the month to 39.7 billion. After adjust-
ment for seasonal and calendar variations, it
fell by 35.1 billion to 310.7 billion. The value
of exports declined more significantly
(-10.6%) than that of imports (-5.6%). On an
average of October and November taken
together, seasonally adjusted nominal exports
were 5.4% lower than the third-quarter aver-
age while imports were 6.6% below this
average. One-quarter of the reduction in ex-
ports and – owing to the continued sharp
falls in prices for energy sources and other
commodities – most of the decline in imports
were price-related.
A surplus of 30.1 billion was recorded for in-
visible current transactions in November,
compared with a deficit of 31.1 billion in Oc-
tober. This shift arose from a decrease in the
deficit on services of 31.5 billion to 30.4 bil-
lion. At the same time, net receipts from
cross-border income fell by 30.3 billion to
34.2 billion. The deficit in current transfers, at
33.7 billion, was unchanged on the month.
With respect to cross-border portfolio invest-
ment, November saw large net capital im-
ports ( 330.2 billion compared with 332.5 bil-
lion in October). German investors disposed
of foreign securities to the amount of 319.3
billion compared with 347.4 billion in the pre-
vious month. In the main, they sold debt se-Sales and

billion) in October. They invested in debtsecurities ( 36.8 billion) with a particular
emphasis on bonds and notes ( 35.8 billion).
Furthermore, they acquired domestic sharesworth 34.1 billion.
Direct investment resulted in net capital ex-
ports of 37.7 billion in November (compared
with 39.4 billion in October). The main reason
for this was that German enterprises providedtheir foreign branches with additional funds(314.7 billion, compared with 39.9 billion in
October). They furnished these branches withequity capital in the amount of 37.0 billion
and additional loans worth 35.1 billion.
Foreign proprietors invested 37.0 billion in
their domestic affiliated enterprises, mainlythrough the granting of intra-group credit(35.9 billion).
Other statistically recorded investment com-
prising financial and trade credits (in as muchas these do not constitute a part of direct in-vestment) as well as bank deposits and otherassets saw net capital outflows of 310.3 bil-
lion in November. However, non-banks re-corded inflows of 33.9 billion. This was due
largely to imports of funds by enterprises andhouseholds amounting to 312.9 billion.
These concentrated particularly on reducingtheir deposits with foreign banks but theyalso took up short-term loans outside Ger-many. By contrast, the cross-border activitiesMajor items of the balance

15Bank Lending Survey:
an interim assessment
and current
developmentsIt is now six years since the Eurosystem
introduced a quarterly Bank Lending
Survey (BLS) for the euro area. The
Bundesbank collates the information
supplied by the participating German
institutions and publishes it as a natio-
nal result. The aim of the survey is to
obtain qualitative information, in par-
ticular, on the lending behaviour of
the surveyed banks. The focus of inter-
est is therefore on changes in credit
standards for lending to the private
sector. The period for which these data
are available is now long enough to
allow an interim assessment.
In Germany, a tightening of credit
standards at the beginning of the sur-
vey was followed by a lengthy period
of easing which continued up to mid-
2007. Given the tense situation in the
financial markets since then, the sur-
veyed German institutions have notice-
ably tightened their credit conditions
in some cases, especially for lending to
enterprises. Nevertheless, these condi-
tions are not as stringent as those ap-
plied in the euro area as whole. How-
ever, the BLS data for Germany do not,
at present, indicate a supply-side credit
crunch on a broad front within the
banking system.

16tive survey among senior credit managers
who deliver their assessment, principally of
their institutions’ lending behaviour, on a
quarterly basis.1Given the dominant role of
the banks in financing the private sector in
the euro area, the BLS is designed to improve
the Eurosystem’s understanding of the mon-
etary policy transmission process and, thus,
ultimately assist it in its monetary policy deci-
sions.2The survey provides detailed informa-
tion on developments in the surveyed insti-
tutions’ lending behaviour. Major factors
affecting the lending decision are surveyed,
for example, including the assessment of risk
by the surveyed institutions, the impact of
refinancing costs in the money and bond
markets – which are especially significant at
present – as well as possible balance sheet
constraints and information on the level of
competition. Additionally, the survey partici-
pants provide data on households’ and non-
financial corporations’ credit demand as they
perceive it. In this way, the BLS contributes to
a better assessment of the isolated impact
of the bank lending market’s supply and
demand sides on the observed interest rate
and quantity movements.
In the BLS, changes in credit standards play a
key role for understanding the participating
banks’ lending behaviour.3For this reason,
seven of the 18 questions in the question-
naire are concerned with the standards and
the factors which affect them. First, a distinc-
tion is made between loans to enterprises
and loans to households, with the latter
being split into loans for house purchase and
consumer loans. Second, two reference
periods are surveyed from the banks: howcredit standards have changed over the past
three months and how they are expected to
change over the next three months. In add-
ition to this information, the banks taking
part in the BLS supply data on their conditions
and terms for approving loans (including their
margins)4as well as the institution-specific
demand for credit and its likely determining
factors.
From the outset, German banks have also
been taking part in the Bank Lending Survey
with their data being collected in interviews
and incorporated into the European aggre-
gates.5Their responses are also combined
into a result for Germany and published and
analysed on a regular basis by the Bundes-
bank.6After nearly six years’ experience ofIntroduction

1The credit managers are asked to indicate trend esti-

jectives of the Bank Lending Survey, see Deutsche Bun-
desbank, German results of euro-area bank lending sur-
vey, Monthly Report, June 2003, pp 67-76.
3Credit standards are defined as internal guidelines or
criteria which reflect a given bank’s lending policy. They
comprise the written and unwritten criteria and other
practices in connection with this policy which determine
what type of loans a bank regards as (un)desirable, the
set geographical priorities, what collateral is deemed to
be (un)acceptable and so on. Changes in the written
lending policy together with changes in how it is applied
are to be taken into consideration in the survey.
4The other conditions comprise the non-interest rate
charges (various types of fees, such as commitment fees
for revolving credits, administrative fees, and costs for in-
quiries, guarantees and credit insurance), the size of the
loan, collateral requirements, loan covenants, maturity,
and also, in the case of loans for house purchase, the
loan-to-value ratio.
5Initially, 17 German institutions took part in the BLS.
The number of surveyed German banks was increased to
30 with the survey round for the first quarter of 2008.
The change to the sample was made necessary by devel-
opments in the German banking system. At the same
time, the new sample takes greater account than before
of the importance of smaller banks, especially in lending
business with small and medium-sized enterprises. For
more information, see box on page 17.

17Deutsche BundesbankThe adjustment of the German sample for the Bank Lending Survey
At the outset, there were 17 German banks which 
took part in the Bank Lending Survey (BLS) for the euro area. They were selected not only on the basis of own market share but also in accordance with the market share of the categories of banks to which they belonged. In the light of developments in the German banking industry in recent years, an enlarge-ment of the sample was deemed to be advisable in order to ensure that the BLS responses maintained a high degree of representativeness. The sample was enlarged with the survey round in April 2008; since then, 30 German institutions have been participating in the quarterly survey. 
For one thing, the sample enlargement took due 
account of the fact that there has been a sharp growth in new “types“ of banks in recent years. These gained market shares because they adopted innovative 
business models – say, by means of new distribution 
channels or a greater specialisation in certain types of loans. The size these banks have now attained suggests that they are playing a perceptible role in determining 
credit supply behaviour in the German loan market. 
Secondly, moreover, the enlargement of the sample makes it possible to give greater consideration than 
before to the structure of the German banking system. 
Many of the credit institutions active in retail banking in Germany are relatively small, for example – not least owing to the regional principle. 
Using the data on the terms and conditions for loans 
to enterprises, the following aims to show the effect of the sample enlargement on the German BLS results 
reported since April 2008 and the extent to which the new BLS banks‘ behaviour differs from that of the institutions which were already being surveyed earlier.
For example, in the ﬁ  rst three quarters of 2008, the 
changes in the standards made by the sample of newly 
included banks differed only marginally from those of the earlier sample. The banks of the old sample reported a slightly stronger tightening of their credit 
standards in corporate lending. At the same time, 
the 13 newly included institutions reported that their standards were affected less strongly – in particular, 
by the reﬁ  nancing conditions in the money and bond 
markets – relative to the group of 17 banks. This sug-gests that especially the newly included smaller banks, which obtain their funding less in the capital markets 
and more by means of deposits, have been the fac-
tor determining the differences between the group results. On the supply side, the greatest behavioural differences were apparent in developments in margins 
for average loans in the third quarter of 2008. While 
the banks of the earlier sample greatly increased their margins, the newly included institutions made no 
changes to this indicator. In terms of developments 
in risk awareness, which are reﬂ  ected in the margin 
policy for riskier loans, there were hardly any differ-ences between the two groups. Finally, the demand 
for bank loans observed by the new banks developed 
more positively over all three quarters than was the case in the old sample.
1 For supply-related questions, a positive value means that 
the sum of the percentage of the restrictive responses 
exceeds the sum of the percentage of the expansionary 
responses. In the case of demand-related questions, a positive value indicates a larger percentage of expansionary 
responses. —  2 German BLS sample: 17 banks until 2007 Q4,

18the BLS, there is now a sufficient quantity of
data to allow an interim assessment from a
German perspective.
Longer-term developments in German
banks’ lending policy
When interpreting the aggregated German
BLS data in a longer-term comparison, it
should be noted that the survey collects infor-
mation only on changes compared with the
preceding quarter. To that extent, the results
do not give any indication of the level of
standards and margins at a given point in
time but only of changes in the level. This is
very important, especially when comparing
the results across individual product categor-
ies (loans to enterprises, loans for house pur-
chase, consumer loans) since it cannot neces-
sarily be assumed that the observed variables
were initially at an identical level in all of the
surveyed business areas when the survey
began in 2003. This also affects comparisons
between data for Germany and for the euro
area as a whole, however, as the cyclical situ-
ation and profitability of German banks dif-
fered markedly from the euro-area average
when the BLS was launched, for example.
With regard to the changes in credit stand-
ards for loans to enterprises and for loans to
households, the German institutions partici-
pating in the BLS stated when the survey
began in 2003, that, on balance, they had
tightened their standards for all surveyed
types of loan (see chart on page 19).7From
2005 onwards, however, there was – meas-
ured by the credit standards – a steady easingof supply-side terms and conditions which
persisted until mid-2007 and even longer in
the case of consumer loans. Since the begin-
ning of the turbulence in the financial mar-
kets, however, the surveyed German institu-
tions have been stating that that they have
tightened their standards for loans to enter-
prises – even considerably in some cases –
and that they have not continued to ease
their standards for loans to households.
The influence of the various factors has
changed in parallel with the developments
in credit standards. During the two periods
– when the BLS started and recently – in
which the German BLS banks tended to re-
port stricter lending behaviour, refinancing
costs and balance sheet constraints had a no-
ticeably restrictive effect on credit standards in
business with enterprises, but played a far
smaller role in the intervening period. Much
the same applies to the importance of the
banks’ liquidity position as well as, to some
extent, their perception of risk, which the BLS
breaks down into the factors “expectations
regarding general economic activity”, “indus-
try or firm-specific outlook” and “risk on the
collateral demanded”. According to the sur-
veyed banks, only loan collateral has not been
playing an increasing role as a constraining
factor in the most recent available quarters.
Recently, factors closely associated with risk
have also had an increasing impact on the
credit standards for lending to households –
7(Net) percentages are calculated to analyse the trend
estimates recorded on a five-point scale. For the data on
credit standards, positive values correspond to more
restrictive standards, whereas negative values indicate an
easing of loan supply conditions.Interpretation

20both consumer credit and loans for house
purchase. Besides expectations regarding gen-
eral economic activity, these factors are pri-
marily households’ creditworthiness (for con-
sumer credit) and the outlook in the housing
markets (for loans for house purchase). As re-
cently as 2007, these factors contributed to
an easing of the credit standards before tend-
ing to exert a tightening influence of late. It is
striking that collateral did not have a growing
impact on the credit standards last year even
in the case of consumer credit. In the period
from 2005 to 2007 – and even beyond that
in the case of loans to households – increas-
ing competitive pressure in the German
market contributed perceptibly to an easing,
albeit to varying degrees, of the credit stand-
ards for all three types of loans surveyed in
the BLS.The information on corporate lending elicited
from banks taking part in the BLS is also
broken down by size of firm. Data on changes
in the credit standards are provided separately
for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
and for large enterprises.8Additionally, since
the survey round in April 2008, information
on the factors affecting changes in credit
lines has also been collected separately for
SMEs and large enterprises. For Germany, the
cumulative changes in credit standards by
size of enterprise show a more accommodat-
ing lending policy towards SMEs by the banks
in the survey from mid-2004 onwards, if not
earlier (see chart on this page).9The stand-
ards were eased noticeably more – or have
been tightened less since mid-2007 – than for
large enterprises. The data on the factors af-
fecting credit standards, which are available
separately for the first three quarters of 2008,
show that the perception of risk as well as re-
financing costs and balance sheet constraints
had a smaller restrictive impact on the terms
and conditions of lending to SMEs. The latter
is also likely to be linked to the fact that lend-
ing business with SMEs is conducted to a
greater extent by credit institutions whichStandards for loans to

9A number of methodological problems have to be
taken into consideration when analysing cumulative
changes, one being that, as mentioned above, only quar-
terly changes are surveyed in the BLS. To that extent, the
results do not provide any indications of the level of
standards but only of changes to that level. This also ap-
plies to cumulative values over several quarters. More-
over, the “point of departure” taken by these cumulative
changes at the start of the BLS is unknown. This is neces-
sarily set as equal to zero. Furthermore, the cumulative
percentage values over time cannot easily be interpreted.
A maximum 100% balance is possible for each reporting
period, which means that the accumulation can produce

than in the capital and money markets andwhich are therefore less affected by refinan-cing problems due to the financial market cri-sis. This is also indicated by a separate analysisof the German BLS results following thechange to the sample in April 2008 (see boxon page 17).
Between the introduction of the BLS at the
beginning of 2003 and roughly mid-2005,the German participants in the survey statedthat they had widened their margins on risk-ier loans – in some cases perceptibly – for alltypes of credit (see chart on this page). In theensuing period, however, the participatingGerman banks made hardly any further ad-justments until about a year ago. Since then,a heightened risk awareness in the wake ofthe financial market crisis has contributedto a further, sometimes sharp expansion ofmargins for riskier loans. The margins foraverage loans were widened less, or tight-ened more obviously, almost throughout theperiod under review; this led a perceptibledispersion of the margins in German banks’lending to the private sector. However, thedata available since the survey round in April2008, which are broken down by firm size,indicate that the German BLS institutionshave adjusted their margins to varying de-grees depending on the line of business.Much like in the developments in creditstandards, SMEs have latterly been affectedby widened margins less than large enter-prises, especially in the case of average-riskloans.Chan ges in stan dards and

22The qualitative information which the sur-

icy should be reflected in the banks’ actual
measured quantitative interest rate spreads,
ie the difference between refinancing costs
and lending rates. For Germany, a compari-
son of these two measures shows a largely
parallel movement in the case of loans to
households for consumption or for house
purchase (see chart on this page). No such
systematic relation is revealed for loans to en-
terprises.

developments in lending to non-financial
corporations
As the BLS is a comparatively new set of stat-
istics, the data from it have been used hither-
to only in descriptive form for the analysis
of credit developments in Germany. However,
the number of observations is now probably
sufficient for the information content of the
BLS data to be studied using quantitative
methods as well.10Analyses of this kind have
already been performed for the United States
and it is has been possible to establish the ex-

2340 years, which allows a clearly greater range
of empirical-analytical procedures than in the
case of the European BLS.
Owing to the comparatively short observation
period and the associated small quantity of
data, the options for analysing the German
BLS data are severely limited. In simple correl-
ation analyses, it is possible to ascertain from
the BLS, first of all, that credit standards lead
credit developments (see the box on pages
24-25). By contrast, there is no obviously dis-
cernible lead for the demand observed by the
BLS participants. Rather, it cannot be ruled
out that the BLS data on demand follow the
credit aggregate. Nevertheless, when inter-
preting these results, it should be borne in
mind that the data do not yet contain a com-
plete cycle for interest rates or the economy.
In a further stage, there is an analysis of the
extent to which BLS data on credit supply and
demand in a simple regression model can ex-
plain credit developments in Germany.12In
view of the short observation period, how-
ever, no account can be taken of the leading
indicator property of the BLS credit standards
ascertained in the correlation analysis as com-
pared with actual credit developments. The
fact that the (simultaneous) BLS supply vari-
able lacks significance is unsurprising given
that there is no contemporary correlation. By
contrast, in the case of long-term loans to en-
terprises, the BLS demand is a robustly signifi-
cant explanatory factor. This suggests that, in
the past (almost) six years, growth in long-
term corporate lending in Germany has been
determined in large part by demand-side
factors. For short-term loans to enterprises, itwas not possible to identify any significant
dependencies from the survey data. Owing to
the fact that relationship banking continues
to be of major importance in Germany, how-
ever, short-term loans are likely to be geared,
at least to a certain extent, to the liquidity
needs of long-standing customer relation-
ships and therefore be less dependent on pre-
defined terms and conditions.
Special questions on the specific impact
of the financial market crisis
After the start of the financial market turbu-
lence in the summer of 2007, the following
autumn round of the BLS asked, for the first
time, additional questions on the specific dir-
ect or indirect impact of the financial market
crisis on banks’ lending. These ad hoc ques-
tions asked the banks’ managers what effect
the turmoil in the credit markets was having
on their credit standards, for example. The in-
formation obtained showed the extent to
which the financial market crisis was contrib-
uting to a tightening of credit standards.
The credit standards for loans to enterprises
were tightened somewhat on average by the
surveyed institutions throughout the period
under observation. There was a very marked
tightening in the third quarter of 2008, how-
ever, when the financial market crisis dramat-
ically came to a head in the wake of the in-
solvency of the US bank Lehman Brothers
(see chart on page 26). Up to mid-2008,

24Deutsche BundesbankThe explanatory power of the BLS variables for developments in loans to enterprises
Not only in the light of the current situation, the extent 
to which the observed developments in loans are driven 
by the supply or the demand side is very important for the 
monetary policy assessment. Since there is only a limited 
possibility of making a clear-cut distinction between supply 
and demand variables using macroeconomic measurement 
variables, loan equations typically make use of approxima-
tion values such as gross domestic product or the investment 
ratio for the demand side as well as an interest rate spread 
to capture the supply factors.1 However, such a classiﬁ  cation 
is not always without ambiguity, for example in cases where 
both the loan supply conditions and the loan demand condi-
tions are cyclically sensitive. In such cases, the Bank Lending 
Survey (BLS) can provide valuable information for a separate 
treatment of loan demand and loan supply as determinants 
in a loan equation.
In the BLS, the institutions are asked, among other things, 
how much they have changed their standards for loans to 
enterprises, loans for house purchase and consumer credit 
over the past three months, whether they have increased or 
decreased their margins, and how the demand for the dif-
ferent types of loan has developed. The corresponding net 
balances can be used as alternative indicators of a change in 
the supply of credit ( Δsupplyt) and of an adjustment of the 
demand for credit ( Δdemandt), respectively.2 The investment 
ratio ( ratiot) is included in the estimation equations as a 
further factor affecting the nominal development in loans.
Δln Kt = β0 + β1Δdemandt + β2ratiot + β3Δsupplyt + utThe estimation is made on the basis of quarterly data for 
the period 2002 Q4 to 2008 Q3 and relates solely to loans 
to enterprises. In order to avoid structural breaks, only the 
BLS data of the 17 banks from the original sample are used. 
The growth rate of German banks‘ loan portfolios Δln Kt 
with non-ﬁ  nancial corporations in the euro area is chosen 
as dependent variable. The investment ratio ratiot is the 
relationship between nominal gross ﬁ  xed capital formation 
and nominal gross domestic product. For the supply side, 
the obvious thing is to include, instead of an interest rate 
spread, the net balance of the responses to the BLS ques-
tion on the change of the margins for loans to enterprises 
(Δsupplyt=Δmargint) in the estimation. Moreover, in an 
alternative speciﬁ  cation, the net balance of the responses 
to the question on the change in the credit standards 
(Δsupplyt=Δstandardst) is included as a more broadly deﬁ  ned 
measure of the supply conditions. Owing to the high cor-
relation between these two supply variables and the associ-
ated risk of multicollinearity, two separate equations are 
estimated, each with only one of the two supply-related 
variables.
The estimations are carried out for the credit market as a 
whole 3 as well as separately for short and long-term loans. 
As part of the BLS, the Δdemandt and Δstandardst variables 
are surveyed for each market segment individually as well 
as for the market as a whole and are incorporated accord-
ingly into the respective estimations. Since the data on the 
change of the margins are collected separately only for 
average and riskier loans, but not for different maturities, 
1 See, for example, Deutsche Bundesbank, Estimation of loan equa-
tions in Germany, Monthly Report, July 200 6, p 19. — 2 Positive values 
for the net balances indicate an increase in demand or a tightening 
of the supply. As an alternative to the net balances, the mean values 
of the quantiﬁ  ed BLS data can be used. The data on credit supply and demand are recorded on a ﬁ  ve-point scale, with the value “1“ indicat-
ing a considerable tightening of the supply or a considerable decrease 
in demand and the value “5“ indicating a considerable easing of the 
supply or a considerable increase in demand. The value “3“ indicates 
that no change has been made or observed. While the net balances Correlation of BL S varia bles with the growth of loans to enterprises in t0

25the margin change for average loans is included ín all three 
estimations as Δmargint.
In order to gain an initial impression of the relationship 
between each individual BLS variable and the credit growth, correlation coefﬁ  cients are calculated for different time lags 
and leads. In all three market segments, it becomes evident that the change in credit standards runs ahead of credit growth, at times markedly. No signiﬁ  cant simultaneous cor-
relation between these two variables is discernable in any of the three cases. The change in the margins reveals a similar 
picture: the highest correlation in each case is between the 
margin change and the credit growth observed four quar-ters later. No clear time lead is evident for the demand for either loans as a whole or for short-term loans: the change in demand both runs ahead and lags behind credit growth, with the highest correlation coefﬁ  cient resulting in the case 
of a time lead for the change in demand of two quarters or one quarter, depending on the credit aggregate under 
consideration. By contrast, in the case of long-term loans, 
the change in demand is apparently almost contemporane-ous and, moreover, relatively strongly correlated with credit growth. The cited results show that there are, at times, strong links between the BLS variables and credit growth. However, the informative value of correlation coefﬁ  cients 
is generally limited: they give no indication of a causal relationship. Furthermore, no more than two variables at a time can be considered using this method of analysis, ie 
correlation analysis does not allow the possibility of isolat-ing the effect of an explanatory variable on an explained variable by means of adjustment for the effects generated by other explanatory variables. This can be done only by a regression analysis.
However, owing to the short observation period, no lagged 
endogenous or exogenous variables can be incorporated into the regression equations, which are estimated using the ordinary least squares method. Nevertheless, even initial 
estimates may give some clues as to how credit develop-
ments depend on the BLS variables. As soon as there is a large enough sample which allows lagged variables to be introduced into the equations, it should be possible to make a further improvement to the quality of the estimates. How-ever, the explanatory power of all the equations is already comparatively high and the designated tests do not indicate any misspeciﬁ  cations. All signiﬁ  cant explanatory variables 
display the expected sign. In all the estimates, the coefﬁ  cient 
for the investment ratio differs statistically signiﬁ  cantly from 
0. The investment ratio has a positive effect on credit growth. In addition, the growth of long-term loans to enterprises is signiﬁ  cantly positively dependent on the BLS demand for 
credit at the same point in time, which was already possible to surmise on the basis of the correlation analysis.

26corresponding part played by the financial
market crisis ran in parallel. The tightening of
credit standards may therefore probably be
explained in large part by the financial market
turbulence. The stronger adjustments to the
standards for loans to large enterprises were,
however, affected more noticeably by the
situation in the financial markets. By contrast,
the actual tightening in both credit categories
in the third quarter of 2008 was somewhatsharper than suggested by the impact of the
financial market crisis taken in isolation. This
permits the conclusion that, to a considerable
extent, these strong adjustments in the third
quarter of 2008 were due to factors not dir-
ectly connected with the financial market tur-
bulence. The banks stressed, in particular, the
restrictive effect of the expectations regarding
the general economic outlook as well as in-
dustry or firm-specific factors. Nevertheless,
with the growing duration of the crisis and
given their obvious knock-on effects on the
real economy, it is becoming increasingly diffi-
cult to isolate and identify the specific impact
of developments in the financial markets.
For changes in the standards for loans for
house purchase and consumer credit, a slight-
ly constraining effect of developments in the
financial markets was reported only in the
second and third quarters of 2008. Neverthe-
less, the relevant credit standards remained
largely unchanged in the third quarter of
2008 after having been eased somewhat, in
fact, in the second quarter.
Since the autumn quarter of 2007, the par-
ticipants in the survey – in response to the
additional questions – have been reporting
persistent problems in their wholesale fund-
ing, ie their borrowing in the markets beyond
ongoing refinancing through customer de-
posits. Access to funding in the unsecured
interbank money market, through the issu-
ance of debt securities or through other mar-
kets was hampered. Just under two-thirds of
the German banks participating in the BLS
usually make use of these refinancing sources.
Of these banks, 50% to 60% reported thatFinan cial market crisis

27their hampered access to wholesale funding
was having a slight or considerable impact on
the quantity that they were willing to lend
out (see chart on this page).13However, for
the majority of banks which answered these
questions, only a slight effect on the quantity
and margin was reported.
More than anything else, the securitisation of
loans and the use of credit transfer instru-
ments was evidently possible only to a very
limited extent. Almost all the banks which
use these sources of funding were feeling
marked restrictions, which were reflected in
most cases just as strongly in the quantity lent
as in the margins. In this connection, how-
ever, it should be borne in mind that the
banks which make any use at all of these se-
verely affected refinancing instruments ac-
count for only just over one-third of the BLS
sample. Seen in that light, it should not be
concluded that the German banking system
has been especially heavily affected by the
above-mentioned funding problems on a
broad front.14

28standards. For loans to enterprises, both the
German and other European banks taking
part in the BLS initially stated that, on bal-
ance, they had been tightening their stand-
ards in commercial banking business on the
whole up to 2004, although the lending re-
strictions in Germany were less pronounced
(see chart on this page). While the process of
easing began as early as mid-2004 in the case
of the euro-area banks overall, the German
banks followed with a time lag of roughly
one year. As a result, the cumulative changes
in the credit standards for Germany from the
end of 2004 onwards are greater than those
for the euro area as a whole. As the credit
standards in Germany were eased somewhat
more considerably in the ensuing period,
however, their cumulative values since the be-
ginning of 2006 have been lower again than
the corresponding data for Europe overall. In
the wake of the financial market turbulence
since mid-2007, this gap has clearly widened
since the German banks in the BLS stated, es-
pecially at the beginning of the crisis, that
they were less affected by it than the banks
surveyed in the euro area as whole. More-
over, up to as late as mid-2008, the German
banks were faced with a growing demand for
credit, while demand in the euro area overall
had been declining since the start of 2008.
The picture is similar for loans to households
for house purchase and for consumer credit,
where the cumulative credit standards for
Germany and for Europe as a whole have
diverged recently. German borrowers were
either less affected by the tightening of credit
standards or benefited from a further easing.

29man values were still higher than the corres-
ponding figures for Europe as a whole up to
mid-2006 or the end of that year. For loans
for house purchase, this has been the case
since the BLS has been in existence, in fact.
Up to about one year ago, however, the
German banks participating in the survey
had been encountering a consistently weaker
growth in demand. Since then, the demand
for loans for house purchase at the German
banks has been somewhat more robust, how-
ever. This is also the case for demand for con-
sumer credit at the German institutions,
which was mainly positive up to the third
quarter of 2008.
A comparison of the responses to the add-
itional “ad hoc” questions on the effect of
the financial market turmoil on Germany and
the euro area as whole shows that the impact
on credit standards in the euro area overall
was more marked than in Germany. In the
euro area overall, a larger percentage of the
banks’ managers than in Germany reported,
especially in the third quarter of 2008, that
the situation in the financial markets had con-
tributed considerably or somewhat to the
tightening of credit standards for loans to
enterprises. The financial market crisis had
less effect on the credit standards for loans
to households in both reporting groups, al-
though the impact in this category of loans
was also greater in the euro area as a whole
than in Germany.
The hampering of refinancing options in the
wholesale markets affected the BLS banks in
the euro area overall somewhat more strong-
ly than the German banks in the survey (seechart on page 27). The percentage of sur-
veyed banks in the euro area as whole using
the unsecured money market, debt securities
or other markets for funding, at around
75%, is somewhat higher than in Germany.
Added to this is the fact that, especially
recently, the negative impact of refinancing
difficulties on the quantity of loans and on
the margins was stronger than in Germany. In
the preceding quarters, there was no discern-
ible significant difference between the two
areas. The effect of the restricted possibilities
of securitisation and of credit risk transfer on
the banks that use these instruments was, in
the past, greater in Germany than in the euro
area as a whole, although the levels have
converged somewhat of late. Nevertheless,
these problems are likely to have left their
mark more clearly in the euro area as a whole
than in Germany since, in the overall aggre-
gate, roughly half of the surveyed banks fund
themselves through securitsations and credit
risk transfer, while only one-third does so in
Germany.
Conclusions
In the past six years, the German BLS data
have made a major contribution to explaining
lending behaviour in Germany as well as the
demand for bank loans and have helped in
gaining a better understanding of overall de-
velopments in German banks’ lending.
At present, the BLS provides some indications
of restrictive supply-side effects on loan de-
velopments. Refinancing costs and balance

30role in developments in credit standards since
the beginning of the financial market crisis.
There were, however, additional factors in
the most recent available survey round, in
which there was a very marked tightening of
credit standards: the impact of the deterior-
ation in the general economic situation and
the increasing importance of industry or firm-
specific developments. A tightening of credit
standards in periods of economic slowdown
is not an untypical reaction in lending be-
haviour, however. Furthermore, it should be
noted that the cited factors – and therefore
also the observed adjustments in lending pol-
icy – are by no means exhibited to the same
degree by all of the banks. All in all, no gen-
eral credit crunch can be discerned at present
on the basis of the BLS data.
On the demand side, in the third quarter of
2008 the survey participants observed a
slightly declining demand for credit from en-terprises for the first time in about three
years. This was due mainly to a smaller
demand for bank loans for investment pur-
poses. At the German BLS institutions, this
decline in demand was especially marked in
the case of loans to small and medium-sized
enterprises. At the same time, these firms
were affected less than large enterprises by
tighter credit standards. It should be noted,
however, that the currently available data
were collected as long ago as the end of Sep-
tember/early October 2008. More recent sur-
veys among borrowers, especially among
small and medium-sized enterprises in Ger-
many, essentially confirm this assessment,
however.15

31German enterprises’
profitability and
financing in 2007According to the Bundesbank’s corpor-
ate balance sheet statistics, profit in
the corporate sector showed a further
considerable improvement in 2007 in
the wake of a dynamic business mo-
mentum. At 51/C252%, the gross return on
sales marked a new high. All economic
sectors examined in this article contrib-
uted to the positive development in
profitability with the exception of re-
tail trade, which was depressed in 2007
by the loss of consumer purchasing
power due to the increase in the stand-
ard rate of VAT and in insurance tax
and corresponding frontloading of
planned purchases in the later part of
2006. Enterprises with a greater export
orientation again fared particularly
well.
As in previous years, the higher annual
result was used in part to strengthen
firms’ equity base. This was additional-
ly boosted by greater injections of
equity from external sources. The
equity ratio thus showed a further
sharp rise and, at 251/C252%, also reached
a new peak.
All in all, German enterprises have sig-
nificantly strengthened their financial
resilience over the past buoyant years.
This buffer is now providing some pro-
tection against the increasing strains
resulting from the sharp global slow-
down and the ongoing financial mar-
ket crisis.

32Overall economic environment
In 2007, the German economy again expand-
ed at a rapid pace. While the increase in real
GDP of 21/C252% was1/C252percentage point lower
than in 2006, this was predominantly due to
special factors, especially the hike in value
added tax which put a noticeable damper on
private consumption. As in 2006, actual out-
put grew faster than potential output, result-
ing in a further rise in capacity utilisation
which, for the first time since the boom at
the beginning of the decade, exceeded the
corridor of normal utilisation. In 2007, the up-
swing was also reflected in a strong recovery
in the labour market. However, the positive
economic environment was marred by grow-
ing price pressures. This can be explained, on
the one hand, by fiscal effects, in particular
the increase in the standard rate of VAT and
insurance tax mentioned above and, on the
other hand, by the marked rise in the prices
of energy and food in the second half of
2007 owing to world market factors.
The sharp increase in GDP was driven mainly
by buoyant activity in the production sector.
The real gross value added of this sector ex-
panded by 43/C254% in 2007 and thus made a
11/C254percentage point contribution to overall
growth in GDP . That of the manufacturing
sector increased by 6% and that of construc-
tion by 21/C252%. The value added by the services
sector rose by 2%. This was due to brisk de-
velopment in business-related services which
contributed 1 percentage point to GDP
growth. By contrast, the performance of
trade, hotels and restaurants, and transport
improved by only1/C252%. In 2007, real grossvalue added in the sectors included in the cor-
porate balance sheet statistics rose by 31/C252%,
which was matched by a rise of the same
amount in trade and industry in general1and
of 3% in the economy as a whole. The
growth lead of trade and industry over the
economy as a whole is attributable to the
comparatively moderate rise in the public and
private services sectors (+11/C254%).
The additional fiscal burdens generated, in
particular, by the VAT increase, which also led
to sizeable forward shifts in demand to 2006,
in conjunction with the greater loss of pur-
chasing power owing to the rise in energy
and food prices during the latter part of the
year as well as the higher saving ratio caused
real private consumption to shrink by1/C252%.
These retarding effects obscured the positive
stimuli that the favourable labour market de-
velopments exerted on disposable income.
However, investment in machinery and equip-
ment continued to expand at a rapid pace
(+7%). The high level of utilisation prompted
many enterprises to expand capacity. Other
supportive factors were the favourable finan-
cing conditions and generous tax depreci-
ation rules for moveable fixed assets, which
were abolished at the end of 2007. In 2007,
construction investment likewise contributed
positively to GDP growth, although, at 13/C254%
overall, it increased significantly less than in
2006.

33In 2007, major expansionary stimuli again
came from exports which, however, at 71/C252%,
did not increase as dynamically as in 2006.The main reasons for this were the slowergrowth of the German export markets andthe strong appreciation of the euro, whichled to a 6% fall in price competitiveness intrade with non-euro-area countries (calcu-lated on the basis of the deflators of totalsales). By contrast, the competitiveness of theGerman economy within the euro area im-proved slightly (+1
1/C254%) due to the ongoing
comparatively favourable price and cost de-velopments in Germany. As a result of thedampening influence on domestic demandemanating from various special factors, at5%, real imports went up by a smalleramount than exports, meaning that statistic-ally foreign trade contributed 1
1/C252percentage
points to GDP growth compared with 1 per-centage point in 2006.
Given the fall in unemployment and large
growth in enterprises’ profit, there was aclear increase in wages in 2007, although themajority of pay agreements in the servicessector were markedly more moderate than inindustry. However, as some of the wageagreements did not come into effect until thelatter part of 2007 or until 2008, the rise innegotiated wages (on a monthly basis), atjust under 1
1/C252%, was barely greater on an an-
nual average than in 2006. By contrast, thegrowth in wages and salaries per employeeclearly rose from just short of 1% to just over1
1/C252%. This reflects a change in direction of
the wage drift, which increased by1/C254%i n
2007 after it had fallen by almost1/C252% the
year before. Unit labour cost went up for thefirst time since 2003 although, at not quite
1/C252%, this rise was still quite moderate. The in-
crease in total compensation of employees(+3%) again lagged behind the expansion ofnational income (+3
1/C252%), thereby driving the
(unadjusted) wage ratio down slightly to64
3/C254%.
A further decline in the rate of corporate in-
solvency – to -141/C252% – is also consistent with
the positive general economic picture pre-sented in 2007.
2Since the previous peak in
2003, this figure has fallen by one-quarter.Estimated creditor claims totalled 331
1/C252bil-
lion compared with 3611/C252billion in 2002 and
an average of 3381/C252billion between 2003
and 2006. The downward trend in insolven-cies was evident across all economic sectors;at -23
1/C252%, it was most pronounced for
manufacturing. Broken down by legal form, adecline can also be seen across all categorieswith the exception of private companies limit-ed by shares (Ltd), which recorded 44% moreinsolvencies. In previous years, this type oflegal form was often the preferred choice forstart-ups because the minimum capital re-quired is lower than for private limited com-panies (GmbH). Measured across all legalforms, the insolvency ratio was lowest in theservices sector, at 71 failures per 10,000 en-terprises. The ratio was slightly higher intrade (87) and manufacturing (88), and againhighest in construction (160).

34Profitability
Strong economic growth in 2007 coupled
with moderate wage increases gave profit
considerable room for expansion. The annual
result before taxes on income3reported in
the corporate balance sheet statistics for en-
terprises from the production, trade, trans-
port and business-related services sectors –
according to current estimates4– shot up by
no less than 231/C252%, after having risen at
double-digit rates in the previous two years,
too. Since the cyclical low in 2003, earnings
growth has totalled 851/C252%. Over the last few
years, profits have therefore risen much faster
than in the period of expansion from 1998 to
2001, when they climbed by 22%.
The increase in the annual result before taxes
on income in 2007 is still extremely large
even after allowing for business growth. The
gross return on sales rose by3/C254percentage
point to 51/C252% in 2007, thus reaching its high-
est level since the start of the data series
based on the Financial Statements Data Pool
in 1997. Moreover, the comparable values for
western Germany, which are available for the
period from 1987 to 1996, were clearly ex-
ceeded, too. The net return on sales, which is
derived from the annual result after deduct-
ing taxes on income, increased by3/C254percent-
age point to 41/C252% in 2007 and also reached
a new high over the period since 1987. The
same is true for the period from 1971 to
1986, for which a figure can be calculated
from the annual result and sales which differs
only slightly from the definition of net return
on sales used here. During that period theratio reached a peak of 31/C254% in 1971 and
1972.5
With the exception of retail trade, which was
substantially depressed by households’ loss of
consumer purchasing power, all economic
sectors examined here contributed to the
positive earnings trend in 2007. The frontrun-
ner here was the manufacturing sector,
whose annual result before taxes on income
rose in double digits for the third year running
(+341/C252%) and has doubled since the low in
2003. The sector’s gross return on sales in-
creased during this time by 21/C254percentage
points to 6%. Earnings varied quite consider-
ably across the individual manufacturing in-
dustries. Consumption-related sectors record-
ed below-average growth in profit for the
3The annual result corresponds to the annual profit in
accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB)
before profit or loss transfers. It provides a better indica-
tion of the profits generated by the enterprises analysed
in this article because many firms are linked through
profit transfer agreements with enterprises which are not
included in the corporate balance sheet statistics (eg
holding companies) and to which their profits/losses are
transferred.
4The following study is based on 24,000 financial state-
ments for 2007. This statistical base corresponds to just
under one-third of the annual number of financial state-
ments in the two preceding years. The data from the fi-
nancial statements were extrapolated based on estima-
tions using data from the turnover tax statistics. The
tables inserted in this article show the profitability and fi-
nancing of enterprises in the economic sectors examined
as a whole for the period 2005 to 2007. The tables ap-
pended at the end contain more detailed information on
individual economic sectors for 2005 and 2006. Long
data series with extrapolated results from financial state-
ments of German enterprises are available online (http://
www.bundesbank.de/statistik/statistik_wirtschaftsdaten_
jahresabschluss.en.php).
5However, the net return on sales reported here is only
suitable for showing the development of post-tax profit-
ability; its level is overstated to the extent that taxes on
income include, besides trade earnings tax, only corpor-
ation tax (including the solidarity surcharge) paid by cor-
porations. The annual results of non-corporations (part-
nerships and sole proprietorships), by contrast, are taxed
as part of the entrepreneurs’ private income and so their
income tax payments do not appear in these firms’ in-
come statements.Dynamic profit

35reasons mentioned above, while the produ-
cers of capital and intermediate goods faredexceptionally well owing to vigorous exportgrowth and buoyant investment activity inGermany. Automobile manufacturers experi-enced a similar situation; although they soldfar fewer vehicles to domestic households,they were able to record excellent results dueto a further rise in exports and higher sales tocorporate customers in Germany. Thus themanufacture of cars – measured in terms ofvolume – increased by almost 6% in 2007and the manufacture of heavy goods vehiclesexpanded by no less than one-fifth.
The persistently buoyant industrial activity in
2007 also boosted business development inthe transport and business-related servicessectors and pushed profit up. Transport enter-prises (excluding railways) expanded their an-nual result before taxes, compared to thesubdued level in 2006, by around four-tenthsand their gross return on sales by almost 1
1/C252
percentage points to 5%. This is partly alsodue to the fact that fuel prices, which are ofparticular importance in this sector, rose at afar slower pace than in previous years. Inturn, this was attributable to the sidewaysmovement in euro prices for Brent crude oilon an annual average following averagegrowth rates of 28% in the three precedingyears (trade and industry were not directly af-fected by the increase in standard VAT ratesdue to input tax relief). At over one-fifth,growth in profit for business-related serviceproviders was also strong. Their return onsales rose further to 10
1/C252%, meaning that
this sector again achieved by far the best re-sult of any sector.Selected indicators

36Business and earnings development in whole-
sale trade is generally likewise strongly influ-
enced by economic activity in industry. How-
ever, in 2007, the expansionary stimuli from
industry were countered by a decline in the
“solid, liquid and gaseous fuels and related
products” industry. In addition to the sub-
dued rate of price increases, this was com-
pounded by the fact that households brought
forward many purchases of heating oil to
2006. At 3%, the wholesale trade sector’s
gross return on sales remained almost un-
changed. As mentioned above, retail trade
activities were affected by tax-related losses
of purchasing power and shifts in demand.
Thus strong growth at the end of 2006 was
followed by an expected collapse at the start
of 2007, which was particularly pronounced
for durables such as cars and furniture. Dur-
ing the course of 2007, the increasing loss of
purchasing power due to energy and agricul-
tural prices weighed on demand in retail
trade. As a result, gross profit fell by 1%,
however, at 31/C252%, its return on sales, which
declined by the same amount, was no less
than in the previous year. In 2007, fiscal fac-
tors also had an impact on the development
of earnings in the construction sector. Much
construction work for new flats and for reno-
vations was brought forward and invoiced
in 2006 due to the increase in VAT. This re-
sulted in a gap in orders in 2007. However,
this was counterbalanced by a clear increase
in industrial and commercial building and in
public sector construction. The improvement
of 71/C252% in the annual result before taxes on
income was below average. At 53/C254%, the
gross return on sales nonetheless marked a
new high.The figures for the return on sales for the in-
dividual economic sectors are not directly
comparable due to the use of varying input
ratios or depth of value added. To facilitate
such a comparison, it is therefore advisable to
set the gross annual result in relation to gross
income, which corresponds to gross revenue
less the cost of materials and is very similar to
the definition of value added included in the
national accounts. For producing enterprises,
this ratio rose from almost 13% in 2006 to
15% in 2007, which matches the relative in-
crease in gross return on sales. However,
using this measure of profitability changes
the sectoral rankings quite dramatically. At
the top of the table is wholesale trade with
18%, followed by business-related services
and then manufacturing. All other sectors are
below average and transport, at 91/C252%, is at
the bottom of the table.
Income and expenses in detail
In 2007, brisk growth in business activity was
once again a key driver of the sharp increase
in profit. However, at 5%, the rise in gross
revenue, which contains sales, the changes in
stocks of finished goods as well as other own
work capitalised, in the economic sectors
examined here was not as dynamic as in
2006 (+7%). This was predominantly due to
low growth in construction and wholesale
trade as well as to a slight decrease in retail
trade. The remaining sectors recorded very
high levels of growth. For example, gross rev-
enue in manufacturing expanded by 8%. Ac-

37Germany increased by 9% whereas those
with domestic enterprises went up by 6%.While growth differentials could also be ob-served for producers of intermediate and cap-ital goods, they were most pronounced in thearea of consumer goods for the reasons men-tioned above. The producers of durablegoods within this sector even registered aslight fall in sales in 2007 in Germany,although they recorded an increase of 7% inexports.
Interest and similar income again grew even
more sharply than gross revenue (+28%).While it has risen by 65% since its last low in2004, its share in total income in 2007 stillamounted to only
1/C252%. Contributions to the
sharp growth in the reporting year came, onthe one hand, from a greater build-up ofinterest-bearing receivables (+8
1/C252% on an-
nual average) and, on the other hand, to a1/C252
percentage point increase in the averageinterest rate to 3
1/C252% due to higher market
rates. Other income, which is composed of alarge number of very different items, includ-ing income from long-term equity invest-ments, rose by 12
1/C252%. Due to the surge in
these two items, the increase of 51/C252% in total
income was slightly larger than in the actualbusiness activities.
Total expenses (excluding taxes on income of
corporations) went up by 4
1/C252%, which was
perceptibly slower than income, thus leavingroom for a marked improvement in the grossannual result. This was mainly due to the factthat the rise in personnel expenses againtrailed noticeably behind business growth, adevelopment which will be examined moreEnterprises’ income statement*

38closely below. At 4%, the increase in other
expenses, which include rentals and leases,
research and development cost as well as ad-
vertising expenses and together account for
one-seventh of gross revenue, was also more
moderate than the increase in income.
By contrast, the cost of materials, which con-
stitutes around two-thirds of total expenses,
went up at virtually the same pace as gross
revenue following a much sharper increase in
2006. This can be partly attributed to the fact
that US dollar prices on commodity markets
rose more slowly than in the previous years
and that this price increase was cushioned to
a large extent for buyers in Germany by the
strong appreciation of the euro against the
US dollar. In 2007, import prices consequently
rose by a mere 1.2% following an increase of
4.3% in 2006 and 5.2% in 2005.
Although, at 21/C252%, personnel expenses grew
faster in 2007 than in 2006 (+11/C252%), they in-
creased much more slowly than total ex-
penses. This was due to the fact that the in-
crease in negotiated wages, calculated at less
than 11/C252% on both a monthly and an hourly
basis, was again rather moderate. Added to
this was the cut in the contribution rate to
the Federal Employment Agency from 6.5%
to 4.2% with effect from 1 January 2007,
with employers benefiting from one-half of
this. While this was partly offset by a rise in
the contribution rate to the statutory pension
insurance scheme and in the average contri-
bution rate to the statutory health insurance
scheme of about1/C252percentage point in both
cases, firms’ payroll cost enjoyed considerable
relief on balance. A further factor here is thata number of large enterprises reduced their
expenditure on company pension schemes
and made smaller severance payments as
part of staff restructuring schemes. With re-
gard to personnel expenses as a whole, the
overall moderate increase in personnel ex-
penses per hour worked was accompanied by
a clear rise in the number of hours worked,
which was reflected, on the one hand, in cor-
responding higher wage payments per em-
ployee. On the other hand, the number of
employees rose significantly, by 2% according
to the definition in the corporate balance
sheet statistics.
In contrast, the increase in depreciation of
tangible fixed assets (including intangible
fixed assets) was comparatively sharp
(+61/C252%). This is attributable to both the
strong growth in investment in new machin-
ery and equipment as well as to the tempor-
ary raising of the declining-balance depreci-
ation rates for movable fixed assets in 2006
and 2007. In this respect, it is worth noting
that in manufacturing close to 60% of total
depreciation was attributable to tangible
fixed assets; however, measured in terms of
gross revenue, at 31/C252%, this sector still
ranked below transport (51/C252%). The high
share of vehicles – which can be depreciated
relatively quickly – in machinery and equip-
ment played a role in this. The figure for
business-related services, which include the
capital-intensive sector “computer and re-
lated activities”, was at the same level as the
ratio in manufacturing. In the remaining sec-
tors, depreciation of tangible fixed assets is
much less significant; the corresponding
shares in gross revenue ranged between 1%Cost of

39for wholesale trade and 3% for construction.
Write-downs of long-term financial assets
and securities classified as current assets were
notably lower, so that total depreciation was
only 4% higher than in 2006.
Following a rise of 61/C252% in 2006, interest and
similar expenses recorded a further surge of
141/C252% in 2007. This was due, firstly, to a
larger increase in interest-bearing liabilities of
51/C252% on an annual average. Secondly, the
average lending rate – in line with market
interest rates – continued to increase to al-
most 5%. Due to the extraordinarily sharp
growth in interest and similar income, which
offset over half the corresponding expense
item recorded in the enterprises’ extrapolated
income statements, net interest expenditure
increased by only 2%. At1/C252%, its share in
gross revenue remained at a low level.
Sources and uses of funds
The enterprises in the economic sectors
examined here increased their total inflows of
funds by one-fifth to 3279 billion in the re-
porting year.6The low from 2004 was thus
exceeded by one-and-a-half times and
reached a new record high. One-seventh of
the year-on-year increase derived from in-
ternal funding. The remaining far larger share
came from external funding, which is not un-
usual during times of positive profit and sales
growth. In the period from 2002 to 2004,
which was difficult in this respect, there waseither no inflow of funds (2002) or else these
inflows were actually negative (2003 and
2004) because liabilities were redeemed on
balance. The volume of internal funding,
which, at 60% of the total of funds, was still
the most significant source of financing, in-
creased by 41/C252% in 2007. At 3 percentage
points, the highest contribution to growth
was made by depreciation allowances which,
in percentage terms, however, recorded only
below-average growth. Capital injections
from profit (including contributions to the
capital of non-corporations) as well as trans-
fers to provisions contributed the remaining
11/C252percentage points of the rise in internal
funding.
Enterprises received 3111 billion from exter-
nal funding sources; that was 342 billion
(+62%) more than in 2006. This was due to
an increase by half in capital injections to cor-
porations and in liabilities of almost two-
thirds. It is striking that only short-term finan-
cial obligations recently entered into rose (by
3471/C252billion, which is twice as much as in
2006). This increase is predominantly attribut-
able to the greater level of borrowing from
banks, which was at a low level in 2006.
From 2002 to 2005, redemptions actually
outweighed borrowing. In 2007, additional
liabilities of 3341/C252billion were incurred from
payments received on account of orders
whereas one year previously a decline was
observed in this item. This clear reversal is
probably due to some extent to the increase
in VAT as there was a fiscal incentive at the
end of 2006 to invoice services early, especial-
ly in the construction sector. In the accounts,
this was then debited against the payments6The figures on the sources and uses of funds are subject

40received on account of orders. Given the
brisk expansion of business activity, enter-
prises also incurred new trade payables; how-
ever, the rise was smaller than one year previ-
ously; the same is true for trade receivables.
Furthermore, the increase in short-term liabil-
ities to affiliated companies, which also con-
tain trade payables, slowed down noticeably.
Long-term obligations were redeemed in net
terms, thus resuming a tendency which start-
ed in 2000 and was interrupted only in 2006.
Of the total inflows of funds, almost two-
thirds were used for non-financial asset for-
mation. This figure was thus almost 60%
higher than in 2006 when the focus was still
on accumulating financial assets. The marked
topping-up of gross investment was primarily
associated with the strong build-up of inven-
tories. On the one hand, this is attributable to
sustained growth of business activity in
manufacturing, which is generally associated
with more extensive stockpiling. Moreover,
during the course of 2007, prices for energy
and agricultural raw materials went up no-
ticeably, meaning that at the end of 2007
higher figures were recorded in the balance
sheet per se than in the previous year. On the
other hand, the inventory levels in construc-
tion returned to normal following a consider-
able reduction at the end of 2006 – as with
payments received on account of orders –
due to many services been invoiced early for
tax reasons. All in all, half of the growth in in-
ventory investments for the economic sectors
examined can be attributed to this effect.

assets.
While fewer funds were provided for financial
asset formation than in 2006, the absolute
amount was still considerably larger than the
average for the period from 1998 to 2005.
The decline on 2006 is partly attributable to a
much weaker accumulation of short-term
receivables and partly to the net disposal of
securities. In contrast, long-term receivables
and the acquisition of other long-term equity
investments increased significantly. However,
at 131/C252% of the total sources of funds, the
budget for new other long-term equity in-
vestments was only slightly higher than the
average for the period from 2001 to 2006.
Balance sheet trends and balance sheet
ratios
Together with various special factors, it was
the favourable macroeconomic setting and
the persistent buoyant growth in profitability
which shaped the development of enter-
prises’ balance sheets in 2007. At 71/C252%, bal-
ance sheet growth was even greater than in
the previous year, when it had amounted to a
sizeable 51/C252%. This was the largest increase
since the start of the series in 1997. Between
2001 and 2005, the annual growth rate had
stood at only 11/C252%. The balance sheet total
tended to be on the increase in all the eco-
nomic sectors examined here, albeit to differ-
ent degrees. Thus the assets and capital in
the business-related services segment went
up by 141/C252% and in the construction sector
by 131/C252%, although the normalisation in in-Enterprises’ balance sheet*

42Deutsche BundesbankThe increasing integration in the balance sheet structures of German enterprises
Development since the mid-1990s
Since the mid-1990s, the structure of German enterprises’
balance sheets has changed dramatically. Looking at the
development of the most important items on the asset
and capital sides using extrapolated data drawn from the
Deutsche Bundesbank’s corporate balance sheet statis-
tics, one striking feature is the sharp rise in receivables
from and liabilities to affiliated companies. From 1997 to
2007, their share of the balance sheet total increased by
41/C252percentage points to 16% and 181/C252%, respectively.
This reflects a rise in intra-sectoral integration. The fact
that other long-term equity investments likewise went
up by 41/C252percentage points to 14% is consistent with
this picture. The growing importance of receivables from
affiliated companies and other long-term equity invest-
ments on the assets side occurred at the expense of non-
financial assets, which dropped by 71/C252percentage points
to 411/C252% of total assets. On the capital side, the share
of liabilities to banks fell considerably; thus in 2007, it
amounted to only 131/C252% of the balance sheet total, com-
pared with 211/C252% in 1997.
These changes in the balance sheet structure were par-
ticularly pronounced among large enterprises. At almost
22% of the balance sheet total in 2006 (the most recent
year for which reliable data are available), liabilities to
affiliated companies were the third most important
source of financing after equity and provisions. Although
this item also gained in importance among small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it constituted only
131/C252% of the balance sheet total in 2006. Among large
enterprises, moreover, the share of bank borrowing,
which has always played a comparatively minor role in
their funding owing to their broader range of financing
options (large stocks of provisions), fell still further to
around 61/C252%. By contrast, the share of bank loans
among the SMEs, at 261/C252% of total capital, was signifi-
cantly higher at the end of the period under review. In
2006, large enterprises held other long-term equity in-
vestments amounting to 191/C252% of the balance sheet
total; among the SMEs, the figure was 21/C252%.
These changes in the balance sheet structure are largely
attributable to the more intensive intra-group division of
labour, which was accompanied by the establishment ofa growing number of legally independent subsidiaries.
The higher proportion of receivables from and liabilities
to affiliated companies is a reflection both of intra-group
financial transactions and of the flow of trade payables
and receivables within the corporate network.1A key
role in this context is played by the foreign financing sub-
sidiaries of major German groups, which were set up in
order to obtain low-cost funding for the group as a
whole, eg by issuing corporate bonds.
Since the mid-1990s, the structural changes in the bal-
ance sheets have been further intensified by other fac-
tors. The decline in the prominence of bank loans in this
period was accompanied not only by an increase in liabil-
ities to affiliated companies but also by a sharp rise of
9 percentage points to 251/C252% in the equity ratio. This
was due, in part, to the fact that firms with a low level of
own funds came under increasing pressure to strengthen
their capital base – even before the new capital require-
ments under the Basel II framework came into force.
1Section 266 of the German Commercial Code requires a prior disclos-
ure of receivables and liabilities by intra-sectoral integration and not
by nature. — 2From a tax perspective, the main attractions for groups
in the period under review were that the corresponding debt interestwas exempt from local business tax, no withholding tax was levied on
the interest income of financing subsidiaries and their profits were
not subject to the relatively heavy tax burden in Germany. — 3The

43Comparison between group parent companies and
non-affiliated companies
In order to better isolate the effect of increasing integra-
tion from other factors, the balance sheets of group par-
ent companies are first compared below with those of
non-affiliated companies. The capital structures of select-
ed German large enterprises with foreign financing sub-
sidiaries are then considered in more detail.
A comparison of the annual financial accounts of group
parent companies and non-affiliated enterprises in the
manufacturing sector reveals clear differences in the de-velopment of key balance sheet items. While the propor-
tion of liabilities showed a sharp downward trend among
the non-affiliated companies, it increased among the
group parent companies, primarily because the financial
obligations to affiliated companies more than doubled to
23% between 1997 and 2006. Partly in response to the re-
sulting significant extension of the balance sheet, the
equity ratio of the group parent companies fell by 3 per-
centage points, while it grew robustly by 14
1/C252percentage
points to 311/C252% among the non-affiliated companies.
Although in both groups tangible fixed assets showed a
downward trend, the difference in magnitude is consid-
erable; thus their share of the balance sheet total among
non-affiliated firms, at 33% in 2006, was almost three
times that among group parent companies. Alongside
the extension of the balance sheet owing to the increase
in financial relationships with affiliated companies, the
fact that investment in tangible fixed assets was often
substituted by the acquisition of other long-term equityinvestments is also likely to have played a role in this.
This is supported in the income statement by the consid-
erable rise in the cost of materials as a result of growth in
purchases of intermediate goods from affiliated com-
panies. The share of the cost of materials in gross revenue
rose by 13 percentage points to 68
1/C252% from 1997 to
2006, while the corresponding share for non-affiliated
firms increased by only 31/C252percentage points to 55%.
Group financing via foreign financing subsidiaries
Many of the major multinational groups based in Ger-
many established autonomous financing subsidiaries (alsoknown as captive finance companies) in the 1980s and
1990s, primarily – for tax reasons – in the Netherlands.2
Their task is to obtain financial resources against collat-
eral or letters of comfort from the parent company,
mainly by issuing bonds on international capital markets,
and to channel them to the parent companies, subsidiar-
ies and holding companies.
The effects of this cross-border financing of the group via
foreign financing subsidiaries on the individual accounts
of domestic parent companies can be seen in the table
below. Twelve German large enterprises with financing
subsidiaries in the Netherlands were selected; their cap-ital structures were compared using both the consoli-
dated financial statements of the corporate group and
the individual accounts of the group’s parent company.
3
In the individual accounts of the parent companies, bank
liabilities, at 1% of the balance sheet total, were of min-
imal importance. These enterprises thus rely overwhelm-
ingly on intra-group financing. Liabilities in the form of
bonds amount to 20% of the balance sheet total in thegroup accounts. The passing-on of the related financial
resources within the group is primarily reflected in group
parent companies’ liabilities to affiliated companies,
which, with a share of 37
1/C252% of the balance sheet total,
far exceed equity (28%) or provisions (22%).
vidual accounts of the financing subsidiary as the latter are not usually
published. Of the individual accounts of other companies in thegroup, only the data from the group parent company is used as thesubsidiaries’ financial statements are not available in their entirety. Itis mainly the data from the foreign subsidiaries that are missing – and
these are of particular significance among the globally active enter-prises under consideration here. — 4Twelve non-financial enterprises

44voicing behaviour mentioned above also
played a role here. The growth rate in manu-
facturing was in line with the average in-
crease and the rate in transport was just
slightly below this. However, at 4% and 3%,
balance sheet growth for wholesale and retail
trade enterprises was much lower.
In 2007, for the first time in a long while,
non-financial assets increased by a greater
amount (81/C252%) than financial assets. This
was mainly due to strong stockbuilding,
which was fuelled by special factors and
which caused inventories to expand consider-
ably. Tangible fixed assets, too, went up
much faster than one year previously. How-
ever, at 4%, their growth rate still trailed far
behind that of the balance sheet total, mean-
ing that their share of total assets fell further
to 20%. All financial asset items, with the ex-
ception of securities, increased. Long-term
receivables recorded particularly high growth,
including those to affiliated companies. In
addition, at 101/C252%, growth in other long-
term equity investments was particularly dy-
namic. At 14%, its share in the balance sheet
total reached a new record level. Broken
down by economic sector, the individual
growth rates range broadly from 21/C252% for
construction to 181/C252% for industry. Overall, it
can be seen that the development and,
above all, the structure of the balance sheet
and of the sources and uses of funds are
being increasingly influenced by intra-group
relations between enterprises (for further in-
formation, see the box on pages 42 and 43).

45continued into 2007 with a growth rate of
101/C252%. Its share in the balance sheet total,
the equity ratio, went up by3/C254percentage
point to 251/C252%. This is an increase of 9 per-
centage points on the low of the new dataseries in 1997. Of the various economic sec-tors, manufacturing, at 28
1/C252%, still occupied
the top position, followed by wholesale(25%), business-related service providers(24%), transport (21%) and retail trade(18%). Construction was still at the lowerend of the spectrum at 11
1/C252%. However, its
equity base recorded the biggest relative im-provement over the medium term, given thatits equity ratio had amounted to a mere 4%in 2001. The weight of liabilities and provi-sions decreased again accordingly; for enter-prises as a whole, this figure was down to74
1/C252%. Liabilities to banks decreased only in
the long-term segment, whereas the share ofshort-term bank borrowing managed to sta-bilise for the first time in a long while (at6
1/C252% of the balance sheet total). Provisions
were raised by a comparatively moderate de-gree. The lower transfers to pension provi-sions mentioned above also contributed tothis development.
While the upward movement of the equity
ratio continued in 2007, other balance sheetratios point to a consolidation of financing re-lations at a high level. At 44
1/C252% of the bal-
ance sheet total, long-term equity and liabil-ities remained fairly high in a multi-year com-parison. Moreover, they clearly exceeded the
stock of fixed assets by 13%. The short-termfinancing situation remained relaxed; al-though, at 92% of short-term liabilities, cashresources and short-term receivables weredown on the 2006 ratio, they far exceededthe average of 87
1/C252% since the beginning of
the series in 1997. In addition, the share ofcash flow in liabilities and provisions – a ratiowhich shows firms’ repayment capacity –continued to increase to 19%. The compar-able values at the beginning of the decadewere just over 15%.
All in all, the balance sheets for 2007 show
remarkable underlying financial strength forGerman enterprises in the economic sectorsexamined. Given the recent marked deterior-ation in the economic outlook and the on-going financial market crisis, this buffer isnow proving very beneficial. For some enter-prises, this could even be the key to safe-guarding their commercial viability. In add-ition, this financial buffer reduces the bankingsector’s need for write-offs. Seen in this light,German enterprises have successfully usedthe buoyant economic years in this decade tostrengthen their financial resilience. This isparticularly true in comparison with the previ-ous cycle when they were faced with cyclical-ly related strains and substantial balancesheet problems following the bursting of theNew Economy bubble.

55The Basel Framework
in practice –
implementing the
Basel advanced
approaches
in GermanyIn Germany, the new Basel Capital
Accord (BaselII) has been in force for
all institutions since 1 January 2008.
When calculating their minimum cap-
ital requirements under Pillar1 of the
revised framework, institutions are now
free to choose whether to use one of
the simple standardised supervisory ap-
proaches or advanced approaches
based on their own internal methods.
The use of internal methods for regula-
tory purposes requires approval by
Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory
Authority ( Bundesanstalt f/C252r Finanz-
dienstleistungsaufsicht or BaFin).
Institutions from all sectors of the
banking industry are now using their
own methods to measure risk. Using
Advanced Measurement Approaches
for supervisory purposes has proved a
correct decision. Current trends also
show, however, that some areas of the
framework still require some improve-
ment. Examples include the capital re-
quirements for certain types of securi-
tisation transactions and the capital
charge for event and default risk in the
trading book. In addition, banks’ risk
management must be improved across
the board for all types of risk, particu-
larly liquidity risk. Moreover, the cap-
ital relief associated with the advanced
approaches under the Basel Frame-
work needs to be reviewed.

56Minimum capital requirements under the
Basel Framework
The key objective of the Revised Framework
for capital adequacy (BaselII), which was
adopted in 2004, is to align regulatory capital
requirements for banks more closely to the
actual risks they incur and to take account
of recent trends in the financial markets
and institutions’ risk management practices
(Pillar1). This internationally developed frame-
work was transposed into European law by
Directive 2006/48/EC, which in turn was
transposed into German law in the German
Banking Act ( Kreditwesengesetz ) and by
the “Regulation Governing the Capital Ad-
equacy of Institutions, Groups of Institutions
and Financial Holding Groups” (Solvency
Regulation) via the “Act Implementing the
Revised Banking Directive and the Revised
Capital Adequacy Directive” ( Gesetz zur Um-
setzung der neugefassten Bankenrichtlinie
und der neugefassten Kapitalad/C228quanzricht-
linie) of 17 November 2006.
The provisions of the “Market Risk Amend-
ment” published by the Basel Committee in
1996 allowed the use of internal market
risk models; Pillar 1, with its Internal Ratings-
Based Approach (IRBA) for credit risk and the
Advanced Measurement Approaches for op-
erational risk1(AMA), enables banks to use
internal procedures to calculate regulatory
capital requirements for these two types of
risk, too.
In order to facilitate the transition, in 2007
credit institutions were able to choose be-
tween Basel’s Foundation IRB Approach andthe Standardised Approach under the new
Basel Framework, on the one hand, and Prin-
ciple I, which had so far been in force in Ger-
many, on the other, for calculating their regu-
latory capital requirements. Since 1 January
2008, the new Basel rules have been in force
for all credit institutions in Germany – as well
as in all other EU countries, Switzerland and
Japan.
The Internal Ratings-Based Approach
(IRBA)
Structure
Under the IRBA, credit institutions have to
apply three risk parameters for each trans-
action of a given borrower when establishing
their regulatory capital requirements for credit
risks: the probability of default (PD), the ex-
posure at default (EAD) calculated using
credit conversion factors (CCF), and the loss
given default (LGD). Under the Foundation
IRBA, banks estimate only the PD itself for ex-
posures to sovereigns, banks and corporates
and use supervisory values for LGD and CCF.
Under the Advanced IRBA, by contrast, insti-
tutions estimate all parameters themselves.
For retail exposures,2institutions always have
to estimate PD, LGD and CCF themselves.
Credit institutions wanting to use the IRBA to
calculate their regulatory capital requirements
1Operational risk means the risk of losses resulting from
inadequate or failed internal processes, people and sys-
tems or from external events. This definition includes
legal risk.

57need rating systems approved by BaFin which
meet the minimum quantitative and qualita-tive requirements set forth in the SolvencyRegulation. Whereas the minimum quantita-tive requirements concern, most notably, theestimate of the risk parameters and the re-quired data inputs, the qualitative require-ments relate to all processes associated withthe rating procedures. This includes corporategovernance when introducing, using and up-dating rating systems, issuing ratings andloans, and also the incorporation of ratingsinto the bank’s credit risk managementframework. The minimum qualitative require-ments for the IRBA are based, in principle, onthe “Minimum Requirements for Risk Man-agement” ( Mindestanforderungen an das
Risikomanagement , or MaRisk), which apply
to all credit institutions. They supplementMaRisk by adding special requirements interms of rating systems intended to ensurethat all institutions using internal proceduresfor calculating regulatory capital require-ments measure risk with the requisite level ofreliability and accuracy.
The IRBA rules for classic credit business have
been supplemented by special provisions forspecific aspects of credit risk measurementand management: the Internal AssessmentApproach (IAA) for exposures in unratedsecuritisation positions in an Asset-BackedCommercial Paper (ABCP) programme andthe Internal Models Method (IMM) for net-ting agreements. The IAA and IMM both re-quire separate approval procedures. The IRBAis more risk sensitive than the old Principle Iand offers a more suitable set of incentivesfor improving credit institutions’ risk manage-ment strategies. Henceforth, capital charges
will increase in proportion to the risk of theassets in question.
Use in GermanyIRB systems are currently being used in all
three pillars of the banking industry (the pri-vate, public and cooperative sectors) and forall types of credit business (retail and com-mercial banking, specialised lending, transac-tions with banks and sovereigns, securitisa-tions etc). Currently, 59 institutions and groupshave applied for approval for their IRBA sys-tems, 21 of which have applied to use theAdvanced IRBA. IRBA banks can be dividedinto two fundamentally different categories:large banks offering a broad range of ser-vices, and smaller and medium-sized yethighly specialised institutions. This is becauselarge banks have the necessary resources anddata histories to introduce numerous internalratings-based systems nationwide. Smallerand medium-sized institutions, such as build-ing and loan associations, mortgage banks,automotive and consumer credit banks, andspecialised lending banks, by contrast, onlyneed a small number of internal ratings-based systems to cover their entire base ofborrowers, owing to their specialisation. Bothcategories generally already have many yearsof experience with systematic approaches forassessing credit risk; the threshold for apply-ing for approval to use the IRBA is thereforerelatively low.
More broadly based smaller and medium-
sized credit institutions, however, believe theburden involved in using the IRBA outweighs

58the advantages, at least at present. Overall,
IRBA institutions account for around two-
thirds of the balance sheet total of all banks.
The adjacent chart provides an overview of
the use of the IRBA in Germany by category
of banks. Germany is one of Europe’s leaders
in terms of IRBA coverage throughout the
banking system.
Implementation from the institutions’
perspective
Credit institutions have the option of introdu-
cing the IRBA over a period of up to five years
(also known as partial use). This allows insti-
tutions to gradually implement suitable rating
systems.3Institutions are taking up this op-
tion in a variety of ways. The average imple-
mentation period required to cover all port-
folios with the IRBA is around three years.
However, around a quarter of institutions hit
the exit threshold within a year after launch-
ing the approval process.
Upon entry into the IRBA, the coverage of
institutions’ portfolios by internal rating sys-
tems averages 77% as measured by risk-
weighted assets (RWA) and 82% as meas-
ured by EAD. At the end of the implementa-
tion phase, the average figures are just under
96% for RWA and 97% for EAD. With theImplementation of the revised

3To launch the approval process, institutions must cover
at least 50% of their lending business using the IRBA,
measured against the exposure at default and risk-
weighted assets (entry threshold). After two-and-a-half
years, coverage must, in each case, be at least 80%
(supervisory reference point). After five years at the latest,

60sists largely of suitability examinations of all
rating systems prior to their use for calculat-
ing regulatory capital requirements and the
review and oversight of the implementation
plan throughout the implementation period.
This includes, in particular, continually observ-
ing implementation progress and compliance
with the requirements governing the tempor-
ary and permanent partial use of the IRBA for
certain portfolio sections.
Suitability examinations are a key element of
the approval process and are conducted
mainly by the Bundesbank. They serve to ver-
ify actual compliance with the requirements
for using an IRBA. Since a considerable por-
tion of the IRBA requirements relate to banks’
internal processes, the suitability examin-
ations are usually conducted on-site. In some
220 suitability examinations, the Bundesbank
has, to date, reviewed compliance with min-
imum requirements for over 360 rating sys-
tems.
Banking associations have initiated joint rat-
ing projects to give small and medium-sized
institutions the opportunity to use the IRBA at
a reasonable cost. Such pool projects not only
reduce the cost of developing the systems
but also broaden the pool of available data
for parameter estimation. Supervisors have
been following these projects closely. One
tried-and-tested strategy in the approval pro-
cess is the so-called pilot bank concept, in
which the entire methodology and imple-
mentation of the systems in the institutions’
internal processes are comprehensively exam-
ined at previously designated “pilot banks”.
Other institutions participating in the poolproject then tap the knowledge gained from
the pilot examination for their implemen-
tation examinations, thereby reducing the
examination workload considerably. The pilot
banks obtained approval in all major pool
projects. The approval process is now com-
plete for all banks involved except for the
public and cooperative sector. Savings banks
and cooperatives, in particular, currently see
little benefit in using the IRBA because of the
extra time and effort involved in implementa-
tion and are therefore, in most cases, current-
ly using these jointly developed systems for
internal control purposes only.
Internationally active banking groups often
apply uniform rating systems across national
borders. Under European law, an internation-
al group operating in the EU must obtain
approval from the parent’s national supervis-
ory authority (home supervisor). When decid-
ing on approval, home supervisors must take
into account all factors that the supervisory
authorities of the foreign subsidiaries (host
supervisors) deem relevant for approval. This
process requires close consultation among all
supervisors involved in order to prevent
duplication of work. In Germany, 12 groups
whose parent institutions are domiciled
abroad, chiefly in France and the Benelux
countries, have to date filed an application
for IRBA approval. In addition, 30 German
parents have applied for IRBA approval for
their foreign subsidiaries, most of which are
located in Luxembourg, Ireland and the
United Kingdom. Two different variants of co-

61Rating model methodology
IRBA banks in Germany employ three basic
rating models.
Scoring systems are quantitative decision-
making tools in which key quantitative andqualitative data are used to derive a risk as-sessment which is called a “score”. Thesescores are generally determined using clas-sic statistical procedures such as discrimin-ant analysis and regression models. Linearmethods are most common. Scoring sys-tems are mainly used in retail business withprivate clients or small and medium-sizedenterprises. Purely statistical methods canbe applied to these portfolios since suffi-cient data, in particular default data, of ad-equate quality are available. Scoring sys-tems frequently have a two-tier structure.In the loan approval process, so-called ap-plication scoring is used, with comprehen-sive data on the borrower’s economic situ-ation taken into account. This is frequentlyfollowed by so-called behavioural scoring,which focuses primarily on payment behav-iour, which banks know from observing theborrower’s account movements. The great-er the risk involved and the larger the bor-rower, the more the differences betweenthe rating procedure applied when a loanis approved and that applied during thelifetime of the loan diminish; the samemethods are employed.
While, in the corporate client segment,
most banks only use data they have collect-ed and processed themselves, in retail busi-ness almost all banks also employ data sup-plied by external credit information pro-viders, particularly when approving loans.However, these external data represent justone risk factor in the overall system; in add-ition, all banks incorporate as much of theirown information as possible into their sys-tems. The weight of such external informa-tion generally declines with the transitionto behavioural scoring.Expert systems and comparable know-
ledge-based methods are applied for as-sessing the risk of very complex borrowers,eg large internationally active enterprisesand credit institutions as well as sovereignborrowers. They incorporate not just highlyqualitative data but also, to a predefineddegree, individual features of the borrowerbeing assessed. Rating criteria and the as-sessment leeway are both based on past ex-perience and expert assessments. This pro-cedure has two advantages. On the onehand, such borrowers’ credit risk is meas-ured and assessed in a uniform and consist-ent manner; on the other, the particular-ities of highly heterogeneous borrowerscan also be taken into account.
Simulation models are employed mainly
for specialised lending and project finance.These elaborate procedures are based al-most entirely on statistics and forecast fu-ture cash flows from such investments. Tothis end, a very large number – frequentlyup to 20,000 – different scenarios for theproject are simulated and the distributionsof future cash flows derived from them.These distributions can then be used to de-termine the investment’s default risk. Theresult of such simulation processes is largelydependent on the underlying assumptions,which must therefore be reviewed con-stantly. In addition to the unavoidable dis-advantages outlined above, simulationmodels have the very great advantage ofallowing the risk inherent in an investmentto be measured in a structured way that isconsistent and uniform within the bank.
Besides these pure forms of rating
methods, hybrids which combine elementsof the scoring procedure, expert systemsand simulation models are also frequentlyused in practice. Procedures where stand-ardised quantitative information is pre-pared statistically and supplemented withexpert-based qualitative assessments aremost common.

62in the on-site approval examinations, or the
approval examinations are divided between
home and host country supervisors according
to agreed responsibilities. Responsibilities are
often divided according to the systems’ use,
with systems in use throughout the group
being examined by the home supervisor and
locally used systems by the host supervisor. In
its dual role as home supervisor and host
supervisor, the German supervisory authority
is in constant contact with foreign supervisory
authorities. Cooperation in all international
projects is now largely free of friction, since
internationally comparable standards have de-
veloped for IRBA systems.
Results of implementation at credit
institutions
The current practice of close cooperation be-
tween institutions and supervisors has con-
tributed to a largely problem-free approval
process. Because rating systems are, in many
cases, well documented, audit teams are able
to prepare intensively for the suitability exam-
inations.
However, all banks that have obtained ap-
proval to use the IRBA were well prepared
and had invested heavily in credit risk man-
agement. Their credit risk management is
therefore not only more accurate but also
more efficient. The IRBA has thus given credit
risk management a considerable innovative
boost. Banks are using, in some cases, highly
refined and methodologically complex systems
to determine and assess credit risk, for ex-
ample when rating specialised lending facil-
ities (see also explanatory notes on page 61).Yet for other portfolios and borrowers, too,
the introduction of internal ratings-based
procedures has rendered the measurement
and management of credit risk more struc-
tured, more systematic and more precise than
just a few years ago.
The introduction of the IRBA has led to a dis-
tinct improvement in the quantitative aspects
of institutions’ credit risk measurement prac-
tices. As regards the estimation of risk param-
eters, nearly all IRBA banks have made the
most progress in calculating PD. The systems
are now achieving, in some cases, very good
results in terms of statistical forecast quality
and discriminatory power. This is due to the
many years of experience these institutions
have had in the systematic assessment of bor-
rowers’ creditworthiness and also to the exist-
ence at these institutions of databases with a
relatively long data history.
However, for many institutions, datasets are
an area in which there is still plenty of room
for improving the implementation of the IRBA
requirements for calibrating rating systems
in terms of the PD, CCF (and, by extension,
EAD), and LGD risk parameters. In some cases,
the pool of data hardly goes beyond the re-
quired minimum history. Estimates frequently
need to be derived from aggregated portfolio
variables because the data needed for more
granular estimates, such as at rating grade
level, are not yet available. The largest chal-
lenges in system calibration continue to lie in
setting the conversion factors for calculating
EAD.Largely

63Institutions, however, must also be aware
of the limitations of risk measurement thatis characterised by complex models. Modelsare always constrained by assumptions andsimplifications as well as by the limited natureof the data used. It is therefore important,in terms of proper risk management, tosupplement rating systems with qualitative,forward-looking elements such as suitablestress tests and scenario analyses. There is aclose link here between the minimum re-quirements for the IRBA and the MaRiskrequirements for proper risk management,demanded of credit institutions under Pillar 2of the Basel Framework and reviewed bysupervisors.
The IRBA banks have used the introduction
of their internal ratings-based proceduresto streamline and thoroughly revamp theirevolved and, in many cases, very heteroge-neous IT infrastructure. This currently on-going process is laying the groundwork for adistinct improvement in data quality at all in-stitutions affected. IRBA systems can there-fore be expected to rest on a better empiricalfoundation in future.
Nearly all German institutions use an exclu-
sively collateral-based approach to estimatingLGD. This is mainly the consequence of thestandard practice in Germany of acceptingcollateral only with a broad declaration ofpurpose. Accordingly, in a first step, an in-ternal procedure is used to assign borrowers’various collateral items to their loans. In asubsequent second step, the LGD for eachloan is derived from the degree of collaterali-sation and the realisation rate of the assignedcollateral. German practice therefore differs
from that in countries such as the UnitedStates, Canada or the United Kingdom,where lending is much more standardised:generally collateral is contractually tied to aspecific loan, and, for certain types of loans,only a specific set of collateral can be used.Therefore, transaction-specific factors such asthe type of loan play a major role in determin-ing LGD in those countries yet are irrelevantto German credit institutions.
Stress tests of default risk are therefore
another important aspect of the IRBA. TheIRBA’s risk sensitivity means capital require-ments react cyclically, ie they rise in line withcredit risk. An essential condition for IRBA ap-proval is therefore that banks can demon-strate how well they are prepared for thisinterrelationship. This requires that they regu-larly conduct stress tests. Pillar 1 stress testsare designed to prove that a credit institutioncan meet its regulatory capital requirementseven in a volatile business environment. Pil-lar 1 stress tests therefore help forecast andaddress the effects inherent in a risk-sensitiveframework.
The most frequent scenario assumed in
Pillar 1 stress tests is an across-the-board in-crease in the risk parameters. According toknowledge gleaned thus far from approvalexaminations, the cyclical downswings as-sumed in such stress tests would probablylower the capital ratio by around one to twopercentage points.
In addition, many banks need to make further
improvements to their internal processes. For

64instance, the IRBA – unlike MaRisk – does not
contain the option of classifying individual
transactions as not risk relevant. Banks are
frequently reluctant to implement the re-
quirement that a rating process be conducted
even in the case of fully secured loans. It is ini-
tially always necessary, however, to determine
a borrower’s – and thus the direct counter-
party’s – default risk. Collateralisation is mere-
ly downstream and serves to limit damage in
the event of default. Although such loans
may seem risk-free upon initial approval, a
drop in the value of the collateral can serious-
ly diminish the collateralisation effect. Intra-
year updates to the rating of IRBA exposures
represent another problem with which insti-
tutions have to contend. This requirement is
significant because only it can ensure con-
stant monitoring of the credit risks taken.
Overall, the structured risk measurement and
monitoring framework of IRBA rating proced-
ures renders different types of risk compar-
able and assessable. German IRBA banks are
now in a much better position with respect to
their credit risk management practices than
they were just a few years ago.
Notices of approval and conditions
To date, 52 institutions have been given ap-
proval to use the IRBA, with 20 receiving ap-
proval to use the Advanced IRBA. Approval,
however, does not mean that all the min-
imum requirements for IRB systems are fully
met from the outset. In fact, the approval
examinations have also revealed deficits, yet
these do not necessarily have to stand in the
way of IRBA approval. If the findings revealedhave only a minimal impact on capital back-
ing and if no major minimum requirements
are seriously violated, conditional approval
may be granted. However, the shortcomings
have to be remedied quickly. Approvals have
been conditional with just a few exceptions.
The specific design of the conditions and the
deadline for remedying the shortcomings de-
pend on their severity. Actual progress in rem-
edying the shortcomings is reviewed by the
Bundesbank in on-site follow-up examin-
ations.
To date, some 30 rating methods have been
denied approval for IRBA use after initial suit-
ability examinations. Frequently, these sys-
tems were not fully integrated into the intern-
al control framework, or the requirements for
parameter estimation were not fulfilled.
Securitisations
There are three approaches to the treatment
of securitisations in the IRBA, which follow a
clear hierarchy. Use of the external Ratings-
Based Approach (RBA) is mandatory for all ex-
ternally rated exposures or for those for
which a rating can be inferred from external
ratings. For an unrated securitisation expos-
ure, either a Supervisory Formula Approach
(SFA) or – for exposures extended to ABCP
programmes – an Internal Assessment Ap-
proach (IAA) subject to approval by super-
visors can be used.
Currently 11 German institutions have ob-
tained IAA approval. Institutions are not re-
stricted to using just one Internal Assessment
Approach but instead can, depending on theInstitutions’

65type of securitised asset, use a variety of sub-
approaches, each of which requires separateapproval. A large portion of German institu-tions’ IAA business is made up of the securi-tisation of trade receivables, car loans andlease receivables. However, some exotic typesof claims, such as claims against insurancecorporations or claims from court decisions,are also securitised; their risk structure andriskiness mean that it takes a lot of time andeffort to develop transparent and adequaterisk models for these types of claim.
The IAA first created the option of a portfolio-
based credit risk measurement using internalmodels for these types of transaction. Optionsfor individualising the model are tightly con-strained since each internal assessment ap-proach has to be based on a publishedmethod used by a recognised external creditassessment institution (ECAI). In principle, thisenables a high degree of transparency and afocus on the market standards created byECAIs. However, it has regularly proved to bevery difficult to show that such models arebased on published methods developed by arecognised ECAI. ECAIs have, in the past,been extremely reluctant to publish concreteassumptions for some exposure classes. How-ever, the IAA suitability examinations haveshown that banks were nevertheless able todevelop adequate risk measurement ap-proaches for various types of exposure. Defi-ciencies in individual IAA models related to un-clear definitions of their scope of applicationor an absence of defining criteria for this; also,guarantees were not always recognised ad-equately in risk assessments. The suitabilityexaminations placed particular emphasis ontransparency and on independent monitoring
of key classification parameters.
The securitisation market, which had been
steadily growing over the past few years, wasrecently buffeted by the financial market cri-sis; this involved a visible decline in the vol-ume of securitisations. At the same time, con-siderable deficiencies were revealed, especial-ly in managing the risks involved in complexsecuritisation structures. The risks of theseproducts were seriously underestimated by allmarket agents, partly because they overreliedon the ECAIs’ assessments when establishingtheir own risk assessments. In addition, manyof these products are exceedingly opaque,making it considerably more difficult to assessrisk properly. Based on these considerations,the Basel Committee has adapted the ruleson capital requirements for securitisations inorder to ensure that capital charges for theserisk exposures are more commensurate withthe risks involved (see explanatory notes onpage 66). For the future, it will therefore beimportant to supplement the Pillar 1 methodsof measuring risk for securitisations withstress tests and other appropriate analyses ofthe securitised portfolios so as to employ abroader spectrum of risk measurement pro-cedures.
In principle, securitisations continue to repre-
sent a useful refinancing and risk manage-ment instrument. However, because these in-struments often have a complex structure, in-stitutions must place much greater emphasison analysing potential risks than previously. Inthe past, such studies have sometimes beenneglected.

66Regulatory changes
Securitisation rules
As a consequence of lessons learned from
the current financial market crisis, the Basel
Committee is planning to raise the risk
weights for so-called resecuritisations.
These are securitisation transactions that
are themselves based on securitisation
transactions, including liquidity lines to
ABCP programmes that include securitisa-
tion exposures. To prevent capital arbitrage
between the banking book and the trading
book, capital requirements for securitisa-
tion exposures in the trading book are to
be brought into line with those for the
banking book. In addition, changes to the
conversion factors for eligible liquidity fa-
cilities – to a uniform 50% under the Credit
Risk Standardised Approach (CRSA) – and
the elimination of preferential conversion
factors for market disruption facilities are
intended. As a further consequence, oper-
ational standards of what constitutes a
careful credit check are being formulated.
The EU is also planning changes to the se-
curitisation rules as part of the forthcoming
directive amendment. Conversion factors
for liquidity facilities will be amended in
line with the Basel rules. In addition, insti-
tutions (as investors) are, in future, to be
allowed to assume securitisation risks only
if originators confirm that they will retain a
percentage of the risk. The quantitative cri-
terion will be supplemented by qualitative
requirements, with penalties imposed if
these are not met.Additional capital charges for market price
risk in the trading book (incremental risk
charge or IRC)
Over the past few years, the significance of
complex and illiquid credit products in the
trading book has been growing steadily.
This is because trading volumes in these
products have risen and the capital charges
in the trading book are more favourable
than those in the banking book. In light of
this, the option of electing not to model
event and default risks in the trading book
explicitly no longer appears justified. Con-
sequently, inter alia capital charges for spe-
cific price risk were adjusted by requiring
that additional capital be held for the de-
fault risk (incremental default risk charge,
IDRC) on existing exposures. The appropri-
ate rules were published in July 2005 and
incorporated into the Basel framework.
However, the losses incurred recently can-
not necessarily be attributed to defaults,
but may be due, for example, to credit mi-
gration. Consequently, focusing on default
risk alone only partially addresses existing
problems. The Basel Committee therefore
agreed to extend the incremental capital
charge on migration risks using conserva-
tive parameter assumptions. For the specif-
ic price risk of securitisations, the same risk
weights must be used as in the banking
book. In addition, several modifications to
the Market Risk Amendment are being
made; in particular, stress periods must be
used when determining capital require-
ments.
The relevant consultation papers were
scheduled for publication in January 2009.
The finalised Basel framework is currently
expected for mid-2009.

67Advanced Measurement Approaches for
operational risk
Use of AMAs in Germany
Institutions in Germany can use any of three
procedures to determine the capital charge
for operational risk: the Basic Indicator Ap-
proach (BIA), the Standardised Approach (TSA)
or the Alternative Standardised Approach
(ASA), and Advanced Measurement Ap-
proaches (AMAs). In the default BIA, the cap-
ital charge is calculated based on an institu-
tion’s weighted average gross income over
the past three years as an indicator of oper-
ational risk. In the TSA/ASA, this indicator is
differentiated by the institution’s business
lines, and qualitative risk management re-
quirements are added. Only in the AMA is the
capital charge determined using a tailor-
made internal model. The use of the AMA re-
quires approval from BaFin.
Currently, ten institutions and groups of insti-
tutions, including four large German banks
and four subsidiaries of foreign institutions,
have received approval to use the AMA. Just
under 70 institutions use the TSA to calculate
the capital charge for operational risk. The re-
maining 2,000 or so institutions resort to the
BIA for their prudential reports. AMA institu-
tions cover 46% of the balance sheet total of
all banks, the TSA accounts for 24% and the
BIA for 30%.
The Solvency Regulation permits institutions
to use the AMA to calculate the capital
charge for only part of the institution upon
adopting the AMA (also known as “partialuse”). However, the majority of AMA institu-
tions are already making full institution-wide
use of this approach.
At internationally active big banks, AMA cap-
ital charges account for between 4% and
13% of the overall capital charge. For the
other institutions, this percentage is much
higher, reaching as much as 70%. This can be
explained by the specific business structure of
these institutions; as they are specialised in,
for example, securities settlement, they have
little credit risk and increased operational risk.
Overview of approved Advanced
Measurement Approaches
When it comes to the concrete implementa-
tion of AMAs, data, modelling and output
and control need to be viewed as key levels
(see explanatory notes on page 68). For the
data level, internal loss data are a sine qua
non for modelling operational risk. For that
reason, they are a key element at the data
input level. The internal operational loss data-
bases maintained by internationally active
large banks encompass anywhere from
around 1,000 to somewhere in the tens of
thousands of data points, while those of
some other institutions have just a few hun-
dred data points. Generally, however, institu-
tions tend to define a minimum threshold for
recording loss events which is normally some-
where between 35,000 and 310,000.
The Solvency Regulation prescribes the use of
relevant external data for modelling; these
external loss data are generally vetted by in-
stitutions. Some institutions use only thoseUsing the

68AMA design
Advanced Measurement Approaches
(AMA) for operational risk generally
comprise three levels: data input, statis-
tical model, and output and control.
Four factors are used as data input: in-
ternal loss data, external data, scenario
analyses and business environment and
internal control factors. Internal loss data
reflect the institution’s historic oper-
ational losses. They must be differenti-
ated by loss event category (eg internal
and external fraud, damage to physical
assets, system failure) and business line.
External data provided by other institu-
tions, which might, for example, be
bought or acquired in an exchange with-
in a data consortium, supplement historic
data, particularly by adding rare, ex-
treme losses. Loss scenarios created by
experts represent potential future risks.
The business environment and internal
control system represent the bank’s cur-
rent risk profile on a stand-alone basis
and relative to other institutions.
These four elements must be properly
combined with the aid of a statistical
model. In general, distribution functions
are used to determine the likelihood and
amount of a loss. This yields the Value atRisk (VaR) measure. VaR is generally ini-
tially calculated for internally defined
business lines and loss event categories
and later aggregated to form a VaR fig-
ure for the entire institution. The institu-
tion itself can choose the granularity of
this internal model. As with credit risk, a
confidence level of 99.9% over a one-
year holding period is targeted when de-
termining regulatory VaR. VaR is also
used as the capital charge for operation-
al risk; however, insurance payments up
to a total of 20% of the capital charge as
well as expected losses may be subtract-
ed provided they are adequately recog-
nised.
The capital charge must be incorporated
into the operational risk management
framework. In particular, the capital
charge should be allocated to internal
business lines. Frequently, an additional
VaR is used at another, generally higher
confidence level for economic capital
management. Moreover, the use of the
AMA is also conditional on other qualita-
tive requirements, such as an independ-
ent management unit for operational
risks, adequate reporting and internal
auditing.

69losses that have occurred in business lines
that they also have at their banks. Otherbanks, for their part, examine external dataindividually in terms of their relevance tothem. In individual cases, only around half ofthe available external data points are used inthe model.
Moreover, scenarios developed by experts
enter into the procedures at the data level.The weight of the scenarios used in themodel ranges from less than 5% to 50%. Asa logical consequence, the number of scen-arios relevant for the model varies equallywidely, ranging from seven to well in excessof 200.
Finally, business environment and internal
control factors represent a fourth input elem-ent at the data level, which institutions use ina variety of ways. Although risk indicators,such as the availability of staff, play a keyrole, they are often supplemented by expertself-assessments of the risk situation whichare evaluated using scorecards or comparablesystems. The impact of this element on theAMA capital charge ranges between 5% and20% for all institutions.
Institutions tend to use in-house models. In
Germany, the Loss Distribution Approach(LDA) has established itself as the marketstandard. The use of an LDA, however, re-quires a large quantity of internal and exter-nal loss data. The LDA is therefore particularlypopular with internationally active big banks.Other institutions tend to make greater useof expert opinions in the form of self-assessments and scenario analyses to modeloperational risk. An exclusively scenario-
based approach, such as is often employed inJapan, for instance, is currently not in use inGermany.
Alongside institutions that use an LDA to
calculate operational loss frequencies andamounts, institutions that use hybrid ap-proaches also employ distribution functionsto calculate the capital charge. In order to de-termine the probability of an operational lossoccurring (loss frequency), all banks use aPoisson distribution, sometimes in combin-ation with additional distributions. Whenmodelling loss amounts, the picture is some-what more mixed: nearly all institutionstest several different distribution assumptionsand, following statistical analyses, choose theassumption that best fits the data. Two insti-tutions use an empirical distribution of intern-al loss data alongside the parametric distribu-tions.
Pursuant to the Solvency Regulation, institu-
tions may model operational risk on internallydefined business lines and event categorieswithout using the supervisory matrix of eightbusiness lines and seven event categories. Allinstitutions have chosen this option, as thequantity of internal loss data makes estimat-ing distributions a relatively difficult matter insome matrix fields; not all 56 matrix fields areused. Some institutions model functional rela-tionships between the matrix fields in themodel when determining the capital charge,thereby making use of the option of deviatingfrom the Solvency Regulation provision re-quiring that the capital charges of the individ-ual matrix fields be added up.

70probability distribution of the aggregated
matrix fields is mostly modelled using a Cop-
ula approach.
Validating the data elements and the model
continues to present a particular challenge.
The small size of the pool of data makes it
more difficult to statistically validate oper-
ational risk models than, for example, market
risk models. All institutions thus use not only
statistical analyses and stress tests but also
qualitative methods and expert knowledge
for validation.
In operational risk control, all AMA institu-
tions have set up a central unit for managing
operational risk. This unit, together with the
board of directors, establishes a framework
that clearly assigns responsibilities for model-
ling, managing and controlling operational
risk. The subsidiaries of foreign institutions
use the parameters set by the parent institu-
tions and either adapt these frameworks or
integrate them into their own guidelines fully.
Under certain conditions, institutions can de-
duct insurance and other risk transfer mech-
anisms from the AMA capital charge, thereby
reducing capital requirements. Six institutions
currently use insurance in their AMAs. This re-
duces their AMA capital charges by between
0.4% and 20%. Moreover, expected losses
(EL) from operational events can be deducted
from the capital charge provided their ad-
equate recognition in business practice can
be demonstrated. Six institutions deduct EL,
reducing their AMA capital charges by 2% to
10%.For control purposes, the capital charge,
which is generally first calculated for the en-
tire institution, must be allocated to the rele-
vant internal business lines or legal entities.
Unlike the Basel Framework, which express-
ly permits allocation to determine capital
charges only in the case of non-significant
foreign subsidiaries, European law permits al-
location in principle. However, the quality of
the allocation mechanism used is a key factor
that is looked at by both home and host
supervisors in the approval process.
Banks mainly still use simple allocation keys
such as gross income or headcount. Only very
few institutions already use a combination of
such factors or calculate the allocation key in
a risk-sensitive manner during modelling, for
instance, using specifically defined risk vari-
ables. Over time, institutions are expected to
move to risk-sensitive allocation keys.
Impact on regulatory capital
requirements
Pillar 1 of Basel II was calibrated based on pre-
vious Quantitative Impact Studies (QIS) with
the aim of maintaining the level of capital re-
quirements in the banking sector as a whole.
Particular emphasis was placed on the IRB
Approaches. In order to give credit institu-
tions an incentive to introduce more risk-
sensitive procedures for measuring their
credit risk, the new capital requirements were
calibrated such that an IRB Approach will
generally yield lower capital requirements
than the Credit Risk Standardised Approach.Validation

71On the basis of banks’ capital reports, the
Bundesbank has analysed credit institutions’own funds requirements under the SolvencyRegulation and under PrincipleI. A direct com-parison of own funds requirements under thenew and the old regimes is exceedingly diffi-cult, however, because both normal businessdevelopments and the financial market crisishave led to considerable changes in banks’portfolio structures. If IRBA banks’ last capitalreports before approval and their reportsafter approval are compared and an attemptmade to adjust the reported values for effectsthat are not attributable to the changed riskweights in order to gain a first estimate ofthese effects, many institutions can be seento have lower capital requirements. The cap-ital relief is currently limited by the “floor”provisions. These mandate that, in the firstthree years after introduction of the IRBA,capital held by banks to cover counterpartyrisk is not permitted to fall below the thresh-olds of 95% (2007), 90% (2008) and 80%(2009) of the comparable Principle I require-ments.
The new Basel capital requirements were cali-
brated under the premise that capital require-ments for the entire banking system wouldnot change. In addition, regulatory capital re-lief was intended to set incentives for usingadvanced approaches. Two working groups,one at Basel and one at European level, arecurrently devoting intensive study to thequestion of whether these calibration object-ives have been achieved in practice, with ini-tial results expected later this year. In the lightof these results and the conclusions that canbe drawn from the current financial marketcrisis, it will remain to be decided next year
what adjustment measures have to be taken.Options include maintaining the so-calledPrincipleI floor or redefining the supervisoryscaling factor (currently 1.06) in the rules forcalculating capital requirements.
Trends in own funds requirements are of
interest, but so are trends in the level of ownfunds held by institutions. The above chartshows the trend in the own funds held bybanks using the Foundation IRB Approachand those using the Advanced IRB Approachover the period from September 2006 toJune 2008. Total available own funds haveremained largely constant since the entry intoforce of the Solvency Regulation at the endof 2006.

72Outlook: further development of the
advanced approaches under the BaselII
framework
All in all, many institutions have qualified to
use the more advanced Pillar 1 approaches to
determine capital charges for credit risk and
operational risk. First-time IRBA suitability
examinations are currently still in progress at
eight institutions. Moreover, the institutions
that have already obtained approval are
transferring additional rating systems to the
IRBA during the implementation phase. At
the same time, follow-up examinations to de-
termine the progress made in fulfilling the
conditions listed in the approval notice are
being conducted at several banks.
Many institutions that have already obtained
approval have begun to refine their systems.
In response to this trend, BaFin and the
Bundesbank published the “Guidelines for
changes to IRBA systems” ( Merkblatt zur
/C190nderung von IRBA-Systemen , available only
in German) in December 2007. German
supervisors are thereby seeking to structure
the dialogue between IRBA banks and super-
visors. While the aim is to allow institutions to
refine and improve their IRBA systems quickly,
supervisors have an interest in ensuring that
the minimum requirements set forth in the
Solvency Regulation continue to be fulfilled
after institutions have refined their models.
The path embarked upon with the notice has
so far proved feasible.
In the past few years, German institutions
have made major progress in implementing
the AMA. There are still deficits in implement-ing the requirements in terms of validation,
business environment and internal control
factors and capital allocation. This will be-
come a focal point of future supervisory activ-
ity. For the AMA, too, supervisors will pub-
lish guidelines on how to deal with model
changes; consultation with the banking in-
dustry is currently in progress in the expert
panel on operational risk.
In the case of the market risk models, broad-
brush rules for the trading book had to be
adapted to current trends.
The composition of credit institutions’ trading
books has undergone sustained change since
the “Market Risk Amendment” entered into
force. Above all, the significance of complex,
relatively illiquid credit products in the trading
book has grown, with the result that the
across-the-board capital add-ons that used to
be possible no longer cover event and default
risk. In addition, the turmoil in international
credit markets has illustrated how complex
credit risks in institutions’ trading books can
lead to heavy losses.
Motivated by these two trends, the Basel
Committee has now wrapped up its work on
rules governing an additional capital require-
ment to cover market price risk in the trading
book. These new rules are scheduled to enter
into force in 2010; institutions have until then
to develop and implement new models that
cover event and default risk. This represents a
journey into uncharted waters for the in-
dustry and supervisors alike. Supervisors are
gearing up for a sharp increase in 2009 and
2010 in the need for on-site examinations atFollow-up

73those institutions that wish to use internal
models to calculate the regulatory capitalcharge for specific price risk in the tradingbook.
The new advanced approaches mean the
gap between banks’ internal methods andsupervisory methods has diminished. Overall,supervisors have successfully designed therules for capital backing such that they canbe applied by big and small institutions alike.Investment in risk management is thus al-ready showing a medium-term payoff thanksto the systematisation of risk measurementand risk assessment.
Even in the light of the current financial mar-
ket crisis, there is no reason to abandon thesystematic approach of the Basel Framework.
As full application of the Basel II rules did notbecome mandatory until after the crisis haderupted, the new capital framework has justnow taken full effect. However, some ruleshave to be revised in the light of recentevents. Increased consideration should begiven particularly to methods which linkmicro findings to macro findings to deliver anoverall view of the stability of the financialsystem. To this end, the Bundesbank has pro-posed the introduction of an internationalcredit register, which could improve know-ledge of the distribution of a considerableportion of credit risk for institutions andsupervisory authorities alike.
