5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Industry
Following a good start to the year, industrial
activity was rather subdued in the second
quarter. In May, seasonally adjusted output
fell by 2.6% on the month with a decline al-
ready having been recorded at the beginning
of the quarter. The reported decrease may be
overstated, however, owing to production
shortfalls in connection with “bridging days”.
Furthermore, since Easter and Whitsun fell
early this year, there was a comparatively
large number of public holidays in May, while
output in April was clearly less affected by
such factors. Over both months combined,
output was still 1.8% down on the quarter,
even taking into account the downward revi-
sion of first-quarter output by 0.6%. At the
end of the period under review, the year-on-
year figure was no more than 1.0%.
In line with output, industrial sales were also
somewhat weaker in the first two months of
the second quarter. Domestic business was
affected more than average by the fall in
sales revenue notwithstanding a slight in-
crease in capital goods. There was a marked
decline in the value of exported goods in
May, while imports showed a moderate price-
related rise following a fall in April. The trade
surplus fell considerably to just 3141/C252billion
in the reporting period.
Orders received fell by a seasonally adjusted
0.9% on the month in May. In contrast to the
recent marked drop in domestic orders, exter-
nal demand showed a slight increase again,Output

6mainly owing to large orders of intermediate
goods. On an average of April and May, there
was a seasonally adjusted fall of 2.7% on the
previous quarter. Although the volume of
orders of intermediate goods rose moderately
thanks to one-off factors, there were consid-
erably fewer orders of capital and consumer
goods in the first two months of the second
quarter. The mechanical engineering sector,
in particular, recently suffered considerable
losses, while manufacturers of IT and elec-
tronic equipment still managed to record an
increase. Overall, the calendar-adjusted in-
take of orders was only 0.3% up on the year.
Construction
Construction activity grew by a seasonally ad-
justed 1.1% in May. This followed sharp correc-
t i o n si nM a r c ha n dA p r i l ,w h i c hc a m ea sa
technical counter-reaction to the weather-
related high volume of output at the beginning
of the year. Overall, construction demand
received no new impetus in April – more recent
information is not yet available. Compared
with the previous quarter, which benefited
from large orders, orders fell by 4.1%. While
enterprises commissioned more projects, the
public sector reduced its order volume consid-
erably. There were also substantially fewer
orders placed in housing construction.
Economy as a whole
In the second quarter, the German economy
is unlikely – in seasonally and calendar-
adjusted terms – to have matched the high
level of output achieved in the first quarter
resulting from the extremely strong growth ofEconomic conditions in Germany*

71.5%. This was primarily attributable to the
expected, mainly technical counter-reactionsto the one-off factors which were very bene-ficial to the production sector in the firstquarter. Adjusted for seasonal and calendarfactors, the sharpest decline on the quarterwas in construction output, for example,which had been relatively high in winterowing to the comparatively mild weather.Furthermore, the production of industrialgoods slowed following quite large deliveriesof machines and equipment at the turn of2007/08 and a sharp build-up of inventoriesby firms. Exports also lost momentum in thesecond quarter. Foreign trade could, none-theless, have made a positive contribution togrowth in the second quarter due, in ac-counting terms, to the clear decline in im-ports. This reflects both the greater restraintshown recently by German firms with regardto investment and inventories and the factthat private consumption was perceptiblysubdued in the second quarter. Despite con-tinuing favourable conditions in the labourmarket and higher pay settlements in thisyear’s pay round, consumption remainedweak. Households’ additional scope for ex-penditure is likely to have been clearly re-duced in real terms by the real sharp increasesin energy prices. Furthermore, the latest pricesurges are also evident in a subdued propen-sity to purchase.
Labour marketThe underlying trend in the labour market
remained positive, leaving aside the shiftsin the seasonal pattern. According to initialestimates by the Federal Statistical Office,the number of persons in work stood at
40.31 million in May, which was 618,000, or1.6%, more than in the same period last year.Employment subject to social security contri-butions increased slightly to 27.48 million. InApril, the number of persons in marginal em-ployment was unchanged at 4.84 million.Government-assisted employment showed aslight rise in April.
In June, seasonally adjusted unemployment
fell to 3.27 million. This was 38,000 fewerthan in the previous month. There was ayear-on-year fall in unemployment of528,000. In July, the unemployment rate wasa seasonally adjusted 7.8%, compared with7.9% in May and 8.4% at the end of lastyear.
PricesCrude oil prices remained at a very high level
in June following a sharp increase at the be-ginning of the month. On average, the spotprice for Brent North Sea oil, at more thanUS$133, was more than US$9 up on the fig-ure for May. Thus far, neither the increase inregulated fuel prices in China nor Saudi Ara-bia’s planned expansion of oil production hasbeen able to stop the upward trend. As thisreport went to press, the spot price stood atUS$136 after reaching record highs in thefirst half of July. For about two months, therehas been a tendency for crude oil to betraded in the futures markets at a mark-upon the spot price. For delivery in six or18 months’ time, the mark-up is currentlyUS$3

8At 2.7% on average, there was an extremely
sharp month-on-month increase in the cost
of imports in May. This mainly affected crude
oil and mineral oil products, but also inter-
mediate and consumer goods. Excluding en-
ergy, import prices went up by a seasonally
adjusted 0.7%. The total increase on the year
was 7.9%, compared with 5.7% in April.
There was a further substantial month-on-
month increase in producer prices. They were
up 6.7% on the year at the end of the period
under review; excluding energy, the increase
was 2.9%.
Consumer prices were increased considerably
on average in June. They went up by a sea-
sonally adjusted 0.4% on the month. There
were sharp increases, above all, in the cost of
heating oil and fuel. The annual rate of
change in the national consumer price index
(CPI) increased from 3.0% in May to 3.3% in
June. According to the Harmonised Index of
Consumer Prices (HICP), the year-on-year rate
was 3.4% at the end of the reporting period,
compared with 3.1% in the previous month.
Recalculated using a basis methodologically
comparable to the CPI, it would be somewhat
higher.
Public finances1
Local government finances
According to the most recent cash office stat-
istics from the Federal Statistical Office, local
government posted a close-to-balance
budgetary position overall in the first quarter
of 2008 compared with a deficit of 32 billionin the same period last year. However, the
year-on-year comparison, in particular, needs
to be interpreted with caution, as the use of
commercial bookkeeping, which is becoming
more widespread within local government,
has produced data recording problems.2
Overall, local government revenue recorded a
further sharp rise of just under 51/C252%(32 bil-
lion). The main reasons for this were the
strong increases in revenue from categories
of grants from state government which are
largely linked to tax receipts and also in in-
vestment grants from state government (to-
talling +171/C252%o r 311/C252billion). However, just
over 31/C252billion of this was accounted for by
repayments from the federal state of North
Rhine-Westphalia of part of the local govern-
ment contribution to financing German unifi-
cation, which the state constitutional court
judged to be excessive. The positive tax rev-
enue trend slackened only slightly (+6% or
just over 31/C252billion). This included further
marked growth in local business tax revenue,
in particular (+71/C252% after deducting the
shares transferable to central and state gov-
ernment). It was presumably too early for the
2008 business tax reform to have an impact
on cash office receipts during the first quarter
(shortfalls of 32 billion are expected for 2008
as a whole). By contrast, moderate net de-

9clines were reported in revenue from asset
realisations and from fees and charges.
Following sharp increases until the final quar-
ter of 2007, overall expenditure is reported tohave fallen slightly in the first three months of2008 by just under
1/C252%. However, the rela-
tively high pay settlement concluded in springhas not yet been reflected in the (slightly re-duced) personnel expenditure. Expenditureon social benefits also declined overall(-1
1/C252%). This is particularly due to reductions
in payments for accommodation costs for re-cipients of unemployment benefit II (whichwere admittedly accompanied by lower re-ceipts as a result of a reduction in central gov-ernment’s share of the costs). Following asharp increase last year, operating expend-iture was up by a mere 1%, despite price in-creases. Investment in fixed assets actuallydeclined by 3%, in spite of price increasesand local government’s improved financialsituation.
Despite the expected weak growth in local
business tax, particularly owing to the 2008business tax reform, and the impact of wageagreements on personnel expenditure, all inall local government is again likely to record aclear surplus, which will probably fall onlyslightly short of last year’s figure ( 38
1/C252billion).
By the end of March 2008 total local govern-ment debt had fallen by 31
1/C252billion com-
pared with the end of 2007 to 3821/C252billion.
By contrast, the volume of cash advances per
seremained virtually unchanged. The total
outstanding volume of 3281/C252billion shows
that many local governments still have con-siderable unresolved budgetary problemswhich continue to necessitate tight expend-
iture curbs.
When publishing its cash office statistics, the
Federal Statistical Office highlighted dataquality problems which are apparently con-nected to deriving the financial statistics datafrom the accounting records of those localgovernments that have changed over to thedouble-entry bookkeeping system. However,maintaining high-quality German public fi-nance statistics is particularly important, notleast for the European excessive deficit pro-cedure. This includes local government quar-terly budget outturns. It is the responsibility,firstly, of the local governments concerned totake action in this respect.

Securities markets
Bond market
Issuing activity in the German bond market
increased noticeably in May. In the reporting
month, bonds with a total value of 3139.3
billion were issued. After deducting redemp-
tions and taking account of changes in is-
suers’ holdings of their own bonds, German
borrowers tapped the domestic bond market
for314.6 billion after having reduced their
capital market debt by 319.6 billion in the
previous month. Sales of foreign debt secur-
ities, which were denominated almost exclu-
sively in euro, amounted to 321.2 billion net.
Therefore, overall, 335.8 billion was gener-
ated from sales of domestic and foreign
bonds in May.
The public sector borrowed 39.5 billion net in
the capital market in May. Central govern-
ment alone increased its bond market debt
by36.0 billion. On balance, it issued mainly
five-year Federal notes (Bobls) worth 34.1 bil-
lion and ten-year Federal bonds (Bunds)
worth 32.4 billion. It also sold 30-year Bunds
for30.3 billion net. By contrast, it redeemed
two-year Federal Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze) for
30.8 billion and, to a lesser extent, Federal
Treasury financing paper aimed primarily at
private investors. State governments raised
33.6 billion net in the capital market.Credit institutions sold 34.0 billion worth of
debt securities in May, after having redeemed
bonds for 32.0 billion net in April. Specialised
credit institutions, some of which are guaran-
teed by the government, accounted for the
majority of borrowing in the capital market
(36.0 billion). By contrast, the outstanding
volume of public Pfandbriefe and mortgage
Pfandbriefe decreased by 31.8 billion and
31.0 billion respectively. Other bank debt se-
curities which can be structured particularly
flexibly experienced net sales of 30.8 billion.
In the reporting month, German enterprises
issued debt securities for 31.1 billion net, on
balance exclusively in the form of bonds with
original maturities of more than one year.
In May, debt securities were purchased pre-
dominantly by foreign investors, who invest-
ed328.4 billion in the German market. Do-
mestic credit institutions increased their bond
portfolios by a total of 318.6 billion. By con-
trast, German non-banks sold bonds – all of
which were domestic paper – for 311.2 bil-
lion net.
Equity market
In May, whilst stocks traded sideways, issuing
activity in the German equity market re-
mained subdued. New shares totalling 30.3
billion were placed in the market. The major-
ity of this paper was issued by non-listed en-
terprises. In addition, the outstanding volume
of foreign equities in Germany fell by 32.6 bil-

11lion. German non-banks were active on the
buyers’ side: they stepped up their investment
– mainly in German shares – by 319.7 billion.
By contrast, domestic credit institutions sold
equities worth 311.0 billion. Foreign investors
also sold shares from portfolio investments as
well as direct investment stocks on the Ger-
man market for 310.8 billion and 30.2 billion
respectively.
Mutual fund shares
In May, domestic mutual funds recorded in-
flows of 34.8 billion net. Specialised funds re-
served for institutional investors sold slightly
more mutual fund shares ( 32.7 billion) than
German mutual funds open to the general
public ( 32.2 billion). With respect to the lat-
ter, most of the capital flowed into funds of
funds ( 31.3 billion). Equity-based funds and
mixed funds saw inflows of 31.0 billion and
30.9 billion respectively. By contrast, outflows
were recorded by money market funds in par-
ticular ( 31.0 billion), but also by bond-based
funds ( 30.4 billion). However, German invest-
ors increased their holdings of foreign mutual
fund shares by 35.0 billion. In May, mutual
fund shares were purchased almost exclusive-
ly by German non-banks ( 310.3 billion),
which invested roughly equal amounts in for-
eign and domestic shares. Foreign investors
added domestic mutual fund shares worth
30.3 billion net to their portfolios, while Ger-
man credit institutions sold certificates worth
30.8 billion net.Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus – in unadjusted terms – of 37.5 billion in
May. The result was thus 38.0 billion down
on the level of the previous month. This can
be attributed to a smaller trade surplus and a
larger deficit on invisible current transactions,
which comprise services, income and current
transfers.
According to provisional figures from the
Federal Statistical Office, the foreign trade
surplus in May decreased by 34.4 billion on
the month to 314.4 billion. After adjustment
for seasonal and calendar variations, it went
down by 33.2 billion to 314.6 billion. The
value of exports declined by 3.2% while the
value of imports rose by 0.7%. If April andSales and purchases

12May are taken together, seasonally adjusted
nominal exports fell 1.0% below the average
for the first quarter of 2008. Imports were
down by 1.7%. Given a 2% rise in import
prices at the same time, this represented a
sharp decline in real terms.
In May, the deficit on invisible current trans-
actions continued to grow, reaching a level of
35.6 billion compared with 32.6 billion in
April. As is usually the case in May, this was
caused by increased deficits both in the in-
come account and in services. Net expend-
iture on cross-border income rose by 32.8 bil-
lion to 33.4 billion, largely on account of
larger dividend payments to non-residents.
The deficit on services increased by 31.8 bil-
lion to 31.9 billion whereas the deficit on cur-
rent transfers declined to 30.3 billion com-
pared with 31.9 billion in the previous month.
Cross-border portfolio investment again re-
sulted in net capital exports in May although
these were significantly lower than in the pre-
vious month ( 33.2 billion compared with
327.2 billion in April). This development was
attributable largely to transactions by resident
investors, who added foreign instruments
with a total value of 321.0 billion to their
portfolios. Much of the activity was focused
on the purchase of debt securities ( 321.2 bil-
lion), predominantly longer-term euro assets
(313.7 billion). In addition, German investors
bought foreign mutual fund shares ( 35.0 bil-
lion) and at the same time disposed of equi-
ties ( 35.2 billion). In May, foreign investors
again acquired German securities ( 317.9 bil-
lion) after parting with paper worth 344.6 bil-
lion in the preceding month. They concen-Major items of the balance

15Recent developments
in the international
financial systemThe international financial system has
witnessed far-reaching changes over
the past few years. This has been
mainly characterised by a securitisation
boom in the industrialised countries
and a rapid expansion of traditional
bank lending business in the emerging
market economies (EMEs). As a result,
the global financial system has record-
ed significantly faster growth than the
world economy; at the same time, fi-
nancial globalisation has accelerated.
This article outlines these develop-
ments and discusses their impact on
the functioning and performance of
the financial system. It comes to the
conclusion that the increasing division
of labour in the financial markets and
their greater global integration should,
in principle, be viewed as positives, but
do not per se guarantee economic pro-
gress. This has been underscored by
the recent turmoil on the international
financial markets. For the efficiency
gains that the financial system has
achieved over the past few years to be
permanently translated into positive
real economic effects, market discip-
line needs to be enhanced and disin-
centives corrected; moreover, the insti-
tutional foundations of the financial
sector have to be strengthened and
the regulatory framework reviewed
and, where necessary, adapted.

16Overview
The structure of financial markets and their
functioning have changed fundamentally in
recent years. The range of traditional banking
services and financial products has been com-
plemented by innovative and in some cases
complex financing and risk transfer tech-
niques. As a result, the differences between
bank-based and more capital market-based
financial systems have increasingly moved
backstage. These developments were made
possible by the liberalisation and deregulation
of the financial markets and boosted by the
progress made in data transmission and pro-
cessing. However, they also reflect an intensi-
fied search for profitable portfolio diversifica-
tion in a global environment which has, for
years, been characterised not only by a high
degree of macroeconomic stability but also
by abundant liquidity and low interest rates.
In the industrialised countries, the growth
and integration of the financial markets
have been characterised, in particular, by the
increasing prevalence of capital market-
oriented business models. Securitisation has
enhanced the productivity of financial inter-
mediation and therefore the availability of
credit. However, recently weaknesses have
emerged in connection with the greater mar-
ket dependence of financial intermediation,
resulting in considerable tensions within the
financial system and pushing individual insti-
tutions to the brink of collapse.
By contrast, the development of financial
systems in emerging market economies has
been driven largely by a marked increase intraditional bank lending business, which in
some regions is based on the growing pres-
ence of foreign banks. Strong credit growth
frequently entails a risk to macroeconomic
stability. In some emerging market economies
and commodity-exporting countries, the ac-
cumulation of large foreign exchange re-
serves and other foreign assets means that
central banks and sovereign wealth funds
play an important role in the financial global-
isation process.
Dynamic growth and increasing global
integration of financial markets
The financial markets have recorded rapid
growth over the past few years. According to
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), out-
standing financial assets worldwide (bank
assets, debt securities and equities) totalled
US$194 trillion at the end of 2006, compared
with US$106 trillion four years earlier.1Data
on equities and debt securities that are al-
ready available for the end of 2007 indicate
that the US$200 trillion mark has been ex-
ceeded. In addition, the share of global finan-
cial assets in global GDP has risen by more
than 75 percentage points since 2002 and
topped 400% at the end of 2006. The global
financial system has therefore grown consid-
erably faster than the world economy.
This dynamic development has been inter-
preted by some observers as an indication
that the financial sector has, to a certain de-
gree, delinked from the real economy. How-

17ever, it has to be borne in mind that growth
of the financial markets in industrialisedcountries mainly reflects an increased divisionof labour within the financial system; in theemerging market economies, it is also a resultof improved access by households and com-panies to financial services.
2Globally, com-
mercial banks’ assets almost doubled toaround US$75 trillion between 2002 and2006. The fact that global stock market capit-alisation doubled to more than US$50 trillionover the same period can be attributed inpart to surging share prices. Overall, thefinancial markets in the emerging marketeconomies experienced particularly dynamicgrowth – albeit from a low base. However,the industrialised countries still dominate theinternational financial system, where theyaccount for more than four-fifths of globalfinancial assets.
Growth of the global financial markets has
been accompanied and amplified by the in-creasing worldwide integration of the nation-al financial systems. Data available for theperiod up to the end of 2004 show that thetotal outstanding cross-border assets andliabilities of 145 countries amounted to some280% of global GDP , compared with approxi-mately 130% ten years earlier.
3Meanwhile,
the ratio of aggregate global exports and im-ports to world GDP rose from just under 40%to 54%. Financial globalisation has thereforesignificantly outpaced real economic integra-tion over the past few years.
This trend is likely to have continued in the
recent past. This is suggested by the develop-ment of cross-border portfolio and direct in-as % of GDPin US$ trillion

2Of the emerging market economies and the de-
veloping countries, the former are of particular interest
in terms of the development of the international fi-
nancial system given their growing significance for the
global economy. However, data on this group of coun-
tries are sketchy, and the two groups are frequently
treated as one for statistical purposes. This article uses
the International Monetary Fund’s classification of
industrialised countries on the one hand and emerging
market economies and developing countries on the
other.

18vestment, for which data are available up to
end-2006. However, it also becomes appar-
ent that, by this measure, the industrialised
countries have displayed far greater financial
openness than emerging market economies,
particularly in recent years. Consequently, the
ongoing integration of the national financial
systems has – like the growth of the global
financial system – largely emanated from the
industrialised countries. According to an IMF
survey (Coordinated Portfolio Investment Sur-
vey), the industrialised countries accounted
for around two-thirds of cross-border port-
folio investment holdings at the end of 2006.
Euro-area countries represented 39.2% of
global cross-border portfolio investment in
2006, up from 37.5% in 2001. Here, the ex-
change of assets and liabilities within the
euro area played a large and growing role.4
Drivers of financial globalisation
The surge in cross-border financial transac-
tions was made possible by the liberalisation
and deregulation of national financial systems
which many countries have pursued forcefully
over the past decades. However, it is difficult
to gauge capital account liberalisation, as the
associated measures are qualitative in nature
and difficult to compare, being heteroge-
neous phenomena. Since the mid-1990s, the
Chinn-Ito index, which is frequently referred
to in the debate on the liberalisation of cross-
border financial transactions, has risen signifi-
cantly in the industrialised countries, signal-
ling that financial transactions are now sub-
ject to virtually no restrictions there.5This
trend reflects, not least, the liberalisation andintegration of Europe’s financial markets.6
Within the emerging market economies, by
contrast, progress on the liberalisation of
cross-border capital flows has been fairly
sluggish. Though these countries had elimin-
ated many hurdles by the mid-1990s, overall
progress on capital account liberalisation has
since been comparatively slow as measured
by the Chinn-Ito index. The fact that the
financial and currency crises that affected
many emerging market economies in the
1990s were partly attributed to the preced-
ing, in some cases overhasty, capital account
liberalisation was doubtless a contributory
factor. This group of countries consequently
even saw a temporary reversal of the liberal-
isation trend in the mid-1990s.
The dynamic financial globalisation process
would be inconceivable without the progress
made in data transmission and processing.
The IT revolution has not only simplified the
efficient and cost-effective settlement of
major financial transactions across national
borders, it has also facilitated the rapid prac-
tical application of state-of-the-art research
findings in the theory of finance. This devel-
opment has led to the range of conventional

tion, see European Central Bank, Financial Integration in
Europe, April 2008, Frankfurt am Main.
5Besides the index developed by Chinn and Ito, the lit-
erature also includes other approaches to measuring cap-
ital account liberalisation. However, the results are virtual-
ly identical in terms of the trends in industrialised coun-
tries and emerging market economies. See M D Chinn
and H Ito (2008), A New Measure of Financial Openness,
Journal of Comparative Policy Analysis, forthcoming.

count liberalisation; it has, for almost 50 years now, had
no restrictions in place on the main areas of international
capital transactions. See Deutsche Bundesbank, Freedom

Financial globalisation is evident mainly in in-
creased cross-border portfolio diversificationand borrowing. This process has been pro-moted by dynamic global economic growth,especially in recent years, coupled with lowinflation. It was also driven by abundantglobal liquidity, which resulted in low capitalmarket rates and therefore intensified thesearch for yield. However, this environmentalso nurtured tendencies towards excessivelylow risk premiums, the neglect of liquidityrisk and the pursuit of aggressive businesspractices in the face of shrinking margins.
Financial globalisation implies that investors
will increasingly include foreign assets in theirportfolios. As a consequence, one would ex-pect a decline in home bias – investors’ trad-itionally observed preference for domestic fi-nancial assets. There is indeed some support-ing evidence for this supposition. In the in-dustrialised countries, for example, the do-mestic share of total equity holdings has fall-en significantly since the mid-1990s.
7This fall
in home bias was far more pronounced in themember states of the euro area than in theUnited States and Japan, which suggeststhat, besides information and transactioncosts, exchange rate risk – which has beeneliminated within the euro area – plays an im-portant role in investment in foreign secur-ities.
8However, there is also evidence to suggestthat, unlike among institutional investors,home bias is still comparatively entrenched1970 80 90 00 2006Liberalisation of

7It should be noted that purchases of shares in multi-

other hand, institutional investors are, like pension funds
for example, generally subject to particular investment
guidelines which often set a specific upper limit on expos-
ures to foreign securities.

20among retail investors.9This is presumably
linked to the fact that the above-mentioned
risk and cost factors have a greater bearing
on households’ investment decisions. In add-
ition, retail investors might prefer to invest in
domestic companies as they think they can
better assess, and therefore manage, the as-
sociated risks than they could in the case of
foreign firms (illusion of control). Increasingly,
retail investors are being offered new finan-
cial products such as investment certificates
(Zertifikate ) that allow an indirect exposure to
foreign capital markets (see box on page 21).
However, for some retail investors, valuing
such products, some of which are complex,
might be too demanding at times. To some
extent these products may be seen as epitom-
ising some of the characteristics and prob-lems that typify the development of the fi-
nancial markets in industrialised countries.
Innovations in the financial systems of
the industrialised countries
In recent years, the development of the finan-
cial systems in the industrialised countries has
been characterised in particular by the in-
creasing availability of products and tech-
niques allowing trade in illiquid assets and/or
specific risks. As a general rule, the transfer
of credit and credit risks can help broaden
markets and thus render them “more com-
plete”, potentially boosting the productivity
of financial intermediation. Three effects are
at work here. First, separating credit risk from
the underlying credit relationship makes it
easier to diversify credit portfolios. Second,
the transfer of credit risks can help spread
risks more widely within the financial system
and also allow them to be better tailored to
the investors’ specific preferences. Third, the
transfer of credit risks allows financial invest-
ors to pursue pure trading strategies, which
enhances price discovery on the risk transfer
markets. However, the transfer of credit risks
does not per se guarantee optimal risk alloca-
tion. The danger of suboptimal allocation is
most likely to occur if the credit risk transfer is
accompanied by reduced incentives to assess
and monitor credit quality and by inadequate
risk management.Home bias in selected countries/

21Investment certificates as an instrument of international portfolio diversification
for retail investors
Especially German retail investors have
increasingly been using investment certi-ficates ( Zertifikate ) in addition to long
established mutual fund shares to tapinto foreign markets for securities invest-ments. Having recorded annual growthrates of around 40% in recent years, theGerman market for investment certifi-cates reached an estimated volume of5135 billion at the end of 2007, accord-
ing to data provided by the German Deri-vatives Association ( Deutscher Derivate
Verband ). By comparison, these financial
instruments are less important in theAnglo-Saxon countries.
While mutual fund shares confer co-own-
ership of separate assets, investment cer-tificates are derivatives. They represent asecuritised claim against the issuer andtheir price is based on the performanceof specified assets. They confer no own-ership rights in these assets. Issuers tendto use derivatives to hedge the risks theyincur in issuing investment certificates.
The broad range of investment certifi-
cates now on offer caters to retail inves-tors’ different investment preferences.This could be a preference for certainregions or industries, but also particularinvestment strategies (eg growth, value)or investment themes (eg climatechange, water supply). A prominent roleis played by index certificates, which mir-ror the performance of equity indices.Investment certificates also cover a wide
spectrum in terms of investors’ risk appe-tite. For example, the price risks involvedin commodity or equity index certificatescan be separated from the associatedcurrency risks.
More recently, the investment certificate
market has increasingly been criticisedfor its lack of transparency. This is theresult of the rapid growth in productvariety witnessed over the past few years,but is also inherent in the investmentcertificates’ structure. It is often difficultfor investors to determine what specificcosts an investment in a certificate in-volves. In addition, the transparency ofthe investment certificate market may beimpaired if liquidity in individual certifi-cates is low, entailing the risk of pricedistortions. However, a number of provi-ders are now taking action to remedythis situation.
Overall, the availability of global (and
sometimes exotic) investment vehicles inthe shape of investment certificates helpsto counter the home bias in retail port-folio investment. Whether this also im-proves portfolio risk/return profiles de-pends inter alia on the extent to which
investors are able to identify potentialinvestment risks when taking investmentdecisions (eg illiquidity, speculative exag-gerations).

22The strong expansion of the financial markets
in the industrialised countries primarily re-
flects the intensive use of innovative instru-
ments and techniques for transferring risks.
These chiefly constitute derivatives that are
either traded in standardised form on ex-
changes (exchange-traded instruments) or
are concluded individually (over-the-counter
or OTC instruments). According to the Bank
for International Settlements (BIS), the nom-
inal value of outstanding exchange-traded
derivatives totalled more than US$80 trillion
at the end of 2007, a tenfold increase since
1993. In the G10 countries alone, in which
data are regularly collected, the nominal
value of outstanding OTC derivatives has
risen approximately eightfold since 1998 and
stood at US$525 trillion at the end of 2007.
Interest rate contracts are by far the mostcommonly traded product on the derivatives
market, followed by foreign exchange con-
tracts and credit derivatives. Credit default
swaps (CDS) are the main instrument in the
market for credit derivatives in the G10 coun-
tries, with a nominal value of US$58 trillion at
end-2007, up from less than US$1 trillion in
2001.10
So-called structured products represent a sec-
tion of the credit risk transfer market that
had, up until recently, witnessed particularly
dynamic growth.11They are complex financial
instruments where claims to cash flows from
a pool of assets are divided into tranches
with different risk/return profiles. The princi-
pal products in this market segment are
asset-backed securities (ABSs) and, within
this category, collateralised debt obligations
(CDOs) in particular. Over the past few years,
the importance of synthetic CDOs, where the
underlying assets are made up of CDS, has
risen significantly. According to the IMF, the
value of structured products issued in the
United States and Europe totalled US$2.6
trillion in 2007, compared with US$500 bil-
lion in 2000. Over the same period, the value
of newly issued CDOs rose from US$150
billion to US$1.2 trillion.12These products
feature prominently in connection with so-
called originate-to-distribute business models,

23loans and using these credit portfolios to
issue asset-backed securities which are subse-quently sold on the market. The growing useof such business models has helped easebanks’ refinancing restrictions. This in turnhas increased the availability of credit for theeconomy and extended the credit cycle. How-ever, the recent turmoil on the internationalfinancial markets has highlighted weaknessesand risks inherent in this development.
Valuing structured products requires in-depth
knowledge and great care on the part of mar-ket players. The use of ratings, which are gen-erally used to evaluate the credit default riskof traditional financial products, may proveinsufficient for a structured product. A ratingreflects a rating agency’s view of the creditdefault risk. However, no account is taken ofother relevant risks, notably market and li-quidity risk.
13In addition, the link between
lending and credit risk monitoring, which istypical of banks’ traditional lending business,disappears with credit pooling and – fre-quently multistage – securitisation.
At the same time, structured products make
it more difficult to localise risks within the fi-nancial system. Key factors in this context arethe extension of the intermediation chain andthe closer links between markets and marketplayers arising from the securitisation-oriented business model. The recent disloca-tions on the financial market, which havepushed some individual institutions to thebrink of collapse, have demonstrated that alack of transparency with regard to risk dis-persion and concentration within the finan-cial sector can rapidly result in a crisis of con-
fidence of systemic dimensions.
Innovative financing and credit risk transfer
techniques are used particularly intensively bylarge and complex financial institutions
14that
operate internationally. These financial con-glomerates offer a broad range of financialservices. In their proprietary trading activitiesthey act both as buyers and sellers of creditrisk transfer products. By contrast, traditionallending banks are generally interested inAssets under

The fact that the major financial intermediar-
ies have witnessed a largely parallel increase
in assets and liabilities indicates that the se-
curitisation boom has hardly changed banks’
position within the financial system – regard-
less of their respective business focus. Over
the past few years, their proportion of assets
under management has even risen slightly; at

pared with 51% at the end of 1998. The

more intense competition in the financial sec-
tor therefore impacts banks’ balance sheets
less through a balance sheet contraction thanthrough a change in the composition of
assets, with loans being replaced by securi-
tised claims. At the same time, refinancing via
the markets has become more important for
credit institutions, and the strong growth of
the derivatives markets is partly a reflection of
their active management of balance sheet
risks.15
Hedge funds, as a largely unregulated invest-
ment vehicle, have attracted particular atten-
tion in financial globalisation not least be-
cause they pursue trading strategies that dif-
fer significantly from those of other market
players such as banks, insurers or investment
funds.16They frequently employ derivatives
and large amounts of debt to achieve lever-
age. Hedge funds consequently typically incur
larger risks than other financial market play-
ers. In principle, these funds make an import-
ant contribution to the smooth functioning of
the financial markets by acting as counterpar-
ties in risk transfer transactions. In addition,
their activities can help increase market li-
quidity, particularly as hedge funds are also
active in specialised and less liquid market
segments.17The total number of hedge funds
rose from some 600 in 1990 to approximately
10,000 in 2007. Over the same period, the
total volume of assets under their manage-
ment increased from just under US$40 billionUS$

15Some institutions have also invested in securitised
products via legally autonomous and therefore off-
balance-sheet special purpose vehicles. This can largely
be explained by the fact that, unlike Basel II, Basel I does
not require additional capital for such exposures.

25to around US$1.9 trillion. However, this actu-
ally understates hedge funds’ actual signifi-
cance for the global financial system; their in-
fluence is in fact considerably greater owing
to their intensive trading activities, extensive
leveraging and their relationships with nu-
merous, often systemically relevant counter-
parties.18
Private equity funds are another new player
on the international financial markets. These
funds allow enterprises to raise equity pri-
vately, ie not on a stock exchange. Some of
these funds acquire enterprises with the aim
of restructuring them and then selling them
on as a whole or in parts.19According to mar-
ket data, the volume of investment by private
equity funds rose from US$70 billion in 1998
to US$364 billion in 2006.20Leveraged buy-
outs, which have predominated in recent
years, are largely debt-financed. The finance
is generally provided by banks or other inter-
mediaries who in turn securitise these credits
and pass them on to other market players.
This investor group is therefore closely inte-
grated with other financial market players.
Private equity funds’ activities consequently
also reflect the increased division of labour
within the financial system of industrialised
countries.
Special features of financial market
development in emerging market
economies
In the emerging market economies, the de-
velopment of the financial markets and their
integration into the international financialsystem has been less closely associated with a
move towards a capital market-oriented sys-
tem. Rather, the development of the domes-
tic financial systems has been driven by a
strong expansion in traditional bank lending
business, which is often based on the grow-
ing presence of foreign banks. Between 2002
and 2006, the total volume of outstanding
bank assets in the emerging market econ-
omies almost doubled to US$13.2 trillion. The
financial system in these countries is therefore
still dominated by commercial banks, although
several regions have seen rapid growth of
their local bond markets.21
The liberalisation and deregulation of the fi-
nancial systems has been accompanied by
strong growth in gross capital flows in recent
years. The substantial capital flow from indus-
trialised countries to emerging market econ-
omies, particularly in the form of foreign dir-
ect investment, conforms to the expectation
that, given greater financial openness and an
adequate institutional framework, capital will
increasingly flow into emerging markets.
Owing to their comparatively low capital en-
dowment, emerging market economies offer
a higher return on investment than de-
veloped economies. However, in recent years
financial globalisation has, on balance, been

26accompanied by considerable net capital out-
flows from emerging market economies.
With regard to net capital flows, the new EU
member states as well as the group of candi-
dates for EU membership are an important
exception. They have recorded mostly high
and in some cases rising current account def-
icits since the beginning of the decade.22Cur-
rent account deficits are fairly typical during
an economic catching-up process, although
the associated risks should not be neglected.
In particular, such deficits are problematic if
they are caused by, say, higher consumption
rather than growth-enhancing investment.
In other emerging market economies, by con-
trast, an export-based growth strategy – part-
ly as a consequence of the financial and cur-rency crises of the 1990s – and persistently
rising commodity prices during recent years
have led to improved current account bal-
ances or even surpluses. As monetary policy
in many of these countries has been focused
on stabilising exchange rates, financial global-
isation has, in the last few years, been charac-
terised in part by the accumulation of large
foreign exchange reserves. At the end of
2007, emerging market economies (including
developing countries) held reserves amount-
ing to almost US$5 trillion, equivalent to
more than three-quarters of global foreign
exchange reserves.
In many emerging market economies, the
recent period of financial globalisation has
therefore been characterised by lower vulner-
ability to traditional external risks such as a
sudden stop or reversal of capital flows. This
is indicated both by the rapid growth in for-
eign exchange reserves and increasing foreign
direct investment. By contrast, considerations
of risk diversification and the exploitation of
yield differences by private investors and fi-
nancial intermediaries, which featured prom-
inently in the development of the financial
systems of the industrialised countries, ap-
pear to have played a more limited role to

27On the other hand, the development of fi-
nancial systems in the emerging market econ-omies in recent years has been characterisedby strong credit growth. Though there areconsiderable differences between individualcountries, credit to the private sector has in-creased at annual rates of, at times, morethan 20% in virtually all major emerging mar-ket economies. Central banks have not al-ways been able to sterilise the strong increasein foreign currency reserves effectively. Inaddition, interest rates in the emerging mar-ket economies have remained comparativelylow in many cases – partly to deter capital in-flows. As a consequence, banks’ refinancingand therefore their lending opportunitieshave increased noticeably both from a vol-ume and a cost perspective.Unlike the industrialised countries, where
credit growth has been boosted mainly bysecuritisation and structured products, thestrong credit growth in the emerging marketeconomies can largely be attributed to con-ventional bank lending (buy-and-hold ap-proach). In Latin America as well as centraland eastern Europe, growth has been par-ticularly pronounced in the retail and house-hold credit business, with the percentage offoreign currency loans high in some cases –partly aided by fixed exchange rate regimes.This trend represents a major challenge forbanks’ credit risk management given that,in several emerging market economies, thecredit boom is increasingly being accom-panied by macroeconomic distortions.

28high current account deficits, though these
are frequently financed to a considerable de-
gree by direct investment.
At the same time, the institutional framework
of the financial systems in emerging market
economies has changed. This can be seen in
a noticeable increase in the presence and im-
portance of foreign banks. However, there
are considerable regional and country-specificdifferences. In Asia and the Middle East, the
role of foreign banks is comparatively small.
By contrast, their importance in Latin America
and central and eastern Europe has risen con-
siderably in recent years. In many countries
– particularly in eastern Europe – foreign
banks now account for well over 50% and in
some cases even close to 100% of total bank
assets. This is likely to have enhanced the
competitiveness and stability of the banking
systems in general through the transfer of
capital, technology and modern business and
management methods. On the other hand,
this process has created new channels of con-
tagion and risks. For example, stronger com-
petition for market share contributed to the
high credit growth. In addition, the – in some
cases large – weight of individual foreign
banks in host countries means that possible
problems experienced by the foreign-based
parent bank might have a significant knock-
on effect on the financial sector of the host
countries.
In some important emerging market econ-
omies and commodity-exporting countries,
the accumulation of large foreign exchange
reserves and other foreign assets mean that
central banks and sovereign wealth funds
(SWFs) play an important role in these coun-
tries’ international financial integration pro-
cess. SWFs are state-controlled entities that
invest public financial assets separately from
the traditional management of foreign cur-
rency reserves by the monetary authorities.24

29ition, they are – unlike hedge funds and pri-
vate equity funds – considered to be conser-
vative investors with a long-term investment
horizon that largely abstain from raising debt
to achieve a leverage effect. According to IMF
estimates, SWFs have between US$1.9 trillion
and US$2.9 trillion in assets under manage-
ment;25some recent market estimates even
give figures of up to US$3.5 trillion or more.
SWFs are therefore roughly as large as hedge
funds and private equity funds combined.
While their holdings are still relatively small
compared with the over US$50 trillion worth
of assets under management by institutional
investors worldwide, the importance of sov-
ereign wealth funds is likely to increase sig-
nificantly going forward, with the IMF expect-
ing their assets to increase to US$12 trillion
by 2012. Overall, public entities’ direct and
indirect control of parts of global financial
wealth is therefore likely to increase further,
particularly as large, internationally operating
enterprises with substantial financial resources
are also subject to state influence in many
countries.
In this context, concern has been expressed
that the motives underlying sovereign wealth
funds’ investment abroad could be political
rather than economic. To date, there is virtu-
ally no evidence to support such concerns,
however. Individual SWFs have actually had a
stabilising effect since August 2007, as they
have provided ailing financial institutions in
industrialised countries with capital.26Some
of the reservations about SWFs are probably
based on the fact that – with a few excep-
tions – little is known about their structure
and mandate or their targets and investmentstrategies. This favours protectionist senti-
ment to ward off unwanted investment by
SWFs in the recipient countries. Ultimately,
such financial protectionism could jeopardise
the progress made in liberalising capital flows
in recent decades.
Conclusions
Overall, the growth of the global financial
system, the concomitant greater width and
depth of the markets and their global integra-
tion should be regarded as positives. Econom-
ic growth should benefit from an opening of
the financial markets as a result of greater
competition and better global capital and risk
allocation. However, empirical studies on the
link between financial openness and econom-
ic growth show that the expected positive ef-
fects of financial market integration depend
on a number of factors. Besides the degree of
maturity of the domestic financial sector,
these include, first and foremost, the stability
of the macroeconomic environment and the
quality and effectiveness of domestic institu-
tions.27
The importance of the central functions of
the financial system, such as allocation of
capital and risks and settlement of payments
and securities transactions, for the real econ-
omy is demonstrated vividly whenever disrup-
tions occur. This is evident, for example, in

30the severe impact that past financial and cur-
rency crises have repeatedly had on the real
economy. The recent tensions on the inter-
national financial markets have highlighted
this once more. The smooth functioning of a
market economy relies on an efficient and
stable financial system, particularly in an in-
creasingly integrated global economy.
While it is probably too early to draw final les-
sons from the current turmoil on the inter-
national financial markets, recent events have
demonstrated that the risk of contagion rises
with greater integration and interdepend-
ence, that problems can spill across borders
rapidly and in an unpredictable manner and
may quickly lead to systemic instability. The
economic advantages of being able to trans-
fer credit and credit risks can only be realised
if they are accompanied by sufficient incen-
tives to assess and monitor credit quality and
by adequate risk management. This is true
whether a transfer is conducted in national or
international markets.
The measures and recommendations agreed
on by central banks, supervisors and minis-
tries of finance in the Forum for Financial Sta-
bility in response to the recent financial mar-
ket turmoil are therefore necessary and ap-
propriate.28In particular, the aim is to im-
prove risk management, increase the trans-
parency of institutions and products and
strengthen the quality and role of ratings.
However, these measures must be further de-
veloped and specified by the market players
themselves. A number of initiatives have al-
ready been launched with this in mind.29Theenvisaged measures must now be implement-
ed rapidly and in full.
Macroeconomic stability remains an import-
ant prerequisite for the smooth functioning
of the financial markets. Against the back-
drop of rising inflation rates worldwide, mon-
etary policy makers around the world, in par-
ticular, will have to take action. A lot of emer-
ging market economies must also contain the
macroeconomic risks associated with high
credit growth as well as further expanding
and strengthening the financial system’s insti-
tutional foundations. Moreover, a case can be
made that, in an increasingly interdependent
global financial system, flexible exchange
rates will have a larger role to play as an ad-
justment instrument for external imbalances.
The free flow of capital across national bor-
ders contributes to its most productive use.
Thus, global economic growth can benefit
from the dynamic development of the global
financial system and, in particular, from im-
proved capital and risk allocation. Moreover,
it is important that sovereign entities’ control
over increasing parts of global financial
wealth be exercised transparently and accord-
ing to economic considerations. This will help
to avoid financial protectionism, which could
jeopardise the advantages of free cross-
border capital flows.

31Development and
application of DSGE
models for the German
economyDuring the past few years, dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE)
models have become an increasingly
important part of the analytical tool-
box used by central banks and other
economic policymaking institutions.
The strength of these models lies in a
rigorous microeconomic foundation of
dynamic macroeconomic relationships.
It is thus possible, for instance, to ana-
lyse the impact of economic policy
intervention, taking into account
forward-looking expectations. This art-
icle begins with an introduction to the
basic structure of DSGE models. It then
presents a baseline model for the Ger-
man economy and describes a number
of model extensions that reflect specif-
ic features of the German economy.
Furthermore, two specific applications
are presented to show how such
models can be used in monetary policy
analysis. On the one hand, this article
illustrates the importance of expect-
ations consistent with stability for
macroeconomic developments and
warranting price stability. On the other
hand, it analyses some of the monetary
policy implications of the various
causes of an oil price increase.
Introduction
For central banks, macroeconomic models
play an important role in monetary and eco-
nomic policy analysis. There are two major
areas in which they are used: the forecastingCentral bank
models

DEUTSCHE
BUNDESBANK
EUROSYSTEM
Monthly Report
July 2008
32of aggregate economic developments and,
through simulations, to help improve the as-
sessment of the effects of certain events such
as a change in oil prices or in monetary policy
measures.
Central banks regularly use a variety of
models for this purpose. The fact that they do
not rely on just a single model or class of
model allows them to utilise the specific ad-
vantages of each of the various approaches.
An additional advantage in using alternative
models is that different perspectives can be
better brought to light, making monetary pol-
icy decisions overall more robust.
In this context, “dynamic stochastic general
equilibrium” (DSGE) models have recently
been playing an increasingly important role.
The defining feature of this class of model is a
rigorous microeconomic foundation of
macroeconomic relationships. This reflects
the advances made in economics over the
past few decades and incorporates criticisms
of traditional macroeconomic modelling ap-
proaches. Among other things, such models
fully and consistently reflect the fact that
agents in the economy base their actions to a
large extent on expectations about the future
– a factor that is not incorporated (or incorp-
orated only to a limited extent) in traditional
models. This aspect, in turn, has far-reaching
consequences for economic policy analysis
and our current understanding of how mon-
etary policy works. Shifts in policy can cause
changes in behaviour and alter parameters
once assumed to be constant.1Insights de-
rived from the past are then inadequate for
correctly assessing the future implications ofcurrent economic policy measures. Therefore,
neglecting forward-looking expectation for-
mation in part of the economic policy debate
has produced the misconception that higher
employment in the long term might be
achieved with higher inflation. However, the
rising inflation expectations in the 1970s,
along with increases in both inflation and un-
employment, proved that such a trade-off
does not exist. Rather, the experience of that
decade illustrates how important it is for
central banks to anchor expectations in a
manner that is consistent with macroeco-
nomic stability. DSGE models are ideal for the
analysis of such relationships, since their
underlying rationale is that monetary policy
does not consist of a series of isolated individ-
ual measures but, to a very large extent, in
the effective management of expectations by
means of transparent and credible strategy as
the core of rule-based behaviour.
Nevertheless, the aspects addressed here –
even in their simplest form – result in very
complex model relationships. This argues in
favour of confining models to their essentials
and including in each respective model only
those aspects which are germane to the spe-
cific issue under investigation.
One of the implications, however, is that the
actual development of macroeconomic vari-
ables, which are subject to very diverse influ-
ences, can be captured only imperfectly by
such models. Especially in forecasting, this
drawback can outweigh the advantage of a

33good theoretical basis. Accordingly, when
preparing macroeconomic projections at the
Bundesbank, preference is given to applying
methods that are principally geared to incorp-
orating not only economic considerations but
also, to a greater degree, the statistical prop-
erties of the times series to be forecast.2A
further limitation of the current generation of
DSGE models lies in the fact that, so far, they
have not been entirely successful in modelling
important relationships between the real sec-
tor and events in the financial sector. This
shortcoming was obvious even before the fi-
nancial market turbulence of the past few
months. Although this applies equally to trad-
itional macroeconomic models, it does make
clear that a central bank cannot afford to es-
chew a broad-ranging approach to analysis.
DSGE models:
some important basic elements
DSGE models feature a number of key char-
acteristics. One prime characteristic of such
models is the rigorous consideration of the
principle that the development of the econ-
omy as a whole is the result of the actions of
its individual decision-makers. For this reason,
the macroeconomic relationships are derived
from well-founded microeconomic behav-
ioural equations. With regard to the decision-
makers, a distinction is generally made at
least between households, enterprises, cen-
tral banks, and government as the institution
which levies taxes and finances expenditure.
Depending on the specific matter being stud-
ied, such a model can then be expanded toinclude other actors, ie, banks or foreign
economies, for example.
Of households it is assumed that they take
decisions on their consumption, their savings,
and their labour supply in order to maximise
their individual utility throughout their life-
time. Firms produce within the boundaries set
by their “technological possibilities” and em-
ploy labour and capital goods so as to maxi-
mise their profit throughout the period ob-
served. The central bank is usually assumed
to desire to keep the rate of inflation close to
a target value – in the case of the ECB, for ex-
ample, below but close to 2% – and to at-
tempt to reduce fluctuations in overall cap-
acity utilisation.3
One direct implication of this explicitly inter-
temporal aspect of decision-making behav-
iour is that current decisions depend on ex-
pectations about future developments. Ac-
cordingly, households’ saving behaviour and
firms’ investment behaviour hinge on current
and expected rates of interest. Expected infla-
tion and costs are among the factors deter-
mining the price-setting behaviour of firms
that cannot or do not wish to change their
prices at will. It is only such frictions in enter-
prises’ price-setting behaviour that make it
possible to model certain empirical regular-

3This requires the central bank to estimate potential out-
put. In DSGE models, this is understood as the endogen-
ous level of output that would be produced without ri-
gidities, say, in price formation. This concept should
therefore not be confused with the more customary no-
tion, where potential output is measured as a trend series
around which actual output fluctuates.Microeconomic

34ities, especially of the monetary transmission
process.
A second major characteristic of DSGE
models is the coherent formulation of the
interaction between the individual decision-
makers and the economy as a whole. Not
only does the macroeconomic equality be-
tween supply and demand have to be ob-
served; it also has to be ensured that the de-
velopments expected by households and
firms are consistent with their current and fu-
ture planned decisions. In other words, it is
assumed that expectations are “rational”. For
this reason, firms and households also form
expectations about the central bank’s future
behaviour. Therefore, the effectiveness of
monetary policy depends less on a current de-
cision by the central bank and more on influ-
encing the expectation of the future behav-
iour of the central bank. Likewise, a central
bank that wishes to make the correct monet-
ary policy decisions not only has to pay heed
to today’s underlying conditions but also has
to keep an eye on expected future develop-
ments. From these apparently simple assump-
tions, however, there follow complex inter-
actions between the actions and expectations
of all the decision-makers. If the decisions
and plans of the individual agents are com-
patible with the macroeconomic conditions,
then this is termed general equilibrium. A
long-term, equilibrium growth path of an
economy can be derived from a model which
takes accounts of the principles described
above. The complexity of the interactions,
moreover, also explains why the degree of de-
tail of current DSGE model fails to match that
of traditional macro models. The strength ofthe DSGE approach lies not so much in a de-
tailed modelling of the economy as a whole
as in a stringent and consistent modelling of
dynamic relationships between the most im-
portant macroeconomic variables without re-
sorting to ad hoc assumptions.
The basic idea of these models is that the cyc-
lical dynamics of the economy are produced
by various unexpected disturbances (stochas-
tic shocks). They explain changes in the be-
haviour of the individual decision-makers or
in the “environmental” conditions that can-
not be explained (deterministically) by the
structure of the model. Examples of such
shocks include changes in household saving
behaviour (preference shocks), unexpected
improvements in enterprises’ productivity or
an unexpected change in the global econom-
ic setting. Temporary and unexpected effects
of this kind cause macroeconomic variables
to deviate from their steady-state values. Tak-
ing account of all these elements has led to
the term “dynamic stochastic general equilib-
rium models”.
Before a model developed in accordance with
these principles can be used for economic
policy analysis or forecasting, it has to be able
to adequately replicate important empirical
observations. Only then can it be used to reli-
ably analyse the specific, relevant economic
variables and relationships. Since the model’s
solution has a time series structure, ie, the en-
dogenous variables depend on lagged values
of the variables themselves, on other model
variables and on the shocks, the model’s dy-
namic behaviour can be compared with that
of corresponding empirical time series. TheRational

35outcome, however, hinges on the economic
relationships incorporated into the model –
external trade links, for example. Additionally,
the parameter values used to model house-
holds’ and firms’ decisions determine how
the model’s variables behave. Accordingly,
the parameter values are chosen in such a
way that the model’s response to shocks
matches the data as closely as possible. Cali-
bration techniques or econometric estimation
methods are available for this purpose. Both
methods are applied at the Bundesbank de-
pending on the question being analysed, with
Bayesian methodology being used for the es-
timations.4
DSGE models for the German economy
Several variants of a DSGE model have been
developed at the Bundesbank, which supple-
ment the baseline DSGE model where appro-
priate. This “modular approach” serves the
purpose of having the model employed to be
most suitable for the question at hand, with-
out making it unnecessarily complicated.
Given the already complex nature of such
models, which is due to the large number of
different interactions described above, focus-
ing on the essentials helps make the models
more “manageable” and the results easier to
interpret.
This section begins by introducing the base-
line DSGE model. Its structure is similar to
models now also used for economic policy
analysis by other central banks, governments
and international institutions.5Apart from
the basic elements mentioned above, this ap-plies to the inclusion of various types of mar-
ket frictions and inertia in the adjustment to a
new equilibrium, which are described in more
detail below. Such elements have proved to
be necessary so that the empirically observed
relationships and actual developments of the
time series can be better replicated with the
DSGE models. Lagged adjustments are espe-
cially necessary in order to be able to give a
realistic description of the observed behaviour
of prices, consumption and investment. In
the models used at the Bundesbank, the par-
ameter values are chosen such that the
model can replicate the crucial relationships
of the German economy.
After the baseline model, the extensions that
are particularly important for certain analyses
of the German economy will be presented.
A relevant factor here is that Germany is the
largest economy in the euro area and is also
highly integrated into the global economy.
This is followed by a brief account of the
main special features of the German labour
market and financial system.
The baseline DSGE model
The baseline model consists of a series of
equations which, along with some identities,
derive from the optimality conditions of
households and firms and which describe the
behaviour of the central bank and of fiscal

This section explains the central steady-state relationships of the 
baseline DSGE model expressed in log-linear form. The ^ symbol 
above a variable indicates that this is a percentage deviation 
from the steady state. Changes in nominal interest rate and 
inﬂ ation are shown in percentage points.1
Households
Households make decisions about consumption C^ and labour 
supply N^. Household decisions can be summarised as
C^
t = Et(C^
t+1) – h(C^
t – C^
t-1) – 1-h
σ(it – Et (π^
t+1)) – 1-h
σ(Et(εc
t+1) – εc
t ) (1)
μN^
t = W^
t – P^
t – σC^
t + εn
t          ( 2 )
Equation (1) is the Consumption Euler equation. In equation (2) 
labour supply depends on the real wage W^
t – P^
t and the mar-
ginal utility of consumption – σC^
t in which W^
t represents nominal 
wages and P^
t represents the price level.
The parameter σ > 0 determines the marginal utility of consump-
tion and 1/μ > 0 represents the elasticity of labour supply while 
εc and εn show the consumption and labour supply preference 
shocks. The parameter h > 0 stands for the extent to which 
today’s consumption is dependent on yesterday’s level and is 
referred to in the literature as a habit parameter.
Firms
Each ﬁ  rm produces a heterogeneous good for which it has 
market power and can, therefore, set the price. The resulting 
marginal costs ϕ^ can be described by the following equation
ϕ^
 t = α(r^K
t ) + (1 – α)(W^
t  – P^
t) – A^
t         ( 3 )
The parameter α > 0 represents the share of capital in produc-
tion. The marginal costs increase with real wages and are higher 
the greater the cost of borrowing capital r^K
t and the lower the 
productivity A^
t .
Firms set prices optimally as a mark-up over marginal costs and 
take into account that prices cannot be completely adjusted to 
the optimal level each period. Capital stock is deﬁ  ned as
K^
t = (1 – δ)K^
t-1 + δI^

t          ( 4 )
The rate of depreciation for capital K^
t is δ > 0. Capital formation 
depends on investment I^
t and can be disturbed by a shock εI
t . 
Investment is deﬁ  ned as
I^
t = I^
t-1 + 1
Ψ(Q^

t)           ( 5 )
Investment today, I^

The parameter β represents households’ subjective time pref-
erence rate while the variable Λ^
t+1 represents the stochastic 
discount factor.

as factors of production

The parameters c , ι and g are steady-state values.
Inﬂ ation dynamics
Aggregate inﬂ  ation dynamics derive from ﬁ  rms’ price-setting 
behaviour. The inﬂ  ation rate is given by a Phillips curve
π^
t = βEt(π^
t+1) + κϕ^
t + επ
t          ( 9 )
The parameter κ gives the elasticity of inﬂ  ation to marginal 
costs. Inﬂ  ation can also be driven by a cost-induced inﬂ  ation 
shock επ
t .
Monetary and ﬁ  scal policy
Monetary policy is described by an interest rate rule
it = ρit-1+ (1 – ρ)(φππ^
t + φxxt) + εi
t            (10)
This implies that the central bank wants to stabilise inﬂ  ation 
and deviations from long-term potential output xt without caus-
ing interest rates to ﬂ  uctuate excessively. Parameter ρ  describes 
the degree of interest rate variation. If the economy overheats, 
leading to π^
t > 0 and xt > 0, the central bank will raise the nominal 
interest rate. The extent to which the interest rate increases is 
dependent on the interest rate response coefﬁ  cients of inﬂ  ation 
φπ > 1 and of the output gap φx > 0. In its most straightforward 
form, ﬁ  scal policy can be deﬁ  ned by
G^
t = T^
t + m(M^
t – M^
t-1 – P^
t)             (11)
The government ﬁ  nances its expenditure G^
t from taxes T^
t and 
the central bank proﬁ  t (M^
t – M^
t-1) – P^
t with M^ representing the 
money stock and m a steady-state value.

households to move consumption to the present. (Increased consumption during a FIFA World Cup or the Olympics may serve as a case in point.) In this model simulation, we assume that the preference shock follows a ﬁ  rst-order autoregressive process to

ρc = 0.20 σu = 0.20 β = 0.99 rK  = 0.035The impulse response functions in the diagrams below illustrate 
how the economy adjusts.
They show how the disturbance causes each variable to move 
away from its steady state (zero line) and how it reverts back to it. Consumption rises and savings fall. The latter leads to a reduction in investment. Greater demand for consumer goods 
induces ﬁ  rms to increase their demand for labour and capital. 
The increased factor demand leads to an increase in marginal costs. The Phillips curve relationship shows that inﬂ  ation rises. 
The central bank responds to rising inﬂ  ation by increasing the 
nominal interest rate in order to increase the real interest rate.

38policy (for details, see the explanatory notes
on pages 36 and 37). Households are mainly
described by their consumption behaviour
and their labour supply (see equations (1) and
(2) in the explanatory notes). In line with the
principles set out above, consumption in the
current period (in the empirical implementa-
tion, each period is set equal to one calendar
quarter) depends negatively on the real rate
of interest, ie, the nominal interest rate minus
the expected inflation rate, expected con-
sumption in the next period and a preference
shock. Furthermore, it is assumed that house-
holds have a propensity not to let their con-
sumption fluctuate too much after changes in
income (the “habit persistence” hypothesis).
This assumption ensures that the compara-
tively low level of volatility in consumption
observed in the empirical time series can be
captured by the model. Labour supply is de-
termined by real wages and the marginal util-
ity of consumption.
The behaviour of enterprises is characterised
by price-setting behaviour as well as by the
demand for labour and capital. Firms produce
goods, for which they have certain market
power. Therefore, this is a departure from the
strict assumption of perfect competition. It
follows from this that profit-maximising en-
terprises possess some discretion in setting
prices. Firms will employ additional labour to
produce their goods as long as the earnings
per unit of labour do not exceed unit labour
costs, which, in turn, also depend on the
marginal productivity of labour. One major
determinant of this productivity is the de-
ployed capital stock; the more capital an en-
terprise uses, the more productive its labouris. The capital stock is determined, in turn, by
investment. The lower real interest rates are
relative to productivity, the more is invested.
Adjustment costs in the investment process
also ensure an empirically plausible, sluggish
change in the capital stock (see equations (5)
and (6) on page 36).
The production of goods in the economy as a
whole depends on the aggregate input of la-
bour, the capital stock and the general level
of productivity in the economy. In the short
term, output varies owing to unexpected
shocks, say, in labour input. In the long term,
output is determined by technological pro-
gress, capital input and population growth. In
the baseline model, the demand for goods is
determined by consumption demand, invest-
ment demand and the level of government
expenditure. Price changes depend on the
marginal costs of production and the expect-
ed future inflation rate. This results from
firms’ optimal price-setting. Enterprises that
cannot or do not wish to change their prices
every period because they face menu costs
also take into account expected rates of infla-
tion because their prices should not deviate
too much from the general price level in the
coming periods. Overall, these relationships
result in a variant of the well-known Phillips
curve, which provides a link between inflation
and output. In contrast to the traditional Phil-
lips curve, however, the expectation about fu-
ture inflation here also influences current
changes in prices. Effective central bank pol-
icy therefore depends not only on current
monetary policy but also on expectations
about the future monetary policy stance.Enterprises

39Deutsche BundesbankThe role of expectations and central bank credibility
According to the policy rules usually applied in the 
monetary policy literature, a central bank responds to deviations from the inﬂ  ation target. Here, two different 
types of response are compared. In the ﬁ  rst scenario, 
the central bank is able to communicate its commitment to stability to the private sector in a credible manner. In the second, the private sector does not expect the central bank to consistently pursue its stability policy and mistakenly assumes a weaker response to inﬂ  ation-
ary pressures (thus, φ
π = 1.02 instead of 2.02 in equa-
tion (10) on page 36). The inﬂ  ation expectations thus 
differ systematically from subsequent actual inﬂ  ation 
rates owing to the central bank’s failure to communi-cate its aims in a credible manner.
The initial disturbance is assumed to be a cost-push 
shock, which follows a ﬁ  rst-order autoregressive pro cess 
(see chart below).It is clear in both scenarios that the cost-push shock 
drives up inﬂ  ation. At the same time, the nominal inter-
est rate increases, thus counteracting the considerable price pressures. Output consequently falls below poten-tial. By contrast, greater monetary policy credibility leads to signiﬁ  cantly lower inﬂ  ation. This is because 
lower inﬂ  ation expectations for the future already have 
an impact on today’s price-setting. The increase ultim-ately required in the nominal interest rate is therefore 
also markedly lower. Thus, if the central bank is able 
to anchor inﬂ  ation expectations, inﬂ  ation is lower as a 
result. There are also advantages for the real economy as production shortfalls are smaller and more short-lived if policy is communicated in a more credible manner. The 
better a central bank communicates its commitment to 
stability, the less volatile the response of the economy as a whole to shocks and the easier it is to ensure price stability.

40A predictable and credible policy facilitates
such a formation of expectations.
In models of this type, it is usually assumed
that the central bank’s interest rate policy can
be described by what is known as a Taylor
rule, according to which the interest rate is
positively correlated with inflation and aggre-
gate capacity utilisation.6The central bank
reacts such that, if inflation rises, the real rate
of interest increases as well (known as the
Taylor principle). The simplified model as-
sumes that government expenditure will rise
in line with economic growth.
Repeated reference has been made to how
important the formation of expectations and
the credibility of monetary policy are in DSGE
models and what the implications are for the
interaction between all economic agents. It is
especially apparent, for example, that a cred-
ible central bank can better anchor inflation
expectations and, therefore, the realised in-
flation following a price shock. In fact, the re-
quired interest rate hike can be markedly
lower than in the case of a monetary policy
that is geared less credibly to price stability
(see the explanations on page 39).
Extensions of the baseline model
A number of important monetary and eco-
nomic policy analyses can be conducted
using the baseline model. However, the Ger-
man economy displays special features which
cannot be ignored for certain questions and
which therefore require extensions to the
model. These features include Germany’s rolein the European monetary union (EMU) and
the global economy as well as the structures
in the German labour market and the Ger-
man financial system. The following section
focuses on these factors and on how they are
taken into account in an extended model.
Germany is not a closed economy as is as-
sumed in the baseline model. In order to take
account of this fact, one model extension
captures the external links of the German
economy within a three-region model. The
German economy (region 1) and the other
member states (region 2) form the EMU. Both
regions are linked to the rest of the global
economy (region 3). Depending on the focus
of analysis, the rest of the global economy
can mean the industrial countries outside
monetary union, the emerging market econ-
omies as a bloc, or the world economy as a
whole with the exception of the euro area.
Depending on the interpretation, relevant
parameters of the model need to be varied.
With regard to monetary union, it is import-
ant to note, first of all, that monetary policy is
designed to suit European conditions rather
than German ones. In the model, the interest
6Such a rule can be derived from the perception that
central banks wish to prevent or, at least, minimise devi-
ations in inflation from the inflation target and keep ac-
tual output close to “potential output”. Potential output
is an important point of reference for monetary policy
since output cannot deviate from potential in the long
term without generating either inflationary or deflation-
ary pressure. In this perception, if a central bank wished
to realise the inflation target at every point in time, inter-
est rate policymakers would overreact to every deviation
from the target. If it seeks to return inflation to the target
path more gradually after a shock, the response will be
less strong. Allowing for all the simplification required by
such models, this analysis addresses major aspects of the
tasks and objectives of the ECB, which aims for an infla-
tion rate below but close to 2%.Monetary and
fiscal policy

41rate rule is modified accordingly. The central
bank now focuses on price stability in themonetary union as a whole. However, in thiscontext, the German situation is accordedmajor importance.
Within an integrated global economy, firms
do not just produce goods for the domesticmarket; they also export part of their output.This means that firms have to decide not onlya domestic price but also an export price.
7
Transport costs prevent all goods from beingfreely tradable, however; there also exist non-tradable goods that can be consumed onlywithin the country of production.
Finally, account must be taken of the fact
that households can also invest in financial in-struments from all three regions but have acertain preference for domestic assets (homebias). This form of modelling international re-lationships makes it possible to analysechanges in the current account positions be-tween the three regions and to answer ques-tions on the implications of globalisation.
The labour market is a second major area in
which the Germany economy differs from thestylised conditions of the baseline model. InDSGE models, as explained above, employeesand employers make their decisions in linewith their respective deliberations on opti-misation. Households consider how they canbest divide their lifetime between work andleisure, always bearing in mind their desiredconsumption, wages, prices etc. Enterprisesconsider how much labour they demand. Thisleads to fundamental conditions of laboursupply and demand as well as a given level ofemployment. In this sense, there is no invol-
untary unemployment in the baseline models,and labour is a homogenous good that canbe deployed readily and universally. This ab-stracts from many key aspects of the labourmarket, however: employees and jobs are notall identical and labour markets are character-ised by a large number of institutional regula-tions. Although these aspects are importantin explaining unemployment, it is not easy tointegrate them into traditional DSGE models.Thus, in principle, in an approach that takesaccount of the possibility of future unemploy-ment (or future reemployment), employershave to consider this fact before they taketheir decisions. On the other hand, whenplanning in the present, enterprises have tobear in mind that, in the future, they may notalways find the employees they are lookingfor. Incorporating all these considerationsgives the models an additional dimension ofcomplexity which has to be accommodatedby suitable approaches.
In the extended model, unemployment is ex-
plained by the assumption of search fric-
7Empirical evidence shows that firms make use of this
option and charge different prices at home and abroad.
A detailed discussion can be found, for example, in

change rates: What have we learned?, Journal of Eco-
nomic Literature 35, pp 1243-1272, and C Engel and

42tions.8This term is used to describe the diffi-
culties experienced by workers and firms in
finding suitable jobs and labour, respectively.
This process costs time and resources and re-
sults in unemployed persons often needing a
long time to find reemployment and to va-
cancies advertised by firms not being filled
immediately. This means that there are always
households, also including long-term un-
employed persons, who are in search of
work. In an economic upswing, unemploy-
ment will therefore fall in the model, as in
reality, because firms are increasingly looking
for labour and making fewer persons redun-
dant. The converse applies in a downturn.
This allows a more realistic explanation not
only of fluctuations in employment but also
the phenomenon of structural unemploy-
ment. This depends on various, often institu-
tional conditions in the labour market, such
as the level and period of entitlement to un-
employment benefit, the general wage level
and the efficiency of the job-seeking process.
The negotiating power of trade unions and
employers also plays a key role.
The role of the financial sector is a third area
where relationships that are key for a large
number of interesting questions are overly
simplified in the baseline model. The financial
sector does not play an explicit role in the
baseline model, in which investment is fi-
nanced directly by households’ savings with-
out the involvement of financial intermediar-
ies. In the real world, however, the financial
system is a key element in the chain of the
monetary policy transmission process.
Changes in interest rates, which raise or
lower the cost of banks’ financing opportun-ities, are passed on to potential borrowers
and, in this way, also influence their demand.
In Germany, for example, bank loans are a
prominent feature of corporate finance,
while direct financing through the capital
markets is less important than in other coun-
tries.9
In current DSGE models, it has become stand-
ard to analyse credit relationships which gen-
erally feature certain frictions in that banks
have only limited information about their cus-
tomers. Banks can reduce these imperfections
by specialising in certain industries (financing
of SMEs), enterprises (relationship banking)
and, in particular, by the inclusion of collat-
eral. The structure of the financial system has
implications for the effects of shocks on the
economy. The relationship banking system
may help to cushion the impact of shocks,
while the requirement to post collateral may
amplify cyclical fluctuations.10The value of
collateral will generally rise during an up-
swing, making it easier for firms to borrow
more funds for investment. The result is that
the upswing is reinforced by this accelerator
process. In a downswing, this mechanism is
reversed.

43A better recognition of the interrelationships
between the real economy and financial fac-
tors is currently one of the most pressing
areas of “construction” in the ongoing devel-
opment of DSGE models. That applies to all
macroeconomic models and not just the
DSGE approach, however. Against this back-
ground, it is essential for central banks –
whose measures take place via financial mar-
kets – not to limit their view on monetary
conditions because of gaps in existing
models. Instead, they need to include com-
plementary views of monetary and credit de-
velopments.
Similar arguments apply to residential finan-
cing. Recent experience in the US as well as
in some European countries has brought to
attention the importance of this segment of
the credit market for monetary policy and the
economy. The German housing market and
its customary forms of financing differ in
many respects from those in other countries,
however. It is therefore essential to take due
account of these special features in order not
to copy conclusions taken from other models
that do not match the German situation. For
this reason, a module allowing a more precise
analysis of the housing market in Germany is
also currently under development.
An application: simulating the effects
of oil price rises
The dramatic overall rise in oil prices, which
has been taking place for some years, poses
in various respects an economic and monet-
ary policy challenge. In particular, it is leadingto direct price rises for energy products and
to rising cost pressure on producers, who
wish to pass at least some of this pressure on
to their customers. The experience of the oil
price shocks of the 1970s and early 1980s,
which triggered high inflation rates and re-
cessionary developments, is often evoked in
discussions of this subject. In actual fact,
however, a careful analysis of the impact of
oil price rises on the German economy has to
investigate the causes of such increases in
more detail so that the correct conclusions
for the development of the economy and for
monetary policy can be drawn.
In the following simulations, two scenarios
are distinguished. In the first scenario, the rise
in oil prices is due to an increase in the global
demand for oil. In the second scenario, it re-
sults from a global supply shortage. Oil prices
over the past few years undoubtedly display
some features of both scenarios. To a large
extent, the first scenario describes the causes
of the recent oil price increase more accurate-
ly as the endogenous outcome of the sharp
growth in emerging market economies such
as India and China. While it is true that supply
shortages in the oil market have been of sig-
nificance in the past few years, the second
scenario reflects more the experience of the
1970s. Of course, neither of these scenarios
should be misconstrued as an attempt to give
a complete picture of oil price movements in
the two historical periods. Rather, the point is
to highlight in stylised form a particular as-
pect in which the two situations differ as well
as their implications.Housing market Supply shock

44The analysis is based on a variant in which the
basic model has been extended in two ways.
First, Germany – as in the above-described
extensions – is modelled as an open economy.
Second, it is assumed not only that capital
and labour are used in the production of
goods but also that oil is needed. Further-
more, domestic households consume not
only traditional domestic and foreign con-
sumer goods but also oil. In this context, Ger-
many takes the oil price as given since it is de-
termined in the world markets.
The most important relationships can be char-
acterised as follows. A decline in the global
oil supply leads to a rise in the real price of
oil. Consumer prices in Germany go up, with
negative consequences for real disposable in-
come. Households consume less. Enterprises
react to the fall in demand by cutting back
production. The higher price of oil also leads
to higher marginal costs, however, and to ad-
verse repercussions on potential output. Infla-
tion accelerates and monetary policymakers
respond by raising interest rates.
However, the rise in interest rates is markedly
lower than in the case of a demand-driven in-
crease in oil prices. As an example, a prefer-
ence shock abroad leading to an expansion
of foreign consumption is assumed in this
scenario. Higher consumption by non-
residents leads to increased output there and
greater demand for oil but also to stronger
demand for German products. This leads to
an increase in output in Germany and a high-
er factor demand. There is a rise in marginal
costs and, thus, in inflation. This is a clear sig-
nal to the central bank to increase interestrates – much more sharply than in the case of
the oil supply shock. Households reduce their
consumption, one of the reasons being that
they have to pay more for oil. The overall out-
come is a current account surplus. Later,
however, the current account deteriorates
again because households reduce their sav-
ings (see chart on page 45).
In spite of its simplifying abstraction, the styl-
ised simulation experiment makes it possible
to extract two aspects that, from a monetary
policy perspective, deserve attention in the
current situation. First, with regard to the
monetary policy response to an oil price rise,
it is important not to lose sight of the fact
that this also has an impact on potential out-
put. Rising oil prices will lead to a reduction in
potential output, with consequences for the
output gap. In other words, the effects of an
energy price rise on output show up not only
in the actual figures but also influence pro-
duction possibilities. Monetary policymakers
have to pay attention to both effects when
assessing the resulting inflation risks. Further-
more, the factors driving the oil price increase
are crucial in determining the appropriate
monetary policy response. The more strongly
demand-side influences determine the oil
price increase, the smaller the adverse effects
on the domestic real economy will be, and
the smaller the price-dampening impact of a
slowdown in the domestic economy will be
as well.
What should not be overlooked, however, is
the fact there are major differences in the dy-
namics of the oil price suggested by the
model scenarios from those of actual oil priceImplications for

46developments in the recent past. The scen-
arios presented here model transitory move-
ments of real and nominal oil prices. This
means that the described effects on output
and potential output are necessarily tempor-
ary in nature. The effect on general inflation
is likewise of limited duration. Oil prices over
the past few years have been characterised
by a trend increase, however. The outcome
has been that energy prices have made a per-
sistent contribution to general consumer
price inflation. Similarly, this model applica-
tion excludes the risk that, in such a setting,
long-term inflation expectations deviate from
the central bank’s stability objective. The im-
plications of such a divergence between con-
sumers’ and enterprises’ expectations and the
actual behaviour of the central bank have
been addressed above. All in all, both scen-
arios tend to underestimate the current chal-
lenges for monetary policy posed by the
sharp and persistent rise in commodity prices.
Outlook
DSGE models are a very promising approach
to analysing macroeconomic relationships.
They have specific strengths that can help
precisely in economic policy decision-making.
Here, as for all models and analytical instru-
ments in general, it is true that no single
model can fully capture the complexity of the
real world. Besides experience and expertise,
well-founded decisions taken by centralbanks and other economic policy decision-
makers therefore depend on the use of a
comprehensive analytical toolbox, in which
the role of DSGE models is important and
growing. Even so, there are still many ques-
tions which cannot be answered or which
can be answered only tentatively at present
using such models.
The modelling of the financial systems and of
their importance for economic developments
has been only partly successful so far. For this
reason, intensive work is being undertaken at
present on how the significance of credit de-
velopments and of the monetary aggregates
can be better integrated into DSGE models.
Increasing attention is being paid to the fact
that households and enterprises can be very
different as well as to the need to focus more
on this heterogeneity and its possible implica-
tions for the economy as a whole. Finally,
greater consideration should be given to the
fact that uncertainty still prevails about the
precise structure of the economy and that ex-
pectations are not formed entirely rationally.
Nevertheless, such unresolved issues should
not obscure the fact that economic policy an-
alysis ought to be based on approaches that
take into account aggregate economic rela-
tionships and, at the same time, take as their
starting point the decisions of the individual
agents in the product, labour and financial
markets – as do the general equilibrium
models presented in this article.Possible future
