Underlying trends
The recovery of the German economy re-
gained momentum in the first quarter of
2011. Whereas the previous quarter had
been adversely affected by the very harsh
winter weather in December, the construc-
tion sector, in particular, as well as some ser-
vices sectors, benefited from catching-up and
backlog effects in the first few months of the
year. Industrial output continued its upward
trend.
The positive underlying trend in overall eco-
nomic activity is set to continue in the second
quarter of 2011. Although it is unlikely that
any further significant catching-up effects will
emerge, the sharp rise in both domestic and
export orders in the first two months of this
year should give rise to a further increase in
industrial output. The events in Japan have so
far had only a minor impact on enterprises’
business expectations. If disruptions in the
supply chains can be avoided or if these can
be rapidly resolved, the impact on the Ger-
many economy will be limited.
Industry
Industrial output in February of this year was
a seasonally adjusted 11/2% up on the January
figure, which has been revised upwards
slightly. On an average of January and Febru-
ary, the increase on the final quarter of 2010
stood at 13/4%. Sharp growth was recorded,
in particular, by manufacturers of intermedi-
ate goods, and there was also a marked ex-Cyclical

6pansion in the output of consumer goods. By
contrast, production of capital goods, espe-
cially in mechanical engineering and in the
manufacture of vehicles and other transport
equipment, was somewhat down on the
strong prior-quarter level.
Demand for industrial goods rose significantly
in February for the second month in succes-
sion, going up by just under 21/2% on the
month after adjustment for seasonal vari-
ations. The average volume of orders in the
first two months of 2011 was therefore 31/2%
higher than in the preceding three-month
period. Orders received by producers of inter-
mediate goods had a major impact with
growth of 41/2%, although orders for capital
goods went up considerably as well (+31/2%).
Large orders received by manufacturers of
aircraft and spacecraft played a part in this. In
regional terms, domestic demand increased
more sharply (+41/2%) than export demand
(+3%). The increase in export orders was
concentrated more on euro-area partner
countries again. Following an extended period
of sluggishness, these orders grew by 61/4%,
largely on account of the aforementioned
large orders. By contrast, orders from non-
euro-area countries were only slightly higher
than in the previous quarter.
Domestic industrial sales in February went up
by a nominal and seasonally adjusted 3% on
the month. In the two-month period of Janu-
ary and February, growth was 23/4% on the
fourth quarter. In the first two months of
2011, the seasonally adjusted value of ex-
ports of goods went up by 1% on the final
quarter of last year. Industrial export salesEconomic conditions in Germany*

7increased on roughly the same scale. The
growth in imports of goods, at 33/4%, was
perceptibly higher, although this was due pri-marily to fairly sharp price rises.
ConstructionSeasonally adjusted construction output
showed a further rise in February following asharp countermovement in January to theweather-induced output losses in December.On an average of January and February, out-put was up 12
3/4% on the final quarter of
2010, with growth being split evenly be-tween general building and civil engineering.Following a sharp decline in December,orders received in January, which are alsoweather-dependent, showed an increaseagain (more recent figures are not yet avail-able). It was only building construction thatsaw a quarter-on-quarter rise in new orders,however. Civil engineering remained at a de-pressed level. Similarly, public sector custom-ers cut back their demand considerably,whereas demand for private housing con-struction and demand from industrial cus-tomers expanded sharply.
Labour marketFebruary 2011 saw a further improvement in
the already favourable labour market situ-ation. There was a perceptible rise in thenumber of persons in work in Germany. Ac-cording to the provisional figures of the Fed-eral Statistical Office, there were 33,000more persons in gainful employment thanin the previous month in seasonally adjustedterms. The year-on-year increase was 494,000(+1.2%). In January, there was an extremely
sharp 2.2% year-on-year rise in employmentsubject to social security contributions. TheIfo employment barometer reached a newhigh in March, and according to the FederalEmployment Agency’s BA-X index for non-government-assisted jobs, enterprises’ will-ingness to recruit also remained at a highlevel.
The upward trend in employment continued
to have a positive effect on unemployment.In March, the official unemployment figuredeclined perceptibly by a seasonally adjusted55,000 to 3.00 million. The unemploymentrate (BA concept) fell by a seasonally adjusted0.2 percentage point to 7.1%, which was0.9 percentage point lower than the figureone year earlier.
PricesFollowing a temporary decline owing to the
earthquake in Japan, crude oil prices con-tinued to rise steeply in the second half ofMarch as a result of the situation in North Af-rica and positive US economic data. At almostUS$115 per barrel on a monthly average, thespot price for Brent North Sea oil was justunder 10% higher than in February. Owingto the sustained appreciation of the euroagainst the US dollar, the increase amountedto just over 7% in euro terms. Crude oilprices continued to rise in April with the spotprice standing at US$122 as this report wentto press. A slight easing is expected on thefutures markets in the coming months. Six-month deliveries were being traded at dis-

8counts of US$2; the figure for 18-month de-
liveries was as much as US$7.
The extremely sharp rise in prices at the up-
stream stages of the economy weakened
somewhat in February. This was probably due
mainly to the fact that crude oil price quota-
tions in the first three weeks of the month
were hardly any higher than in January.
Moreover, the further appreciation of the
euro against the US dollar is likely to have
had a dampening effect on prices. The rise in
import prices, at a seasonally adjusted 0.8%,
was only about half as strong as in January. In
terms of commercial producer prices, which
respond with a time lag, the moderation was
more muted at +0.7%. The year-on-year
figure for import prices remained largely
unchanged at +11.9%. The corresponding
figure for domestic producer prices went up
to +6.4%.
Owing to the surge in crude oil prices at the
end of February, consumer prices rose very
sharply in March at a seasonally adjusted
+0.5%. With regard to food prices, the
strong yet opposing movements in the case
of coffee and dairy products, and fruit and
vegetables, largely cancelled each other out
in seasonally adjusted terms. There was a rise
in the seasonally adjusted prices of industrial
products and services. Owing to a base effect
brought about by the sharp rise in energy
prices in March 2010, the year-on-year rise in
consumer prices in the national consumer
price index (CPI) remained unchanged at
+2.1%, and the Harmonised Index of Con-
sumer Prices (HICP) went up slightly from
+2.2% to +2.3%.Public finances1
Local government finances
Local government recorded a surplus of €11/2
billion in the final quarter of 2010 compared
with a deficit of €1/2billion one year previous-
ly.2This improvement was chiefly due to a
clear rise in tax receipts as well as an increase
in transfers and other current income, com-
bined with growth in expenditure remaining
subdued.
Despite positive macroeconomic develop-
ments, the deficit for 2010 as a whole went
up somewhat to just over €71/2billion (2009:
just over €7 billion). Revenue rose by 21/2%
(or €41/2billion). The rise in tax receipts
(+ 21/2%, or €11/2billion) was attributable to
positive developments in local business tax
(+ 71/2%, or €2 billion, after deduction of the
shares accruing to other government levels),
while revenue from local government’s share
of income tax declined significantly. The de-
crease in general grants to local government
(-71/2%, or €2 billion), which in most cases in-
cluded offsetting delayed payments and, for
the year in question, were linked to the nega-
tive expectations at that time with regard to
the level of tax revenue, was more than com-
pensated for by higher investment grants

9from state government (+ 121/2%, or €1 bil-
lion), including, in particular, funds from thesecond economic stimulus package, as wellas strong growth in fees, other current in-come and receipts in the capital account. Ex-penditure went up by just under 3% (or €5billion). A major part of this was accountedfor by sharp growth in other operating ex-penditure (+ 5
1/2%, or €2 billion) and social
benefits (+ 41/2%, or €2 billion). But growth
was likewise reported for fixed asset forma-tion (+ 5
1/2%, or just over €1 billion) – largely
driven by the second economic stimuluspackage – and personnel expenditure (+ 2%,or €1 billion). By contrast, acquisitions ofparticipating interests, in particular, declined(following larger one-off transactions in Stutt-gart and Munich in 2009) as did interestexpenditure. However, the Federal StatisticalOffice continues to stress that, in connectionwith the gradual introduction of the commer-cial double-entry bookkeeping system, theallocation of expenditure to the categories“other operating expenditure” and “fixedasset formation”, in particular, may havechanged to some extent.

For the first time in five years, credit marketdebt was up on the year, increasing by €2 bil-lion to €77 billion at the end of 2010. Evi-dently, the reserves built up by local govern-ment in the period up to 2008 have in manycases now been depleted. At the same time,the sharp increase in short-term cash ad-vances, or liquidity loans, continued. Theyshot up by €5
1/2billion on the year to a record
high of €401/2billion. This demonstrates the
extremely tense budgetary situation faced bymany local governments – not least in NorthRhine-Westphalia (for information on the
state budget, see the comments on pages 10and 11). Despite a probable significant rise intax receipts and higher tax-revenue-linkedgeneral grants, deficits are not expected tobe lowered drastically in 2011. However, theFederal decision to gradually transfer thetotal annual costs of around €4 billion forthe basic allowance for elderly persons andpeople with reduced earning capacity to cen-tral government will notably relieve the pres-sure on local government finances in thecoming years.Local government fiscal

10Deutsche BundesbankImplications of the ruling on the supplementary budget of North Rhine-Westphalia for 2010
In a ruling that will also have fundamental implica-
tions for the effectiveness of borrowing limits in Ger-
many, on 15 March 2011 the Constitutional Court for
the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia found
that the state’s supplementary budget for 2010, which
authorised the state government to increase its
borrowing from €61/2billion to €81/2billion despite a
distinct improvement in the economy since the adop-
tion of the original budget, was unconstitutional and
therefore null and void.1The court issued a temporary
injunction in mid-January 2011 prohibiting the state
from further implementing its budget and closing its
books; this is the first time that a direct restriction has
been imposed on the execution of a pending budget.
All payments already made that are not subject to any
direct legal obligation or that can be postponed to
the next fiscal year must therefore be reversed. This
primarily affects transfers to several special-purpose
reserves and to a special fund for provisioning for
burdens from guarantees made in connection with
WestLB, which together amount to just over €2 bil-
lion. Overall, this has reduced North Rhine-
Westphalia’s net borrowing for 2010 from just over €7
billion to €5 billion.2
In their ruling, the judges explained that the condi-
tions for exceeding the regular borrowing limit,
which is based on self-financed investment, had not
been met. They expressed doubts as to whether there
was still any severe disruption of the macroeconomic
equilibrium which could have justified additional new
borrowing at the end of 2010 and whether the state
government’s assessment that such a disruption exist-
ed was backed sufficiently. The judges’ main misgiv-
ing, however, was that North Rhine-Westphalia’s law-
makers had failed to demonstrate how the measures
taken were supposed to avert this assumed disrup-
tion. In addition, they expressed strong doubts about
whether the aforementioned transfers to reserves and
to the WestLB special funds in connection with severe
burdens on the budget that either could not yet be
determined clearly or were not imminent were com-
patible with the principle of cost-effectiveness, which
requires that government debt be kept tightly in
check. Since the court had already found the suitabil-
ity of the measures to be insufficiently proven, it did
not make a final judgement on the aforementioned
additional – and apparently likewise serious – issues.On the whole, for future budgetary legislation, far
more precise analysis and arguments will clearly be re-
quired in order to justify recourse to the long-stand-
ing exemption clause for the ceiling on new borrow-
ing.
The state government of North Rhine-Westphalia,
newly formed in the summer of 2010 after the state
parliament election, did not present a draft state
budget for 2011 until mid-February. With just over
€31/2billion in self-financed investment, the draft
budget contained net borrowing for a total of nearly
€8 billion.3On the same day, the North Rhine-
Westphalian government issued a supplementary
document which reduced the proposed authorisation
for new borrowing to just over €7 million by upping
the assumed tax revenue by €1/2billion following the
unexpectedly favourable result in 2010 and by add-
itionally planning to save half of this figure through
several targeted cuts to planned spending authorisa-
tions and larger global spending cuts.4The cited rea-
son for the renewed breach of the borrowing limit
was once again to avert a disruption of the macroeco-
nomic equilibrium in North Rhine-Westphalia and in
Germany as a whole. The explanatory memorandum
for the original draft budget stated that the four sub-
goals listed in the Stability Act – high employment,
price stability, external equilibrium and steady and
adequate economic growth – had all been missed
after the beginning of 2011, thus necessitating fur-
ther remedial steps. If these criteria had been applied
in the past, however, they would have nullified the
borrowing limits for practically every year over the
past three decades. By contrast, both the German
Council of Economic Experts and the autumn 2010
Joint Assessment by key economic research insti-
tutions had already recommended using the very
favourable economic development as an opportunity
to begin consolidation. In that vein, the Federal
Government has set the goal of consolidating its
budget, beginning with the current year.
Lawmakers in some other Federal states also diagnosed
continued disruptions to the macroeconomic equilib-
rium for 2011. However, this was particularly because,
in most cases, they had been much quicker to pass
their budget laws. At the same time, clear medium-
term consolidation strategies had been laid out. The

11state government of North Rhine-Westphalia, by con-
trast, is pursuing an approach described as “precau-
tionary fiscal policy”.
Under this approach, comprehensive government
educational programmes are one main instrument de-
signed to reduce future income shortfalls and social
welfare requirements.5The long-term budget relief,6
however, is uncertain and, in the case of tax revenues,would have to be distributed among the Federal
states under the state government revenue-sharing
scheme. A more fundamental objection, however, is
that using borrowing to finance additional ongoing
expenditure is incompatible with the borrowing limit
if this borrowing is not designed to meet cyclical ob-
jectives but – as in this case – structural goals instead.
Another envisaged provision is to extend the pay in-
creases agreed for salaried public service employees in
the latest wage round to current and retired civil ser-
vants – unlike in previous years – without any delay
and without making any concessions for the budget-
ary situation,
7thereby directly burdening the budget
by an additional figure in the hundreds of millions.
Further funding is also to be provided as assistance for
local government budgets, which are also under
severe pressure. Along with €300 million from an ad-
justment of the local government revenue-sharing
scheme already made in 2010, another €350 million
have been earmarked for local governments that are
unable to balance their budgets as required. Given
that the outstanding liquidity loans of North Rhine-
Westphalia’s local governments are very high on aver-
age (totalling €20 billion), it is doubtful, however,
whether such limited measures can trigger a percep-
tible increase in local authorities’ investment – as
would be fundamentally suited to overcoming a dis-
ruption of the macroeconomic equilibrium.8
Following the ruling by the constitutional court, fur-
ther adjustments to the North Rhine-Westphalian
state budget for 2011, which is to be signed into law
in mid-May, have been proposed. As an example, fol-
lowing high tax revenue in the first quarter, the pro-
jected revenue from this source is to be increased
by another €11/2billion. In addition, an increase in the
tax rate on the acquisition of land and buildings is
planned for October 2011. On the expenditure side,additional cuts of around €1/2billion are planned.
However, a large percentage will be budgeted only in
the form of increased global cuts in spending. With
just under €4 billion worth of self-financed invest-
ment, the net borrowing authorisation is to be re-
duced to just below €5 billion and thus, despite an
improvement in the economic situation, only to
around the actual level for 2010. This means that a
continued surpassing of the borrowing limit is
planned – ultimately to finance the aforementioned
political objectives.
In response to the requirements of the Constitutional
Court for the Federal State of North Rhine-
Westphalia, a more extensive justification for exceed-
ing the borrowing limit was submitted.9However, this
is largely based on estimates of the output gap dating
from autumn 2010 and takes no account of the fact
that the outlook has improved again considerably in
the meantime, as concluded, for instance, in the clear-
ly dissenting new Joint Assessment submitted by key
economic research institutions. No link is drawn be-
tween the planned borrowing and the size of the out-
put gap and there is no explanation of the extent to
which the planned surpassing of the borrowing limit
is actually supposed to correct the presumed disrup-
tion.
To sum up, it appears inappropriate to conclude from
the data currently available for this year that there is
a severe disruption to the macroeconomic equilibrium
in order to justify exceeding the regular borrowing
limit. In addition, even a Federal state as large as
North Rhine-Westphalia would probably find it ex-
tremely difficult to give aggregate demand a suffi-
ciently strong boost if – on the basis of a dissenting
view of the situation – at the same time both the Fed-
eral Government and its European partners have
adopted a consolidation strategy which is, in some
cases, strict. For all Federal states with high structural
deficits, in fact, comprehensive budget consolidation
remains a key task in this favourable macroeconomic
environment. Failure to take appropriate measures at
an early stage could make it almost impossible to
comply with the constitutional requirement for a
(structurally) balanced budget without new borrow-
ing beginning in the year 2020.

Bond market
In February 2011, the issue volume in the
German bond market decreased to €114.2
billion, compared with gross issuance of
€154.2 billion in the previous month. After
deducting redemptions (€86.0 billion), which
likewise declined markedly, and including
changes in issuers’ holdings of their own
bonds, a net total of €38.3 billion was invest-
ed in the German bond market. At the same
time, foreign debt instruments in the amount
of €8.6 billion net were sold. The volume of
outstanding debt securities in Germany thus
increased by €46.9 billion in the reporting
month, compared with €23.0 billion in the
previous month.German credit institutions increased their
capital market debt by €17.4 billion in the re-
porting month (previous month: €3.0 billion).
Issuances primarily included specialised credit
institutions’ debt securities (€11.2 billion) and
other bank debt securities (€10.1 billion),
which can be structured particularly flexibly,
as well as, to a lesser extent, mortgage Pfand-
briefe (€1.8 billion). By contrast, there were
renewed net repurchases of public Pfand-
briefe (€5.6 billion in total).
In the reporting month, the public sector
raised €12.9 billion in the bond market. Cen-
tral government thereby increased its capital
market debt by €12.6 billion. It mainly issued
two-year Federal Treasury notes (Schätze:
€6.3 billion), Federal notes (Bobls: €4.6 bil-
lion) and ten-year bonds (Bunds: €2.4 billion).
Furthermore, resolution agency securities
issues worth €3.1 billion were attributed to
central government in February. Meanwhile,
€3.7 billion worth of Treasury discount paper
(Bubills) was redeemed. The federal states ex-
panded their capital market debt by €0.3 bil-
lion.
In February, domestic enterprises tapped the
bond market for €8.1 billion in net terms. The
instruments issued were, on balance, almost
all bonds with original maturities of more
than one year. “Certificates” issued by non-
bank financial institutions and primarily
passed on to their foreign parent companies
played a key role in this context.

ors were the main net buyers in the reporting

banks acquired debt securities amounting to
€17.4 billion, purchasing domestic and for-
eign paper in almost equal measure on bal-
ance. German credit institutions, by contrast,
sold €3.2 billion worth of bonds, all of which
were issued by residents.
In February, German enterprises raised barely
any funds by issuing new shares in the Ger-
man equity market (€0.4 billion, compared
with €0.6 billion in the previous month). The
volume of foreign shares in the German mar-
ket fell by €3.8 billion. Shares were purchased
by foreign investors, who added €4.2 billion
worth of German equities to their portfolios.
Furthermore, domestic non-banks acquired
shares worth €2.4 billion. It was only German
credit institutions which disposed of equities
on balance (€9.9 billion in total).
In February, domestic mutual funds recorded
inflows of €6.9 billion. Specialised funds re-
served for institutional investors benefited
from this almost exclusively (€6.5 billion). Of
the mutual funds open to the general public,
it was mainly the mixed securities-based
funds and equity-based funds that sold new
shares (€0.3 billion in both cases), although
open-end real estate funds and mixed funds
also sold shares for €0.2 billion in each case.
However, bond-based and money market
funds repurchased shares worth €0.4 billion
and €0.1 billion respectively. In February, for-
eign enterprises placed fund shares amount-
ing to €2.6 billion on the German market.
Mutual fund shares were primarily purchased
by resident non-banks (€8.4 billion). Foreigninvestors acquired mutual fund shares worth
€1.0 billion net.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus – in unadjusted terms – of €8.9 billion in
February 2011 and was thus €1.8 billion up
on the January level. This was primarily due
to a rise in the trade surplus. However, the
deficit on invisible current transactions, which
comprise services, net income and current
transfers, increased.
According to provisional figures from the
Federal Statistical Office, in February the for-
eign trade surplus rose by €1.9 billion on the
month to €12.1 billion. However, after ad-
justment for seasonal and calendar variations,
it went down by €0.4 billion to €11.4 billion.
The value of exports rose by 2.7%, while the
value of imports climbed by as much as
3.7%. Seasonally adjusted nominal exports in
January and February, taken together, were
0.9% higher than the average of the fourth
quarter of 2010, while imports were 3.7%
higher. After adjustment for price rises, there
was a slight decline in the case of both im-
ports and exports.
In February, the deficit from invisible current
transactions expanded by €0.6 billion to €2.3
billion. The main factor was the deficit in-
crease in current transfers of €3.1 billion to
€7.1 billion, which was chiefly due to higher
government payments to the EU budget.

14billion in January. The positive balance arising
from cross-border factor income rose by €1.0
billion to €4.6 billion.
Cross-border portfolio investment resulted in
net capital imports in February 2011 (€35.3
billion) compared with small-scale capital ex-
ports (€1.8 billion) in January. This was attrib-
utable mainly to greater new investment
from foreign portfolio investors in Germany
(€42.4 billion following €11.2 billion in Janu-
ary), whose primary focus was on German
debt securities (€32.7 billion). They purchased
bonds and notes, in particular public-sector
paper (€21.6 billion), as well as money mar-
ket instruments (€11.1 billion). They also
bought shares (€8.7 billion). German invest-
ors, too, increased their foreign investment
portfolios (€7.1 billion), acquiring mainly debt
securities (€8.6 billion) and bonds and notes
(€10.7 billion), and here in particular public-
sector paper. They concurrently sold foreign
money market instruments (€2.1 billion). On
the other hand, they offloaded foreign shares
in the amount of €4.1 billion.
By contrast, direct investment again resulted
in net capital exports in February (€11.3 bil-
lion, compared with €8.2 billion in January),
with German firms channelling capital to
their foreign affiliates (€7.1 billion). Reinvest-
ed earnings accounted for a large part of this
(€3.9 billion). Additional funds flowed abroad
in the form of intra-group loans (€2.1 billion)
and fresh injections of equity capital (€1.1 bil-
lion). At the same time, foreign proprietors
withdrew capital from Germany (€4.2 billion).

in equity capital (€4.5 billion) in which theMajor items of the balance

17Effective exchange rates from financial market
data
Nominal and real effective exchange rates have, to date, been calculated mainly from trade
flows and goods market prices both in the academic literature and in economic practice. With
increasing financial market integration, however, the importance of international capital transac-
tions has increased, and their value meanwhile far exceeds that of cross-border goods market
transactions. This suggests that it would be appropriate to construct real exchange rates based
not only on goods market equilibriums but also on capital market equilibriums. Although first
approaches in the literature weight the currencies of partner countries that are included in the
calculation of effective financial market exchange rates according to financial ties, deflating is
still based on goods price indices.
A concept for effective financial market exchange rates will be introduced on the following
pages, with both weighting and deflating based on financial variables. The underlying idea is to
construct effective financial market exchange rates as an indicator of the relative attractiveness
of different countries’ assets. It emerges that the indicators of price competitiveness on the
goods markets on the one hand and the corresponding financial market indicators on the other
may diverge considerably at times. Consequently, they may well provide different information.
For instance, historically very high or very low effective financial market exchange rates signal
potential over or undervaluation of assets. In the past, such mispricing was at times aggravated
by speculative financial market players who expected current developments to continue regard-
less of fundamentals. This caused “speculative bubbles” that triggered, sometimes severe, tur-
moil on the financial and goods markets. Establishing effective financial market exchange rates
may potentially help identify the emergence of mispricing on national financial markets more
quickly.

18The concept of effective financial market
exchange rates
In calculating nominal and real effective ex-
change rates, the focus has, to date, lain main-
ly on correlations in the goods economy. For
instance, the weights used by the European
Central Bank to summarise the euro’s ex-
change rates against individual currencies to
yield the overall index reflect those currencies’
significance for the euro area’s external trade.
The real effective exchange rates of the euro,
which are derived by deflating the nominal ef-
fective exchange rate with the appropriate
price or cost indices, are used as indicators of
international price and cost competitiveness
on the goods markets. Temporary deviations
of the real effective exchange rates calculated
in this manner from their long-term average
can be interpreted as the relative price compe-
tition advantages or disadvantages of the indi-
vidual currency areas on the international
goods markets, which may affect external
trade. The relevant currencies are classed as
relatively under or overvalued in such phases.
The use of long-term averages as a bench-
mark is compatible with the concept of rela-
tive purchasing power parity (PPP).1This con-
cept states that the inflation differentials be-
tween two countries or regions are offset by
opposite changes in the nominal exchange
rate, ensuring that relative purchasing power
at home and abroad – and thus the real ex-
change rate – remains constant. Purchasing
power parity is based on the law of one price,
according to which prices for homogenous
tradable domestic and foreign goods on inte-
grated goods markets are the same acrossborders, provided the nominal exchange rate
is used to express national prices in a uniform
currency. Geographic price differences tend
to be eliminated through goods arbitrage.
While trade barriers (eg transport costs or
varying levels of import duties) as well as dif-
ferent indirect tax rates may prevent full price
equalisation and thus the validity of absolute
purchasing power parity, they are compatible
with relative purchasing power parity pro-
vided they remain constant.2
Increasing financial market integration has
heightened the importance of cross-border
capital transactions, whose value far exceeds
that of international goods transactions. In
order to identify and assess mispricing of cur-
rencies, one could therefore conceivably also
take capital transactions into account. Based
on this underlying idea, it would appear to
make sense to construct effective exchange
rates proceeding not only from arbitrage
equilibriums in goods markets but also on ar-
bitrage equilibriums in capital markets. Some
initial approaches have already been pub-
lished in the literature. In these, the curren-
cies of partner countries that are included in
the calculation of effective financial market
exchange rates are weighted based on finan-
cial ties. However, deflation is still carried out
using goods price indices in these models.3

19It is possible to go a step further and use fi-
nancial market prices for deflating, too. Thisreveals the correlation with uncovered inter-est rate parity (see box on page 20). Uncoveredinterest rate parity stipulates that the expect-ed returns on comparable investments shouldbe equal in arbitrage equilibrium, provided in-vestors are risk neutral. Based on a state ofequilibrium, in which there is uncoveredinterest rate parity, an isolated relative in-crease in the price of domestic versus foreignsecurities causes the expected yield on thedomestic investment to drop as compared tothe foreign investment, all other things beingequal. Uncovered interest rate parity is dis-turbed, which triggers substitution processesin favour of foreign investments, and yielddifferences tend to narrow. Adjustment cantake place through an alignment of nationalasset prices or appreciation of the foreigncurrency. Provided the fundamentals that de-termine prices – expected earnings prospectsand risk assessment – have not changed, allfinancial variables return to their originallevels.
When the foreign as compared to the domes-
tic earnings prospects improve – for instanceas a result of relatively favourable economicdevelopments or an asymmetric shock – do-mestic and foreign investors will restructuretheir portfolios in favour of foreign assets ifasset prices are fixed. The resulting restructur-ing of securities holdings in favour of foreignsecurities drives up their relative prices. At thesame time, as capital flows abroad, the do-mestic currency tends to depreciate. Giventhat earnings prospects have changed in thisscenario, at least temporarily, the effective fi-
nancial market exchange rate declines.
Assuming that portfolio adjustment has been
concluded in the medium term, and changesto the earnings outlook are primarily the re-sult of cyclical factors, the financial marketexchange rate will, after a while, return to itslong-term average. When looking at suffi-ciently long time series, the long-term aver-age should represent a good proxy for theequilibrium value of the financial market ex-change rate; it can therefore be regarded asthe benchmark. This reveals an importantparallel between relative purchasing powerparity for goods markets and uncoveredinterest rate parity for financial markets:while the former implies that the long-termaverage of the real effective exchange ratecan be used as the benchmark on the goodsmarkets, the latter implies the same for theeffective financial market exchange rate.
4In
arbitrage equilibrium, ie where interest rateparity holds, the financial market exchangerate remains constant.
The situation is different where a country’s
earnings prospects are more favourable thanthose of other countries over the long term –for instance as a result of a lasting productiv-ity or growth lead.

stances, capital inflows trigger a trend in-

5Temporary differences in the earnings situation, too,
can trigger a long-term shift in the level of the equilib-
rium real financial market exchange rate, provided they
are not offset by later, diverging developments. When
using long-term averages, this effect is taken into ac-
count incompletely and with a time lag. This suggests the
advisability of establishing uncertainty margins when
identifying mispricing and using variable time windows
when calculating longer-term averages.Correlation

20Financial market exchange rate and interest rate parity
Interest rate parity stipulates that, where
investors are risk neutral, the expected re-
turns on homogeneous domestic and for-
eign assets are equal in arbitrage equilib-
rium. It therefore holds that
ðWetþ1/C1Petþ1/C0Wt/C1PtÞ=Wt/C1Pt¼ðP/C3etþ1/C0P/C3tÞ=Pt/C3,(1a),
where Prepresents the price or the per-
formance index of a given type of invest-
ment (equities on the one hand or bonds
on the other) at home and P/C3the corres-
ponding price abroad. Wis the nominal ex-
change rate between the home country
and the foreign country, expressed as the
price of the domestic currency in units of
the foreign currency, as is customary for
euro exchange rates, for example. The no-
tations tand tþ1stand for the point in
time of the investment decision and the
point in time of unwinding the investment
respectively; foreign variables are repre-
sented by the symbol/C3and expectation
variables bye.
After some conversion the following ex-
pression is obtained, in reduced notation,
for the condition of equilibrium
Wt/C1Pt=Pt/C3¼Wetþ1/C1Petþ1=P/C3etþ1, (1b),
where W/C1P=P/C3represents the financial
market exchange rate.
Where investor risk neutrality is given, arbi-
trage equilibrium is achieved at preciselythe time when the financial market exchange
rate will not, in investors’ opinion, change
over the investment period. Equation (1b) is
fulfilled ex post when the real exchange rate
is constant, so that the long-term average of
the financial market exchange rate should,
over time, provide a useful benchmark for
equilibrium if the observation period is suffi-
ciently long and there is no indication of
structural shifts in the equilibrium price rela-
tionship for assets (or in the corresponding re-
turns).
A different situation arises when the domestic
and foreign assets are not completely homo-
geneous due, for example, to differences in
risk assessment. If investors attribute an earn-
ings or default risk to securities issued in their
home country and therefore demand a yield
markup for investing in domestic securities, a
risk premium (RP) needs to be added to the
condition for arbitrage equilibrium (1a).
ðWetþ1/C1Petþ1/C0Wt/C1PtÞ=Wt/C1Pt¼ðP/C3etþ1/C0P/C3tÞ=Pt/C3þRP(2a)
or
Wetþ1/C1Petþ1=P/C3etþ1¼Wt/C1Pt=Pt/C3þRPðWt/C1Pt=P/C3etþ1Þ (2b).
Investors receive a risk premium ( RP > 0)
for investing in a domestic asset at precisely
the time when the current financial market
exchange rate of the domestic currency
drops below its expected future value or
when the domestic currency is expected to
appreciate over the investment period.

21crease in the financial market exchange rate
– indirectly through asset price increases
and/or nominal appreciation – which means
that interest rate parity is not given, even in
the medium term, and the long-term average
of the financial market exchange rate does
not represent a suitable benchmark.
Permanent deviations from interest rate par-
ity can, however, also occur if risk consider-
ations play a role in investment decisions and
optimum portfolio composition depends not
only on the expected yield structure, but also
on the risk structure of international invest-
ments. For instance, investors will demand a
yield premium – in other words, a risk pre-
mium – for investing in domestic assets which
they believe have a comparatively high earn-
ings or default risk. A persistently high risk
premium is therefore reflected in a lasting in-
crease in the effective financial market ex-
change rate.
Calculating effective financial market
exchange rates
In the following, effective financial market ex-
change rates – based on the considerations
outlined above – will be presented for Ger-
many and the euro currency area. Bilateral
exchange rates will be weighted against the
currencies of the most important partner
countries to reflect existing financial ties. As
specific factors may influence investments in
equity and long-term fixed interest securities,
a distinction is made between stock market
prices on the one hand and bond prices on
the other hand when establishing effective fi-nancial market exchange rates. As when con-
structing goods market exchange rates, the
regional structure of the foreign assets and li-
abilities of the country in question is taken
into consideration when calculating effective
stock and bond market exchange rates.
The overall weight at which the bilateral ex-
change rate of the country under observation
– in the following, we will talk of “domes-
tic” – vis-à-vis the individual partner countries
is included in the effective exchange rate is
calculated as the weighted average of the
asset and liability weight (see box on page 22
for an explanation of how this is calculated).
The asset weight is determined as the per-
centage of shares (bonds) of the individual
partner country in the overall equity (bond)
holdings of all partner countries held domes-
tically by residents. By contrast, the liability
weight corresponds to the percentage that
the individual partner countries represent of
total holdings of domestic shares (bonds)
held by investors in the partner countries.
Data from the Coordinated Portfolio Invest-
ment Survey (CPIS), which comprises asset
and liability holdings in equities and bonds in
the securities portfolios of investors from cur-
rently roughly 75 countries, were used to cal-
culate country weights. The circle of countries
(25)6used here reflects more than 90% of
the global assets and liabilities documented in
the CPIS. Looking at the CPIS data, which are

22Method for calculating weights
When calculating effective financial market
exchange rates of country i, the bilateral ex-
change rates Rji
tmust be suitably weighted.
In the same way as when constructing goods
market exchange rates, the regional structure
of the corresponding foreign assets and liabil-
ities of a country are used. Since the weights
for the effective stock market exchange rate
on the one hand and the effective bond mar-
ket exchange rate on the other are calculated
using the same method, the general proced-
ure will be described in the following. The li-
ability weight of country jin the liabilities
portfolio of country iis calculated as its share
(wp
ji) of the total holdings of securities of
country iheld by the Npartner countries.
Here, the weight for the stock market ex-
change rate is calculated in respect of hold-
ings of shares and, for the bond market ex-
change rate, in respect of holdings of bonds.

The tables on pages 23and 24 show the overall weights at which theindividual countries are included in the stockmarket exchange rate and the bond marketexchange rate for Germany and the euroarea respectively. From a German perspec-tive, the United States (27.7%), France(15.4%) and the United Kingdom (13.3%)are most important for the stock market ex-change rate, while the Netherlands (13.8%),France (12.4%) and Italy (11.7%) have thelargest weight in the bond market exchangerate, with the euro-area countries accountingfor a percentage of 65.8% overall. In the in-dices for the euro area, which reflect its fi-nancial ties with third countries, the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom dominatewith a combined weight of around 60%(bond market exchange rate) and just under75% (stock market exchange rate).
Monthly bilateral euro and D-Mark exchange

Germany’s attractiveness on the financial
markets
The effective exchange rate based on stock
market weights and prices, a rate that can be
interpreted as an indicator of Germany’s
(relative) attractiveness on the international
stock markets, shows no clear trend over the
observation period (for the period from 1993)
(see chart on page 25). Deviations from its
long-term average were largely temporary.
Comparison with the indicator of price com-petitiveness on the goods markets shows that
while the two indicators display fairly similar
developments in the medium term, the share
price-based indicator is significantly more
volatile in the short term than its counterpart,
which is calculated based on goods prices.9
The indicator of Germany’s attractiveness on
the international equity markets marked
highs for a short period leading up to July
1998 and to end-February 2000, ie immedi-
ately before the onset of the Russia crisis and
the bursting of the new economy bubble re-
spectively, while the indicator of price com-
petitiveness – as measured by its long-term
average – indicates a neutral or favourable
competitive position on the goods markets.
When the effective financial market ex-
change rate reaches high levels, this indicates
– like the indicator of price competitiveness –
that domestic assets (goods) are comparative-
ly expensive and thus less attractive (competi-
tive) internationally.
As measured against its long-term average,
the German economy has recently also en-
joyed a slight price competitive advantage onWeighting for the euro area’s effective

25the goods markets, while German equity
valuations are relatively high. The increase inprices for domestic shares before the eco-nomic and financial crisis was driven bystrong global economic growth, which Ger-man stock corporations with their inter-national focus were in a particularly goodposition to exploit. Additional factors werethe economic revival in Germany and thesharp rise in the euro until into the summerof 2008. Following a marked decline – Ger-man enterprises were particularly hard hit bythe global economic downturn, and the euro,too, fell sharply during the crisis – the effect-ive stock market exchange rate has ralliedsince March 2010. In fundamental terms, thisrecent firming can be attributed to lively Ger-man economic growth and has, since mid-2010, also been buoyed by the revival of the
euro.
By contrast, the performance of the indicator
measuring Germany’s attractiveness on thebond markets is fairly similar to that of theindicator for price competitiveness on thegoods markets in the shorter term, too. Devi-ations are limited. This is because risk pre-miums and nominal interest rate changes onthe international bond markets of the coun-tries observed, and particularly those withinthe euro area, were long relatively unimport-ant. Like deviations from relative purchasingpower parity on the goods markets, devi-ations from uncovered interest rate parity cantherefore mainly be attributed to inflation dif-ferentials that are not matched by changes innominal exchange rates.

26diverged somewhat only recently. During the
financial crisis, the nominal depreciation of
the euro enhanced the German economy’s
competitiveness on the goods market overall
as compared to mid-2008.
Valuations for German bonds, by contrast,
appear to be relatively high as measured by
the long-term average of the indicator for the
attractiveness of German bonds. This is be-
cause Bunds are seen as safe and given pref-
erence in times of crisis, and investors are
willing to pay a premium for safety. By con-
trast, the government bonds of peripheral
euro countries, whose default risk is seen as
higher by the markets given serious fiscal
problems, came under pressure, and prices
fell.
Although economically plausible explanations
can be found for the deviation of the two ef-
fective financial market exchange rates pre-
sented here from their long-term averages,
caution should be applied before reaching
any sweeping conclusions. Financial market
prices are determined by a wide range of fac-
tors that are not explicitly considered here.
Long-term averages are therefore only par-
tially suitable as a benchmark, as outlined
above. This is evident in the numerous studies
dealing with the uncovered interest rate pari-
ty’s lack of empirical validity.10
Attractiveness of the euro area on the
financial markets
From a euro-area perspective, the effective
exchange rates for goods and financial mar-kets are more volatile than from a German
perspective (see chart on page 27). This is
particularly true of the indicator for price
competitiveness, which in the short term
tracks the movements in nominal exchange
rates almost one to one given the stickiness
of goods prices. The fact that the indicator
for Germany is comparatively smooth can be
explained by the fact that a large percentage
of German external trade is conducted with
other euro-area member states and is not,
therefore, affected by changes in nominal ex-
change rates.11
Unlike German equities, European shares are
only slightly dearer than their long-term aver-
age in an international comparison. A break-
down of the euro’s effective exchange rate
based on share prices into its components
demonstrates that movements in share prices
have a considerable impact on index perform-
ance.12The sovereign debt crisis in several
euro-area countries has therefore driven
down not only the nominal euro exchange
rate but also share prices – in particular of
banking stock – in the euro area, thereby
weighing on the euro’s effective financial
market exchange rate from the price side. By
contrast, the relative increase in euro-area
share prices at the end of 1999/beginning of

very largely dependent on share price movements. Effect-

282000 caused the single currency’s effective fi-
nancial market exchange rate to appreciate
perceptibly, although the euro has fallen in
nominal terms. This represents a major differ-
ence as compared to the index of price com-
petitiveness on the goods markets, which is
– as already mentioned – driven mainly by
changes in nominal exchange rates in the
short term.
Unlike German bonds, the valuations of Euro-
pean bonds are, on balance, virtually neutral
at present, as measured by the long-term
average. Breaking down the effective euro
exchange rate based on bond prices into its
individual components shows that it is – like
the indicator of price competitiveness – main-
ly driven by changes in nominal exchange
rates. The bond price ratio displays major
volatility only in the first phase of the observa-
tion period, roughly until 1999. During this
period, yields in the individual euro-area
countries still moved independently of one
another, which led to the interest rate con-
vergence process before the euro was intro-
duced. It is, moreover, noteworthy that in the
period after the launch of the euro, bond
portfolios in the euro area underperformed
those in the other countries under observa-
tion, as bond prices fell as compared to part-
ner countries and the euro eased. By contrast,
between 2006 and 2008, when talk of carry
trades frequently dominated the markets, the
bond price ratio and nominal exchange rates
moved in opposite directions. With the onset
of the government debt crisis in several euro-
area countries and widening intra-euro-area
spreads, the curves re-converged.Effective financial market exchange rate
and net external position
The correlation between the effective finan-
cial market exchange rate and important fun-
damental variables is particularly interesting
as an indicator of possible imbalances. Cross-
border capital flows are especially relevant.
The increase in international capital transac-
tions in recent decades has caused a shift in
the factors influencing exchange rates, which
probably goes some way to explaining the
often observed persistent deviation of the
real effective exchange rate from its
fundamentals-driven equilibrium value.13The
concept of effective financial market ex-
change rates could help to bridge the gap be-
tween short-term technical analyses of nom-
inal exchange rate movements and long-term
approaches that examine the goods markets
to determine real effective exchange rates.
The fact that changes in the effective finan-
cial market exchange rate reflect deviations
from uncovered interest rate parity is helpful
in this context. These can be explained, for in-
stance, by the existence of risk premiums; but
they could also be caused by changed earn-
ings prospects in combination with capital in
and outflows.
The correlations between capital flows, share
prices and nominal exchange rate fluctuations
have already been analysed by Heimonen
(2009) and Hau and Rey (2006).14A tendency

29was found for the currency of the country
receiving capital flows to appreciate and thecurrency of the country of origin to depreci-ate. Moreover, both studies concluded thatthere was a negative correlation betweendomestic share price movements and capitalinflows. It was, however, left open to whatextent this mechanism actually helps bringdown international yield spreads. A compari-son of price trends on the currency marketsand on national securities exchanges is need-ed to assess that question.
The above-mentioned studies use bilateral
data for the United States and its partnercountries, and are therefore not necessarilyrepresentative of the global capital markets.In addition, they are based on estimates indifferences (capital flows, exchange rate andshare price changes) and therefore allow noconclusions regarding the long-term equilib-rium relationships of level variables, whichmay also be relevant for assessing the sustain-ability of the current competitive and debtsituation. Here, an empirical analysis of thecorrelation between a country’s financialmarket exchange rate and its net externalposition may be useful.
In line with the above-mentioned papers on
equity prices, capital flows and exchange ratedevelopments, Bundesbank estimation resultsindicate a positive correlation between for-eign debt and financial market exchange rate(see box on pages 30 and 31). That meansthat the financial market exchange rate forcountries with a positive external position isrelatively low, whereas countries with a nega-tive external position (ie foreign debt) tend tohave fairly high financial market exchange
rates. The fact that (high) foreign debt in rela-tion to gross domestic product tends to be as-sociated with an above-average risk premiumfor investments in that country is likely a fac-tor. The existence of a risk premium can, asalready mentioned, also help explain persist-ent deviations from uncovered interest rateparity that has not been adjusted for risk as-pects as used in the concept of the effectivefinancial market exchange rate.
The empirical correlation between the finan-
cial market exchange rate and the externalposition – in econometric terms, the long-term equilibrium relationship between thesetwo variables – can also be interpreted interms of economies’ growth path. Thus, rap-idly growing economies should initially see anincrease in foreign debt combined withabove-average capital gains. As internationalcapital allocation adapts, this process should,however, come to a halt over time, and couldpotentially even reverse. According to thetheory of intertemporal balance of paymentsadjustment, the economic catching-up pro-cess in emerging markets is associated withhigh capital inflows, followed later by profitrepatriation by the creditor countries. Matureeconomies would therefore tend to have apositive external balance and comparativelylow yields on domestic assets.

15This hypothesis is supported by the empirical study by
Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, which finds a negative correl-
ation between per capita income and net external assets
for emerging markets, but a positive correlation for ad-
vanced economies. See P R Lane and G M Milesi-Ferretti

30Deutsche BundesbankCointegration estimate of effective financial market exchange rate and net external position
The correlation between the effective financial
market exchange rate and important fundamental
variables is particularly interesting as an indicator
of possible imbalances. The following cointegra-
tion analysis examines the relationship of the ef-
fective financial market exchange rate with a coun-
try’s net external position. The interplay of capital
flows and changes in the nominal exchange rate
has already been analysed in numerous studies, al-
though the external position’s valuation effects, as
well as domestic and foreign relative price develop-
ments, were not taken into consideration.1The es-
timate presented here incorporates these factors
by using the indicator described in the main text.
The panel study is based on the net external pos-
ition and the effective financial market exchange
rates of 25 countries, which account for more than
90% of the global securities positions documented
in the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Sur-
vey (CPIS).2The observation period covers the years
1993 to 2009. To calculate the effective financial
market exchange rates ( fineer ), the weights from
the 2004 CPIS were applied, and partner countries
were differentiated from one another, as were
equities and bonds.3The nominal bilateral ex-
change rates have been deflated based on the
MSCI performance indices for shares and bonds.
The net external positions in relation to gross do-
mestic product ( iip) are taken from the Inter-
national Financial Statistics of the IMF and the Ex-
ternal Wealth of Nations database by Lane and
Milesi-Ferretti (2006).4Panel unit root tests indicate that all variables used
are integrated of order one. fineer and iiphave a
cointegration relationship.5Taking the determined
cointegration relationships as a basis, a pooled
mean group (PMG) estimate was carried out using
Stata 11.0, as described by Pesaran et al (1999).6
The program defined and developed by Black-
burne and Frank (2007) called xtpmg was used for
the estimate.7
The estimate was premised on an autoregressive
distributed lag (ARDL) specification with one lag of
the dependant and independent variables
(ARDL(1,1)). The corresponding error correction
equation is
/C1fineer i;t¼/C11iðfineer i;t/C01/C0/C180/C0/C181iipi;t/C01Þþ /C14j/C1iipi;tþ"i;t(1).
The PMG estimator implicitly assumes that iipis ex-
ogenous in terms of fineer . The adjustment after a
disruption to the long-term equilibrium can there-
fore only be modelled by a response by the finan-
cial market exchange rate. Therefore, additional
estimates in accordance with the Engle-Granger
procedure are used as a robustness test. In this esti-
mate, the long-term relationship was carried out
with DOLS including one lead and one lag from iip
and fixed country effects. The estimates of the ad-
justment processes also take into consideration
one lagged value of /C1fineer and/C1iip.8The esti-
mated adjustment of the asset position is based on
the same error correction term as the exchange

31rate adjustment estimate. The results are shown in
the table overbelow.
Both estimates demonstrate a significant negative
correlation between the net external position andthe effective financial market exchange rate. An in-flow of foreign capital which causes liabilities vis-à-vis other countries to rise is thus accompanied byan appreciation of the domestic currency or a risein domestic asset prices in relation to other coun-tries.
The estimated parameters do vary considerably be-
tween both estimates, however. It is not possibleto make a direct comparison with the studies byHeimonen (2009) or Hau and Rey (2006) citedabove as the overall effect of internationally diver-
ging share prices and an exchange rate reactiontriggered by capital movements remains undefinedin their work.
Adjustment after a disruption of the equilibrium
takes place with somewhat of a time lag. Accord-ing to the PMG estimator, the loading coefficientof the financial market exchange rate is below20%. The error correction based on the DOLS re-gression does take place more quickly, but the esti-mated return of the financial market exchangerate to its long-term equilibrium is still considerablyslower, at barely a third of the previous year’s devi-ation per annum , than the high responsiveness of
the capital markets would suggest. This discrep-ancy can be interpreted as an indication that fun-damental adjustment processes are frequentlyovershadowed by short-term factors.
The lack of significance of a reaction of the exter-
nal position to existing over or undervaluations ofthe effective financial market exchange rate is pos-sibly due to the fact that transaction-related ad-justments to net foreign assets are accompanied bya change to the current account. This only takesplace if the real effective exchange rate for goodsand services also favours such a correction. As thiscondition is not always met, capital inflows in con-nection with the co-integration relationship pre-sented here must be regarded as exogenous.

32According to estimates, adjustment after a
disruption of the equilibrium between exter-
nal position and financial market exchange
rate tends to take place with somewhat of a
time lag. The estimated return of the financial
market exchange rate to its long-term equi-
librium is considerably slower, at less than a
third of the previous year’s deviation per
annum , than the high responsiveness of the
capital markets would suggest. This discrep-
ancy can be interpreted as an indication that
fundamental adjustment processes are fre-
quently overshadowed by short-term factors,
particularly as data on the external position,
which could influence investors’ decisions,
are only available with a considerable delay.
Adjustments of net external assets to an exist-
ing over or undervaluation of the effective fi-
nancial market exchange rate cannot be de-
rived from estimates; the relevant coefficient
is not significant. This is presumably because
the reaction of the external position presup-
poses a change in the current account, which
will only take place if the real effective ex-
change rate for goods and services also fa-
vours such a correction. As this condition is
not always met, capital inflows in connection
with the co-integration relationship present-
ed here must be regarded as exogenous.
This correlation between the financial market
exchange rate and external position makes it
more difficult to reduce pronounced current
account deficits, particularly if they are associ-
ated with high net external liabilities. As cap-
ital inflows will, ceteris paribus, cause the ef-
fective financial market exchange rate to rise,
the price competitiveness of the country inquestion should tend to deteriorate provided
not only asset prices respond, which would
be indirectly reflected in a further worsening
of the current account balance and additional
capital inflows. However, such a develop-
ment increases the risk of an abrupt reversal
of capital flows if investors start to doubt the
sustainability of the current account deficits.
The risks to the real economy and the
financial system associated with such a sud-
den adjustment suggest that implementing
stability-oriented national economic policies
at an early stage is recommendable.
Conclusion
The concept of real effective exchange rates,
which has proved a useful instrument for
analysing price competitiveness on the goods
markets, can also be used as an instrument to
evaluate international asset prices. With this
objective in mind, the IMF’s CPIS database
allows the exchange rates of partner coun-
tries to be weighted in line with the inter-
national structure of foreign portfolios. The
approach presented here expands on this op-
tion, which has been described in the litera-
ture, by deflating effective exchange rates
using asset prices rather than goods prices.
Therefore, the effective financial market ex-
change rate calculated in this manner reflects
even better the character of a relative asset
price.
It becomes evident that effective financial
market exchange rates (particularly on the
equity markets) differ at times quite consider-
ably – not only methodologically, but also inAdjustment

Looking at the past 20 years,the effective exchange rate for shares has, forinstance, at times even been inversely correl-ated to its counterpart for goods and services.Moreover, it responds considerably morequickly to new information than the equiva-lent metric based on much more sticky goodsprices. The effective exchange rate for bondsis virtually in sync with the usual competitionindicator over large stretches. However, itshows reassessments of country risk andchanges in investors’ risk appetite, which theother indicator does not. Overall, the effect-ive financial market exchange rate is a usefuladditional instrument with which to analyseasset prices. Moreover, it could, in combin-ation with other early warning indicators,also help to identify at an early stage funda-mental mispricing which is aggravated by
speculation on the financial markets.
Furthermore, a long-term (negative) correl-
ation between the net external position and acountry’s effective financial market exchangerate was demonstrated. Adjustment to thelong-term equilibrium after temporary disrup-tions is fairly sluggish – as measured againstthe marked short-term responsiveness of theinternational capital markets. In addition,corrections appear to come about largelythrough changes in nominal exchange ratesand international asset prices, while cross-border capital flows should be regarded asmore exogenous according to the test vari-ables in the estimates. This phenomenon isconsistent with the observation of stubbornexternal imbalances.

35The US labour market in the current cycle
Employment in the United States declined sharply during the recent recession and increased
again only hesitantly in the nascent upswing. Such pronounced labour market weakness is strik-
ing in historical terms as well as in an international context and is likely to have placed an add-
itional strain on macroeconomic developments in the past few quarters. A large number of
sometimes widely differing arguments have been put forward to explain this: in particular, major
advances in productivity, increased structural change, and financing constraints of small firms.
Nevertheless, none of these factors is likely to provide an adequate explanation of recent devel-
opments on the labour market. Productivity growth has accelerated considerably at times, then
only to slow down again perceptibly. There are no indications of a more rapid pace of techno-
logical progress. There is no doubt that some economic sectors and regions were more severely
affected than others by the recession. Overall, however, job losses were spread quite broadly
across sectors and federal states. Owing to their dependence on banks in matters of financing,
small firms probably suffered more from banks’ stricter credit conditions than larger firms did.
Even so, they were by no means more reluctant to recruit new staff.
So far, however, little attention has been paid to explanatory approaches that focus on enter-
prises’ strategy for lowering wage costs in the recession. The data, however, demonstrate that
the adjustment during the downturn was effected quite substantially by means of employment
and scarcely through wages. The newly acquired room for manoeuvre in the incipient recovery
was then used mainly for higher wage incomes and less for increasing the number of jobs. Des-
pite a high level of unemployment and sometimes even falling prices, nominal hourly wages
were persistently rising, which meant that there were no cuts in real wages, which might have
contributed to a clearing of the labour market. This is consistent with studies based on micro
data, which attest to a high degree of downward nominal wage rigidity in the US in comparison
with other countries. In Germany, by contrast, it was probably not least closer cooperation
between employers and employees which made it easier to adjust costs in the recession without
a massive loss of jobs.

36The recent labour market weakness
in a historical context
There has been a very marked development
in the US labour market over the past few
years: employment declined sharply in the
wake of the economic downturn and new
jobs have been created only very slowly in the
ensuing recovery. While real gross domestic
product (GDP) shrank by more than 4% be-
tween the cyclical peak in the final quarter of
2007 and the trough in the second quarter of
2009, 61/4% of all non-farm jobs had been
cut by the time employment bottomed out
nine months later than overall output. At the
end of 2010, the volume of goods and ser-
vices produced in the United States was back
up to its pre-recession level, but 51/2% fewer
jobs were needed for this than three years
earlier. This means that the labour market is
likely to have placed an additional strain on
the development of the economy as a whole.
This might also help to explain, above all, the
performance of private consumption: in con-
trast to earlier recessions, it fell markedly
during the downturn and was initially on no
more than a moderate upward trend during
the recovery.1
How sharp the labour market adjustment
was in the recession is made clear by a histor-
ical comparison. On an annual average, 2009
saw not only the sharpest rise in the un-
employment rate (3.5 percentage points)
since 1949, but also the sharpest fall in GDP
(-21/2%). Based on a simple linear regression,
historical experience would have suggested a
considerably weaker increase in unemploy-
ment given such a decline in overall output.2What is also striking, however, is the poor
performance of the US labour market by
international comparison. Whereas export-
oriented economies, such as Japan and Ger-
many, suffered a perceptibly sharper slump in
output in the wake of the recent recession
than did the United States, their employment
losses were more limited.3
Various approaches have been suggested in
order to explain this development, which is
unusual in historical and international terms.
In particular, major advances in productivity
as well as increased structural change owing to
the need for adjustment in the construction
sector have been cited as possible reasons, as
have – in view of the financial crisis – poten-
tially severe financing constraints of small
firms. Below, these propositions are scrutin-
ised in the light of the empirical evidence.
Moreover, a look at the adjustment behav-
iour of wages and profits sheds light on an
area which has tended to be neglected up to
now, at least in the economic policy debate.4

37Aggregate demand and uncertainty
Some observers believe that the weakness of
the labour market essentially reflects cyclical
factors. A lack of demand for firms’ products,
so the argument goes, depresses its need for
labour. All that is needed to revive the labour
market is a faster pace of aggregate growth,
as can be initiated by additional monetary
and fiscal policy stimuli, for example. Alterna-
tively, it is often argued that it is not the pace
of economic growth itself, but rather a high
degree of uncertainty about future overall
economic output that weighs down on enter-
prises’ demand for labour. In this case, un-
employment is likely to be considerably less
receptive to economic policy stimuli. It is
claimed that enterprises and households
were additionally unsettled by government
interventions and reforms, such as those
initiated in financial supervision and health-
care, for example.
Despite differing implications for the charac-
ter of unemployment and the success of
macroeconomic stimuli, both theories sug-
gest that the given identified strain is unlikely
to be reflected solely in the labour market.
Enterprises suffering from a lack of demand
or a high degree of uncertainty, so the rea-
soning goes, take account of this not only in
their employment intensions but also, first
and foremost, in their investment decisions,
too. After adjustment for differing average
rates and volatilities, there is historically a sur-
prisingly close correlation between employ-
ment growth and expansion of investment in
machinery and equipment, which held even
during the severe economic slowdown in thesecond half of 2008. During 2009, however,
firms’ real spending on equipment and soft-
ware moved on to a steep path to recovery,
with the number of jobs in the private sector
initially lagging far behind in comparison.
Therefore, in order to explain the no more
than hesitant improvement in the labour mar-
ket, one has to look not only for cyclical fac-
tors but also other influences that have driven
an unusual wedge between investment and
employment in enterprises’ decision-making.
Productivity and technological progress
The fact that employment has performed less
well than overall output over the past two
years points to a matching rise in labour prod-
uctivity. There was still a rise even if outputOkun’s Law

38per hours worked is taken as a point of refer-
ence rather than output per capita , which is
reminiscent of the “jobless recovery” of 2002
and 2003.5At that time, the faster pace of
technological progress, not least in the infor-
mation and communications sector, raised
the employment threshold to such an extent
that aggregate growth was insufficient to
create new jobs. Before this, a surge in prod-
uctivity during the recession year 2001 had
already broken through the cyclical pattern
typical of the USA.6Usually, the upward
movement in productivity weakens in the
wake of a cyclical downturn because, for in-
stance, enterprises hoard labour and thus de-
ploy it less efficiently for a time. In the first
few quarters of the subsequent overall eco-
nomic recovery, however, the foregone in-creases in productivity are rapidly regained so
that output per hour returns to its trend path.
The impression that there are considerable
parallels between recent labour market devel-
opments and those in 2002 and 2003 needs
to be corrected, however. In actual fact, re-
cent developments appear to follow more
the typical procyclical pattern rather than tie
in with experience at the beginning of the
millennium. This becomes even clearer when
looking at developments in individual years
rather than the cyclical phases dated by the
National Bureau of Economic Research
(NBER). For example, according to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics (BLS), hourly productivity in
the non-farm business sector fell, in fact, by
1/2% year on year in the final quarter of 2008,
after increasing by 21/2% during 2007, which
corresponds to the average rate for the
period from 2000 to 2007. By the end of
2009, however, hourly output had shot up
within four quarters by 61/2%, posting the
sharpest increase since 1962.
Productivity gains can be due to various fac-
tors. Applying a Solow growth model, the
BLS estimates, on an annual basis, to what
extent productivity gains are due to an im-
provement in capitalisation or a higher quality
of the factor labour. The remaining amount is
ascribed to a residual which combines the ef-Co-movement of investment

39fect of other relevant variables including, in
particular, technological progress.7According
to the current BLS estimate for the private
(non-farm) business sector, however, this
Solow residual, or “total factor productivity”,
showed virtually no change in 2009 com-
pared with the previous year, when it had de-
clined by 1%. By contrast, it increased by just
under 1% on average for the period 2005 to
2007 and even showed an annual increase of
21/2% in the period 2002 to 2004.
Instead, three-quarters of the 33/4% increase
in output per hour worked in 2009 was due
to higher capital intensity. According to the
BLS, this was the largest contribution that this
component has made to growth in labour
productivity during the post-war period.
However, the main reason for this was a
larger cutback in employment than in plant
and equipment and not a large-scale increase
in capital. For that reason, the surge in prod-
uctivity in 2009 is likely to be not so much the
cause of the weakness on the labour market
but rather a reflection of it. Even if the prod-
uctivity gains of the following year had been
driven to a greater extent by technological
progress, a persistent upward trend in private
employment has nonetheless now become
established. Fears of a repetition of the long
period of jobless growth in 2002 and 2003
have not been borne out.
Beveridge curve and structural change
In this connection, a lot of attention has been
paid to the Beveridge curve, which is a graph-
ical representation of the relationship betweenunemployment and the job vacancy rate. In a
period of overall economic expansion, the un-
employment rate declines accompanied simul-
taneously by a growing number of vacancies
so that the labour market moves along a given
Beveridge curve. If the matching process
between labour supply and labour demand
becomes less efficient, however – perhaps
because the unemployed do not possess the
required characteristics and skills owing to
more rapid sectoral and regional structural
change in the economy – there is an increase
in the number of vacancies without a match-
ing decline in the unemployment rate, which
shifts the Beveridge curve outwards.Cyclical pattern of labour productivity

40In 2010, when a development of this kind
was becoming apparent in the BLS data,
which go back to the end of 2000, structural
distortions were often identified as the cause
of the persistently high level of unemploy-
ment. Such a conclusion is by no means com-
pelling, however.8Indeed, a historical com-
parison reveals that, after the economy has
bottomed out in the United States, there is in-
variably an anticlockwise movement in the
Beveridge curve. This is due to the time lag
between vacancies being advertised and
filled. As a result, the number of vacancies at
the start of an overall economic recovery rises
faster than unemployment can fall.9
Heightened structural change as an explan-
ation for the sharp rise in unemployment and
the lagged recovery on the labour marketought to be reflected in clear divergences in
employment between individual sectors and
regions. No such dispersion can be observed,
however. In fact, the BLS diffusion index,
which measures the percentage of industries
with job gains or no change in jobs,10shows
that the change in employment in both the
recent recession and the subsequent recovery
was relatively broadly spread across sectors. A
quite similar picture emerges if one constructs
a diffusion index of regional dispersion, based
on the BLS employment data, for the individ-
ual federal states and metropolitan areas.
Many observers’ perception of increased
structural change is likely to be based very
largely on the importance they attach to the
downturn in the real estate market for the
current macroeconomic cycle. Even in 2006,
however, at the height of the boom in the
housing market, the construction sector’s
share in overall (non-farm) employment did
not exceed 53/4%. This seems moderate givenBeveridge curves for

in view of the peak figures for aggregate em-
ployment of 13% in Spain and 133/4% in Ire-

other sectors of the economy, the BLS – on

the impact of the recent housing price bubble
on employment at no more than 11/4million
to 13/4million additional jobs, ie roughly 1%
of all non-farm payroll employment.11Many
homeowners’ net worth is now negative
owing to the fall in house prices; the effect of
this on their mobility and thus on structural
employment is by no means clear-cut either.12

12In theory, it would be possible to put forward argu-
ments for homeowners’ negative net worth having both
a mobility-reducing and mobility-enhancing effect. Ultim-
ately, however, this question can only be answered em-
pirically. While Ferreira et al (2010) observe a perceptibly

outcome to faulty preparation of the dataset and comes
to the opposite conclusion. Nevertheless, this dataset

that the jury is still out on this. See F Ferreira, J Gyourko

Finan cial market parti cipants an d analysts from both 
private an d pu blic institutions always pay close atten-
tion to the Bureau of La bor Statisti cs’ (BL S) monthly 
estimates of non-farm payroll employment in the 
US. One important reason for this is the imme diacy 
of these data. BL S generally pu blishes its estimate as 
early as the ﬁ  rst Fri day of the month followin g the 
referen ce month. However, it is often overlooke d 
that these ﬁ  gures are merely a preliminary estimate 
an d that su ch timely pu blication comes at the cost of 
sometimes extensive revisions.
The employment estimates are base d on a payroll 
survey with a sample of approximately 400,000 esta b-
lishments an d thus rou ghly one-thir d of all non-farm 
payroll employment.1 Owin g to the early pu blication 
date, BL S has only between nine an d ﬁ fteen days to 
colle ct an d analyse the responses before pu blishin g its 
ﬁ rst preliminary estimate. Late sample reports lea d to 
revisions to the employment ﬁ  gures in the next two 
releases. Furthermore, sin ce mi d-2003 ﬁ  gures have 
also been revise d on the basis of monthly re-estimates 
of seasonal fa ctors.
If the a bsolute over-the-month chan ge in seasonally 
adjuste d employment is consi dere d, ie disre garding 
the dire ction of the chan ge, the corre ction from the 
ﬁ rst to the thir d – an d ﬁ nal – sample- base d estimate 
amounte d to 58,000 persons on avera ge for the 
perio d from the start of 1979 to 2010. Compare d with the mean a bsolute over-the-month chan ge in 
employment of 20 6,000 jo bs, this revision usually is 
indeed su bstantial.
More importantly, the dire ction of the revision does 
not appear to be ran dom. Base d on the National 
Bureau of E conomi c Resear ch’s (NBER) datin g of 
business cycles, the monthly drop in employment 
durin g perio ds of re cession was corre cted upwar ds by 
an avera ge of 17,000 jo b cuts from the ﬁ  rst to the 
ﬁ nal estimate. By contrast, durin g economi c upturns, 
estimates for employment growth were raise d by 
18,000 jo bs on avera ge. Hen ce, in general, the ﬁ  rst 
preliminary estimate does not appear to fully reﬂ  ect 
cyclical movements in employment.
This distortion has been parti cularly pronoun ced in 
the more re cent past. On avera ge, over-the-month 
job cuts durin g the 2008-2009 re cession were initially 
un derstate d by 54,000 positions. Conversely, durin g 
the ensuin g perio d of re covery, employment growth 
was a djuste d upwar ds by 40,000 persons on avera ge. 
According to the ﬁ  rst preliminary estimates, a total 
of only 715,000 jo bs were create d in net terms durin g 
2010. However, the ﬁ  nal estimates in dicate a ﬁ  gure

While the emergenceof unemployment in the wake of the reces-sions in the 1970s and 1980s was due pre-dominantly to large-scale redundancies, theincrease in unemployment in the early 1990sand at the beginning of the millennium wascaused to a greater extent by enterprises’ re-luctance to hire. In the recent downturn inoverall economic activity, however, large-scale lay-offs initially played a prominent roleagain. Economists see this as a distinguishingfeature between severe and mild recessions.
14
Yet, while the wave of redundancies recededduring 2009, the number of hires remainedat a very low level.
15
One popular explanation is that small enter-prises, in particular, are cautious about hiringnew staff because they depend on banks fortheir financing and tighter credit conditionstherefore put them at a comparative disad-vantage. The only relevant information onthis published by the BLS is to be found in theBusiness Employment Dynamics. The statisticsare available only at quarterly frequency andwith a considerable time lag but they do con-tain a breakdown of gross employment flowsby firm size. These statistics are compiledprincipally by analysing the official unemploy-ment insurance records, which at least meansthat sampling errors can be ruled out.

44size category.16,17In this respect, too, the re-
cent labour market weakness appears to
have been exceptionally broadly based. It
therefore seems appropriate to see a macro-
economic phenomenon – rather than disloca-
tions between businesses of different sectors,
regions or size categories – as being at the
root of the problem.
Wages and profits
The wage mechanism has an important ad-
justment function in the labour market. In this
context, a high unemployment rate should
have a dampening effect on nominal compen-
sation, because, for instance, it weakens the
employees’ bargaining position. Looking at la-
bour compensation per hour worked in the
non-farm business sector, adjusted for the
relevant value added deflator, falls in the real
wage in the USA, although rare, can indeed
be observed. But, especially in the past two
years – which were characterised by major
underemployment – real labour compensation
continued to increase robustly. Given stable
prices, wages would have to fall in nominal
terms to produce a real decline. In aggregate,
however, the national accounts data on cost
developments, which include non-wage costs,
show that there has been no cut in the nomin-
al hourly wage in the business sector in any
year since the statistics were first recorded in
1948. A clear negative correlation between
growth in nominal hourly earnings and the
unemployment rate can be established for cer-
tain periods, particularly from 1993 to 2008.18
This Phillips curve has flattened out completely
over the past two years, however, since thesharp rise in unemployment failed to prevent
further increases in the nominal wage.19
In order to investigate the question of
whether, and to what extent, downward
nominal wage rigidity represented a binding
restriction in the last recession, a comparison
with the deep macroeconomic downturns of
the mid-1970s and the early 1980s would
seem appropriate. With a maximum cumula-
tive decline in real GDP of 31/4% and 3%
compared with their respective cyclical peaks,
these are among the deepest recessions of
the post-war period. Nevertheless, they failed
to match the severity of the recent one
(-4%). Notwithstanding this, in some cases
there were considerable losses of real earn-
16See J Helfand (2010), All Firm Sizes Hit Hard during
the Current Recession, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Issues
in Labor Statistics, March 2010.
17Looking at the percentage of each firm size category
in gross job gains, scarcely any cyclical pattern is appar-
ent. At most, the percentage of small firms (with be-
tween one and 49 employees, in line with the classifica-
tion of the ADP Labour Market Report) increased slightly,
in fact, during the recent recession, while, as a mirror
image, the percentage of large firms (500 or more em-
ployees) showed a marginal fall. In the case of gross job
losses, however, the cyclical pattern is much more
marked with the percentage of large firms shooting up in
the recession.
18It is acknowledged in the literature that such a correl-
ation is only temporarily stable. In the long term, the Phil-
lips curve is vertical, which means that a given level of
underemployment is compatible with any nominal rate of
wage growth. See J Galí (2010), The Return of the Wage
Phillips Curve, NBER working paper, No 15758.
19Besides including non-wage costs, wage data from
the national accounts might give a distorted impression
owing to differing composition over time. Nevertheless,
other measures also confirm downward nominal wage ri-
gidity. In order to eliminate the effect on the observed la-
bour compensation of shifts in employment between oc-
cupational groups and industries, the BLS has specifically
constructed the survey-based Employment Cost Index
(ECI). According to this indicator, year-on-year growth in
wages and salaries in the private sector (excluding non-
wage costs) fell from +31/4% in the final quarter of 2007
to just +11/4% two years later, with the change remaining
positive even in the construction sector. Despite persist-
ently high unemployment, the year-on-year figure had,
in fact, gone back up to +13/4% by autumn 2010.Nominal wages

45ings, albeit in a strongly inflationary setting,
during the course of the recession. This isillustrated by the real hourly earnings of pro-duction employees in the private sector, esti-mated by the BLS on the basis of the monthlyCurrent Employment Statistics (CES) and theConsumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earnersand Clerical Workers (CPI-W).
20Fifteen months
after each of the earlier recessions began, realwages had fallen by 4
1/2% in 1974-75 and
1/2% in 1981-82; in 2008-09, however, they
had risen by 41/2%.21In qualitative terms, the
comparison is scarcely any different if otherprice measures are applied for deflating, espe-cially not if energy and food are excluded fromthe CPI-W basket of goods.
To assess the impact of the differing develop-
ments in real wages, the Bureau of EconomicAnalysis and BLS data on non-financial cor-porations’ value added, costs and employ-ment can be analysed.
22In a recession, firms
attempt to adjust their costs quickly to dimin-ishing sales. As some other costs are essen-tially fixed in the short term and their share invalue added increases accordingly, US enter-prises mainly reduce their labour compensa-tion in proportion to their nominal output.While this means that the profit marginshrinks perceptibly owing to the pressure ofother costs, the percentage of wage costs invalue added is largely constant. In the recov-ery phase, which is understood below as thefirst four quarters after the given cyclicaltrough, the ratio of other costs returns to nor-mal again. The profit margin improves con-siderably, however, because wage costs alsoclearly lag behind the expansion in nominaloutput. The recessions of 1974-75, 1981-82and 2008-09 all follow this typical pattern.

20Hourly earnings as shown in the CES do not include
non-wage costs and irregular bonus payments, but may
be influenced by shifts in employment between industries
and occupational groups. The ECI time series only goes
back to 2001. This indicator is therefore unsuitable for
the present historical comparison.
21The rather marginal decline in real wages at the be-
ginning of the 1980s should also be seen in the context
of the fact that the recession in 1981-82 had already
been preceded by a macroeconomic downturn in 1980.
By July 1981, the cyclical peak dated by the NBER, the
real hourly wage had already declined by 61/4% within
the space of two years.
22This definition of the business sector has been chosen
because the profits of financial corporations were subject
to severe special factors particularly in the wake of the re-
cent financial crisis.
23In a departure from the NBER dating, the second
quarter of 1981 is taken below as a reference point for
the 1981-82 recession, since the wage cost component
was temporarily exceptionally low in the third quarter of
1981. Furthermore, with July, the cyclical peak was set
by the NBER in terms of the month as early as the begin-
ning of summer.Wage costs

46If the same deflators are used as a basis, the
share of wage costs in nominal gross value
added corresponds to the ratio of real labour
compensation to output. Of the three reces-
sions considered here, the most recent one
displayed the least favourable pattern of pro-
duction with the sharpest decline in the
downturn and the weakest rise in the recov-
ery. Accordingly, firms initially had to make
the deepest cuts in real wage costs, too, andthen curb their upward movement most. To
do this, both the number of employees and
real wages per employee can be varied. In the
mid-1970s, both components made virtually
equal contributions not only to the decline in
real wage costs in the downturn but also to
the increase in the recovery. By contrast, the
lowering of real wage costs in the most re-
cent recession was achieved to a very large
extent by means of a massive reduction in
jobs. Furthermore, the cost surge in the fol-
lowing four quarters – with continuing job
cuts – was due solely to a renewed rise in real
earnings per employee.
These, in turn, are composed of the real
hourly wage and the number of hours
worked per employee. The latter are typically
cut down temporarily in recessions in order to
retain personnel. In this respect, the most re-
cent downswing does not essentially differ
from the crisis in the mid-1970s.24Neverthe-
less, real hourly earnings pushed up the share
of labour compensation in gross value added
by approximately 3 percentage points overall
during the last recession and the following
four quarters, compared with a contribution
of 11/2percentage points between 1981 and
1983 and 1 percentage point between 1974
and 1976. Most of this cost surge arose only
in the emergent macroeconomic upturn,
however, and was due in roughly equal parts
to persistent growth in nominal hourly earn-
ings and the fall in prices. All other things
being equal, if the nominal hourly wage had,Real average hourly

47at least, not risen further since the second
quarter of 2009, non-financial corporations,at a rough calculation, would have been ableto employ 1
1/2million more persons one year
later. Given unchanged real hourly earnings,the real wage sum would have been suffi-cient, in purely nominal terms, for 3 millionmore jobs. If employees’ working hours hadalso been maintained, the number of jobscould have been as much as 4 million higher.
Admittedly, such back-of-the-envelope calcu-
lations can provide, at most, a rough guide-line for estimating the macroeconomic ef-fects, especially as they leave aside the endo-geneity of the variables. Simulations usingthe NiGEM macroeconomic model, which in-corporates such mutual dependencies, makeclear, however, that downward nominalwage rigidities can considerably strengthen
the dampening of employment in the UnitedStates following a negative demand shock(for more details, see the box on pages 48and 49).
The adjustment of wage costs by US enter-
prises over the past years differs not only fromearlier periods but also – and even more mark-edly – from developments in Germany. Usingnational data as a basis, the BLS compiles anannual dataset comparing manufacturingproductivity and labour compensation trendsin 19 advanced economies. This shows that, at+5%, there was a similarly sharp rise in (nom-inal) wage costs per hour worked in Germanyin 2009 and in the United States (+5

On the whole, the macroeconomic data indi-
cate considerable downward nominal wage
rigidity in the United States. Given an initial
situation of price stability, such rigidity may
have played a much more important role in
the most recent cycle than in earlier business
cycles when the US economy entered a diffi-
cult economic period coming from an infla-
tionary setting. According to studies based
on micro data, downward nominal wage ri-
gidity is especially marked in the United
States.25A whole series of factors have been
discussed in the literature to explain such ri-
gidities. Institutional obstacles, which may be
significant in other countries, are hardly likely
to stand in the way of wage cuts in the US.26
Instead, the literature focuses more on psy-
chological and sociological factors. Bewley
(1999), for example, advances the theory,
based on detailed surveys, that employers
fear the possibility of morale and, by exten-
sion, productivity suffering seriously from pay
cuts since these are perceived to be unjust or
even a hostile act.27,28By contrast, lay-offs in
the wake of a decline in sales are not felt to
be unfair and only impair the morale of those
affected and not that of the remaining per-sonnel.29In the absence of a cooperative so-
lution, the employer must assume that em-
ployees’ productivity falls in the event of
wage cuts. Consequently, the employer re-
duces the workforce, thereby making a deci-
sion which he sees as rational, but which con-
tributes to even greater losses of demand in
macroeconomic terms than if nominal wages
were cut.
The problem is different for the employer in
Germany. Even with regard to the trade-off
between wage cuts and lay-offs, German em-
ployees might come to different conclusions
about what is fair than their counterparts in
the United States. Above all, however, owing
to the important role played by labour unions
and works councils, German firms tend more
to have a cooperative solution available to
them in committing the workforce to at least
partially sacrificing wages, while maintaining

the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN), December 2009.
26As shown in a recent study by the Congressional
Budget Office (CBO), the hourly wage of low earners
over the past years has been considerably above the na-
tional minimum wage, which means that the latter has
probably had little perceptible impact. See Congressional
Budget Office, Changes in the Distribution of Workers’
Hourly Wages Between 1979 and 2009, CBO Study, Feb-
ruary 2011.
27Unlike nominal wage cuts, reductions in real wages
due to the erosion of price stability occur only gradually
and are not blamed to the same extent on the employer.
28More generally, efficiency wage theories postulate,
on the basis of various considerations, that there is a cor-
relation between productivity and remuneration and at-
tempt to explain why enterprises voluntarily forgo wage
cuts. See G A. Akerlof and J L Yellen (eds, 1986), Effi-
ciency Wage Models of the Labor Market, Cambridge

51productivity. Moreover, in an economy that is
specialised in exporting technologically high-quality goods, retaining firm-specific expert-ise becomes a more important factor in aneconomic crisis. Furthermore, redundanciesinvolve higher costs in Germany, and enter-prises are prepared to bear a contraction inprofits for a time owing to the favourable ini-tial situation and the expected temporary na-ture of the decline in demand. This temporaryacceptance of considerably lower profitabil-ity, along with job guarantees, may havemade it easier for firms to ask their employ-ees to forgo wages in return. Governmentassistance for short-time working, which isoften cited as a driving factor, provided flank-ing support to this solution, as did top-up
benefits from crisis funds.
30All things con-
sidered, precisely the lack of firmly anchoredemployee institutions as well as the high de-gree of labour market flexibility with regardto lay-offs may therefore, to some extent, ex-plain the nominal wage rigidity and unfavour-able employment performance in the UScompared with Germany over the past fewyears.

53European Council decisions on the prevention
and resolution of future sovereign debt crises
The current debt crisis in several euro-area countries has revealed the inadequacy of the existing
rules for preventing and resolving such crises. In light of this, on 25 March 2011, the European
Council adopted a comprehensive reform package with the aim of enhancing the existing
procedures. The guiding principle was to maintain the fundamental framework of monetary
union and, in particular, affirm the member states’ national autonomy for their own fiscal policy
as well as investors’ individual responsibility for their investment decisions.
Essentially, the Council resolved to change the Stability and Growth Pact, introduce both a
procedure for macroeconomic imbalances as well as the “Euro Plus Pact”, and to set up a Euro-
pean Stability Mechanism.
The overall assessment of the reform package is mixed. The reforms significantly expand the
prevention and crisis resolution procedures and strengthen coordination. Although the proposed
enhancement of prevention is a step in the right direction, the approach appears to be too
cautious, particularly with regard to the Stability and Growth Pact. The effectiveness of the
preventive measures still crucially hinges on the political will to resolutely implement the agreed
rules. In this respect, given past experience, the new rules do not inspire much optimism. The
decisions regarding the crisis resolution mechanism have resulted in risks being “communitised”
to a greater extent. Here too, the stringency and effectiveness of the procedures ultimately
depend primarily on the actual future implementation thereof. Some aspects have yet to be final-
ised. The outstanding decisions on these unresolved issues should lead to a strengthening of the
stability-oriented policy framework of monetary union, with better incentives for sound fiscal
policies and effective disciplining by the financial markets.

54The current debt crisis in several euro-area
countries has revealed the inadequacy of the
existing procedures for preventing and resolv-
ing such crises. The European Council has re-
sponded to this with a package of reforms,
which, however, does not affect the funda-
mental framework of monetary union. Thus
the no bail-out principle, in particular, has
been expressly affirmed and with it member
states’ national autonomy for their own fiscal
policy as well as investors’ individual respon-
sibility for their investment decisions. The re-
form package essentially comprises changes
to the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), the
introduction of a procedure for macroeco-
nomic imbalances as well as the “Euro Plus
Pact” (EPP), and the establishment of a
European Stability Mechanism (ESM).1Over-
all, the prevention and crisis resolution
procedures have been significantly expanded.
However, the stringency and effectiveness of
the procedures ultimately depend primarily
on the actual political implementation there-
of. In this respect, given past experience, this
does not inspire much optimism. With regard
to the issues still to be clarified and the
substantiation required, the fundamental
framework of monetary union should be
strengthened. The incentives for sound fiscal
policies should be increased and the condi-
tions for effective disciplining by the financial
markets improved, instead of extending the
“communitisation” of risks even further.
Reforming the SGP is essential to improving
the prevention of future sovereign debt cri-
ses. The key elements envisaged to achieve
this objective are a somewhat more stringent
sanction mechanism and a greater obligationto comply with the debt criterion. In future, it
will be possible to already impose financial
sanctions under the preventive arm of the
pact – although only in the form of interest-
bearing deposits. Overall, SGP sanctions can
therefore be gradually stepped up from in-
creased reporting requirements first to
interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing de-
posits and then to fines. Although the Euro-
pean Commission will, at times, have a some-
what greater say in the decision-making pro-
cess in future as a result of modifications to
some Council voting rules, the Council will
still have the last word, meaning that there
has been no significant increase in automati-
city. Furthermore, details of the debt criterion
have been specified. However, owing to nu-
merous exceptions, it is doubtful whether it
will be more binding. Moreover, the fact that
the deficit criterion is to be eased vis-à-vis the
existing rules if the debt ratio falls below the
reference value should be viewed critically.
Although the European Council’s reform
plans still have to be negotiated with the
European Parliament before they are adopted
by June, overall there is a risk of the reform
turning out to be too cautious.2The effect-
iveness of the rules will continue to hinge on
the political will to apply them strictly.
In addition, the stability of the euro area is to
be safeguarded, first, by introducing a pro-

tions can be found in annex II. The procedure for macro-
economic imbalances and the changes to the SGP are to

pean Parliament by June.

55cedure for macroeconomic imbalances on
the basis of Article 121 (4) of the Treaty onthe Functioning of the European Union(TFEU) and, second, by the EPP, a politicalagreement concluded by the Heads of Stateor Government of the euro-area countriesand other member states that have not intro-duced the euro as legal tender. The newUnion-law-based procedure for macroeco-nomic imbalances is, in principle, a sensibleaddition to the SGP, which focuses on fiscalpolicy. It consists of two stages. The first com-prises an early warning system based on alimited number of indicators which are de-signed to detect external and internal macro-economic distortions at an early stage. If amore in-depth country-specific investigationis initiated as a result and this reveals seriousimbalances, the second stage of the proced-ure involves increasing political pressure onthe country to implement economic policyrecommendations aimed at correcting thedistortions. At this stage, it will also be pos-sible to impose financial sanctions if therecommendations are not heeded.
Going beyond Union-law-based measures,
the EPP, a political pact agreed by the Headsof State or Government, aims, in particular,at introducing reforms to improve competi-tiveness, promote employment and ensurethe sustainability of public finances and finan-cial stability. A further objective is to improvetax policy coordination. However, the specificfocus of policies remains the sole responsibil-ity of each member state. In addition to theeuro-area countries, for whom participationin the pact is compulsory, EU countries thatdo not belong to the euro area may also par-ticipate. Progress towards the objectives will
be politically monitored by the Heads ofState or Government of the participantmember states. In line with its politicalnature, the pact envisages no binding re-commendations or sanctions.
Since neither procedure alters existing com-
petences in the area of economic policy, but,as a rule, keeps them under national jurisdic-tion, the discussion should focus on problemcases that pose risks for other EU countriesand, in particular, euro-area member states.In so doing, measures that weaken high-performing countries should be avoided, asshould attempts at macroeconomic fine-tuning, which run a high risk of not beingsuccessful owing to diagnosistic problemsand implementation difficulties in the politi-cised process.
Furthermore, in order to avert a threat to the
stability of the euro area, the crisis has shownthat it makes sense for a crisis resolutionmechanism to be kept in reserve for contin-gencies in which the preventive instrumentsprove insufficient. However, the fundamentalinstitutional and regulatory framework ofEMU must likewise be observed here. In par-ticular, the incentives for member states topursue sound fiscal policies and the disciplin-ary function of the financial markets shouldnot be revoked.

56liquidity assistance to distressed countries
under certain circumstances. Financial assist-
ance (in the form of assistance loans and, in
exceptional circumstances, primary market
purchases of government bonds of the af-
fected countries) is only to be granted if the
distressed country complies with strict eco-
nomic and fiscal policy conditions. The ESM is
of an intergovernmental nature and will be
established by virtue of an international
treaty. Depending on the member state’s
legal provisions governing the treatment of
international agreements, the treaty may re-
quire ratification by the national parliament.
This is the case in Germany. The requirement
for unanimity on key issues resolved by the
decision-making bodies of the ESM means
that each country will have a veto right for fu-
ture assistance programmes, too. This is very
important, particularly for those countries
providing assistance. Furthermore, the polit-
ical agreement conferring preferred creditor
status to ESM loans means that taxpayers in
the countries providing assistance are pro-
tected to a certain extent against losses.
Moreover, from mid-2013 onwards, uniform
collective action clauses (CACs) are envisaged
for all euro-area government bonds with a
maturity of more than one year, thereby fa-
cilitating the involvement of the private sector
in the case of solvency problems.
However, some of these cornerstones of the
ESM have yet to be specified in detail and the
arrangements for a number of other key
points are problematic. During the course of
further implementation, it should be ensured
that the above-mentioned basic structures
are not impaired, so that incentives for soundfiscal policies and for disciplining by the finan-
cial market, which have in any case been
weakened in some important respects by the
agreements reached up to now, are not re-
duced any further.
Interest rates on ESM loans are to be set only
two percentage points higher than the fund-
ing costs of the ESM for the first three years
(to be increased to three percentage points
after three years). Compared with the pre-
miums originally agreed within the frame-
work of the European Financial Stability Facil-
ity (EFSF), this amounts to a reduction in
the price of assistance loans of around one
percentage point. The threshold for the
utilisation of rescue programmes is thereby
lowered and the incentives to return to the
capital market are reduced. Moreover, the
premium is now considerably lower than that
of comparable IMF loans – although these are
senior to ESM loans and are therefore less
risky. Furthermore, the rules currently envis-
aged do not rule out the possibility of the
ESM’s Board of Directors easing the interest
rate conditions even further. In order to limit
any misguided incentives due to favourable
interest rate conditions, it is all the more im-
portant to make sure that the conditionality
of the assistance is strictly applied and com-
plied with. The way in which conditionality is
already enforced in the existing EFSF is likely
to have a lasting impact on these incentives.
In light of this, it is essential that EFSF loans
are only granted if a credible and resolute ad-
justment programme is adopted and corres-
pondingly implemented by the country seek-
ing assistance.Important

57The mandatory participation of private credit-
ors in cases where there are solvency prob-lems is a key element in order to curb the ex-pectation of fiscal policymakers and financialmarket players that the debt will be assumedby a third party, and thereby maintain the dis-ciplinary function of the market.
4In the case
of solvency problems, any assistance providedwithout the mandatory participation of pri-vate creditors could contravene the no bail-out provision, and transfers to beneficiarycountries and financial investors would beeven greater than in the case of liquidity as-sistance. With regard to the involvement ofprivate creditors in establishing fundamentalfiscal sustainability, the agreement that hasnow been reached appears less clear than thedecisions made in December 2010. There-fore, before the agreement is concluded, itshould be ensured in no uncertain terms that,in addition to consolidation measures, solv-ency is made a mandatory prerequisite forthe provision of assistance and, if necessary,is to be re-established by involving privatecreditors to an appropriate extent.
The decision of the European Council does
not envisage any secondary market purchasesto support countries with financial problems.However, it has not yet been explicitly de-fined how the capital contributions to theESM in the amount of €80 billion are to be in-vested. If secondary market purchases are tobe dismissed as a possible means of providingassistance,
5a provision stating that ESM
funds may only be invested in paper with afirst-class credit rating would be required.Moreover, it is surprising that the Board ofDirectors of the ESM appears to have beengiven considerable room for manoeuvre to
make unspecified changes to the ESM’srange of instruments. Whether any futurechanges will need to be endorsed by the re-spective parliaments will depend on whatform the national ratification documentstake.
Furthermore, the current decisions do not
specify transparent rules for the primary mar-ket purchase instrument. It is therefore un-clear whether these can be used as an exten-sion of the support provided and thus be sub-ject to more lenient conditions than other fi-nancial assistance measures. If this possibilityis to be ruled out, it should be stipulated thatboth the mandatory conditionality and thepreferred creditor status for ESM loans applyin equal measure to primary market pur-chases. Furthermore, it should be stated thatassistance provided by means of primary mar-ket purchases may also not be used for any-thing more than financing deficits and refi-nancing maturing debt instruments. Thisframework should not be extended to permitsovereign debt buybacks on the secondarymarket by the beneficiary country.
Furthermore, it is important to define the ap-
plication of the respective majority votingrules in the ESM’s Board of Directors and

58Board of Governors. It seems sensible for
unanimity or a qualified majority (80% of the
weighted votes) to be required for all import-
ant decisions. So as to avoid a conflict of
interests, it appears necessary for those mem-
ber states that are already receiving or are in
the process of applying for assistance not to
be given voting rights, as is currently the case
for unanimous decisions made within the
framework of the EFSF. In this context, no
clear upper limit appears to have been set
for the individual countries’ total amount of
liability. With regard to the capital contribu-
tions, in the case of losses, the ESM’s Board
of Directors appears to require only a simple
majority to call in additional contributions or,
in individual cases, these contributions may
be called in automatically and a subsequent
rise in the national liability limit is not clearly
ruled out.
The planned CACs, which are to facilitate the
participation of the private sector in crisis
resolution measures, will not apply to govern-ment bonds with a maturity of less than one
year. This restriction encourages the issuance
of short-term debt securities, although, ac-
cording to the conclusions of the European
Council last December, a greater emphasis is
to be placed on paper with medium to long-
term maturities. In principle, CACs should be
included in all government debt instruments
and not be limited to bonds. The involvement
of the private sector could also be facilitated
by a procedure that has yet to be developed,
which would provide more detailed regula-
tion on how to deal with government solv-
ency problems in general.
To ensure that the participation of the private
sector is as smooth as possible, it is also
important that the ESM is complemented
by appropriate financial market regulation
that noticeably reduces the risk of systemic
problems for financial market players and
thereby limits as far as possible the need for
governmental intervention in this sector.More
