5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a wholeAccording to Federal Statistical Office data,
gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourthquarter of 2003 was 0.2% up on the preced-ing three-month period after adjustment forseasonal and working-day variations. The cyc-lical improvement, which began after mid-year, therefore continued in the last fewmonths of 2003, but remained subdued. Atall events, the decline in overall output duringthe first half of 2003 was offset, with outputmatching its level at the end of 2002.
Fixed investment made the main contribution
to the slight growth, showing an increase onthe previous period in seasonally adjustedterms after an extended negative period.Added to this was the fact that there werehardly any further reductions in overall inven-tories. Export activity held up at a high level.Nevertheless, imports – especially of com-modities and inputs – were also expanded inthe fourth quarter. There was a marked de-cline in real net exports. Private consumptionwas also on the decline, being more than 1%down on its level at the start of 2003 andshowing no signs of a turnaround in early2004 either. Retail sales did recover in Janu-ary, but the figure in the last two months of2003 had been decidedly low. The develop-ment at the beginning of the year thereforesignifies no more than a return to normal.GDP

6Industry
The cyclical improvement in industry firmed
up at the start of 2004, even though season-ally adjusted incoming orders in January weresomewhat down on December. There was anexceptional accumulation of major orders inthat month, however, which could hardly beexpected to be repeated. The average volumeof orders in the period from October toDecember was largely matched in Januaryand was around 1
3/C254% up on the year. Minus
rates had been posted in the second andthird quarters of last year.
The performance in terms of export orders
was comparatively good, with the level beingslightly up on the final quarter of last year inseasonally adjusted terms, even though therehad been a surge of fairly large-scale orders inDecember. The intake of orders was up 2
1/C252%
on the year. By contrast, domestic demand fellback somewhat. Although the seasonally ad-justed domestic order intake was higher thanin the first nine months of 2003, it failed tomatch the strong showing in the fourth quar-ter. Year-on-year growth was just over 1%.
Industrial output was stepped up sharply in
the fourth quarter of 2003 and, according tothe currently available data, showed a furtherslight seasonally adjusted increase in January.A downward adjustment has to be expected,however. This will probably result in a broaddegree of parity with the last few months of2003. It should be noted that renovationwork brought production in one major plantin the motor industry almost to a standstill atthe start of this year, with work having beenperformed in advance in December. Overalloutput in January was 2
1/C254% up on the year.
Construction
The end of 2003 and early 2004 failed to
show signs of a turn for the better in con-struction. The level of new orders fell inNovember and declined further in seasonallyadjusted terms in December. In the fourthquarter as a whole, new orders were not onlydown on the level of the summer months butalso clearly down on the year at somewhatover -8%.
The decline would have been even sharper if
the cutbacks in assistance, which were sched-uled to enter into force at the start of 2004,had not led to an increased volume of newOverall economic growth

7orders for housing construction in autumn. In
many cases, orders were brought forwardwhich will be lacking this year. Industrial andpublic sector construction were trendingdownwards in the last few months of 2003.The year-on-year decline in the industrial sec-tor continued to be in double figures. In thecase of public clients, the figure was down6
1/C254% in the fourth quarter.
Construction output was quite buoyant in
December but was cut back significantly inJanuary 2004. Unfavourable weather is likelyto have played a part in this. In seasonally ad-justed terms, construction activity was 4
3/C254%
down on the average level of the final quarterof 2003. This gives a year-on-year decline of8
1/C252%. Given the poor order situation, it
seems questionable whether the productionlosses will be offset in the coming months.
Labour marketThe labour market situation remained un-
favourable with a further decline in employ-ment in December. The pace of the declinehas become much slower, however. Accord-ing to an initial estimate by the Federal Statis-tical Office, the seasonally adjusted numberof persons in work fell to 38.21 million inDecember. This was 175,000, or 0.5%, lowerthan in the comparable period of 2002. Onan average of the third quarter, the declinehad been as much as 1.0%.
There was quite a sharp increase in un-
employment in February. At the end of themonth, seasonally adjusted, 4.29 million per-sons were registered as unemployed with theEconomic conditions in Germany*

8Federal Employment Agency. This was just
over 25,000 more than in January. The sea-sonally adjusted unemployment rate as calcu-lated by the Federal Employment Agency was10.3%. The figure using the standardisedEU method was 9.3%.
The fact that the latest unemployment figure
was still lower than for December 2003 hasto do with a change in methodology. Sincethe beginning of the year, persons taking partin aptitude tests and training measures haveno longer been counted as being un-employed. This affects around 90,000 per-sons (not seasonally adjusted).
PricesPrice developments became calmer again in
February. Following a surge in prices at thestart of the year in the wake of the healthcarereform, consumer prices remained almost un-changed in seasonally adjusted terms at theend of the period under review. The year-on-year rate of increase went down from 1.2%to 0.9%. Firstly, this owed something tomarked reductions in the prices of heating oiland seasonal food products. Secondly, indus-trial goods did not become more expensive inFebruary. Services cost more than before,however.
Import prices remained largely unchanged in
seasonally adjusted terms in January, with theyear-on-year fall increasing to 3.1%. Therewas a marked fall in seasonally adjusted in-dustrial factory gate prices on the domesticmarkets in January, which were no more than0.2% up on the year. On an average of thelast three months of 2003, the increase had
been 1.8%.
Public finances
Indebtedness of central, state and
local government
At the end of 2003, the indebtedness of gen-
eral government (central, state and localgovernment plus social security funds), asdefined by the Maastricht Treaty, totalled31,366 billion or 64.2% of gross domestic
product (GDP). Compared with 2002, whenpublic debt had already exceeded the 60%reference value, this represents a steep rise ofalmost 3
1/C252percentage points, which reflected
not only the high deficits but also the ex-tremely low level of growth in nominal GDP .In terms of debt structure, the emphasiscontinued to move away from unsecuritisedborrowing towards securities, their share inthe overall indebtedness climbing by just over1 percentage point to 67
1/C252%. Measured by
original maturity, the share of short-term se-curities and direct borrowing (with a maturityof up to one year) rose by
3/C254percentage
point to 51/C252%. This reflects a further increase
in the outstanding amount of Federal Treas-ury discount paper (Bubills) and, in particular,the sharp rise in local government cash ad-vances, which are actually only intended tocover short-term liquidity shortages but haverecently come to constitute almost one-sixthof total local government indebtedness.

9of the overall indebtedness), increased once
again in 2003 following a marked decline inthe two preceding years owing to the eurochangeover.
At the beginning of the year, the liabilities of
central, state and local government surged by321 billion, of which 318.2 billion was attrib-
utable to central government alone, whichborrowed 31.9 billion on the money market
and 316.3 billion net on the capital market.
As is customary, bond issues featured promin-ently in January, when 312.0 billion net
was raised by this means. 37.4 billion was
generated through the topping-up of theend-October issue of ten-year Bunds with a4.25% coupon; 30.2 billion of this was for-
warded to the German Unity Fund. A further34.5 billion was raised via a new tranche of
the thirty-year Bund issue that was launchedin January 2003. While the 4.75% interestrate granted twelves months previously hadattracted a price premium, the same bondsnow sold at a significant discount of 2.52%.In the case of a top-up issue of two-yearTreasury notes, which raised 34.3 billion, the
yield receded by 0.35 percentage point incomparison to that for the December issue.Including market smoothing operations, theoutstanding amount of these securities roseby35.0 billion. A further 34.0 billion was al-
lotted through an issue of Bubills, of whichthe outstanding amount increased by 30.7
billion, taking into account market smoothingoperations and repayments. By contrast, Fed-eral savings notes and loans against borrow-ers’ notes were redeemed on balance (by31.0 billion and 30.8 billion, respectively).In January, the indebtedness of state gov-
ernment increased by 32.8 billion, the bulk
of which was attributable to Baden-W/C252rttemberg, Berlin and Bavaria, which all is-sued sizeable amounts of Treasury notes. Intotal, the state governments raised 33.7 bil-
lion through such securities. By contrast, re-payments were made on cash advances andloans against borrowers’ notes (- 30.6 billion
and - 30.5 billion, respectively). As regards the
special funds, liabilities were reduced by 30.4
billion, primarily as a result of repayments onloans against borrowers’ notes in the case ofthe ERP special fund. Local government ap-pears to have marginally raised its indebted-ness once again.Net borrowing in the market

10Central government borrowing
In February, central government increased its
liabilities by 32.3 billion. While 31.6 billion of
repayments were made on money marketloans, capital market debt went up by 33.9
billion. In gross terms, central governmentraised 318.4 billion. The lion’s share of this
(37 billion) was generated through the new
issue of five-year special Federal bonds (Boblseries 144) with a slightly lower coupon of3.25%. The issue yield fell even more stronglyby almost
4/C2510percentage point to 3.4%. The
outstanding amount dropped by 30.2 billion
owing to the expiry of series 130, which wasalso issued with a 3.25% coupon. Centralgovernment raised 35.9 billion through a
second topping-up of a ten-year Bund issuecarrying an interest rate of 4.25%. In contrastto the January issue, the issue yield fell by al-
most
2/C2510percentage point, realising a pre-
mium of 1.23 per cent. Owing to repurchasesin the course of market management oper-ations, the outstanding amount expanded byonly 34.9 billion. The monthly issuance of
Bubills raised 34.0 billion, as in the previous
month. Despite 31.2 billion of additional pro-
ceeds from market smoothing operations,the outstanding volume decreased by 30.7
billion following a redemption. Outstandingholdings of loans on borrowers’ notes in-creased by 30.5 billion. The volume of Federal
savings notes in circulation declined sharplyonce again by 30.7 billion.
Securities markets
Bond marketAs usual, sales activity in the German bond
market picked up considerably at the start ofthe year. At a market value of 3120.5 billion,
gross sales of German bonds and notestopped last month’s level by just under 343
billion. After deducting redemptions and ad-justing for changes in issuers’ holdings oftheir own bonds, German borrowers tappedthe bond market for 319.2 billion, after hav-
ing redeemed bonds worth 312.7 billion (net)
in December 2003. In Germany, sales of for-eign bonds and notes raised a mere 30.9 bil-
lion net.
After having made only marginal changes to
its bond market debt in the two previousmonths, the public sector accounted for most(317.6 billion) of the funds raised in January.Net borrowing in the market by central

11The Federal Government alone raised 313.7
billion of this amount. It topped up a ten-yearbond issued last autumn as well as a 30-yearbond and two-year Treasury notes issued ayear ago. In January, central government re-purchased Federal savings notes worth 31 bil-
lion net. There was practically no change inthe amounts outstanding of five-year Bobls,Treuhand agency paper and paper issued byother Federal special funds. The state govern-ments ( L/C228nder ) issued debt securities worth
33.9 billion net.
Of private domestic borrowers, credit institu-
tions in particular, expanded their bondeddebt in January, mainly purchasing paperwith shorter-term maturities (up to fouryears). They borrowed funds totalling 33.3
billion after having redeemed 313.8 billion
(net) worth of their own debt securities inDecember. Public Pfandbriefe were redeemedfor36.8 billion while funds were raised main-
ly by issues of debt securities by specialisedcredit institutions ( 35.1 billion) as well as of
other bank debt securities ( 34.7 billion). Sales
of mortgage Pfandbriefe raised only 30.3 bil-
lion. German enterprises tapped the capitalmarket only by issuing commercial paper(31.3 billion). At the same time, they re-
deemed corporate bonds to a net value of33.0 billion.
In January, foreign investors were the main
purchasers of bonds. They acquired Germandebt securities totalling 323.1 billion after
having reduced their holdings of this kind ofpaper in the previous months. By contrast,both domestic credit institutions and non-banks were net sellers of German bonds.They sold 30.2 billion and 33.7 billion worth
of such bonds respectively. At the same time,domestic credit institutions purchased foreignbonds and notes worth 34.5 billion, while
non-banks reduced their holdings of thesesecurities by 33.6 billion.
Equity marketIssuing activity in the German primary equity
market remained weak at the start of theyear. No IPOs were launched. In January, non-listed German enterprises issued shares total-ling only 30.7 billion. At the same time, do-
mestically held positions in foreign equitieswere reduced by 35.0 billion net. On balance,
equities were purchased exclusively by do-mestic credit institutions, which added 32.7
billion worth of shares to their portfolios. BySales and purchases

worth 32.5 billion net. Foreign investors re-
duced their holdings of domestic shares by34.4 billion.
Mutual fund sharesIn January, sales of German mutual fund
shares increased by 31.0 billion to 35.0 bil-
lion. Most of the funds raised again accruedto specialised funds, which sold mutual fundshares worth 34.5 billion. By contrast, Ger-
man mutual funds open to the general publicraised only 30.4 billion after having had to re-
deem fund shares on balance in the previousmonths. The net funds raised by mutualfunds open to the general public at the endof month were fuelled in part by private in-vestors’ increased interest in share-based mu-tual fund shares ( 31.1 billion) and the on-
going net purchases of open-end real estatefund shares ( 31.0 billion). By contrast, bond-
based funds redeemed 31.1 billion worth of
fund shares. Money market funds and mixedfunds saw net capital outflows of 30.3 billion
each. Foreign mutual funds raised 33.4 billion
from selling shares in the German market. InJanuary, domestic non-banks were almost theonly buyers, adding 38.4 billion in domestic
and foreign mutual fund shares to their port-folios. German credit institutions, by contrast,increased their corresponding holdings by amarginal 30.3 billion only.
Balance of payments
In January 2004 the German current account
recorded a deficit of 31.2 billion comparedwith a surplus of 36.4 billion in December
2003. The main reason for this swing was asharp increase in the deficit on invisible cur-rent transactions, which comprise services,factor income and current transfers. By con-trast, there was an increase in the trade sur-plus.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the trade surplusamounted to 312.3 billion in January com-
pared with 310.4 billion in December 2003.
In seasonally adjusted terms, too, there was arise in the surplus of 32 billion to 314
1/C252bil-
lion. This was caused by a sharp increase inthe exports of goods (6%), which contrastedwith a somewhat weaker increase in the im-ports of goods (3%). In a three-month com-parison (November to January taken to-gether), there was a noticeable recovery inboth exports (3
1/C252%) and imports (41/C252%)
compared with the reference period (Augustto October).
In the case of invisible current transactions
with non-residents, the deficit went upmonth on month by 39.6 billion to 312.9 bil-
lion. This rise was due mainly to an increase(of36.9 billion net) in factor income pay-
ments to non-residents as well as to the in-creased use of cross-border services (+ 33.7
billion net). By contrast, net payments in thefield of current transfers declined in Januaryby31.0 billion to 30.5 billion. The main rea-
sons for the essentially seasonal increase infactor income payments were the large num-ber of matured coupons for public bonds aswell as dividend payments.Sales and

13Germany’s financial transactions with non-
residents led to large net capital importsthrough portfolio investment in January2004, which were partly offset by outflows offunds through direct investment and non-securitised credit transactions. Net capital im-ports as a result of portfolio investmentamounted to 314.4 billion whereas slight out-
flows had been recorded in December ( 31.2
billion). The main reason for the turnaroundwas that foreign investors on the Germancapital market switched from selling to buy-ing and added German securities worth318.3 billion to their portfolios. Non-residents
were solely interested in German bonds is-sued by private ( 34.7 billion) and, above all,
public sector borrowers ( 318.6 billion). By
contrast, they sold net amounts of Germanshares ( 34.5 billion), investment fund certifi-
cates ( 30.3 billion) and money market paper
(30.2 billion). German investors likewise in-
vested more again in foreign securities ( 34.0
billion compared with 30.4 billion in Decem-
ber), directing their attention towards invest-ment certificates ( 33.4 billion) as well as
bonds and notes ( 33.0 billion). At the same
time, they reduced their net holdings of for-eign money market paper ( 32.1 billion) and
equities ( 30.4 billion).
In the field of direct investment, there were
net capital exports ( 38.4 billion) in January.
German proprietors provided their subsidiar-ies domiciled abroad with investable fundsamounting to 37.4 billion, almost exclusively
in the form of loans ( 310.9 billion). Foreign
enterprises, on the other hand, withdrew netamounts of capital from Germany ( 30.9 bil-

15Public finances
in crisis – the causes
and the need
for actionIn 2003 the general government deficit
and debt levels in Germany reachednew highs. While it is true that the eco-nomic slowdown of recent years con-tributed to this development, the fi-nancial problems are primarily of astructural nature and can thereforeonly be overcome by following a de-termined path of consolidation andimplementing comprehensive reforms.Initial important steps were agreed lastyear. It is now important to resolutelypursue this path.
A sound fiscal policy which creates a
favourable framework and clear pro-spects is a precondition for highergrowth and employment. The fiscalconsolidation which this requires canonly be achieved by reducing the gov-ernment expenditure ratio, especiallyas further cuts in the fiscal burden ap-pear necessary in the medium term.The ageing of the population alsoposes a significant challenge for fiscalpolicy.
This article aims to provide an idea of
the scale and urgency of the problemswhich have accumulated and identifysome of the measures necessary. It is afollow-up to a policy document pub-lished by the Bundesbank one year agoentitled “Ways out of the crisis”.

16Pinpointing the problem
Problems in the field of public finances which
have been accumulating for a long time haverecently become manifest – partly as a resultof the three-year period of macroeconomicstagnation. High general government deficitand debt levels, the growth-inhibiting tax-ation and transfer regime, a federal financialconstitution which does not clearly delineateresponsibilities, the mass of regulations andthe foreseeable demographic burdens havetriggered an in-depth public debate aboutthe need for reform. Last year, in particular,substantial changes were agreed which willhave a positive impact in the future. Never-theless, further reforms are essential in orderto restore confidence in the sustainability ofpublic finances and create a favourablemacroeconomic framework in Germany.
In 2003 both the government deficit ( 382 bil-
lion) and the level of government debt ( 31.37
trillion) reached a record peak.
1They were
also exceptionally high in relation to grossdomestic product (GDP) at 3.9% and 64.2%respectively. Only twice in the history of theFederal Republic of Germany, in 1975 and1981, has the deficit ratio been higher (seeadjacent chart).
As a result of the sharp deterioration in public
finances, the deficit and debt limits agreed inthe European Union were considerably over-shot. Before the onset of macroeconomicstagnation, Germany had failed to fulfil therequirement of the European Stability andGrowth Pact to achieve a budget position atleast close to balance in the medium term,and in 2002 the deficit and debt ratios ex-
ceeded the ceilings set by the MaastrichtTreaty. In January 2003 it was therefore for-mally established that Germany had an exces-sive deficit. However, in November 2003 theEcofin Council refrained from implementingthe rule-based procedure initiated by this de-cision (as it also did in the case of France). Asa result, considerable damage was done tothe EU fiscal policy rules, which were drawnup above all at Germany’s initiative and con-stitute a key element of European monetaryunion.As a percentage of GDP

17The upper borrowing limits set by national
budgetary law were also clearly overshot.Last year new borrowing by both central gov-ernment and most of the state governmentswas well above the limit, linked to investmentexpenditure, specified in Article 115 of theConstitution ( Grundgesetz ) or in the largely
comparable provisions of the state govern-ment constitutions.
2The Budget Principles
Act, which was amended in 2001 to incorp-orate the European rules, obliges central andstate government to pursue the objective of abalanced budget. At local government level,the applicable borrowing limits laid downunder budgetary law were likewise overshotin many cases. As regards the social securityfunds, at the end of 2003 the fluctuationreserve of the statutory pension insurancescheme once again fell below the statutoryminimum level, despite the fact that this hadbeen progressively and substantially lowered.In 2003 the statutory health insurance institu-tions recorded significant deficits for the thirdyear in a row. In many cases the reserves hadbeen used up, resulting in borrowing forwhich there is no direct legal provision. Theadjacent chart illustrates the deficit trend atthe various levels of government.

past three years partly reflects the unfavour-able cyclical development,

18ed deficit in 2003 is estimated to be around
3% to 31/C252% of GDP . This means that even
when the economy recovers, the deficits willnot “automatically” disappear. Rather, con-solidation measures are still required to re-duce them.
Since the 1990s, the development of public
finances has been strongly shaped by Germanreunification. Massive government transfersto eastern Germany, which even today stillamount to approximately 4% of total Ger-man GDP , had and still have to be financed.This was initially done by resorting to large-scale debt financing, resulting in a rapid risein government debt in the first half of the1990s.
4In addition, the contribution rates to
the social security funds were raised, especial-ly for the Federal Labour Office, various indir-ect taxes were increased and a surcharge onincome tax and corporation tax was intro-duced (solidarity surcharge). By contrast,apart from the gradual abolition of the sub-sidies for Berlin and the area along the formerintra-German border, there was a failure tocarry out a fundamental review of govern-ment benefits and activities and to adaptthem to the underlying conditions which hadchanged as a result of reunification and theincreased international competition. Instead,the west German social security benefit sys-tem remained largely in place or was even ex-panded, particularly with the introduction ofa long-term care insurance scheme. Thesebenefits were also implemented in easternGermany, further increasing the need for ad-justment which had, in any case, been gener-ally underestimated at the time. The unbal-anced financing also led to a deterioration inthe underlying conditions for the German
economy compared with other countries.
In 2000 the public finance situation still
seemed favourable. The deficit ratio hadbeen decreasing continuously since 1996 andhad reached 1.2%, the macroeconomic out-look was regarded as positive and a signifi-cant rise in growth potential was widely ex-pected. In retrospect, this assessment provedwrong and the improvement in governmentfinances was only temporary. The exception-ally buoyant development of profit-relatedtaxes up to 2000 turned out to be an exag-geration and was reversed in the followingyears. Economic growth did not accelerate.Instead a three-year period of stagnation setin accompanied by a noticeable rise in un-employment. Despite a relatively small in-crease in expenditure, the structural expend-iture ratio barely decreased because the nom-inal trend-growth of GDP was also low. How-ever, the main reason for the sharp rise in thedeficit between 2001 and 2003 was the fallin the revenue ratio, which was partly due totax cuts, but mostly to a general weak levelof revenue.

The government expenditure ratio, havinginitially risen sharply as a result of reunifica-tion, has been decreasing since the mid-1990s. Nevertheless, in 2003, at approxi-
4Between 1991 and 1994, the general government def-
icit and debt levels were underestimated in that the Treu-
hand agency was not included in the government sector
in the national accounts. The cumulative deficits were
only attributed to the government sector upon the as-
sumption of the Treuhand agency’s debt by the Redemp-
tion Fund for Inherited Liabilities in 1995.

19mately 49%, it was still well above the aver-
age level that prevailed in the second half ofthe 1980s (just over 46%).
6Adjusted for cyc-
lical influences the difference is, however,more moderate. The structure of governmentexpenditure changed significantly over thisperiod. Particularly striking is the fact that so-cial benefits have risen sharply as a percent-age of total government expenditure (cur-rently accounting for 57% of general govern-ment expenditure compared with 48% in thesecond half of the 1980s). They are primarilyresponsible for the rise in the governmentspending ratio. The main factor was the in-crease in spending on pensions. This in turn iscaused by the general ageing of the popula-tion, which has become very apparent overthe past ten years, and the relatively highpension entitlements in eastern Germany duemainly to the adoption of the west German
benefit system in an unmodified form. Thiswas compounded by the sharp increase in la-bour market-related spending, rises in childbenefit and additional costs in connectionwith the introduction of the long-term careinsurance scheme.
The sharp rise in social benefits was accom-
panied inter alia by a declining weight of in-
vestment expenditure. Despite the additionalresources required for eastern Germany com-pared with the second half of the 1980s, theratio of investment spending to total expend-Average of 1985-1989

20iture declined by almost half to 3%. If the
consumption of fixed capital shown in the na-tional accounts is taken into account, netgovernment expenditure was in fact negativefor the first time in 2003. Even if this sharpdecline is overstated because of outsourcing,it remains problematic given the particularimportance of the infrastructure for economicgrowth. In addition to the decline in invest-ment expenditure, there was also a significantreduction in the share of personnel expend-iture from just under 20% to 16%, above allowing to job cuts in the public sector. Thiswas admittedly also partly due to outsour-cing.
The rise in social benefits poses a major prob-
lem for public finances, particularly as inmany cases the structure of the transfer sys-tem, in conjunction with the tax and social
security regime, weakens the incentive totake up regular employment, especially in thelower wage segment.
The total burden of taxes and social security
contributions – the fiscal burden – amountedto 41
1/C252% of GDP last year. Although this was
2 percentage points below its peak in 1999and 2000, it was still higher than the level inwestern Germany prior to reunification (justover 40
1/C252% in the second half of the 1980s
and just over 39% in 1990).7This was mainly
due to the development of social securitycontributions, whose ratio to GDP last year,at 18
1/C252%, was approximately 2 percentage
points above the level in the second half ofthe 1980s despite the fact that a growingshare of pensions has been financed out oftaxation since 1998. The sharp increase incontribution rates – from a total of just under36% of earnings subject to compulsory insur-ance in 1989 to 42% in 2003 – contributedto the significant rise in labour costs after re-unification and consequently to one of thekey macroeconomic problems in Germany(see adjacent chart). By contrast, after a sig-nificant interim rise (reaching just over 25%in 2000), the tax ratio, at 23%, is once againbelow the level reached in the second half ofthe 1980s, not least because of the tax re-form which came into effect in 2001.
A declining tax ratio alone is not, however, a
sufficient indication of a fiscal system that isAs a percentage of remuneration

21more conducive to growth. Rather, high tax
rates and complicated tax legislation withmany allowances and “loopholes” can leadto evasion and misallocation with relativelylow government revenue. In many cases, the“marginal fiscal wedge” on additional labouror capital input plays a greater role in manyeconomic decisions. Since the beginning ofthe 1990s, the marginal fiscal burden on la-bour has increased considerably more than itwould appear from the average overall taxesand social security ratio. Last year an unmar-ried average wage-earner (in western Ger-many) had to pay almost 64% of his addition-al gross income in taxes and social securitycontributions, 11 percentage points morethan in 1990. Furthermore, the tax regime forcorporate profits in Germany is still less at-tractive than in many other countries eventhough the tax rates were noticeably de-creased in the course of the 1990s and espe-cially with the 2001 reform (concerning themarginal fiscal burden see the box onpage 22).
As well as the high marginal fiscal burden,
the mass of regulations is also weakening thegrowth conditions. For smaller enterprises, inparticular, the “costs of red tape” are relative-ly high.
8Another factor is that the tax system
has become ever more complicated andopaque amid an increasingly dense mass ofpromotional rules, subsidies, and exceptions.For example, after German reunification,there was massive subsidising especially ofcapital invested in eastern Germany. A widerange of instruments were used, includinghigh special tax depreciation facilities and in-vestment grants. This system of incentivesand assistance was both voluminous and
complex and, moreover, brought about con-siderable macroeconomic distortions and avirtual erosion of the tax assessment base.
9
The “ecological tax reform” introduced fur-ther tax breaks. The reform of corporatetaxes, which came into effect on 1 January2001, also created new artificial tax con-structs. Instead of tackling the root-causes ofthe additional tax burden borne by businessesby abolishing the local business tax, a compli-cated alternative solution was chosen allow-ing the partial offsetting of local business taxagainst income tax.
Moreover, a federal system of public finances
which blurs the responsibilities of central,state and local government impairs the effi-ciency of the provision of services by generalgovernment. Extensive linkages within andbetween the different levels of governmentweaken their individual vested interest in aneconomical use of resources and in improvingtheir own financial strength. On the revenueside, the predominance of the general tax-sharing arrangements is partly responsible forthis. For example, almost three-quarters oftotal tax receipts are joint taxes (includinglocal business tax) in which various tiers ofgovernment participate. Furthermore, stategovernment – unlike central government –does not have any noteworthy legislativepowers to levy taxes, not even in respect ofthose taxes which accrue solely to it. This lackof autonomy goes hand in hand with a com-

22Marginal tax and social security burden on employee compensation
and corporate earnings
Last year an unmarried average wage earner (in
western Germany) had to pay almost 64% of his
or her additional gross income1in tax and social
security contributions, over 11 percentage points
more than in 1990. For single employees with
above-average earnings (just below the income
threshold in western Germany for contributions
to the statutory health insurance scheme) the
marginal tax and social security burden was as
high as around 71%, as opposed to just under
57% in 1990. By contrast, various tax cuts
brought the marginal tax and social security bur-
den for top earners down somewhat from its
1990 level to just over 51% in 2003. In this in-
come bracket, no social security contributions
have to be paid on the additional income but
there are no additional entitlements either.
Of the considerable increase in an average earn-
er’s marginal levy wedge, 41/C252percentage points
were accounted for by social security contribu-
tions. The marked increase in contribution rates
in the 1990s and the introduction of the long-
term care insurance scheme were reflected in
this figure. Most of the increase in the marginal
burden of tax and social security contributions is
attributable to income tax. By the end of the
period under review, an unmarried average
earner was having to pay around 29% in tax on
his/her additional gross income as opposed to
roughly 22% in 1990. The marginal tax rate on
above-average earned income rose even more
strongly, by nearly 10 percentage points to
around 36%. Apart from the introduction of the
solidarity surcharge, this was attributable to the
various adjustments of the income tax rates,
which tended to ease the burden at the lower in-
come levels and overall were far from sufficient
to offset the additional marginal tax burden aris-
ing from the progressive taxation of higher earn-
ings.2By comparison with other countries, too,
the marginal burden of levies on earned income
in Germany is very high. In 2002 the burden for
an unmarried average wage earner was the
highest in the OECD countries after Belgium.3
A specific problem occurs in the low incomebracket, which, given the high level of structuralunemployment primarily among unskilled work-
ers, is particularly important. Owing to the rela-
tively high social assistance entitlement (com-
pared with the negotiated minimum wages)
coupled with high marginal rates of deductions
from additional earnings, the incentives to take
up regular employment are still very limited,
even if the rigorous deduction regulations have
been relaxed somewhat and the criteria for
being able to turn a job down have been tight-
ened.
The earnings of corporations, which are more
exposed to international competitive pressures
than other types of firms, were subject last year
to an average marginal tax rate of some 40%
overall in Germany, comprising corporation tax,
the solidarity surcharge and local business tax.
4
In the current year, this marginal tax rate onearnings has been reduced by just over 1 per-
centage point owing to the fact that the tem-
porary increase in the corporation tax rate from
25% to 26.5% was reversed. The marginal tax
wedge at company level (ie excluding taxes paid
by shareholders) is thus considerably lower than
in the early 1990s, when it reached around 58%
for retained profits of corporations. Before 1990
– when the corporation tax rate was cut from
56% to 50% – retained profits of corporations
were even subject to a marginal tax rate of more
than 60% in all. However, the cuts in the tax
rates have not been enough to improve Ger-
many’s international position substantially as, in
response to the more intense tax competition
arising from increasing globalisation, other
countries had taken earlier steps to cut their tax
rates on earnings to a considerably lower level.
Even after the 2001 tax reform, marginal tax
rates on corporate earnings thus put Germany at
the top (after Japan) of the international league
tables. The effective marginal tax burden, ie
after taking account of the actual tax base,
was also considerably higher than the corres-
ponding ratios in other countries (such as Italy,
the Netherlands and the United Kingdom); cor-
porations’ tax-related cost of capital is thus com-
paratively high in Germany.

1In this review, this includes the employer’s share in social
security contributions, which is an additional part of la-bour costs on top of gross wages. The marginal burden isaffected to a certain extent by the leaps in the underlyingwage tax tables. — 2The average tax burden on the
earned income (including the employer’s share of the so-cial security contributions) of an unmarried average wageearner in western Germany went up in the period in ques-tion by 1 percentage point to just over 15% and that of anemployee with an income just below the ceiling for contri-butions to the statutory health insurance scheme by almost3 percentage points to 20%.

23plicated revenue-sharing arrangement which,
in spite of the new rules due to enter intoforce in the coming year, still virtually levelsout the differences in tax revenues amongthe individual states.
10Even if some kind of
revenue-sharing arrangement is necessary ina country with a federal structure, such ex-tensive levelling-out weakens the incentivefor individual states to strengthen their tax-raising efforts.
On the expenditure side, a clear demarcation
of responsibilities has been hampered up tonow above all by the fact that numeroustasks are financed by various levels of govern-ment. Such tasks include, for example, thejoint tasks pursuant to Article 91a of theConstitution. Central government influencesthe discharge of these tasks via joint overallplanning with state government. This co-financing of state government tasks by cen-tral government breaks the necessary linkagebetween the responsibility for performing du-ties and the responsibility for the associatedexpenditure, thus contradicting the connexityprinciple. A further criterion for federal effi-ciency, namely the principle of fiscal equiva-lence,
11is also disregarded, especially in those
areas where, in the context of conflicting le-gislation, the legislative powers have beenvery much centralised. This limits the discre-tionary leeway of the lower levels of govern-ment and consequently inhibits a more effi-cient use of resources and greater budgetaryflexibility.Major determinants of the future
development of public finances
Whether or not the German economy man-
ages to return to a higher path of sustainablegrowth and, above all, improve labour marketconditions will be of crucial importance forthe future development of public finances.A 1% rise in employment, or approximately340,000 more people in employment, would– if spread equally across all sectors – lead toan increase of roughly 35 billion or
1/C254%o f
GDP in revenue from social security contribu-tions and wage tax alone.
12
On the expenditure side, a decline in un-employment would noticeably relieve thepressure on public finances. Roughly 375 bil-

The strong influence of economic growth on

In this programme the Federal Governmentassumes that if there is nominal economicgrowth of 2
1/C252% in 2004 and 31/C254% in each
year thereafter, in 2007 the deficit ratio willstill be 1
1/C252%. If annual nominal growth were
merely1/C252a percentage point lower (higher),
the deficit ratio in 2007 would increase (de-crease) by a full 1 percentage point. This isbased on the assumption that a 1 percentagepoint increase in growth reduces the generalgovernment deficit ratio in the year in ques-tion by
1/C252a percentage point, or around 310
billion.
The mathematical relationship between the
different GDP growth rates and the longer-term development of the debt ratio, which isan important indicator of the state of publicfinances, is also revealing. For example, in thelonger term a deficit ratio in line with the 3%Maastricht ceiling coupled with nominal GDPgrowth of 5% would result in a debt ratio ofjust over 60%. If, however, nominal growthwere only 3%, the debt ratio would rise toover 100% in the long term.

25tained and there were 3% nominal growth,
the debt ratio would rise by almost 20 per-centage points to more than 80% within thenext ten years. In the long term it wouldreach almost 140%, with an ever larger shareof government revenue having to be spenton interest payments, which would crowdout other expenditure (see chart on page 24).Assuming the current primary balance (ie thebalance excluding interest expenditure) wereto remain unchanged in relation to GDP , fu-ture nominal GDP growth of 3% and aninterest rate of 4
1/C252% would lead to a soaring
debt ratio because of the “snowball effect”.On the basis of the assumed growth condi-tions, a reduction of 2 percentage points inthe deficit ratio would be needed simply tomaintain the current high debt ratio. A steepreduction of the debt ratio would require vir-tually balanced budgets.
A rapid reduction of the debt ratio is impera-
tive, not least because of the demographictrend (see adjacent chart). The current fore-casts for Germany indicate a major shift inthe age structure, with the share of the popu-lation of working age shrinking.
15The declin-
ing proportion of this section of the popula-tion can be expected to have a negative im-pact on economic growth. Apart from theshrinking labour force, it remains to be seenwhat effect a higher average age will have onthe productivity of employed persons. Positiveassessments based on greater work experi-ence are opposed by sceptical predictionswhich anticipate less innovative potential.Alongside larger-scale immigration, consider-able relief may also be provided by exploitingthe labour force potential more effectively,for example by raising today’s average retire-
ment age of approximately 60 years. How-ever, these measures can do no more thanlimit the negative impact of the demographictrend.mn

26In addition to its possible negative impact on
economic growth, the demographic shift alsoaffects public finances directly. This appliesmainly to the pay-as-you-go social securitysystems which are reliant primarily upon indi-viduals of working age for their revenue, withexpenditure being concentrated on the olderage groups. Both factors come to bear on thestatutory pension insurance scheme. Theclearest forecasts regarding future financialdevelopments can be made for this sector.Without the latest pension reform, there is adanger that the current contribution rate of19.5% will rise to well over 22% by 2030despite the fact that the pension level will fallsteeply. Thus, as the statutory pension insur-ance scheme’s yield inevitably declines, thefiscal burden will rise.
Growing financial problems are also foresee-
able in the statutory health insuranceschemes. However, in this sector it is less clearto what extent ageing will push up health-care expenditure. Age-specific spending pro-files certainly indicate that health-care costsare higher the older the insured persons are.However, it is questionable whether thisstructural feature can also be applied to anageing society in toto . For example, studies
indicate that healthcare costs depend less onthe absolute age of the person insured thanon the temporal distance from death. Irre-spective of the demographic trend, progressin medical technology plays an especiallylarge role in pushing up costs.
16This is be-
cause it is primarily concerned with newproducts and methods and less with cost-saving process innovations. On the otherhand, it is clear that the financing base of thestatutory health insurance scheme will be
narrowed as a result of the ageing popula-tion. In 2003 contributions per pensionerwere just under three-fifths of the level of theother members. These problems are evenmore acute in the long-term care insurancescheme. As the need for long-term nursingcare primarily affects the very old, the great-est financial problems in this case are still tocome.
The demographic changes pose the least
problem for the statutory unemployment in-surance scheme. On the contrary, as the la-bour supply declines, a fall in unemploymentcan be expected. However, given the highlevel of structural unemployment, it is by nomeans certain whether this will happen morequickly than the predicted decline in the la-bour force and thus cut the unemploymentrate.
A comprehensive assessment of the sustain-
ability of public finances which takes into ac-count the long-term demographic burdens isnot possible using conventional fiscal indica-tors such as the budget balance. For this rea-son, generational accounting was developedto determine the sustainability gap. This canbe expressed as an annual consolidation re-quirement. The consoildation requirement in-dicates by how many percentage points thedeficit ratio would have to be lastinglylowered to enable the fiscal position prevail-ing in the base year to be sustained over the

cording to the calculations based on 2003, ifthe reform measures which have alreadybeen adopted (but had no impact in the baseyear) are disregarded, the consolidation re-quirement amounts to almost 6% of GDP .This indicates that in the future it will only bepossible for the government to continue toprovide the benefits it does today if there is asharp increase in the fiscal burden. Even if theadopted reform measures which were not yetin force in 2003 are taken into consideration,there is still a consolidation requirement of3

duction was achieved last year (for furtherdetails see the box on page 28).
Need for fiscal policy action
Role of government in market economiesThe critical situation of public finances and
the big future challenges require a fiscal pol-icy which is oriented to the basic role of gov-ernment in a social market economy. Accord-ing to this concept, government primarily de-fines the framework for economic activity. Itis particularly important that the economicprocesses can generally be steered via theprice mechanism, which – wherever possible –is not to be limited or distorted by govern-ment intervention. Such intervention can atmost be justified by the existence of external-ities. Government also ensures greater equal-ity of opportunities and provides a social se-curity system. Furthermore, given sound pub-lic finances government can help to steadyeconomic growth in the event of economicfluctuations, notably by allowing the auto-
matic stabilisers to take effect. As a generalrule, government should only intervene inmarket processes in exceptional circum-stances and in a precisely delimited manner,particularly to allow sufficient scope for indi-vidual performance and responsibility.
Government activity must define stable and
reliable framework conditions but at thesame time create confidence in the imple-mentation of reforms if any adjustments arerequired over the course of time. In this con-text, a clear strategy and a constant econom-ic and fiscal policy course are the necessarybasis for the mostly long-term decisions ofthe economic agents. Overregulation as wellas complicated and opaque tax and transfersystems hinder private economic activity andencourage the pursuit of special interests. At-tempting to maximise fairness at the individ-ual level may be perceived as unfair in toto .
Reducing the budget deficits
in the medium term
Sound public finances are a crucial require-
ment for enabling government to perform itsduties continuously and investors and con-sumers to have confidence in a stable eco-nomic framework. In addition, they are animportant foundation for a stability-orientedmonetary policy. High deficit and debt levels

government revenue and expenditure are divided be-

the basis of the demographic trend. For a description of

28On the development of the long-term sustainability of public finances
The question of the long-term sustainability of
public finances can be analysed using the tech-nique of generational accounting. The annualconsolidation requirement derived therefromgives some indication of the change in the long-term fiscal burdens which are to be expected, inparticular in view of projected demographicchanges.
1The annual consolidation requirement
indicates by how many percentage points thegeneral government expenditure ratio wouldhave to be lowered or the general governmentrevenue ratio raised to enable the fiscal positionprevailing in the base year to be sustained overthe long term without any further changes.Changes in the macroeconomic setting ensuingfrom demographic trends or reactions to policymeasures are disregarded, however.
Two different scenarios are considered within
the context of generational accounting. A “sta-tus-quo-scenario” assumes that the fiscal condi-tions prevailing in the base year will remain un-changed in the future. The age-specific per ca-pita amounts for the individual government rev-enue and expenditure categories that are ob-served in the base year are kept constant – ex-cept for an adjustment for productivity growth.By contrast, a “policy scenario” captures policychanges which have already been adopted butwhich will take (full) effect only at a future date.This facilitates a more realistic assessment ofwhat additional fiscal policy measures are need-ed.
Under the status quo scenario, the annual con-
solidation requirement increased marginally lastyear to just under 6% of GDP compared with5
3/C254% in 2002. This deterioration was exclusively
due to the unfavourable cyclical development.Adjusted for cyclical influences and temporaryadditional expenditure to overcome the flooddamage, the annual consolidation requirementactually decreased by just over
1/C252percentage
point. This was partly attributable to the in-crease in contribution rates to the statutory pen-sion and health insurance schemes and in indir-ect taxes. On the expenditure side, central, stateand local government have pursued a stringentbudget management course. Furthermore, sav-ings were made, in particular, in labour market
spending. This was, however, offset by the factthat payments to the EU in 2003 were higherthan in 2002. In addition, revenue from social se-curity contributions grew more sluggishly thanwas to be expected considering the develop-ment of gross wages and salaries and the in-crease in the contribution rates and in the assess-ment bases.
Under the policy scenario the annual consolida-
tion requirement last year was noticeably lower,at just under 3
1/C252% of GDP, than in the adjusted
status quo scenario. This was chiefly attributableto future savings by the statutory pension insur-ance scheme. Moreover, cost-cutting measuresin respect of labour market-related spending,healthcare expenditure and tax consolidationmeasures will more than offset the tax cutswhich will take effect primarily in 2004 and2005. Compared with 2002, the sustainability ofpublic finances has improved to a remarkableextent under the policy scenario. The annualconsolidation requirement declined by 1
3/C254per-
centage points. This was mainly attributable tothe measures adopted last year but which willtake effect only in the future. Heading the listare the reform measures for the statutory healthinsurance scheme and labour market-related ex-penditure.
2Additionally, the cuts in tax subsidies
and the other measures adopted for the statu-tory pension insurance scheme have also made asizeable contribution.
Even though these figures must be interpreted
with caution, the results show that the measuresadopted in 2003 have significantly improved thestate of public finances compared with 2002.The dramatic increase in the annual consolida-tion requirement in the previous years – whichwas primarily attributable to the adopted taxcuts and the shortfalls in revenue from the taxeson capital income, turnover tax and social secur-ity contributions which exceeded these changesin legislation and the development of themacroeconomic assessment bases – was re-versed. Even so, the fiscal policy course last yearwas still not sustainable.

culating the results shown here, see Deutsche Bundesbank,The long-term sustainability of public finance – an analysisbased on generational accounting, Monthly Report , De-

29will restrict government’s room for man-
oeuvre in future years and may crowd out pri-vate investment. The increasing interest bur-den has to be financed by higher taxes orlower expenditure elsewhere.
The imperative of sound public finances has
no specific implications for the scale or natureof government activity but simply means thatgovernment expenditure must be financed byrevenue in the long term. If lower taxes andsocial security contributions are desired, thesealso need to be funded by cutting govern-ment expenditure. The scale and nature ofgovernment activity should ultimately makeallowances for preferences of the population.At the same time, however, the implicationsfor future macroeconomic development, par-ticularly in terms of international competition,should be taken into account.
The high (structural) deficit and debt levels
and the foreseeable demographic develop-ment necessitate a comprehensive consolida-tion of public finances in Germany – not leastin order to comply with national and EUbudgetary rules. This particularly requiresachieving lasting structural savings on the ex-penditure side. Given the already high levyburden, an increase in taxes or social securitycontributions would have negative repercus-sions for the overall economic outlook. More-over, international experience shows that,above all, consolidation strategies which arefocused on curbing government consumptionexpenditure are the most likely to succeed.Fiscal consolidation is required at all levels ofgovernment. The largest proportion of thegovernment deficits, which amounted to 382billion in 2003, was accounted for by central,
state and local government ( 375 billion). In
the case of the social security funds, deficitsshould generally be avoided by adjusting thecontribution rates; however, further increas-ing them would be extraordinarily problem-atic.
The consolidation of central, state and local
government budgets requires strict spendinglimits. However, the requirement of constantor marginally increasing overall expenditurefor central, state and local governmentmakes cuts necessary, since various expend-iture items already indicate a dynamic ten-dency.
For example, pension payments for civil ser-
vants, which amount to 335 billion and make
up more than 5% of all central, state andlocal government expenditure, will go upconsiderably,
18even though saving measures
have already been adopted. Federal Govern-ment grants to the statutory pension insur-ance scheme will also increase further be-cause they are largely coupled to the evolu-tion of contribution rates and gross wagesand salaries. Whereas the expenditure shareof the grants to the social security fundsamounted to merely 8% for central, stateand local government in 1991, by 2003 ithad grown sharply to almost 13%, in partowing to the greater financing of pensionsout of general taxation; central government’sexpenditure share (as defined in the nationalaccounts) amounted to as much as 29%. Thefurther rise is, however, likely to decelerate if

30the increase in contribution rates to the statu-
tory pension insurance scheme is limited byfurther reforms and progress is made in redu-cing unemployment so that the Federal grantto the Federal Employment Agency can alsobe lowered.
Interest expenditure will also go up at least in
the medium term as a result of the continu-ous growth in debt, which is expected to con-tinue in the coming years. However, the dy-namics of this expenditure item will initiallystill be dampened by a favourable refinancingof maturing debt securities. In the last fewyears, central, state and local governmenthave already profited considerably from thedeclining interest rates. Although indebted-ness has risen by nearly 3340 billion in the
last eight years, annual interest expenditureremained almost unchanged. The averageinterest rate
19on government debt went
down from around 8% in 1992 to 5% in2003. If it had stayed at the same level as inthe early 1990s, the government deficitswould currently be almost 340 billion (or 2%
of GDP) higher. Based on overall debt, an in-crease in the average interest rate of 1 per-centage point would have resulted in add-itional expenditure of 314 billion or just over
1/C252% of GDP .
Expenditure on employees of central, state
and local government amounts to just over3150 billion or 24% of total expenditure,
thus constituting the largest spending item.At best, this can be limited by further lower-ing staffing levels, which can be achieved bycomprehensively reviewing government tasksand services and by reducing governmentregulations. However, it should be noted that
certain tasks – labour-intensive education, inparticular – may require additional resources.
It will be essential to scrutinise all services pro-
vided by central, state and local governmentand to exploit additional efficiency reserves incarrying out government tasks. This must alsocomprise additional subsidy cuts. This requiresa fiscal policy which can also be enforcedagainst pressure from vested interest groups.
Limiting the burden of social security
contributions
The social security funds are not only particu-
larly affected by the weak growth momen-tum and the demographic changes, they arealso partly responsible for the unsatisfactoryemployment situation in Germany owing tothe fact that their financing is based onwages and salaries. Crucial requirements forthe future are therefore to promote a higherparticipation rate of the shrinking labourforce in the macroeconomic production pro-cess as well as to limit social security contribu-tions and decouple them as far as possiblefrom the payroll. Any society must bear theburdens associated with the ageing of itspopulation. A rise in the financing burdens ofthe social security systems can hardly beavoided, but it can be contained and distrib-uted in a more even and employment-friendlymanner.

31In order to reduce non-wage labour costs, it
is necessary to monitor social benefits withregard both to their entitlement precondi-tions and their amount. Important measureshave already been taken: the maximumperiod of entitlement to unemploymentbenefit has been shortened, the rules govern-ing jobs which the unemployed can reason-ably be expected to accept have been tight-ened, and unemployment assistance and so-cial assistance paid to persons able to workhave been merged to create the new “un-employment benefit II”. This will not only re-sult in savings on expenditure but will also in-crease incentives for labour supply and de-mand in the lower income bracket, conse-quently helping to reduce the high structuralunemployment in Germany. Considerable po-tential savings appear possible, in particular,on expenditure in the area of active labourmarket policy.
If the misguided incentives arising from social
security contributions are to be limited, theequivalence concept must be respectedmore. The levy wedge driven between thewage from a consumer’s and from a produ-cer’s perspective by social security contribu-tions has a distortionary impact on insuredpersons if contributions are not linked directlyto corresponding entitlements. Especially inthe statutory health insurance scheme, a risein contribution payments leads to practicallyno additional claims to benefits and is there-fore tantamount to a tax. Furthermore, thelonger-term trend of rising expenditure in thehealth sector means that the current methodof financing via wage-related contributionsdrives up labour costs. If higher contributionsare not compensated by a corresponding re-
straint in pay agreements, this leads to add-itional unemployment. Therefore, it wouldseem appropriate for the statutory health in-surance funds to concentrate on their primarytask, ie insuring against intolerable financialburdens in the event of illness, as well as todecouple financing from wages and henceemployment. Shifting the income redistribu-tion function that is currently performedwithin the statutory health insurance schemeto the tax and transfer system could contrib-ute to greater transparency and help to over-come undesirable and inefficient redistribu-tion effects. The currently discussed proposalof a health premium on independent incomecoupled with a supplementary tax-financedadjustment based on the principle of solidar-ity points the way forward.
Under the “Pension Insurance Sustainability
Act”, future pension adjustments are to becorrected whenever the ratio of pensioners tocontribution payers shifts. As a result ofdemographic changes, the new “sustainabil-ity factor” will usually mean that pensions goup more slowly than the incomes of em-ployed persons. In this way, it is possible tostabilise the statutory pension system againstdemographic changes. As things stand today,the contribution rate can be prevented fromrising to more than 22% up to 2030. Al-though the associated need for enhancedsupplementary private pension provision willincrease the burden on today’s contributionpayers, it will not necessarily raise labourcosts and may offset the demographically re-lated lower yield provided by the statutorypension insurance scheme as a result of the

32higher rate of return which private pension
plans may be expected to generate. Thiswould also contribute to more equal inter-generational burden-sharing. To compensatefor the longer period of drawing pensionsowing to higher life expectancy, an increasein the statutory retirement age appears un-avoidable. Ultimately, a balance between thelevel of contributions, the level of pensionpayments and the retirement age has to befound.
Need to make the tax system
more efficient
Over the past few years efforts have already
been made in the field of tax policy to reducethe marginal tax burden on income, therebyimproving longer-term growth and employ-ment conditions. In 2004 and 2005 more in-come tax cuts will come into force as part ofthe “2000 tax reform”; this will significantlyreduce tax again on both the bottom and topincome brackets (to 15% and just over 44%,respectively).
20On the other hand, various
measures have also been taken to abolishcurrent tax breaks and thus broaden the taxbase. Initially these were largely concentratedon the corporate sector. However, the ActAccompanying the 2004 Budget also makesa start on eliminating tax subsidies for house-holds, although some of the cuts are lowerthan the Federal Government’s original plans.
Despite this progress, a fundamental tax re-
form is required if performance and invest-ment incentives are to be strengthened fur-ther and the tax system, which has becomeexceedingly complex and unwieldy, is to bemade more transparent and efficient. Such a
reform should primarily aim to further lowerthe income tax rates, continue to abolish sub-sidies which distort allocation and at thesame time massively simplify tax legislation.Not least, the impending EU accession of thecentral and east European countries increasesthe pressure – owing to their tax structures –to pay greater heed to macroeconomic effi-ciency than to redistribution aspects. How-ever, given the current high general govern-ment deficit, it is not acceptable to financemore tax rate cuts by incurring additionalgovernment debt. Therefore, such a reformmust be financed by further savings on theexpenditure side and the abolition of tax sub-sidies. In this context the possibilities for elim-inating the current preferential treatment inthe field of VAT – particularly in the form ofthe reduced rate applied to certain goods andservices – should also be placed on theagenda.
The public debate on tax policy has been pro-
moted considerably by the fact that variousconcepts for a radical reform have been pre-sented (see table on pages 34-35). All majorreform concepts aim to further reduce in-come tax rates and, on the other hand, tobroaden the tax assessment base consider-ably. This should make the tax system moreneutral and at the same time macroeconomi-cally more efficient. Another aim is to im-prove the public perception of the tax regimeby drastically simplifying tax assessment andcollection procedures.

33The most radical proposals from the point of
view of macroeconomic allocation are ap-proaches which – like the Kirchhof concept –suggest a move towards taxing all types of in-come at a standard marginal tax rate (as is al-ready the case in several acceding countries).Compared with a continuous direct progres-sive tax schedule, such proposals have the ad-vantage of greater neutrality also in the infla-tion process and concurrently enable the levy-ing of taxes to be simplified by broadly insti-tuting a system of final taxation with deduc-tion at source. However, critics doubtwhether such proposals take sufficient ac-count of income redistribution aspects. Butthe concepts put forward by the GermanCouncil of Economic Experts and the oppos-ition parties likewise aim to broaden the as-sessment base while reducing income taxprogression and to greatly simplify tax legisla-tion. A problem common to all reform con-cepts is that they would result in sizeable taxshortfalls for government, at least during thetransitional phase. A gradual process wouldtherefore be necessary in connection with awide range of additional consolidation meas-ures.
Untangling the financial
relationships between the differentlevels of government
The goal of a more efficient fiscal policy also
entails the need to revise the financial consti-tution so as to enable the individual levels ofgovernment to bear more responsibility andincrease their own interest in improving theireconomic and tax-generating potential. Thelink between public services and the fiscalburden should be made more visible. In the
long term, this could create greater incentivesto use public sector resources more efficiently.This primarily requires a clearer separation oflegislative powers between the differentlevels of government, which should be ac-companied by a relaxation of the revenue-sharing scheme and greater tax autonomyfor state government. The Commission toModernise the Federal System has a mandateto draw up proposals for reforming the cur-rent federative system by the end of the year.
On the expenditure side, at least part of the
current mixed financing arrangements shouldbe reduced. As a general rule, the expend-iture burden should be allocated to the levelwhich has the relevant legislative powers soas to make the political responsibilities moretransparent for the citizens.
21In order to
achieve greater budgetary flexibility for stategovernment, it would be necessary – giventheir high proportion of personnel expend-iture – to create greater latitude in the field ofpublic sector remuneration as well.
On the revenue side, the budgetary leeway of
state government could be expanded by thetransfer of legislative powers concerningtaxes. The most radical solution would be toreplace the current tax-sharing system in thecase of the joint taxes by a segregated systemin which central government has the legis-lative power and revenue competence forturnover tax and state government is allo-cated income tax and corporation tax.

36main argument against such a segregated
system is, however, that these taxes have dif-ferent revenue trends. Not least for this rea-son, a more moderate reform would be pref-erable in which, while the current tax-sharingsystem would remain, state governmentwould be given a degree of tax autonomythrough a limited right to impose a supple-ment or discount on their shares in incometax and corporation tax. On the whole, such asolution would increase the self-responsibilityof state government without resulting inoverly strong divergences in the revenuetrends between the different tiers of govern-ment.
Conclusion
German reunification created extraordinary
tasks for fiscal policy. The largely unchangedcontinuation of the existing west Germantax, social security and transfer systems –which were already in need of reform – aswell as the financing of the massive transfersto eastern Germany mainly by raising socialsecurity contributions and incurring new debtcontributed to the current difficult situation.The sharp increase in the number of pension-ers (including retired civil servants), which al-ready became apparent in the 1990s, hasalso led to a considerable rise in retirement-related expenditure. Also as a result of themacroeconomic problems, public finances arecurrently characterised by high deficits, whichinfringe both the national ceilings and the fis-
cal rules of the EU and thus lessen their cred-ibility. Together with the unclear fiscal policyoutlook, this has led to uncertainty on thepart of consumers and investors. Further-more, the current design of the tax and trans-fer systems, not least in the light of the in-creased competitiveness arising from global-isation and European integration, is hamper-ing economic growth. The problem is com-pounded by the demographically inducedburdens.
However, the critical situation of public fi-
nances also presents an opportunity for re-newal and change if it releases forces thatcould successfully overcome the fiscal policyproblems. The preconditions for this im-proved significantly last year. An intensive re-form discussion is under way and in manyareas the first important steps have alreadybeen taken. The reform process must notcome to a halt, however. The consolidation ofgovernment finances, further reform of thesocial security funds, the tax system and thefinancial constitution remain on the agenda.The broad consensus that has meanwhilebeen reached on the need for reform mustnow be followed by detailing and implement-ing the other necessary measures. Togetherwith the equally urgent reform of the labourmarket, this would create favourable condi-tions for sustainable economic growth andthe promotion of social welfare.

37German balance of
payments in 2003Last year the German economy was ex-
posed to changing international influ-ences. Whereas in the first half of theyear geopolitical tension, the SARSlung disease and cyclical concerns puta strain on the international environ-ment, the subsiding of negative factorsand the visible global economic recov-ery subsequently led to perceptiblybrighter sentiment. This improvementin outlook was not lastingly affectedby the sharp appreciation of the euroeither, even though the shifts in the ex-change rate structure in some caseshad a discernible effect on internation-al current and financial transactions.The trade surplus in 2003, with bothexports (+1
1/C252%) and imports (+21/C252%)
rising, fell slightly from the previousyear’s record heights. By contrast, thecurrent account balance improvedsomewhat as the deficit in invisible cur-rent transactions continued to dimin-ish. As regards financial transactions,the favourable interest rate and ex-change rate situation for euro-area in-vestment and domestic investors’ reluc-tance to incur risk led to large net cap-ital imports in Germany, particularlyvia securities transactions. However,those inflows contrasted with sub-stantial outflows of funds in non-securitised credit transactions.

38Current account
German exporters initially encountered rather
difficult sales conditions in 2003. Early in theyear, the Iraq war and the SARS lung diseaseweighed heavily on the world economy andworld trade. It was most notably the persist-ently muted global demand for capital goodswhich affected Germany’s foreign trade dur-ing that period. These influences dampenedGerman exporters’ foreign sales, on thewhole. In the second half of the year the ab-sence of these negative factors caused theworld economy to recover distinctly, and sen-timent among German exporters – measured,for instance, in terms of Ifo export expect-ations – became increasingly brighter. Grow-ing demand on German export markets en-abled German exporters to post a discerniblerise in foreign orders from first-half levels,and this led to a distinct expansion in exports.
Under these circumstances the gradual disap-
pearance over the entire year of Germany’scompetitive edge in terms of prices, whichhad been created by the relatively low valueof the euro, did not have a negative impacton the revival of export business. Throughout2003 the euro appreciated by 20
1/C252% against
the US dollar and by 111/C252% on a weighted
average against the euro area’s most import-ant partner currencies. The dampening stim-uli from the euro’s appreciation, however,were cushioned by the fact that a large shareof Germany’s exports (43
1/C252%) go to other
euro-area countries. In this area, Germancompanies were able to build on their priceand cost advantages. On a weighted averageagainst Germany’s 19 most important tradingpartners, German exporters’ price competi-
tiveness therefore fell by only 3% during thecourse of 2003. Therefore, on a long-termcomparison, domestic enterprises’ price com-petitiveness can currently be regarded asclose to neutral even after the euro’s appreci-ation.

39foreign markets in the past year. In terms of
value, German exports in 2003 were up by amere 1
1/C252% on the year. Given largely un-
changed export prices on average, they like-wise rose only marginally faster in real termsand thus more slowly than world trade.
It was particularly exports of goods to other
euro-area countries which proved to be astimulus. They rose by 3
1/C252% in nominal
terms, and by just over 3% in real terms,from 2002 levels. German exporters benefit-ed not just from the pickup in economic activ-ity in the euro area as the year progressed butalso from a slight improvement in their priceand cost situation compared with companiesin other euro-area countries. On the whole,German exporters are therefore likely to haveextended their euro-area market share some-what in 2003.
By contrast, last year German exporters were
forced to surrender some of their share in ex-ports to non-euro-area countries. Nominal ex-ports stagnated. In addition, stiffer competi-tion caused domestic exporters to grant priceconcessions on their respective non-euro-areaexport markets, with developments in specificsectors of activity having had a negative im-pact on results in some cases. At constantprices German exports to non-euro-areacountries rose by just under 1%.
Diverging market conditions outside the euro
area – with at times strong market growth,on the one hand, and sharp movements inexchange rates, on the other – has led tomajor differences in Germany’s exports to in-dividual countries. As in previous years, do-Regional trend in foreign trade

40mestic exporters reported remarkable success
in sales to China (+25%), which saw particu-larly strong economic growth during the pastyear. Sales to central and east European tran-sition countries likewise grew vigorously(+6%). Sales to other EU countries, whichalso make up a significant share in Germanexporters’ foreign business, went up by 3%.By contrast, German companies saw a sharpdrop in sales to the United States (-9
1/C252%) and
the South-East Asian emerging market coun-tries (-3%), whose currencies are in somecases (nominally or effectively) pegged to theUS dollar. Trade with OPEC countries (-4
1/C252%)
and Japan (-6%) behaved similarly.
Nearly all sectors felt the impact of the in-
creasingly difficult selling conditions on for-eign markets in 2003.
1It was particularly theproducers of capital goods (German export-
ers’ most important product range, at 45%of exports) that suffered under last year’s con-tinued sluggishness in global investment ac-tivity. The muted foreign demand had a par-ticularly adverse effect on exports of machin-ery. In terms of value, deliveries of informa-tion and communication technology (ICT)products also fell sharply; however, furtherprice reductions in this product segment werea major factor. By contrast, car manufacturersincreased their export revenue slightly from2002 levels. Chemical product manufacturerslikewise saw some growth in their foreignbusiness.
Nominal imports of goods were up by 2
1/C252%
in 2003 and thus slightly more sharply thanexports. At the same time, the appreciationof the euro against the currencies of import-ant trading partners caused import prices tofall by a total of 2.2%. It is true that, despitethe euro’s appreciation against the US dollar,it was most notably energy imports which be-came more expensive on average over thepast year. However, most other importedgoods were cheaper, sometimes by a consid-erable margin. Imports therefore grew fasterin real terms (+5%) than in terms of value.Shifts in price relationships between Germanyand other countries, which caused domesticbuyers to tend to substitute foreign productsfor domestic products (terms of trade im-proved by 2%), undoubtedly contributed tothe sharp import growth relative to domestic2003

41demand, which had experienced a long
period of stagnation last year. Moreover, theacceleration in exports in the second half of2003 was probably the main factor whichboosted import activity, since experienceshows that the share of imported intermedi-ate goods in the production of export goodsis relatively high. In some cases, however, therise in imports is also attributable to the quan-titative replenishment of energy stocks.
Along with energy imports, foreign demand
for motor vehicles and vehicle parts likewiserose in the past year, a sign of the increasingintegration of domestic car production withother countries. By contrast, in terms ofamounts, imports of chemical products weredown on 2002. Sales by foreign machinerymanufacturers in the German market, too,were down somewhat on the year in the lightof more subdued domestic investment activ-ity. In addition, foreign sellers of ICT goodssaw their sales on the German market dropdistinctly. However, it was particularly lowerprices which reduced the value of imports inthis product category; for instance, importsof data processing equipment were 11
1/C252%
cheaper and those of communications equip-ment 8
1/C252%.
On the imports side, too, trade with China
was particularly buoyant; imports were up by17
1/C252%. Imports from the central and east
European transition countries rose as well(+8%) following a relatively weak year. More-over, euro-area enterprises recorded a distinctrise in their turnover in business with Germanimporters (+3%). Since the prices for importsfrom the euro area fell slightly last year, thisincrease in turnover merely reflects volume
effects. In nominal terms, imports from OPECcountries likewise rose in 2003 (+4
1/C252%), the
increase in energy prices being an importantfactor. By contrast, imports from companiesin Japan (-4%), the United States (-3
1/C252%)
and the South-East Asian emerging econ-omies (-
1/C252%) went down. These develop-
ments, however, are more likely to have beenaffected by the exchange-rate-related declinein import prices in euro terms than by a realdecline in sales.
In 2003 a trade surplus of 3129
1/C252billion was
generated. Since the value of imports roseonly slightly faster than export proceeds, thesurplus was merely 33 billion below the previ-
ous year’s record. At the same time, the def-icit on invisible current transactions wentdown by 35 billion to 376 billion. This led to a
current account surplus of 347 billion or
2.2% of nominal GDP . This figure had beensomewhat lower in 2002, at 345
1/C252billion.
The lower deficit on invisible current transac-
tions which comprise services, factor incomeand current transfers is due largely to move-ments in cross-border factor income. The pastyear saw net expenditure of 312
1/C252billion fol-
lowing 317 billion a year earlier. Develop-
ments in investment income contributed inlarge part to this decline, whereas cross-border employee compensation remained vir-tually unchanged. As regards investment in-come, revenue went up by 32 billion to 393
billion, while expenditure went down by 32
1/C252
billion to 31051/C252billion. The increase on the
revenue side was focused on income fromdirect investment, which could potentially in-Breakdown of

42dicate that the profitability of German enter-
prises’ foreign branches is improving. By con-trast, dividends from portfolio investmentand interest earned on bonds and loans fell.Not only interest rate movements but also ex-change rate movements might have played asignificant role: the euro’s rise led to a sharpreduction in income on foreign currencyassets (converted into euro). Since, in termsof amounts, more German external assetsthan external liabilities are denominated inforeign currency, this exchange rate effect didnot have the same impact on the expenditureside,
2where lower interest payments on
loans were virtually offset by higher interestexpenditure on public bonds and increasedyield payment on direct investment.
3
As was already the case in earlier years, thelargest subsegment in the deficit on invisibleswas the deficit on services ( 335 billion). How-
ever, this deficit like the factor income deficitalso fell further, by around 31
1/C252billion. This
was due mainly to lower expenditure oncross-border services, which fell distinctly fur-ther than revenue. Developments in the indi-vidual subsectors of services varied consider-ably. Payments on transport services, in par-ticular, went down. In addition, payments byresidents to non-residents for patents and li-cences and for research and developmentwere down. The euro’s appreciation may havealso contributed to a tendency on the part ofimports of services to become cheaper.Major items of the balance

43Travel has traditionally been a key element of
the services account. A decline in the deficitin 2002 was followed last year by a slight riseto336 billion. Despite having less scope for
expenditure, residents apparently increasedtheir foreign travel on holiday and on busi-ness again. Germany’s travelling expenditurewas up by 31 billion, or around 1
1/C252%, on the
year after falling sharply in 2002. SeveralEuropean holiday countries in particularbenefited from the increase in travelling, in-cluding Austria, the Benelux countries andGermany’s central and east European neigh-bours. Following the dollar’s sharp depreci-ation, however, the United States also appar-ently proved to be an attractive destinationonce again. There was less demand last yearfor trips to Italy, Spain and Portugal, though.Other holiday destinations, too, saw theirpopularity decrease, bucking the generaltrend. The Iraq war, uncertainty caused byterrorist attacks and the SARS epidemic allprobably played a role. Affected destinationsinclude Turkey, Egypt, Tunisia and some Asiancountries.
Insurance services deteriorated the worst
within the services account in 2003. Ger-many’s expenditure more than doubled, forone thing (+ 31
1/C252billion). This was due not to
premium payments by residents to non-resident insurers which remained constantbut mainly to declining revenue from claimspayments by foreign reinsurance companies.
4
Another thing was that German revenuefrom cross-border insurance services fell by31
1/C252billion since German reinsurers’ revenue
from premiums fell further than claims pay-ments.The deficit on current transfers to non-
residents rose by just less than 31 billion to
329 billion last year. This was attributable
mainly to increases in public transfers, whichrose by 32
1/C252billion net due to an increase in
net payments to the EU budget. Reduced EUpayments to Germany, especially in the areaof agricultural market regulation, as well ashigher German payments to the EU based onnational product were both contributory fac-tors. By contrast, the EU share in German rev-enue from value added tax remained virtuallyunchanged.
In contrast to public sector transfers, the bal-
ance on private sector transfers improved by31
1/C252billion; in 2003 it ran a deficit of 310 bil-
lion. The decline was attributable to the othertransfers item, among other things; this in-cludes, above all, severance pay and gam-bling revenue but also penalties and warrantypayments ( 31
1/C252billion). Moreover, indemnifi-
cation payments by private sector entitiessuch as the Foundation “Remembrance,Responsibility and Future” went back down(3
1/C252billion) following large disbursements in
the two preceding years.
Financial transactions
Events on the international financial markets
were also determined by the changing polit-ical and economic situation in 2003. For ex-ample, share prices fell to a cyclical low

44worldwide in the second quarter of 2003,
and the yields on bonds issued by first-classborrowers declined under the pressure ofgrowing concerns about deflation to levelswhich had last been observed at the end ofthe 1950s. When uncertainty subsided laterin the year and the economic outlook grad-ually brightened, internationally oriented in-vestors again faced the future with greateroptimism. This was reflected in a rapid rise inshare prices and – inversely – in a fall in pricesfor fixed-interest paper. At the same time, theeuro appreciated in leaps and bounds rightup to the end of the year. The internationalinfluences outlined above were also manifestto some extent in the capital flows to andfrom Germany, which likewise underwent atransformation in the course of the year.Whereas in the first few months of last yearsome internationally operating investors hadreduced their globally oriented portfolios, es-pecially in the case of equities, they switchedback around the middle of the year to invest-ing considerable amounts internationally. Ifthe year is considered as a whole, however,the increased need for security felt by inter-national investors was part of the reason whythere was a further decline in the gross flowsof capital in both directions. All in all, netamounts of capital flowed into Germany as aresult of portfolio investment and direct in-vestment in 2003 whereas large net capitaloutflows were recorded in non-securitisedcredit transactions.
The largest net capital imports in ten years
(359 billion) were recorded in portfolio invest-
ment although large amounts of funds alsoflowed into Germany in the previous twoyears ( 344 billion in 2002 and 326
1/C252billion
in 2001). Even so, the substantial net inflowsconceal considerable reluctance on the partof financial market participants to makecross-border investments, a developmentwhich does not become apparent unless thedecline in the gross amount invested is exam-ined.
The more cautious approach to making finan-
cial decisions is particularly evident amongGerman investors, whose portfolio invest-ment abroad amounted to 332
1/C252billion and
was therefore only half what it had been inthe previous year. German investors were par-ticularly sceptical about the dividend-bearingpaper of foreign firms. For the first time since1995, for example, German residents becamenet sellers on the international equity marketsand reduced their holdings of foreign sharesby37
1/C252billion. It was evidently not so much
the influences exerted by the foreign ex-change market that contributed to this devel-opment but rather the change in expect-ations about the business cycle and earnings.This argument is supported by the fact that itwas mainly holdings of shares issued in theeuro area which were liquidated ( 35 billion)
while US equities – despite the weakness ofthe dollar – were bought by German investorson balance. Given the prevailing stock marketsituation, German investors seemed to bedirecting their attention more at their homemarket, and this was reflected in their declin-ing interest in funds domiciled abroad; experi-ence has shown that these funds invest thebulk of the capital accruing to them on theinternational share markets. At all events,German investors added foreign investment

45fund certificates worth no more than 341/C252bil-
lion to their portfolios after acquiring asmuch as 37 billion of this type of paper last
year.
German investors’ demand for foreign debt
securities was also much lower, however,and was restricted essentially to euro-denominated bonds issued by governmentsin the euro-area partner countries. WhereasGerman residents had invested 348 billion in
longer-term euro-denominated bonds andnotes in 2002, they added no more than331
1/C252billion worth of such paper to their
portfolios in 2003. In the first three years ofmonetary union, when stocks were under-going substantial adjustment to the new situ-ation, German investors actually bought anaverage of 384 billion worth of such paper. It
is possible that this significant fall in demandis also a sign of a growing degree of homo-geneity within the euro-area capital marketwhere the differences between federal (Ger-man) bonds and the bonds of euro-area part-ner countries are increasingly dwindling. Thishypothesis is borne out at least to some ex-tent by the fact that the differential betweenthe yields on government bonds within theeuro area declined by a further 7

points to 10 basis points on an annual aver-age of 2003. A net amount of money marketpaper, ie fixed-interest securities with a ma-turity of less than a year, was actually sold lastyear ( 32 billion).
The generally more cautious attitude in the
international financial centres could also beseen in the comparative reluctance of non-residents to invest in the German securitiesFinancial transactions

46markets. Non-residents acquired securities
worth 3911/C252billion in Germany in 2003, but
that was much less than in the previous year(3110 billion). There was a particularly sharp
decline in demand for federal bonds – paperwhich is normally very popular with foreigninvestors owing to its first-class credit ratingand high degree of liquidity. For example, for-eign savers increased their holdings of publicinterest-bearing paper by no more than320
1/C252billion, just over 40% of the previous
year’s amount ( 3501/C252billion). One reason for
this may have been that non-residentsreassessed their international investmentoptions as global security risks subsided and,especially in the third quarter, withdrew fundswhich they had invested in German govern-ment bonds as a safe haven at the beginningof the year. By contrast, the interest rateswing on the international bond markets
probably played rather a minor role in this de-cision because private bonds had been ingreat demand throughout the year. For ex-ample, foreign investors acquired 349 billion
worth of this paper in 2003 whereas in theprevious year they had added privately issueddebt securities worth only 333
1/C252billion to
their safe custody accounts. This switch in de-mand from public to private bonds and noteswas probably also due to the interest rate ad-vantage that bank debt securities had overGerman government paper even though thisspread was reduced by a further 11 basispoints in the course of the year. All in all, theacquisitions of long-term fixed-interest secur-ities amounted to 369 billion compared with
383
1/C252billion a year earlier. German money
market paper which was evidently used for atime during the year to take account of tem-porary interest rate and cyclical uncertaintiesfound no foreign buyers on balance over theyear as a whole (- 3
1/C252billion).
German shares, by contrast, benefited from
the changing expectations about the businesscycle and the declining uncertainty in termsof the implicit volatility of the DAX evenwhen compared with the equities issued inmajor partner countries. Although foreign in-vestors had still been selling German sharesat the beginning of the year, they redis-covered the German stock exchange whenthe dynamic rally set in and bought Germanshares worth 324 billion net. This was 38
1/C252
billion more than in the previous year. This
also means that within the euro area, too,Germany appears to have been a particularlyattractive location for equity investment in 5 bn

472003. This development is certainly also to be
seen in connection with the fact that theDAX, after emerging from the cyclical low inmid-March 2003, rose by 44% by the end ofthe year whereas the Dow Jones index andthe Nikkei index increased by only 28% andthe EuroStoxx index by 32%.
It was not only in the field of portfolio invest-
ment that gross capital flows declined; in thefield of direct investment, which usually re-sponds comparatively slowly to cyclical andgeopolitical changes, new investment in bothdirections was also lower last year. Evidentlythe cyclical revival which gradually emergedand the share prices which increased in thecourse of the year were still not being reflect-ed in a renewed upturn in cross-border directinvestment. Possibly memories of the heavylosses which internationally oriented enter-
prises – especially those in the innovativehigh-tech and telecommunication sectors –had sustained as they extended their inter-national reach in recent years were still havingan effect on their decision-making. For ex-ample, the mergers and acquisitions of inter-nationally operating enterprises – precisely inthese aforementioned economic sectors –sank last year to a fraction of record levelsreached around the year 2000. However, thegeneral downward movement predominatednot only in the case of German direct invest-ment but also in that of the euro area as awhole even if the data so far available sug-gest that the declines in the latter case wereless pronounced. All in all, net funds flowinginto Germany in the form of direct invest-ment amounted to 39 billion in 2003, which

48was 320 billion less than in the previous
year.5
New investment by German enterprisesabroad declined particularly sharply to 32
1/C252
billion (2002: 39 billion). As in previous years,
there were countervailing developments inthe provision of funds, and the amounts werealso smaller. While, on the one hand, Germanenterprises increased their capital investmentin branches abroad by 313 billion, they re-
ceived substantial net funds, mainly in theform of short-term financial credits, fromtheir foreign subsidiaries, on the other. Againas in previous years, the credits, amountingto323
1/C252billion, consisted principally of re-
verse flows. These are loans which are grant-ed by the subsidiary domiciled abroad to theparent company in the home country and areentered in the balance of payments as disin-vestment. Furthermore, German enterprisesand individuals spent 39
1/C252billion on property
and real estate, notably in the United King-dom and France, which likewise count as dir-ect investment. Possible reasons for the fairlylow level of German direct investment werethe persistently poor performance of Germanenterprises and the uncertain world econom-ic outlook during much of the year; this evi-dently induced German enterprises to restricttheir cross-border M & A activities.
Interest in cross-border investment also
waned significantly in the case of financialflows in the opposite direction, ie foreigndirect investment in Germany. Non-residententerprises invested a total of 311
1/C252billion in
Germany, which was just over two-thirds lessthan in 2002. The main reason for this wasthat, although the supply of equity capital
remained stable (at 328 billion), there was a
swing in the credit transactions betweenaffiliated enterprises from capital inflows in2002 ( 322 billion) to what is now a fairly high
level of capital outflows ( 311 billion). How-
ever, it must be remembered when interpret-ing these figures that, owing to the revisionof the Corporation Tax Act ( K/C246rperschaft-
steuergesetz ), parent companies that are ob-
viously foreign transformed corporate loansinto equity capital, thereby undertaking anaccounting exchange on the liabilities side(see the explanatory notes on page 49). Lastyear Germany was the most attractive loca-tion for enterprises from France and theUnited States.
As in the previous year, there was a net shift
of capital abroad as a result of the statisticallyrecorded credit transactions of non-banks in2003 ( 312 billion compared with 32 billion in
2002). The main reason for this developmentis to be found in the operations of Germanenterprises (and individuals): they parked theproceeds from securities issues with foreignbanks and thereby recorded a net increase of317 billion in their external assets. General
government, by contrast, imported fundsamounting to 35 billion. This was essentially
due to large loans against borrower’s notes
5According to initial estimates by UNCTAD for 2003, dir-
ect investment in the group of developed countries did
not decline further but, instead, stabilised at a low level.
However, there were diverging trends in the individual
countries. For example, there was a threefold increase in
the inflows of capital to the United States in the year
under review whereas fairly substantial declines con-
tinued to be recorded in the EU, especially in France and
Germany.German direct

49New provision on corporate borrowing and its effect on direct investment
At the end of 2003, there were unusual
developments in foreign direct invest-ment in Germany. For example, lastDecember, non-resident proprietors re-patriated long-term loans in the amountof514
1/C252billion, which they had previous-
ly made available to their branches domi-ciled in Germany. At the same time, theyreinvested a large part of these funds asequity capital in their affiliated com-panies in Germany, a development whichincreased these affiliated companies’equity ratio.
These transactions were carried out in
the light of the amendments to the Cor-poration Tax Act ( K/C246rperschaftsteuerge-
setz), which entered into force on 1 Janu-
ary 2004. These amendments removedthe previous tax privileges with regard tocorporate borrowing enjoyed by Germanshareholders but not by foreign share-holders in German corporations andabolished the special tax privilege forholding companies. Pursuant to the pre-vious regulation, domestic holding com-panies – irrespective of their financingstructure – could offset all interest pay-ments on loans granted by their Germanparent company as operational expend-iture and thus reduce their tax burden.The interest payments of German hold-ing companies majority-owned by for-eign companies, however, could be offsetagainst tax only in the event of a debt-equity ratio of up to 3:1. If the capitalratio was less than 25%, the cost of debt
was deemed to be a hidden distributionof profits under tax law. From a fiscalpoint of view, the intention was to limittax shortfalls arising from this kind ofcorporate borrowing as the interest in-come of the non-resident parent com-pany is not subject to German taxation.
The regulation in force since the begin-
ning of 2004 applies equally to all Ger-man and foreign shareholders. Accord-ing to the new regulation, payments forborrowed funds that exceed an exemp-tion limit of 5250,000 are, as a rule, to be
regarded as a hidden distribution ofprofits and are therefore taxable if theborrowed funds are greater than one-and-a-half times the pro rata share ofown funds at any time during the fiscalyear. The extended safe haven for hold-ing companies is no longer applicable.This is causing foreign shareholders to in-crease the equity base of their Germanholding companies from a previous levelof 25% to at least 40% of the sum ofown funds and borrowed funds.
In order to adapt the financing structure
of their German holding companies tothe legal framework applicable from1 January 2004, foreign parent com-panies reduced their share of borrowedfunds at the end of 2003 by calling inlong-term loans and simultaneously en-gaging in new equity investments.

50which were provided by foreign investors and
which count as credit transactions.
Much like a mechanical balance sheet coun-
terpart, as it were, large net capital exportsby the banking system ( 3108 billion com-
pared with 3137
1/C252billion in the previous
year) coincided with an increase in the cur-rent account and the net capital imports inthe other statistically recorded segments ofthe financial account. Operations at the shortend of the market, amounting to 373 billion,
accounted for most of the increase in the netexternal assets of the credit institutions. As inprevious reporting periods, the granting ofadvances and loans to non-residents was theprimary reason for this; corresponding de-posits and borrowing operations grew moreslowly. By contrast, the Bundesbank’s externaltransactions that are classified as credit trans-actions were almost in balance ( 32 billion).The small positive balance was due primarily
to larger deposits by foreign commercial andcentral banks at the Bundesbank and wasnot, in contrast to the situation in previousyears, in connection with the payment trans-actions of the ESCB.
The foreign reserves which are shown separ-
ately in the balance sheet declined at transac-tion values by 3
1/C252billion in 2003. When con-
sidered over the year as a whole, however,the valuation changes in the Bundesbank’sbalance sheet had a much greater effect. Theforeign reserves depreciated by 38
1/C252billion
compared with the final balance sheet resultin the previous year and stood at 376
1/C252billion
at the end of 2003. This was the result of theweak US dollar, whose exchange rate losswas only slightly offset by the increase in thevalue of gold.Credit
