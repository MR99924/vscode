5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a wholeGerman economic growth came to a standstill
in the second quarter of 2001. According toinitial calculations by the Federal StatisticalOffice, the real gross domestic product was nohigher, after adjustment for seasonal andworking-day variations, than in the first threemonths of this year. Year on year, the compar-able position was exceeded by
12% after ad-
justment for working-day variations, as op-posed to just under 2% in the first quarter.During that period there was a strengtheningof growth, which was, however, only tempor-ary and based mainly on catch-up effects.Overall, there has been a marked slowdown ineconomic growth since the middle of last year.
In the period under review – as in the early
months of the year – a boost came from pri-vate consumer spending. By contrast, exportsceased to provide any impetus. Although ex-ports held their own, imports increasedstrongly during the same period, resulting ina drop in net trade. There was a perceptibleweakening of gross fixed asset formation.Whereas expenditure on new buildingsdropped only slightly, investment in machin-ery and equipment showed a marked down-ward trend.

6down on the previous months. However, they
were again slightly up on the lowest point todate, which was reached in April this year.Year on year, there was a lag of around4
12%, as opposed to an average of just
under 2% in the second quarter. Althoughdomestic demand – relative to the depressedlevel of the previous month – recoveredsomewhat, orders from abroad fell comparedwith the two preceding months, which werecharacterised by several large orders.
After adjustment for seasonal variations, in-
dustrial output fell in July to the lowest levelof the year. This was partly attributable to thefact that a number of firms closed down forlonger in the summer than in recent years.This was the case, for instance, in the motorindustry, where it led to a strong decrease inproduction being recorded. In July, overall
industrial output was 2% down on theprevious year.
ConstructionIn July, demand for construction work fell
again, after making a good recovery in thecourse of the second quarter. If the monthsfrom April to July are taken together (which isadvisable, given the volatility of the series),despite the poor July result, there is still astrong increase in seasonally adjusted termscompared with the winter months. Year onyear, orders fell by just over 2
12% in the
period under review, whereas the decreasewas almost 10% in the first quarter. Nearlyall branches of the construction industry wereaffected by the recent slowdown; onlyprivate-sector building contracts increasedsomewhat.
In July, seasonally adjusted construction out-
put, which had risen during the spring fromthe very low level at the end of winter, per-sisted at virtually the same level as before.Compared with the previous year, this meansa decrease of around one-tenth, although thedecline was considerably larger in the secondquarter.
Labour marketThe situation on the labour market has
changed little in recent months. Although,according to initial estimates by the FederalStatistical Office, the seasonally adjusted Junefigure for the number of persons in work fellslightly to 38.74 million, the decrease wasReal gross domestic product

1 See Deutsche Bundesbank, The changeover from the
seasonal adjustment method Census X-11 to CensusX-12-ARIMA, Monthly Report, September 1999, pages
39-51. — 2 At factor cost.As the result of an EU Regulation, the Main
Industrial Groupings (MIGs) have been redefined and
standardised throughout the EU. A new MIG −“Energy” − is being included in the production
indices in addition to the existing main industrial
groupings (production of intermediate goods,
capital goods, durable consumer goods and
non-durable consumer goods). This new MIGcomprises electricity, gas, steam and hot water
supply, certain mining activities and part of the
manufacturing sector (in particular, the manufacture
of refined petroleum products). This change means
that the manufacturing sector, on which the analysisof business activity has focused until now, can no
longer be used as the aggregate of the intermediate,
capital, durable consumer and non-durable con-
sumer goods industries. Therefore, a new aggregate
− “Industry” − is being formed from these main
groupings which in future will replace the
manufacturing sector as the main concept in theanalysis of   current   economic   developments.
Some reclassifications have also been made in the
present main groupings in the indices for
production, orders received and turnover. In
particular, the manufacture of motor vehicles andmotor vehicle engines, which previously was largely
allocated to the  durable  consumer  goods  industry,will now be wholly recorded within the capital
goods industry.
The adjustment of the production indices for
seasonal and working day variations has been
changed over to the new seasonal adjustment
method, Census X-12-ARIMA, which has already
been in use since mid-2000 for adjusting Germanquarterly national accounts data. The salient feature
of the new method compared with its predecessor
(Census-X-11) is smaller revisions of the seasonally
adjusted figures on average when re-estimating the
seasonal pattern.
 1The change of method will not
produce a different overall picture of business
activity. There are some significant differences,
however, in the annual growth rates shown in the
results which are adjusted for working-day variations
only; these were previously calculated using a
different approach. With regard to the analysis of
current economic developments, comparabilitybetween results adjusted using the X-12-ARIMA
method and data still obtained using the X-11
procedure (e.g. for statistics on orders received,
turnover and foreign trade) is assured. The seasonal
adjustment of these indicators, too, will beprogressively changed over to X-12-ARIMA.

8again very small. All in all, since its peak in
December 2000, employment has gonedown by just under 60,000, or 0.15%. Thecomparable position in the previous year wasno longer matched in June.
The seasonally adjusted number of jobless
persons registered at the Federal LabourOffice was no higher in August than before.A slight increase in the west German Länderwas offset by a small decrease in eastern Ger-many, which was probably partly related tothe early end of the summer holidays. Theunemployment rate for Germany as a wholeremained steady at 9.3%. According to thestandardised calculation method based onthe ILO concept, it was 7.9%.
PricesAfter adjustment for seasonal variations, the
consumer price index remained unchanged inAugust. As in July, the year-on-year increasewas 2.6%. Increases in the prices of energyand food continued to be far higher, butprice rises in these sectors have slowed downperceptibly in recent months. Overall, this hasreduced the upward pressure on prices con-siderably. At around 1%, the year-on-yearincrease in the price of manufactured goodsand in housing rents was still below average.
The seasonally adjusted prices of imports and
of manufactured goods sold within Germanyfell in July. The year-on-year difference, whichhad still been + 3.6% for import prices inJune, narrowed to + 1.7%; for the sellingprices of manufactured goods it was + 3.1%,compared with + 4.3% previously. In add-Economic conditions in Germany*

Public Finance
Government indebtednessThe central, regional and local authorities’ in-
debtedness increased significantly by 314.0
billion in July after having decreased by 38.6
billion in June. The Federal Government’s netborrowing rose by 38.1 billion. Fresh funds
were raised predominantly through twotransactions from the capital market. Firstly,35.7 billion gross revenue was raised by the
Federal Government through the increase inthe ten-year 5% Federal bond issued in Maythis year and secondly, 39.2 billion was ac-
quired with the new issue of treasury dis-count paper. After deducting redemptions,the amount outstanding increased by 34.4
billion ( Bunds ) and 34.3 billion ( Bubills ). In
July, the Federal Government repaid anotherconsiderable amount of the equalisationclaims of the Currency Conversion Fund ( 31.1
billion). There remained only 34.5 billion of
this liability – which had reached a total of339.7 billion at the end of last year – after a
large bulk of it had been paid back in Januarythis year.
In July, the indebtedness of the Länder Gov-
ernments also increased sharply ( 35.7 bil-lion). The situation of the Länder budgets,
which has worsened considerably comparedwith last year, was reflected, for instance, innet borrowing, which, by the end of July, hadalready exceeded the total figure for 2000 by31 billion. To cover their financing require-
ments, they resorted predominantly to issuingtreasury notes (with a maturity of up to fouryears) amounting to 33.3 billion. At the
same time, the Länder governments drew oncash advances from banks, notably short-term advances ( 31.8 billion). The „German
Unity“ Fund stepped up its indebtedness onlymarginally ( 30.1 billion). The ERP Special
Fund had a 30.3 billion stake in the afore-
mentioned bond issue of the Federal Govern-ment in order to fund maturing bank loans.The local authorities appear to have madeNet borrowing in the market

10only small demands on the credit markets in
July.
Federal Government borrowingIn August, the Federal Government tapped
the capital markets for 33.1 billion gross,
while redeeming 37.1 billion. Owing to the
simultaneous increase in its money marketdebt of only 32.7 billion, the Federal Govern-
ment’s indebtedness contracted, on balance,by31.3 billion. The main instrument of its
gross borrowing was the periodic reopeningof five-year special Federal bonds ( Bobls ),
carrying a dividend of 4.5%, which reacheda gross revenue of 35.1 billion. 34 billion of
this amount went to the „German Unity“Fund. This served largely to refund the8.75% bond of 1991, which matured at theend of August. After deducting redemptions
(36.6 billion) and the ongoing sales of mar-
ket management stocks ( 30.9 billion), the
Federal Government experienced a decreaseof34.5 billion in its outstanding amount of
Bobls . Tap sales and market management
sales of other Federal securities yielded 30.5
billion net. For loans against borrowers’notes, borrowing equalled redemptions.
Securities markets
Bond marketSales in the German bond market picked up
again in July, after several months of sluggish-ness. Domestic borrowers issued bonds to themarket value of 376.3 billion, compared with
357.4 billion in the previous month. Owing
to declining redemptions, net sales, at 329.8
billion, were markedly above the June figure(–31.9 billion). Foreign bonds were placed in
the German market to the value of 35.2 bil-
lion, made up mainly of shifts in foreigncurrency paper (– 32.2 billion) into bonds de-
nominated in euro ( 37.4 billion). Altogether,
the outstanding amount of domestic and for-eign bonds increased much more in July (by335.0 billion) than in the previous months.
In July, credit institutions raised funds
amounting to 313.0 billion net from sales of
their own debt securities; in the previousmonth, they had slightly reduced theirbonded debt. Other bank bonds and bondsissued by specialised credit institutions pre-dominated; they were sold to the extent of36.3 billion and 35.3 billion, respectively.Federal Government net borrowing in

11Communal bonds ( Öffentliche Pfandbriefe )
and mortgage bonds ( Hypothekenpfand-
briefe ), at 31.1 billion and 30.3 billion re-
spectively, played only a subordinate role. InJuly, corporate bonds were issued to the re-cord volume of 35.2 billlion (net), after net
redemptions amounting to 31.7 billion in the
previous month.
In July, the public sector increased its bonded
debt by 311.5 billion, 312.1 billion (net) of
that sum being accounted for by the FederalGovernment. It increased its ten-year bondissue, at 5%, launched in May, by 38 billion,
to a total of 316 billion, and issued Treasury
discount paper ( „Bubills“ ) totalling 39.4 bil-
lion. Net of the market regulation quota andredemptions, sales of such paper yielded 36.8
billion and 34.3 billion, respectively. Five-year
special Federal bonds and two-year Treasurynotes were sold to the extent of 30.6 billion
and 30.5 billion, respectively. The outstand-
ing amount of Federal savings bonds rose by30.1 billion.
2The Länder Governments raised
funds in the bond market to the extent of32.8 billion. By contrast, there were redemp-
tions of the bonds issued by the Federal Rail-ways Fund ( 31.9 billion net), the Currency
Conversion Equalisation Fund ( 31.1 billion)
and the former Federal Post Office ( 30.3 bil-
lion).
Gross sales of Deutsche Mark/euro bonds is-
sued by non-residents under the lead-management of German syndicates came to30.5 billion in July. Owing to redemptions,
however, the outstanding amount declinedby31.9 billion.On the buyers’ side of the bond market, do-
mestic non-banks were in the forefront inJuly. They enlarged their bond portfolios by317.9 billion, two-thirds of that sum being
accounted for by domestic paper and one-third by foreign paper. German credit institu-tions increased their holdings of bonds andnotes by 315.5 billion, made up, on balance,
entirely of domestic securities. In July, foreigninvestors increased their portfolios of Germanbonds by 31.6 billion.Sales and purchases of bonds

12Equity market
Issuing activity in the German equity market
picked up somewhat in July. Domestic enter-prises placed new shares to the market valueof32.1 billion (June: 31.5 billion). Foreign
equities were placed in the German marketto the tune of 35.4 billion; thus sales of equi-
ties totalled 37.5 billion. In July, domestic
non-banks predominated on the buyers’ sideof the equity market. They purchased equitiestotalling 38.5 billion, consisting almost en-
tirely of foreign paper. Foreign investors pur-chased German shares to the extent of 35.5
billion net, while domestic credit institutionssold equities worth 36.5 billion.
Investment fund certificatesThe amount raised by domestic investment
funds was higher in July ( 36.0 billion) than a
month before ( 33.3 billion). Specialised
funds received the major part of this amount,selling certificates to the value of 33.6 billion
net (June: 31.6 billion). 32.4 billion (net) was
invested in funds open to the general public.As in the previous months, money-marketfunds and open-end real estate funds, receiv-ing30.7 billion each, were favoured by in-
vestment savers. Share-based funds, bond-based funds and funds of funds received 30.3
billion each, and mixed funds 30.2 billion.
The outstanding amount of certificates ofmixed securities funds, land funds and pen-sion investment mutual funds ( Altersversor-
gungsfonds ) remained virtually unchanged.
Foreign investment fund certificates weresold to the extent of 30.9 billion.On balance, all investment fund certificates
were purchased by domestic non-banks ( 38.0
billion), whereas German credit institutionsand foreign investors sold certificates to thetune of 31.0 billion and 30.2 billion, respect-
ively.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account – the combined
outcome of foreign trade, services, factor in-come and current transfers – ran a deficit of33.1 billion in July compared with one of
34.6 billion in June. The decline was due
solely to the larger trade surplus.
According to calculations by the Federal Stat-
istical Office, trade in goods resulted in a sur-plus of 38.5 billion compared with 36.9 bil-
lion in June. Even after the elimination of sea-sonal factors the surplus on foreign trade, at37.1 billion, was much larger in July than in
the previous month ( 36.1 billion). This was
primarily the result of the increased exportsof goods, which (in seasonally adjustedterms) were 1
12% greater in July than in
June. This means that – despite the slight de-cline in export prices – Germany’s seasonallyadjusted exports had grown for a secondconsecutive month for the first time since thesummer of last year. German imports ofgoods, by contrast, were a (seasonally adjust-ed)
12% below their June level. However, this
decline was entirely the result of the trend inimport prices, which fell by 1
12% in the same
period.Sales and

13At311.1 billion, the deficit on invisible cur-
rent transactions with non-residents in Julywas the same as in the previous month.Slightly reduced net expenditure on services(35.0 billion) and on current transfers ( 32.4
billion) was partly offset by increased net ex-penditure on factor income ( 33.6 billion in
July compared with 33.1 billion in June). The
large net expenditure which again occurredin the case of investment income was duemainly to dividend payments to holders ofGerman securities abroad in the month underreview.
Financial transactions with non-residents in
July resulted in a turnaround in the case ofcross-border securities transactions. Whereasin the previous two months there had beenlarge inflows of funds, net capital exportsamounting to 31.2 billion were recorded in
July. However, there was little change in Ger-man investors’ interest in foreign securities(they purchased paper worth 38.2 billion net
in July compared with 37.8 billion in the
month before). Most demand in the periodunder review was for foreign bonds andnotes ( 34.9 billion) and for foreign shares
(32.0 billion). Non-resident demand for Ger-
man paper fell significantly, by contrast, withnet purchases declining from 328.9 billion in
June to 36.9 billion in July. Foreign purchases
of German shares declined most during themonth under review ( 35.5 billion compared
with 326.7 billion). For the first time this year
non-residents again purchased Germanmoney market paper in July ( 31.9 billion
net). By contrast, sales and redemptions pre-dominated in the case of bonds and notes.Major items of the balance

14In contrast to portfolio investment, direct
investment resulted in a net influx of 314.5
billion. Foreign proprietors provided theirbranches domiciled in Germany with a totalof37.1 billion – primarily through short-term
intra-group credits – in July. German enter-prises, by contrast, imported net fundsamounting to 37.4 billion. The latter sum
was essentially the outcome of long-termborrowing from their subsidiaries operatingabroad and has therefore to be booked as adeduction item (reverse flows) in the case ofGerman outward investment.
Enterprises and individuals exported 33.3 bil-
lion net in statistically recorded credit transac-tions in July. The stocking-up of bank depositsabroad was the main contributory factor
here. By contrast, a small influx of funds ac-crued to general government ( 30.9 billion
net) and to German credit institutions ( 31.2
billion net) in the month under review. Theexternal transactions which are conductedthrough accounts held at the Bundesbankand which ultimately led to net capital ex-ports of 310.4 billion were of greater signifi-
cance in terms of value in July. As usual sincethe start of monetary union, the balance inconnection with the payment system TARGETwas the main contributory factor here.

15The performance
of German creditinstitutions in 2000The performance of German credit in-
stitutions came under increased pres-sure in financial year 2000. Both theiroperating result and their annualprofit before tax were down. This wasmainly due to unsatisfactory interestbusiness. Administrative costs and netcharges from the valuation of assetswere also higher. By contrast, thebanks’ earnings from commission busi-ness and own-account trading werevery good. Lower extraordinarycharges, further sales of participatinginterests and lower earnings-relatedtaxes had a stabilising effect on the re-ported profit levels. There was amarked variation in performance inthe different categories of banks. Fol-lowing the results for the first half ofthe year, the price swings on the equitymarkets and the cyclical position areexpected to lead to a further worsen-ing of performance in the banking in-dustry this year.
Overview
Performance trends in 2000 reflect the on-
going pressure on the result of interest busi-ness and the increased importance of invest-ment banking, which implies greater depend-ence on developments on the financial mar-kets. Earnings also came under pressureowing to large amounts being invested in re-organisation programmes and in enhancingcompetitiveness. Interest business was char-acterised by a marked increase in the balance

mand and a broad stagnation of customerdeposits. In addition, the term structure wasflattening out and competition in terms andprices was fierce. Against this background,net interest received fell by around 30.9 bil-
lion to just under 377 billion in the year
under review. The interest margin
1fell from
1.28% to 1.15%, which is the lowest level re-corded to date. The slump in prices on theequity markets which began in the secondquarter, particularly for technology shares, hadno overall detrimental effect on the banks inthat savers continued to show a preference forsecuritised forms of investment. The banksbenefited particularly from the continued highpublic demand for investment fund certificatesand high turnovers in equity business. Netcommissions received rose by 35
12billion or
25 % to a record 328 billion.
The 34.7 billion increase in gross earnings
from interest and commission business wasnot sufficient to offset administrative spend-ing, which went up strongly by 37.5 billion;
the partial operating result therefore de-creased. This means that administrative ex-penses have outstripped the net interest re-ceived. Last year staff costs went up by 9%,while other administrative spending rose farmore strongly by 12

17years. There were marked differences in the
cost trends of individual categories of banks.2
At36.4 billion, the net profit on financial op-
erations reached a new record level. Year onyear, this constituted an increase of around80%, achieved during a period of very highvolatility on the financial markets and despitemassive price slumps at the same time on theequity market. In other operating businessthe positive balance dipped slightly by 30.3
billion to 32.1 billion. By contrast, the net
charges from the valuation of assets relatingto loans and securities placed a considerableburden on performance. The negative bal-ance rose by 34.3 billion to 315.8 billion.
However, the reinstatement of original valuesand allocations provided for by law had had apositive impact on the net income or netcharges from the valuation of assets in the
preceding financial year. By far the greatestproportion of the net charges from the valu-ation of assets in 2000 was attributable tovalue adjustments in domestic lending busi-ness. At 320 billion, the operating result,
which indicates the success in business oper-ations, fell by 34
12billion and was thus just
under one-fifth down on the previous year.

billion in the previous year to – 30.6 billion.
This was mainly due to the release of specialreserves and the sale of participating inter-ests. German credit institutions’ aggregatenet profit for the financial year fell by 31.9
billion to 319.4 billion in the year under re-
view; as, however, there was a roughly pro-portionate decrease in earnings-related taxes(from 39.0 billion to 36.8 billion), the banks
were able to hold their after-tax profits steady(at312.6 billion). Roughly one-third of these
profits were transferred to their reserves andthe remaining 38.5 billion is recorded as bal-
ance sheet profit. The return on capital, de-fined as the ratio of the profit for the financialyear before tax to the average capital asshown in the balance sheet,
3amounted to9.38% in 2000, compared with 11.22% in
the previous year. After tax, the return oncapital was 6.09% (in 1999 it was still6.51%). The equity ratio (the capital shownin the balance sheet as a percentage of thenon-risk-weighted balance sheet total) fellslightly to 3.52% (1999: 3.59%).

Net interest received
By and large, interest business stagnated in
2000. Net interest received fell by 30.9 bil-
lion, or just over 1%, to 376.9 billion. It thus
represented only just over two-thirds of theprofits in operating business, whereas, as anaverage of all the banks, it was three-quartersin 1998. The interest margin, which relatesthe net interest received to the average bal-ance sheet total, fell from 1.28% to a new%%DM

4The credit institutions’ net profit for the financial year
pursuant to the German Commercial Code, which they
report to the Federal Banking Supervisory Office and the
Deutsche Bundesbank each year, forms the basis for the
analysis of the profit and loss account for 2000. For the
first time, the annex contains a comparison between the
aggregated annual accounts of the big banks as individ-
ual institutions pursuant to the German Commercial
Code and their group annual accounts (see page 35f). In
this article, the data reported for the monthly balance
sheet statistics by the credit institutions, including their
branches abroad, are taken as the statistical basis.
Branches of EU credit institutions, institutions in liquid-
ation or those with a truncated financial year are ex-
cluded. Money market funds, building and loan associ-
ations and institutions which cannot be defined as “Mon-
etary Financial Institutions” are not taken into account.
The balance sheet total (up to end-1998: volume of busi-
ness) is derived from the balance sheet statistics, with the
balance sheet total for foreign branches being adjusted
for their relationship to the parent institution in order to
avoid duplication. The figures for 1999 are based on the
approved annual accounts and may diverge from the
data published in September 2000. The data for 2000
are based on non-approved annual accounts and are
therefore provisional. In addition, the results of subsidiar-
ies of German banks domiciled in Luxembourg are re-
viewed.Even smaller

19low of 1.15%.5Interest paid once again rose
at a distinctly faster pace – by 1912% (or by
348 billion to 3293 billion) – than net inter-
est received, which went up by 1412% (or by
347.1 billion to 3370 billion). It is, however,
worth noting that interest received thus grewmore strongly than the balance sheet total(+10.9%) for the first time since 1992. Cor-respondingly, the net interest received rosefrom 5.33% to 5.51% (see the above chart).The balance sheet figures tend to suggestthat there is unlikely to have been a particu-larly strong increase in wide-margin assets in2000. Rather, there are indications that inter-est movements caused a “cyclical price ef-fect” to set in. Past experience shows thatthe interest margin follows the developmentof the capital market rate with a certain timelag (with differences in interest rate elastici-ties and different blocks of fixed interest rates
in asset-side and liability-side business playinga role). The capital market rate had reached atemporary low in 1999.

The reason why interest paid rose faster thaninterest received (up from 4.05% to 4.36%of the balance sheet total) is related, first, tothese balance sheet factors and, second, tothe ongoing increase in funding costs as a re-sult of investors’ shifts to securitised forms ofinvestment at banks and elsewhere.

5In 2000 the credit institutions’ net income received
from the remuneration of minimum reserve holdings at

have been 1.12%.

20iour, it could prevent the interest margin from
returning to previously experienced levels.
The interest figures tended to be boosted by
a strong increase in lending against securitiesand a somewhat higher demand for short-term loans. The loans granted by foreignbranches to non-banks abroad are also im-portant; these rose on average by aroundone-third in financial year 2000, amountingto3480 billion at the end of the year. How-
ever, this was not enough to offset the nega-tive factors in domestic business. In this area,overall loans to the private sector (up by4
12%) and particularly housing loans
(+ 312%), which had been in particular de-
mand in the previous year because of the his-torically low rates of interest, increased onlyslightly.
In the year under review, interbank credit,
with its comparatively narrow margins, in-creased somewhat more slowly than the bal-ance sheet total, by just over 8%. If, in ac-cordance with the concept of the “adjusted”interest margin,
7the average balance sheet
total for 2000 is “adjusted” for interbankbusiness (2000: 31,758.3 billion) which does
not affect the aggregate net interest received,this results in a figure of 1.55% for the yearunder review if an aggregate of all banks istaken (from 1.76% in 1999).

produced better results than in the previousyear, with income from (fixed-interest) debtsecurities and Debt Register claims develop-ing especially well. They rose by just underone-fifth to 360 billion. Increasing by more
than one-third, current income from shares,participating interests and shares in affiliatedcompanies grew, relatively speaking, evenmore strongly. This income item, which in-cludes income from subsidiary banks andother companies within the group as well asincome from equities, thus grew by 34
12bil-
lion to a total of 317 billion. At 1212%, the
increase in income from lending business andmoney market transactions was somewhatless dramatic, although it was far strongerthan in recent years. At 3290 billion or justunder four-fifths, it is still the most important
component in the interest rate result.
The rise in short-term interest rates had a
negative effect on liability-side businessowing to the higher share of floating-rateitems. At the same time, the term structureflattened out and made it more difficult toobtain earnings from maturity transform-ation. The year-end difference betweenmoney market rates and the yield on bondswith a ten-year residual maturity was around0.3 percentage point.
In addition to these interest-rate-related fac-
tors, however, savers’ continued preferencefor securitised forms of investment such as in-vestment fund certificates was mainly respon-sible for raising refinancing costs in the bank-Relative significance of major income and cost items for individual categories of

22ing industry. Savings deposits with a three-
month period of notice were reduced bysome 10% and had to be offset by more ex-pensive interbank funds (+ just under 10%)or bearer debt securities (+ 8%). The strongincrease (+11%) in short-term time depositswhich are remunerated in line with marketrates had a similar effect. Overall, at the endof 2000 domestic customers’ bank depositsaccounted for just under 31
12% of the bal-
ance sheet total.
Closer examination of the interest margins re-
veals a downward trend over the longer termfor all the categories of banks. It continuedvirtually everywhere last year. The decreasefor the big banks and regional banks was par-ticularly marked. In 1999 fairly extensive insti-tutional shifts had already gone on in thesetwo categories.
8However, the decrease also
affected the savings banks and credit co-operatives, which, on account of their busi-ness structure, both achieve the largest inter-est margins. Overall, they achieved 2.33%and 2.45% respectively in the year under re-view. The interest margins of the savingsbanks and credit cooperatives in eastern Ger-many were 2.73% and 2.89% respectively,i.e. 45 and 46 basis points more than in theequivalent categories in western Germany.The decisive factor here was the somewhatlower amount of interest paid.

23their typical interbank and wholesale banking
business coupled, at the same time, with ahigh share in expensive securitised refinan-cing instruments. Regional institutions ofcredit cooperatives was the only category ofbank to improve on its interest rate result (upfrom 0.60% in 1999 to 0.78%); this is par-ticularly due to the strong increase in currentearnings from shares in affiliated undertak-ings.
The German banking industry has already
prepared itself for the change in investor be-haviour by taking greater advantage of its op-portunities to generate income from commis-sion business. Nonetheless, at least as anaverage of all banks, this has not yet reachedthe point where it is able to offset the declin-ing income from interest business.
Net commissions received
In financial year 2000 the German credit insti-
tutions made splendid earnings from commis-sion business. Net commissions received wentup by 35.6 billion (+ 25%) to a new record
level of 328.1 billion. This increase was gen-
erated by the 37 billion rise in commissions
received, which more than offset the rise incommissions paid by 31.4 billion. Net com-
missions received thus rose to 0.42% of theaverage balance sheet total (1999: 0.37%).The commercial banks, in particular, benefit-ed from this, accounting for around three-fifths of the aggregate net commissions re-ceived ( 316.8 billion) and three-quarters of
the increased earnings in the year under re-view. The increased importance of commis-sion business and the strong market position
of the big banks likewise become clear if netcommissions received is set against net inter-est received. In 2000 roughly one-quarter ofall operating bank income came from com-mission business – more than one-third in thebig banks.
The favourable commissions result was main-
ly due to a very lively demand for investmentfund certificates and equities, which was re-flected in sizeable securities commission andsafe custody business. Although, aftermarked price rises, equity market sentimentbecame very gloomy from the second quarteronwards, the turnover of equities on thestock market went up in 2000 from 32.96
trillion to more than 34.62 trillion. At just
under 339 billion, the funds raised through%

24share-based funds were more than twice the
amount raised in the previous year. Overall,the investment funds also sold more sharecertificates than in 1999. The income fromsafe custody business is also likely to have in-creased perceptibly. As the securities depositsstatistics show,
9the number of safe custody
accounts at credit institutions (including in-vestment trusts) went up from 24 million in1999 to 33.3 million at the end of 2000.Owing to falling prices on the equity markets,the increase in the market rates that are rele-vant to safe custody fees was smaller (from34.2 trillion to just over 34.4 trillion). How-
ever, the margins are likely to have narrowedfurther, also as a result of the competition be-tween direct banking facilities offered by allcategories of banks and direct brokers. Therevenue from initial public offerings (IPOs)was down on the previous year. Equity issuesdecreased from 336 billion (market value) in
1999 to 323 billion in the year under review,
while the number of IPOs fell from 168(1999) to 152.
Other components of net commissions re-
ceived are likely to have contributed fairlylimited earnings. This applies, for example, topayment transactions. The earnings fromasset counselling and administration are likelyto have declined somewhat on account of de-velopments on the stock market as the yearwent on, although at some banks they in-creased distinctly. Merger counselling focuseson just a small number of institutions. By con-trast, within financial groups, associationsand cooperatives the intermediation linked tothe bancassurance concept gained in generalimportance; in these enterprises financialproducts of third parties are clearly being sold
more and more. Apart from investmentfunds, intermediation is related mainly to sav-ings and loan contracts for building purposes,property financing business and insurance.The credit cooperatives appear to have bene-fited particularly from increasing revenuefrom this business sector.
Households’ efforts to build up additional pri-
vate capital-covered pensions – which will in-tensify in the future as a result of govern-ment’s decision to encourage them – suggestthat the demand for commission-yieldingsecurities-related services of all kinds can beexpected to increase further in the future.Initially, however, owing to the weakness ofthe equity markets and investors’ lower riskpropensity, fairly moderate growth should beexpected.
Administrative expenditure
In the year under review administrative ex-
penditure increased comparatively strongly by37.5 billion, or 10.7%, to 377.7 billion. The
increase outstripped the growth in commis-sion business, with the partial operating resultfalling correspondingly by just under 32.8 bil-
lion to 0.41% of the average balance sheettotal (1999: 0.50%). The increase in adminis-trative spending focused on the category ofcommercial banks, which accounted foraround 80% of the increased expenditure. Inaddition to other factors, this was, however,also due to the fact that employees from an-

25other institution in one of the financial groups
classified under big banks were included inthe parent institution’s administrative costsfor the first time. Given the largely stable costtrends at savings banks and credit coopera-tives in 2000, the branch network did notplay a major role, at least not in terms of ris-ing costs.
Staff costs rose by 33.6 billion (+ 9.2%), far
more strongly than in previous years but at aslower pace than other administrative spend-ing (+12.4%). According to the availabledata, the number of persons in employment(part-time employees are also calculated on aper capita basis) rose slightly by 2,600 (seethe above table). In view of the ongoing dif-ferentiation of branch operations (e.g. self-service, standardised banking products re-quiring little advice and financial services re-
quiring extensive advice), the overall staffingcapacities for standardised activities are nowlikely to be rather too high and to have led toincreased part-time working. At the sametime it would appear that the need for morehighly qualified employees and specialistscannot always be met. This is also reflected inbonus payments and loyalty premiums mainlyin investment banking and in the field of IT.At an annual average of 2.6%, the rise inagreed rates of pay in the private bankingsector was fairly moderate (1999: + 2.9%).
Other administrative spending rose by 33.9
billion to 335.7 billion and accounted for
around 46% of total costs. As shown in theannual reports of enterprises and associ-ations, investment in information and com-Structural data on German credit institutions

26munications technology continued to be the
main factor driving spending up. The creditinstitutions are endeavouring to establishstandard electronic platforms, are extendingelectronic banking or are making increasinguse of electronic networks to sell their ser-vices and products. For example, the numberof online accounts in Germany rose by 5 mil-lion to 15 million in the period under review.Essentially, however, whether the growth ofother administrative spending signals invest-ment in future competitiveness or a stream-lining of cost management can be assessed, ifnecessary, only at the level of the individualinstitutions. As well as IT-related spending,the costs of business premises and third-partyservices are likely to have gone up anyway inrecent years; in the period under review,however, these increases appear to havebeen comparatively restrained.
The savings banks and credit cooperatives
held the increase in their expenditure largelyin check. Enhanced exploitation of cost syner-gies in individual areas within their respectivefinancial associations (such as IT developmentand computer centres, securities trading,electronic banking, shared financial portals inthe Internet and payment transactions) is like-ly to be playing just as important a role nowas the outsourcing of functions to specialistenterprises within these financial associationscoupled with concentration on core business.In the year under review, in addition to out-sourcing and cooperative ventures, therewere further mergers and branch closures,the main objective being to achieve morecost-effective operating sizes and to improvemarket positions. According to the statisticsof bank offices, the number of credit institu-
tions declined in the period under reviewfrom 2,993 (end-1999) – especially as a resultof mergers – to 2,733; at a rate of – 8.7%,the decrease thus accelerated slightly (1999:7
12% decrease). The credit cooperatives ac-
counted for 240 of a total of 260 closures.
In view of the rather volatile earnings in re-
cent years, the banking industry has focusedincreasingly on cost-cutting opportunities.Therefore the tables annexed to this article in-clude, for the first time, a detailed survey ofthe cost structures of the different categoriesof banks and how they have developed since1993 (Table: “Breakdown of general adminis-trative spending by category of bank”,pages 48–50). This shows, for instance, thatthe share of social security costs has de-veloped relatively differently in the differentcategories of banks and that other adminis-trative spending is, on average, already wellabove spending on wages and salaries. This isparticularly noticeable at regional banks andbranches of foreign banks.
Net profit or net loss on financial
operations
In 2000 the credit institutions performed ex-
ceptionally well in own-account trading in se-curities held in the trading portfolio, foreignexchange, derivatives and precious metals, im-proving their trading results by four-fifths tomore than 36.4 billion in total. However, the
increase was concentrated on the big banks,which accounted for more than 90% of thegrowth and whose own-account trading con-

27tributed far more strongly to the operating in-
come (more than 16% compared with anaverage share of all banks of just under 6%).Apart from the big banks, own-account trad-ing still has a certain significance for regionalinstitutions of credit cooperatives, Land banksand the branches of foreign banks. At thelatter, own-account trading figures almostmatched the net interest received. In particu-lar, in this business sector, the big banks copedsuccessfully with the fall in prices on the equitymarkets from the second quarter, the upwardtrend of bond prices from the autumn and thedownward movement in the external value ofthe euro. Derivatives also appear to haveplayed an important role. The half-yearly re-ports indicate that a similarly favourable evolu-tion of income cannot necessarily be expectedthis year. On average, the category of regionalbanks, which includes institutions trading rela-
tively actively, made only a slight improvementin their performance in own-account tradingin 2000.
Net other operating income or charges
The positive balance of other operating in-
come and charges went down slightly by 30.3
billion (–14%) to 32.1 billion in the year
under review. The main factor here was thedeterioration in other operating charges in thenarrow sense (by – 31.1 to – 34.3 billion) as

The operating result before net income or net

335.9 billion (see the table on page 27). Set
against the balance sheet total, almost all cat-egories of banks recorded losses, the excep-tions being regional institutions of credit co-operatives and the branches of foreign banks.
The cost/income ratio, which relates the gen-
eral administrative spending to the net inter-est and commissions income or to the totalnet income in the operating business, calcu-lated as an average of all banks, rose from70% (1999) to 74% and from 66% to68
12% respectively. When using this figure
to assess efficiency, however, the fact that ITexpenditure can be considered broadly as in-vestment and institutionally determined shiftsin staff costs should also be taken into ac-count. Since 1997 the cost/income ratio hasshown an overall upward trend.

from value re-adjustments in respect of loansand advances and provisions for contingent li-abilities and for commitments fell by 32 bil-

already been made of the cross-offsetting op-tion permissible under section 340 (f) (3) ofthe German Commercial Code. The value ad-justments had taken effect in the previous fi-nancial year on the basis of the legal rulingson the reinstatement of the original value ofassets that had already been value-adjusted.This positive effect has lapsed in the reviewperiod.

By far the largest proportion of the valuationexpenditure is clearly accounted for by do-mestic lending business. In particular, in thecase of housing loans there was evidentlymore need for value adjustments, this stillbeing apparent at some institutions in spring2001. To an extent, institutions had to fallback on deposit guarantee schemes. Loanlosses also affected the construction industry,trade and companies associated with agricul-ture. Credit risk continued to be comparative-ly higher in eastern Germany. In addition, theeconomic slowdown was reflected in an in-crease of around 6% in the number of insolv-encies, bringing the total to 28,000 (includingsmall businesses).

11In 1999, however, many banks allocated most of
these “appreciation gains” to a reserve for reinstating ori-
ginal values which is part of the “extraordinary ac-
counts”. They will then release those gains between
2000 and 2003 with a corresponding effect on earnings.

30“consumer insolvencies” virtually tripled in
2000. By contrast, the write-downs on fixed-interest securities were, at around 31.4 bil-
lion, fairly small in the year under review (in1999 they were still 34.8 billion), as the rise
in bond prices in the course of the year limit-ed the need for valuation considerably. Riskprovisioning for foreign loans was also clearlyreduced on balance, with the positive devel-opments in eastern Europe, in particular, play-ing a decisive role.
The credit institutions made a slight reduction
in their taxed hidden reserves, held in accord-ance with section 340 (f) of the GermanCommercial Code. The “Fund for generalbanking risks” (pursuant to section 340 (g) ofthe Commercial Code), the funds of whichare included in the core capital, was toppedup by around 31.1 billion in the year under
review.
12With regard to the individual cat-
egories of banks, a disproportionate amountof evaluation expenditure was recorded atthe regional institutions of credit coopera-tives, mortgage banks and savings banks. Thechange in risk provisioning at the regionalbanks was in line with the average, while fig-ures for the Land banks, credit cooperativesand especially the big banks were relativelygood.
Owing to increased risk provisioning and the
discontinuance of the previous year’s specialincome from the reinstatement of originalvalues, the operating result fell by just underone-fifth to a total of 320.1 billion in 2000.
That was over 34.5 billion less than in the
previous year.Net other and extraordinary income
or charges
Performance in the year under review was
boosted by the “extraordinary accounts” (seethe table on page 31). Their negative balancewas reduced by 32.6 billion to – 30.6 billion.
The most important reason for this was theongoing evolution of “special reserves”,which was the inverse of its trend in 1999. In1999 considerable amounts of the special in-come from the reinstatement of original val-ues required by law accrued to it and some ofthese have now been released again. The in-come thus generated was 31.8 billion in the
period under review, at the same time virtual-ly no new transfers were made (in 1999 itwas still 34.3 billion). On balance, this effect,
which had a particular impact on the savingsbanks, offset the rather negative changes inthe other extraordinary account items. Thesecame, on the one hand, from declining extra-ordinary income and smaller profits from thefinancial investment business. The credit insti-tutions made use, as usual, of the option ofnetting income and charges permissibleunder section 340 (c) (2) of the German Com-mercial Code. Charges relating to mergersalso played a role. The balance of the extraor-dinary accounts varied considerably acrossthe different categories of bank. While itboosted the income account at the savingsbanks, the regional institutions of credit co-operatives and credit cooperatives, it put add-itional pressure on the income account at thebig banks, regional banks and the Landbanks.

Owing to the more favourable “extraordinary

tions. In 1998 the institutions in this category– in the course of transferring a large part oftheir share holdings to autonomous partner-ships within the group – had recorded corres-pondingly high latent taxes in the form ofBreakdown of other and extraordinary income or charges

13Balance sheet equity also includes “assets contributed
by silent partners”. These have a certain significance
mainly at the Land banks. At least part of their remuner-
ation is clearly included under interest paid and does not
therefore have to be paid out of the profit for the finan-
cial year. Owing to this effect, return on equity is there-
fore likely to be underestimated somewhat. However, the
“assets contributed by silent partners” can be seen only
from banking supervision data and not from the balance
sheet statistics. According to estimates, the average re-
turn on equity (before tax) of all banks was around 0.5
percentage point higher (as an average for the period
from 1994 to 2000). As this instrument is used primarily
by the Land banks, the effect was more marked there.Profit for the

to release some of these, which led, as theywere higher than the current tax liabilities, toclaims for a refund. The transfer was justifiedby reference to the “Tax Reduction Act”

which takes effect from 2001 and whichlowers the rate of corporation tax to a stand-ard 25% (the rate was previously 40% on re-tained profits and 30% on distributed profits,excluding the solidarity surcharge). In add-ition, from 2002 the tax liability on profitsfrom the sale of share holdings in incorpor-ated enterprises will cease to apply.
At312.6 billion, the profit for the financial
year after tax was slightly higher than in theprevious year ( 312.4 billion). Of this amount,
34.1 billion was transferred to reserves and

33to non-recurrent special effects which took
the form of sales of participating interestsand then ceased. In 2000 the operating resultand the profit for the financial year before taxwere around 31.1 billion (0.49% of the bal-
ance sheet total in each case)
17; after tax the
result was 30.8 billion (0.35%). The results
have barely changed since 1999. These per-formance figures show that, in terms of theaverage balance sheet total, the Luxembourgsubsidiaries did better than the institutionslocated in Germany.
18
In 2000 the balance sheet total of the Luxem-bourg subsidiaries rose as an annual averageby 8.5% to just over 3222 billion. The net
interest received, the most important sourceof income, remained steady at just under31.1 billion. The interest margin, which,
owing to the interest business which is largelyrestricted to banks and major customers, istraditionally lower than at the institutions lo-cated in Germany, has decreased continuous-ly since 1997 (0.60%) to 0.48% in 2000.Compared with the 1993 figure, it has almosthalved. In 2000 increases in revenue relatedto volume were absorbed by the increase inshort-term interest rates and the flatter termstructure. Net commissions received de-veloped exceptionally well, rising by 45% tojust over 30.6 billion. This corresponded to
0.29% (1999: 0.22%) of the average bal-ance sheet total. The Luxembourg institutionsbenefited from the strong demand for invest-ment fund certificates, as some of them actas custodian banks for investment funds, aswell as from the demand for asset counsellingand asset management.The net profit or net loss on financial oper-
ations held steady at around 30.1 billion. Net
other operating income or charges, which iswhere the Luxembourg institutions recordrevenue from sales of participating interests,again fell to just under 30.1 billion from its
peak in 1998 ( 30.6 billion). At – 30.2 billion,

and volume of business are identical.
18At the end of 2000 a total of 170 foreign subsidiaries
majority-owned by German banks from 35 countries re-
ported data for the monthly balance sheet statistics. At
that time their balance sheet total was 3580.5 billion. Of
this amount, 41.7% was accounted for by the 31 Luxem-
bourg subsidiaries. Measured against the balance sheet
total of (dependent) foreign branches of German banks,
whose income is included in the result of the domestic
credit institutions, the overall importance of the 170 sub-
sidiaries declined further (to 37.3%, from 41.6% in
1997, the financial year last reviewed). However, this is
not the case in Luxembourg, where there is a distinct

virtually unchanged. By contrast, in 2000 thenegative effect of higher administrativespending on performance was felt morestrongly than in the previous two financialyears. Administrative spending went up byjust under one-quarter to 30.6 billion, with
other administrative spending almost reach-ing the level of staff costs. The reasons forthe strong increase were related, in particular,to the appointment of additional qualified
staff and to continued high levels of invest-ment in tangible fixed assets in the field of ITand to special expenditure related to mergers.Overall, performance growth in the Luxem-bourg subsidiaries and the institutions locatedin Germany seems to have moved muchcloser together, which signals further integra-tion of the banking markets.Comparison of the performance of German credit institutions and their subsidiaries

Comparison of the annual accounts of groups
and individual institutions in the big bank
category
This presentation and review of the perform-
ance of credit institutions is based on the indi-vidual annual accounts of the institutions pur-suant to the German Commercial Code. Bankgroups (in particular, commercial banks, Landbanks and the regional institutions of creditcooperatives) also publish annual group ac-counts, primarily in accordance with theInternational Accounting Standards (IAS). Theadjacent chart compares the most importantincome and expenditure items of the bigbanks
20on the basis of their group data and
their individual annual accounts pursuant tothe German Commercial Code (1993 to2000; up to 1998 three institutions, subse-quently four). As an average of the aggre-gated figures, the individual institutions’ bal-ance sheet totals make up around 65% ofthe group balance sheet totals. A large de-gree of convergence is evident. The compari-son shows that using individual institutions’annual accounts does not lead to systemic orstructural distortion. The differences aresomewhat larger in terms of net interest re-ceived; they are smaller in terms of the trad-ing result, where the evaluation in the groupaccounts is more market-oriented and alsotakes pending profits into account, and in netcommissions received. In the group account,as a result of the inclusion of a large numberof group enterprises with other business, netcommissions received have already out-stripped net interest received.For the purposes of analysing the perform-
ance of the German banking industry, it is ad-visable to continue to use individual accounts.As a percentage of the balance sheet total  1

the statistics published here, while group data were com-
piled, using the same format, from the annual reports.
The value adjustment in respect of tangible and intan-
gible assets was included in administrative spending. Net
interest received contains no income from leasing and
is captured before deduction of risk provisioning. The

36This is the only way to enable a comparison
also to be made with those banks which donot calculate and present their accounts inaccordance with accounting regulations forfinancial groups. The group figures also con-tain data from credit institutions which are al-ready included in other categories of bank.Adding the figures together would thereforelead to double counting, which could beavoided only by subtracting data for these in-stitutions from the group result, which wouldbe very costly. Whereas group annual ac-counts pursuant to IAS are intended to con-vey information which would be of assistanceto investors in their investment decisions
21
and to make it easier to supervise financialconglomerates, the annual accounts pursuantto the German Commercial Code are moreconcerned with protecting creditors, are lesssusceptible to market price fluctuations andare also relevant to the tax balance sheet. In
addition to preparing market comparabilitydata, analysing the performance of the bankshelps, in particular, to assess the stability ofthe financial system. The profitability of ac-tual banking business needs to be analysed,but this would be virtually impossible if anumber of group enterprises which conductsome bank-unrelated business were to be in-cluded. In 2000 at the four big banks the re-sults of a total of 2,007 enterprises were in-cluded in the group accounts. Of these,1,612 were foreign and 395 domestic enter-prises (1999: 1,059 foreign and 342 domesticinstitutions).
21Owing to the information they provide on risk and the
segment, as it is, the very comprehensive annual reports
contain data which are far more important for investors
than aggregated group data.

51Bank balance sheets,
bank competitionand monetary policytransmissionAll credit institutions operating in Ger-
many report data on their bankingbusiness to the Bundesbank. The Bun-desbank aggregates those data toform variables of macroeconomic rele-vance, such as the money stock and thelending volume. The Bundesbank alsouses such individual data, or collectivedata computed from them, for thepurpose of carrying out econometricstructural analyses. The fields of appli-cation of such analyses are diverse. Inthe present article, two such fields aredescribed to serve as examples, andthe findings of some econometric esti-mations are presented.
The first analysis concerns the field
of monetary policy transmission, andshows that funds flow from largebanks to small ones in Germany in thewake of a restrictive monetary policymeasure. That might explain why inGermany – unlike other countries – thesize of a bank, in itself, has only aminor bearing on its response to mon-etary policy measures. The second an-alysis examines the competitive behav-iour of banks, and comes to the conclu-sion that competition on the Germanbanking market has not changed sig-nificantly as a whole, despite a slightincrease in concentration in the courseof the consolidation process during thenineties. Then again, such consolida-tion can equally be construed as a re-flection of competition.

52Bank loans in the monetary policy
transmission process
The central bank’s monetary policy measures
are applied to the money market, and ultim-ately affect – via the transmission process –non-banks’ spending decisions and price deci-sions. Monetary transmission is, in reality,highly complex and insufficiently understoodin its details (i.e. as regards the key variablesand the precise timing). In economic theory,several different monetary transmission chan-nels are distinguished.
1For example, the
“interest-rate channel” emphasises the factthat higher interest rates tend to reduce theattraction of investment, and increase the in-centive to accumulate savings. Both effectshave a dampening impact on expenditure.The “exchange-rate channel” takes accountof the fact that, given floating exchangerates, a more restrictive monetary policystance tends to revalue the domestic cur-rency, which cheapens foreign goods and ser-vices for residents and makes domestic goodsand services dearer for non-residents. Thatcurbs net exports, and therefore the demandfor home-produced goods.
Besides the interest-rate and exchange-rate
channels, there are, in economic theory,other potential transmission channels, eachof which highlights different key variables(e.g. inflation expectations, real balances). Inrecent years, two approaches, in particular,have attracted greater attention – approacheswhich assign an active role to bank loans inthe transmission process, and which arelumped together under the heading “creditchannel”: the “balance-sheet channel” pos-tulates that monetary policy measures affect
the value of assets, and thus generally alternon-banks’ creditworthiness. The “bank-lending channel”, on the other hand, isgeared specifically to the effects of monetarypolicy measures on the supply of bank loans.
The keen interest shown in the credit channel
in recent years owes much to the fact that itimplies a dependence of the transmissionprocess on the characteristics of the financialsystem. At the same time, this signifies thatdifferences in financial systems may involvedifferences in transmission. Such problemsmight be of particular significance in the euroarea, where countries with different financialsystems are subject to a single monetary pol-icy.
2The dependence of monetary transmis-
sion on the structure of the financial systemmay, moreover, imply that the transmission ofmonetary measures changes in the event ofstructural adjustments to the financial mar-kets – for instance, if there is a shift in theprevailing term structure, an increase in se-curitisation or an alteration in bank competi-tion.
The bank-lending channelUnlike, for instance, the interest-rate and ex-
change-rate channels – in which monetary-policy-induced changes in bank loans arecaused by the behaviour of non-banks, and

53thus merely reflect movements in bank-loan
demand – the bank-lending channel relatesto the supply of bank loans. Accordingly, a re-strictive monetary policy measure tends to re-duce the deposits held at banks, since non-banks switch to alternative types of assets inthe wake of an interest-rate increase. In prin-ciple, the level of bank loans may remain un-affected if the bank raises enough additionalfunds (for example, by issuing bank bonds)and/or runs down other asset holdings (e.g.,by selling securities or reducing interbank de-posits). But if the withdrawn deposits andother forms of fund-raising, on the one hand,and the loans and other asset holdings, onthe other hand, are not fully interchangeable– i.e. not perfectly substitutable – for thebank, then the reduction in deposits triggeredby the monetary policy measure results in adecline in the supply of bank loans. Thattends to dampen expenditure, unless the re-duction in lending is accompanied by a cor-responding expansion of alternative types offinancing – unless, that is, non-banks can re-place their borrowing from banks completely,and on the same terms, by other types of fi-nancing.
According to the credit-channel theory, such
imperfect substitutability is due to imperfec-tions in the financial markets. It mainlystresses, in this connection, the existence ofcosts of delegation, and of asymmetries inthe distribution of information: as a generalrule, a capital-seeker is likely to have more in-formation about his motives, the prospects ofthe success of a financing project, and othercircumstances relevant to the provision of thefunds, than a capital-supplier. Moreover, thecapital-supplier, after the transfer of the
funds, normally cannot monitor and controlcompletely the actions of the capital-seeker.That may give the capital-seeker an incentiveto withhold disadvantageous information,and to perform actions which are of benefitto him, but detrimental to the capital-supplier. The capital-supplier is inclined to tryto keep this risk as low as possible, for in-stance by obtaining more information, or byappropriate contractual provisions, such as ademand for collateral. As a rule, however,such adjustment, monitoring or incentivemechanisms boost costs. Thus they result, forexample, in more time-consuming proced-ures, in constraints on the use of funds, or ininflexibilities in the deployment of the assetsused as collateral. Since that is detrimental tothe capital-seeker (as well), he has an interestin keeping the associated efficiency losses aslow as possible.
A possible way of doing so consists, in par-
ticular, in establishing a closer relationship be-tween capital-seeker and capital-supplier.That permits, on the one hand, the buildingof confidence and reputation and, on theother, the repeated use of information al-ready obtained, and of experience previouslygained. Compared, for instance, with (an-onymous) types of financing, this is facilitatedby bank loans, because they tie the contract-ing parties to one another, and enable indi-vidual provisions to be worked out. “Relation-ship banking” is a particularly close form ofsuch an arrangement.
3For that reason, bank

54loans are, for many non-banks, not inter-
changeable with any other method of finan-cing. For banks, too, they have a differentquality from their other assets. The same ar-gument may be applied to the replacementof deposits by debt securities, where banksfeature as borrowers.
The balance-sheet channelThe “balance-sheet channel” is based on the
perception that – because of the imperfec-tions of the financial market – assets play animportant role in lending decisions in the con-text of creditworthiness examinations, and ascollateral. If the interest-rate level rises owingto a restrictive monetary policy measure, thenthe present value of future payment flowstends to drop on account of the associatedincrease in the discount factor. Moreover, thehigher interest-rate level may have an adverseimpact on the level of payment flows itself –for instance, via the interest-rate and ex-change-rate channels. Both will reduce thevalue of the corresponding assets. That de-cline may mean that banks, on an average,rate their lending as more risky, and cut backtheir loan supply. As in the case of the bank-lending channel, therefore, monetary policyoperates via a change in the supply of bankloans. However, the balance-sheet channel isnot confined to bank lending; instead, it mayalso be applied in principle to other methodsof financing, too, such as securities under-writing. Hence it is designated as a “broadcredit channel” – unlike the bank-lendingchannel, which is therefore termed a “narrowcredit channel”.Empirical analysis of the credit channel
The key problem posed by the empirical an-
alysis of the credit channel is that of identify-ing, among the observed movements of thestock of loans, those which are caused by theloan supply, i.e. by the behaviour of thebanks. After all, a possible decline in thestock of loans following a restrictive monet-ary policy measure need not necessarily havebeen caused by the credit channel, but mightmerely reflect a reduction in loan demandthat was triggered, for instance, via theinterest-rate or exchange-rate channel. Exist-ing empirical studies based on aggregatedmacro data, which relate mostly to the UnitedStates, have been unable to resolve thisidentification problem satisfactorily.
4
Hence the literature has switched to usingdisaggregated data and to exploiting, for thesake of identifying supply movements, theheterogeneity between individual (or groupsof) enterprises and banks. The underlyingidea is based on the supposition that, for aborrower, the procurement of funds is all themore costly and more difficult, the greaterthe problems are that beset him as a result ofthe imperfections of the financial market. Forexample, it is suspected that a borrower whois affected to a lesser extent than others byasymmetrical information will also have bet-ter access to funds. It follows from this that, ifthe credit channel is relevant, a restrictivemonetary policy measure will not affect all

55borrowers equally, but will have a greater im-
pact on some than on others.
A borrower’s size is often used as an indicator
of the degree to which he is affected by theimperfections of the financial market. Thereason for this is the belief that large-scaleenterprises are scrutinised more closely by thegeneral public than smaller ones. Hencebanks can gather information about large en-terprises more easily, and can more readily as-sume that they will “behave well”. Based onthis hypothesis, the empirical test of thecredit channel boils down to identifying, as aresponse to a restrictive monetary policymeasure, a steeper decline in lending tosmaller enterprises than in lending to largerones.
5On the assumption that loan demand
does not respond differently to monetary pol-icy measures, depending on the size of theenterprise, potential size-specific divergencesbetween individual loan responses are inter-preted as indications of supply-side effectswithin the meaning of the credit channel.
6
Empirical analyses based ondisaggregated bank data
On the basis of the hypothesis that any with-
drawal of deposits due to monetary policymeasures can be coped with better by largebanks than by small ones, this argument islikewise applied to banks as “borrowers” inthe financial market. The reason for this is thebelief that big banks find it easier than smallones to take advantage of alternative finan-cing facilities, since they are less exposed tofinancial market imperfections. Correspond-ingly, the hypothesis under test is that, in thewake of a restrictive monetary policy meas-
ure, smaller banks cut back their lendingmore than larger ones. This hypothesis has al-ready been tested for the United States, andhas largely been borne out.
7
To date, such studies for Germany havefound no equally unequivocal results in fa-vour of a size-dependent response to monet-ary policy measures on the part of banks.
8
The reasons for that can be analysed using in-dividual bank data. For that purpose, eachbank is assigned to a size category in accord-ance with its total assets (relative to the totalassets of the other banks). Such aggregationof individual data to provide group data ad-mittedly involves a certain loss of information,but it does have some advantages. First, size-specific differences in behaviour betweenbanks emerge more clearly, which makes thedifferences more apparent. Second, time-series econometric methods can be appliedwithout difficulty.

56The above table contains data on the current
size structure of German credit institutions (asat December 2000). The category of smallbanks comprises the 75% of institutions withthe smallest total assets, the category of largebanks encompasses the 5% of institutionswith the largest total assets (all the banks inbetween are of medium size). To begin with,a marked inequality of distribution standsout: the 2,032 small banks hold no morethan 7.3% of total assets, while the 136 largebanks hold 78.2% thereof.
Over 90% of the small banks belong either
to the savings-bank sector or to the coopera-tive bank sector. Some institutions from thecategory of large banks likewise belong tothose sectors. Among the savings banks,these are the 13 Land Banks, among others,and among the cooperative banks, the four
(from the start of 2001: three) central institu-tions of cooperative banks. Both savingsbanks and cooperative banks have very closeties with their central institutions (see thetable opposite); on an average, savings bankslodge 65% of their interbank balances withthe Land Banks, 58% in short maturitiesalone. Cooperative banks actually lodge, onaverage, 90% of their interbank balanceswith their central institutions (67% in theform of short-term balances). Against this,savings banks receive, on average, 59% oftheir interbank loans from Land Banks.Among cooperative banks, the share of fundsraised from cooperative central institutions inaggregate interbank loans averages verynearly 74%. In both sectors, the loans fromcentral institutions are predominantly at longThe size structure of the German banking system

57term (among savings banks: 54%; among
cooperative banks: 70%). Hence the sub-structure mainly holds short-term balanceswith the superstructure, and chiefly obtainslong-term loans from the latter.
9
On account of these close ties, it may well bethat, in the wake of a restrictive monetarypolicy measure, small banks do not necessar-ily cut back their lending more than largeones, since intra-sectoral funds may flow toand fro between banks of different size cat-egories. As a matter of fact, an econometricanalysis shows that, following a restrictivemonetary policy measure, small banks with-draw funds from large ones (see Annex 1,p. 65ff.). In principle, such funds may beused by small banks to cushion the effects ofrestrictive monetary policy measures on theirlending to non-banks (at least for a time), forexample, for the sake of an existing bank-customer relationship.
Hence banks’ response to monetary policy
measures apparently does not depend ontheir size in Germany, because their size re-flects banks’ (potential) access to funds onlyinadequately. It must not, however, be in-ferred from this that the credit channel is ofno significance; the fact that bank size, in it-self, is not a sufficient discriminatory variablein Germany – unlike the situation in theUnited States, for example – does not ruleout the possibility that other factors accountfor differences between banks in theirresponse to monetary policy measures – dif-ferences which might be interpreted as indi-cations of a supply-side effect exerted bymonetary policy. Possible examples here are a
bank’s liquidity and its capitalisation.
The question of whether such differences be-
tween banks with respect to their response tomonetary policy measures actually exist, and,if so, of how important the associated creditchannel ultimately is for the monetary policytransmission process, is being addressed,inter alia, by the Eurosystem’s “Monetary
Transmission Network” (MTN). There, re-searchers from the ECB and the national cen-tral banks of the Eurosystem are likewiseworking to answer the question as to the roleplayed by the supply of bank loans in theSavings banks’ and cooperative banks’

to whether or not the credit channel is empir-ically relevant. The MTN is not only using theindividual data of banks, but is also analysingcorporate balance-sheet data and macroeco-nomic time series. These studies relate bothto the national level and to the entire euroarea.
In point of fact, the investigations being car-
ried out within the MTN on the basis of indi-vidual bank data have found evidence sug-gesting that banks in Germany, in response toa restrictive monetary policy measure, cutback their lending all the less, the more liquidthey are. At the present time, however, theseanalyses are not quite completed. The MTNplans to present its preliminary findings, as aset, in December 2001.
Market structure and the degree of
competitiveness on the German bankingmarket
In view of the sustained consolidation in the
German banking sector and the increasing in-tegration and liberalisation of the financialmarkets, the question arises as to the impactof these developments on competition on theGerman banking market. The efforts to fosterintegration on the European markets in finan-cial services (EU Single Market Programme)are, additionally, acting as a catalyst of furthermerging of banks beyond national borders.At the same time, however, technological ad-vances and the liberalisation and integrationof the markets are leading to greater markettransparency, easier market access and there-fore enhanced competitive pressure. In the
following sections, the relationship betweenthe degree of competitiveness and marketconditions will be explained first. Thereafter,an account will be given of structural devel-opments on the German banking market. Fi-nally, in Annex 2 on p. 67ff., the applicationof an empirical method of measuring com-petitive behaviour will be described.
The relationship between market structure or
concentration (i.e. the number of banks, andthe distribution of their market shares) andconsequent competitive behaviour is not un-ambiguous, viewed in theoretical terms. Onthe one hand, economists have assumed, inline with the classic “structure-conduct-performance paradigm,”
10that the market
structure crucially affects the competitive be-haviour of market players. According to thatapproach, a market with few suppliers fostersless competitive market behaviour (collusion),which results in a smaller volume of supplyand higher prices than under conditions ofperfect competition.
On the other hand, such an ineluctable cor-
relation between market structure and com-petitive behaviour is denied by other ap-proaches. Thus, the so-called “efficient struc-ture hypothesis”
11explains increasing con-
centration as being a consequence of the be-haviour of the more efficient firms, whichtake advantage of their greater efficiency to
10See: Bain, J., Relation of Profit Rate to Industry Con-
centration: American Manufacturing 1936–1940, Quar-

59enlarge their market shares. According to
that approach, increasing concentrationshould be rated less as a competition-redu-cing development, and more as a redistribu-tion of the market towards the more efficientsuppliers, and thus towards a greater overallefficiency of that market.
The so-called “contestable market theory”
12
likewise argues against an ineluctable rela-
tionship between increasing concentrationand decreasing competition. According tothat theory, it is not the number of suppliersactually operating on the market that deter-mines competitive behaviour, but rather theimpending market entry of external suppliers.Compared with the classic approach, here itis the potential competitor that takes theplace of the actual competitor. Hence, in as-sessing the competitive aspects of the con-centration process that has been evident onthe German banking market for some time,both efficiency considerations – especially inthe light of very small credit institutions – andthe findings of the contestable market theoryshould be taken into account.
Market structure and consolidation on
the German banking market
Characteristic features of the German bank-
ing market are, in principle, its low overall de-gree of concentration, with just over 2,700credit institutions (in December 2000), therelatively high market shares of the publicsector and the cooperative banking sector,the considerable density of bank branchesand the apparently wide dissemination ofwhat is known as “relationship banking”. Al-though a number of mergers, or intended
mergers, between major private banks some-times shape the public perception of the con-solidation process, in terms of numbers thatprocess is concentrated primarily in the co-operative banking and savings-bank sectors.Thus, the number of cooperative banks de-creased from almost 2,800 at the end of1993 to 1,800 at the end of 2000. During thesame period, a decline from 717 to 575 insti-tutions was recorded in the savings-bank sec-tor. When considering the size categories (seethe table on page 56), it will be seen thatsmall institutions continue to dominate, espe-cially among cooperative banks, so that theconsolidation process must be viewed primar-ily from the point of view of enhancing effi-ciency, and less as a concentration processposing a threat to competition.
The reduction in the number of branches has
proceeded somewhat more slowly, but quitesteadily. Between 1998 and the end of 2000,the number of branches decreased by almost2,000, to a thoroughly ample 39,600
13(see
the table on page 25). Relative to the popula-tion figure, bank density in Germany stillworks out at about 48 bank branches per100,000 inhabitants. Added to these at theend of 2000 were some 13,600 branches ofPostbank AG (against 14,700 at end-1998),which has likewise distinctly reduced itsbranch network in recent years. Accompany-ing the reduction in the branch network, atthe same time the number of ATMs put up by

60banks rose from about 19,000 at the end of
1992, via just under 36,000 at the end of1995, to 46,200 at end-1999. They enablecustomers to avail themselves, on a virtuallynationwide basis, of a number of basic ser-vices, such as withdrawing cash, and also toperform credit transfers by using other auto-mated machines.
As regards the distribution of market shares,
a certain increase in concentration on theGerman banking market has been discerniblein the course of the consolidation process ofthe past few years, although that increasemust still be rated small by internationalstandards. As measured by the balance-sheettotal, the five biggest banks accounted forjust over 21% of the market at the end of2000, against 16% at end-1993 and 19% atend-1998 (see the box opposite).
14On a
European comparison, Germany thereforeremains at the bottom of the table. In Europe,the average market share of the five biggestbanks came to 57% at the end of 1999.In this connection, especially smaller coun-tries with a small number of banks account-ed for the highest figures.

Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (another yard-stick of market structure that is often used)likewise indicates for Germany a slight in-crease in market concentration in recentyears, but that, too, is running at a low level.When using such national yardsticks, whichindirectly assume market delineations corres-ponding to national borders, it must, how-ever, be borne in mind that, for parts of banklending and deposit business, competition isoften confined to smaller regional markets.Such national yardsticks of concentration giveno indication of the structure of such regional
markets, nor of any local market powerwielded by individual banks.
In recent years, however, banks’ share in ag-
gregate financial investment and financingoperations has declined markedly in the wakeof the increasing securitisation of financial re-lations.
16For instance, the significance of
bank loans in the financing of the non-financial sector (especially of enterprises) iscontinuing to diminish (see the table onpage 62). While the share of bank loans in thetotal liabilities of the domestic non-financialsectors was almost 62% at the beginning ofthe nineties, it was only 57% at the end of1999; in the same period, the share in the ag-gregate liabilities of enterprises decreasedfrom just over 51% to barely 43%.
17An
even more pronounced decline was regis-tered in financial assets. Whereas, at the be-ginning of the nineties, banks accounted foralmost 42% of the financial investments ofthe domestic non-financial sector in the formof bank deposits,
18by the end of 1999 such
deposits made up barely 30% of the total; inthe case of households’ financial assets,banks’ share fell from 46% to 35%. That
14The figures do not include groups, and are confined
to the domestic part. If non-resident or group figures
were included, the share would be distinctly higher.

17These figures from the financial accounts on the basis
of ESA 95 relate to nominal values for securities. A com-
putation at market rates for securities makes the shares
of bank loans in external financing (particularly that of
enterprises) turn out much lower, in part owing to the
marked rise in share prices.

used in connection with questions of competition are the
so-called “Concentration Ratios” (CRs), which measure the
market share, in per cent, of the biggest three, five or tenbanks, relative to the entire market. The reference vari-ables for that purpose are usually the balance-sheet total,
the lending volume or the volume of deposits.
CR (m) =  ∑ MAii=1m
(m= number of the (e.g. 3, 5 or 10) biggest banks, MA=
market share in percentage points)
To take account both of the total number of banks and of
the distribution of market shares within a concentration
ratio, the “Herfindahl-Hirschmann-Index” (HHI) 1is like-
wise used. It represents the sum total of squared marketshares of all banks on a market; larger market shares are
weighted particularly heavily by the squaring. It thus takes
account both of the total number of banks operating on amarket and of the unequal distribution of market sharesamong them, even though, as regards competitive behav-iour, there is no ineluctable correlation between the num-
ber of banks on a market or an unequal distribution of
market shares and the market power exercised. (Its theor-etical maximum value is 100 * 100 = 10,000 in the case of a
monopoly).
HHI =  ∑ MAii=1n2
(n = total number of banks)
In terms of the possibly prevailing competitive behaviour,
both ratios must be rated only as preliminary rough indica-tors. On account of the simplicity of their calculation, and of
the often limited availability of data, which did not always
enable more detailed empirical investigations to be made,t h e s er a t i o sc o n t i n u et ob ei nw i d e s p r e a du s e .Ap r o b l e mi sposed in this connection, however (as in all studies of com-
petition), by the question of market delineation. Measures
of market structure which describe an entire national mar-ket thereby indirectly assume that national boundariesmark out the competitive room for manoeuvre. As a matter
of fact, however, markets in lending business and deposit
business are often comparatively locally defined, with theresult that national concentration ratios may not say muchabout the actually prevailing market structures.
For the nationally defined German banking market, the
concentration ratios are as follows:

62owed very much to the intensification of com-
petition on account of the authorisation ofmoney-market funds in 1994 and the growingacquisition of investment-fund certificates.
Funds and insurance firms have been com-
peting more fiercely recently for the financialassets of households, in particular. New so-called “hybrid financial products”, whichcombine the properties of different financialassets (such as fund certificates, savings pass-books and/or insurance benefits), step up thecompetitive pressure on banks. Such compe-tition from the non-bank sector, in what isknown as the “bankassurance” field, inwhich the borderlines between differentforms of investment are becoming increasing-ly blurred, compels the banks to committhemselves more deeply in that area. Thepension reform due to take effect in 2002,
with its support for private provision for oldage, will intensify that tendency even further.
Banks’ lending business is determined to a
large degree by the structure of the Germaneconomy, with its many small and medium-sized businesses. Given the heavy costs in-volved in issuing bonds and shares, such smalland medium-sized firms are highly dependenton bank lending for their external financing.Because of information asymmetries, whichare particularly marked in those economicsectors, relationship banking

63paratively important role in their financing
operations. As can be seen from the adjacentchart, the significance of bank loans for smallfirms actually seems to have increased duringthe nineties, whereas it tended to declineamong enterprises with a turnover of morethan DM 100 million. In the field of the finan-cing of small and medium-sized firms, it isoften savings banks and cooperative banksthat assume the role of principal bankers.
To date, domestic credit institutions have only
sporadically felt competition from foreignbanks in the field of classic deposit and lend-ing business. Especially in the sphere of inter-national payments, or securities, foreign ex-change and derivatives trading, foreign banksare strongly represented, and there, as well asin investment banking (such as the areas ofunderwriting or counselling on mergers andtakeovers), they compete directly with largedomestic banks, in particular. By contrast, for-eign banks – with a few exceptions – have sofar made fewer inroads into business with pri-vate customers and retail business, even if,thanks to the new technologies, access tothese markets by means of so-called directbanking, whereby the customer is in touch bytelephone or Internet, is now distinctly easier,compared with the construction of a costlybranch network.
The Internet, in particular, has crucially
changed the face of banking in many re-spects, and thereby imparted a new dimen-sion to competition in the area of financialservices. The resultant new marketing chan-nels facilitate the market access of “new”banks or financial-service providers, especiallyin retail and brokerage business, despite the
need for heavy IT investment, compared withthe construction of a sizeable, personnel-intensive branch network. With growing mar-ket transparency, decreasing informationcosts and consequent higher mobility on thepart of customers, the pace of market accesshas likewise quickened.

64terms. For banks already on the market, that
greatly enhances the competitive pressureexerted by potential rivals, particularly inparts of retail banking.
Furthermore, information technology facili-
tates the low-cost standardisation of financialproducts, and their adjustment to customers’particular needs, thus intensifying competi-tion in those business areas. Correspondingly,expansion in that sphere, notably in Germany,is proceeding at lightning speed.
20Last year
alone, according to data supplied by theFederal Association of German Banks, thenumber of accounts carried on line rose from10 million at the end of 1999 to 15 million atthe end of 2000. Since, according to a surveycarried out by the opinion research institutionforsa, 27 million people in Germany alreadyhave access to the Internet, marketing via theInternet is likely to increase in popularity. Inthe course of the new developments in tele-communications technology, including mo-bile access to the Internet, further marketingopportunities will probably open up there inthe not-too-distant future, and/or broadersegments of that market will be tapped.
Conclusions as to competitive behaviourWhen we consider structural changes on the
German banking market, it becomes plainthat they are not confined to mere consolida-tion. In view of the new marketing channelsarising via the Internet, market access has be-come distinctly easier for banks and other fi-nancial service-providers. Enhanced markettransparency and lower information costs af-ford customers greater opportunities for com-paring terms and conditions, and increase
their mobility. At the same time, the range ofpotential competitors for banks has growncontinuously with the creation of the singleEuropean banking market and the advanceof disintermediation. Overall, therefore, im-pending market entry is likely to have becomea factor encouraging competition on the Ger-man banking market. Against that back-ground, the manifest consolidation mightalso be viewed as a reflection of competition.Since these considerations contradict theclose relationship between market structureand market behaviour suggested by the clas-sic “structure-conduct-performance para-digm”, the New Empirical Industrial Organisa-tion (NEIO)
21approach – rather than relying
solely on some rather approximate market-structure ratios – is trying to assess competi-tive behaviour with the aid of empiricalmethods.
The application of one of these methods to
the German banking market
22is described in

65Annex 2 to this article.23That method en-
deavours to draw conclusions as to banks’competitive behaviour indirectly by estimat-ing banks’ behavioural equations, taking ad-vantage of the information available at thelevel of individual banks. The study is basedon the disaggregated statistics of all credit in-stitutions in Germany reporting for themonthly balance-sheet statistics, over theperiod from 1993 to 1998. On balance, des-pite a slight increase in concentration on theGerman banking market, as measured bymarket-structure indices, during the nineties,
the study finds no evidence of a reduction incompetitiveness accompanying this structuralchange. At the same time, differences arenoted in the competitive behaviour of thevarious categories of banks and of severalsize categories.
Annex 1
Interbank operations in the wake of monetary
policy measures
The response of interbank variables to monetary
policy measures is ascertained in this annex withthe help of a vector autoregressive (VAR) model.
24
First, the common dynamic behaviour of a groupof variables is estimated. Second, on the basis ofthe findings of that estimation, we computewhether, and if so how, an exogenous monetarypolicy measure affects the variables included. Thedevelopment of these effects over time is then pre-sented graphically in the form of “Impulse-response functions”.
To examine how the interbank operations of large
and small banks respond to a monetary policymeasure, credit institutions are subdivided into sizecategories, as in the table on page 56. For thatpurpose, data must be available at the level of indi-vidual banks, since only then can the distributionof total assets among all banks be calculated, anda corresponding categorisation based on tworatios of that distribution (the 75
thand 95thper-
centiles) be effected.
For each category, net interbank claims (interbank
claims less interbank liabilities) are computed.25For
every savings bank and cooperative bank, the indi-vidual figures also include the interbank claims onand interbank liabilities to the central institutionsof their respective associations. For each of thesecentral institutions, in turn, the interbank claimson and liabilities to the affiliated institutions oftheir respective associations are known. For eachbank in either of these sectors, in other words, thenet interbank claims can be subdivided into claimson affiliated banks within the sector (“intra-sectoral” claims), and claims on other banks.23Comprehensive findings will be presented in a discus-
sion paper which will appear towards the end of the
year: Hempell, H.S., Testing for Competition among Ger-
man Banks, Economic Research Centre of the Deutsche
Bundesbank.

67The VAR model contains the following variables, at
monthly frequency: a short-term interest rate i,an
inflation variable pand a variable for real output y.
In addition, the intra-sectoral net interbank claimsof large banks l
Gare also included. To be able to
assess the response of various other interbank vari-ables to a monetary shock, the model is enlargedby an additional interbank variable l. Hence, a VAR
model is estimated for each of these interbankvariables l. The net interbank claims of large banks
l
Gare to be found in each of these estimates, since
that ensures their mutual comparability.
Possible non-stationarities of the time series in-
cluded are taken into account by means of co-inte-gration relationships:
26the first one expresses ias
a function of pandy, and may be interpreted as a
monetary policy reaction function; the second onedescribes the relationship between iandp, and
constitutes a real interest-rate equation. The thirdand fourth describe the relationship between iand
either of the interbank variables l
Gandl.
Exogenous interest-rate changes (“monetary pol-
icy shocks”) are identified by two assumptions: (1)in the long run, all variables return to their initialvalue and (2) interest-rate shocks do not affect in-flation and output as early as the same month.
Chart 1 includes four impulse-response functions
of an exogenous increase in the short-term interestrate. Figure 1a indicates that, after the shock, thenet claims of large banks on banks outside theirown sector drop significantly. This implies that thecategory of large banks either raises loans fromother banks and/or reduces its balances held withother banks. A more precise analysis shows thatthese funds come primarily from foreign banks. Inthe case of small banks, no significant response ofnet claims on banks outside their own sector canbe discerned (Figure 1b). However, their intra-
sectoral net interbank claims decrease (Figure 1d).A more detailed analysis shows that this is mainlybecause small banks run down their short-termbalances (maturities of up to 3 months) held withthe large institutions of their own sector. As a mir-ror image, that reduction is accompanied by a risein the intra-sectoral net interbank claims of largebanks, above all because their interbank liabilitiesdecrease correspondingly (Figure 1c).
Annex 2
Empirical study of competitive behaviour onthe German banking market
27
Besides pure market-structure ratios, whose rela-tionship with actual market behaviour is not un-ambiguous, the so-called New Empirical IndustrialOrganisation (NEIO) approach offers a number ofempirical methods of examining the competitivesituation on markets – methods which are beingused in the economic literature in the field ofbanking competition, too. As well as labour inputand real capital, bank deposits are interpreted asinput factors of the production technology ofbanks in the context of what is known as the“intermediation approach”. One of these empiric-al approaches was developed by Panzar and

H,1 monopolistic competition
H#0 monopoly or perfect collusion
The intuition behind this approach is as follows:
given perfect competition, the banks, in line withthe assumptions, produce in the area of minimumlong-term average costs, and a rise in marginalcosts is therefore identical to an increase in aver-age costs. Revenues (R)are precisely equal to
costs, and the price is equal to the marginal cost ofone additionally produced unit, with the resultthat, if factor prices go up, earnings are bound toincrease to the same extent for an individual bank,provided that the quantity produced remains con-stant.

69rise is effected by certain banks quitting the mar-
ket.
In the event of a monopoly, or of perfect collusion
by the banks operating on the market, thosebanks produce just so much that the marginal rev-enue of one additional unit is precisely equal to themarginal costs. Given a constant quantity pro-duced, the marginal costs go up owing to the rais-ing of factor prices, but not the marginal revenues.Hence the banks reduce the quantity to such anextent that the additional revenues again tally withthe higher marginal costs on account of the simul-taneous price increase. Since the higher prices can-not offset the decline in revenues owing to thequantity effect, aggregate revenues fall and there-foreH<0 .As the third case, Panzar and Rosse distinguish the
situation of monopolistic competition, in which, al-though banks behave like monopolists, the marketentry or exit of other enterprises that offer imper-fect rival products makes them always generateprecisely zero profits. In that case, as the authorsshow, the sum total of factor-price elasticities isH< 1, and may actually be smaller than zero in
the case of rival products that are conspicuouslypoor substitutes. In the literature, moreover, ahigher Hstatistic is sometimes interpreted as an

71Uncertainty,
freedom of actionand investmentbehaviour –empirical findingsfor GermanyInvestment in the buildup and mod-
ernisation of the capital stock is a keyvariable in the economic developmentand prosperity of a country. Privateinvestment requires entrepreneurs todeal with a basic phenomenon: uncer-tainty. One might say that investmentis like “betting on the future”.
There is no clear theoretical relation-
ship between investment and uncer-tainty. Since uncertainty also involvesentrepreneurial opportunity, it maynot only produce dampening effectsbut might also promote investment.The extent of the entrepreneurial free-dom of action is important in deter-mining which of the two types ofeffects will prevail.
Drawing on the more recent literature
on investment, this article uses cor-porate balance-sheet data of theDeutsche Bundesbank to examine theinvestment behaviour of 6,745 enter-prises. The main result is that the effectof uncertainty on investment behav-iour is definitely negative. For econom-ic policy makers, the maxim that fol-lows from this is to ensure certainty ofplanning wherever possible and toopen up – and keep open – the free-dom of entrepreneurs to take action.

72The role of uncertainty in investment
decisions
An understanding of factors that motivate
entrepreneurial fixed investment is extremelyimportant to economic policy makers in gen-eral and to central banks in particular. Ex-perience has shown that investment in fixedassets is a very volatile component of macro-economic demand. This makes it an excep-tionally dynamic factor in the entire businesscycle, and thus difficult to forecast. However,its second feature is more important. Positivenet investment is tantamount to growth ofthe macroeconomic capital stock and – in linewith its factor productivity – of potential out-put.
1Investment is therefore a key founda-
tion of material prosperity. By either investingor not investing, burdens and benefits can beshifted back and forth between generationsand over time.
2
In principle, an additional investment projectis advantageous if and only if the expectedmarket value of the project exceeds theamount spent on purchasing and installingthe capital good. If investment is made, thisleads to additional revenue. This “marginalrevenue” must be weighed by the investoragainst the costs being incurred because thefunds are tied up in the enterprise for alengthy period of time and cannot be put toanother use.
3
Knowledge of future developments is alwayssketchy. Therefore, investment is essentiallyakin to “betting on the future”. Those whoundertake an investment project under mar-ket conditions, such as purchasing a ware-house, building a multi-family house or es-
tablishing a new production line, will not beable to avoid accountability to themselves orothers regarding the expected revenue. Butimportant data on the cost side such as inputprices, wages and interest, are hidden in thefuture.
If the investors’ expectations turn out to be
erroneous, they must bear the economic con-sequences of unfavourable sales or cost de-velopments. On the other hand, they alsoreap the benefits of unexpectedly favourablemarket developments. Hence investors tietheir economic fate to factors which theyhave only incomplete knowledge of and con-trol over. This is the essence of their entrepre-neurial risk, and without the willingness toincur such a risk, i.e. to “bet on the future”,all long-term economic activity would cease.Uncertainty is what makes entrepreneurship,in its strict sense, necessary in the first place.Within society’s division of labour, one mightsay that entrepreneurs are experts in dealingwith uncertainty.
In light of the mediocre success that tradition-
al models have had in attempting to satisfac-torily explain observed patterns of investmentbehaviour, research on the effects of uncer-

73tainty has undergone a renaissance. What
may come as a surprise, though, is that in-creased risk does not necessarily harm invest-ment activity per se.
However, there are certainly a number of
valid reasons for such a negative effect. Mosteconomic agents tend to be risk-averse. Pre-sented with a choice, they prefer certain re-turns over uncertain returns if the expectedlevel is the same in both cases. Entrepre-neurial risk is thus subjectively perceived as a“bad” which is only accepted in return forthe prospect of higher returns. Generally thisextra return will have to be higher if theexisting information on the future is less pre-cise. Such a correlation between the non-diversifiable, systematic part of risk and therisk premium demanded by investors con-tinues to hold when all options for diversify-ing risk have been exhausted.
The financing of risky projects can turn out
to be difficult owing to what is called theprincipal-agent problem. If a company’s man-agement is better informed than the externalproviders of capital (lenders or shareholders),management will have an incentive to exploitthis knowledge advantage. For their part,providers of capital must live with the conse-quences of such selfish behaviour – whichcan range anywhere from lower returns tototal loss of invested capital – and will do allthey can to hedge against such losses. Forgood reason, therefore, providers of capitalare more careful with commitments if thedecision makers are largely uncontrolled. In-formation asymmetry is especially great if theprofitability of an investment project is diffi-cult to assess from the outside – meaning
that a higher level of uncertainty exists. Be-sides additional risk premiums or limits in theamount of funds lent by banks, a further con-sequence may be that promising projects willnot find anyone willing to finance them inthe market for equity, either. That has noth-ing to do with the risk propensity of pro-viders of capital: asymmetrical informationalso makes financing more difficult in thosecases where all parties involved are indifferentto risk.
A third chain of causality has only recently
come to the forefront of academic debateand has also entered the literature of businessmanagement as the real option model of in-vestment.
4Traditional models of investment
take account of uncertainty by converting theexpected returns into what are called cer-tainty equivalents or include a risk premiumin the discount factor. However, this does notaccount for the fact that in most cases invest-ment is difficult or impossible to reverse. Thisengenders asymmetrical adjustment costs.Whereas in principle it is relatively easy toraise the capital stock, it is often only possibleto get rid of it by either selling it far below itsoriginal price or scrapping it. If the investorhas the option of postponing the implemen-tation of such a project, tying up capital irre-versibly becomes more expensive if the de-gree of uncertainty is high. The less investorsknow about future developments, the more

74difficult it is for them to make an irreversible
commitment in the present.
Where investment is made immediately, the
company not only gives up the monetaryequivalent of the capital good it has pur-chased, but also sacrifices the option of beingable to decide again at a later time based onimproved information. From the company’spoint of view such an investment opportunityis a “real option”, the value of which can, inprinciple, be calculated just like that of a calloption on a dividend-bearing security. If in-vestment is made now, the option on a futuredecision is sacrificed. In a rational investmentdecision, the value of this option must betaken into account as an additional cost com-ponent. This raises the opportunity cost ofthe decision to invest, which, in turn, raisesthe profitability threshold. This yield premium,as is typical of option prices, is dependent onthe level of uncertainty regarding the courseof future profitability. In Appendix 1 this sub-ject will be discussed more thoroughly for thetwo-period case.
Where uncertainty is great, it often appears
advisable for entrepreneurs to hold on totheir option, thereby maintaining their abilityto adapt to economic developments whichare still murky. Therefore, a relatively longperiod of heightened uncertainty can easilylead to a “wait-and-see” attitude towardsinvestment. This general principle can also beapplied to the demand for durable consumergoods, efforts to explore sources of raw ma-terials and decisions to enter or exit the mar-ket. The effect of job protection rules on thedemand for labour can also be studied using
this versatile analytical instrument.
5
The influence channels outlined so far tendto suggest that uncertainty has a dampeningimpact on investment activity. However, in-creasing uncertainty heightens not only therisks but also the opportunities of entrepre-neurial activity. Those investing in their capitalstock today are at the same time purchasingnew opportunities to take action which re-main closed to the hesitant. If an entrepre-neur is able to adjust in a sufficiently flexiblemanner to the situation, uncertainty can evenadd economic value to the investment project.This mechanism, also known as the Hartman-Abel effect,
6applies where, at the time of the
investment, uncertainty about the outputprice exists, yet the amounts of variable fac-tors of production being deployed, such as la-bour, energy or raw materials, can optimallybe adjusted to different demand situations.In Appendix 2 this will be explained in depthusing a two-period example.
If investors are able to adapt production opti-
mally to changing circumstances, they there-by systematically increase the weight of fa-vourable developments relative to less favour-able events. Thus, uncertainty increases theexpected value of the return and can thus bean independent incentive to invest. To a cer-tain degree this is a complement to earlier

75statements in this article that in an irreversible
investment situation the cost of tying up cap-ital rises with growing uncertainty. This pat-tern once again underlines the fact that flexi-bility and freedom of action are key variablesin investment behaviour.
On the other hand, though, the above con-
siderations make it clear that the impactof uncertainty on the investment behaviourof profit-oriented entrepreneurs depends onthe specific circumstances. Depending on thetype of project, the enterprise’s technology,its market position and the nature of uncer-tainty, the underlying phenomenon of un-certainty can either prevent or attract entre-preneurial investment.

How and to what extent does uncertaintyaffect the “bet on the future” when lookingat an aggregate of projects and enterprises?This can only be answered empirically, yet thefindings do not permit any definite conclu-sions to be made. There are only a very fewresults available for Germany,

Microeconomic data are fundamentally bet-ter suited to explain the role of uncertaintythan macroeconomic data.

76ing. In that context, up until the end of the
nineties an average of nearly 70,000 annualaccounts were sent to the Bundesbank’sbranch offices every year for processing.Once they have been thoroughly reviewedand checked, these accounts form the database for corporate balance-sheet statistics.With respect to manufacturing companiesin western Germany, the data base coversaround 75% of the aggregate turnover, butonly around 8% of the total number ofenterprises.
Technically speaking, the set of data under-
lying this study is called a panel. It containsnot only information on a large number of in-dividual enterprises at a fixed point in timebut can also follow the development of thoseenterprises over time. A panel contains a con-siderably larger volume of information thanpurely cross-sectional data or time series.
However, it is not possible to use the whole
panel of data from corporate balance-sheetstatistics for econometric evaluation. Forcomparability reasons, the study is limited towestern German manufacturing corporationsand to the period between 1987 and 1997.Furthermore, only part of the annual ac-counts contains sufficiently exact informationon the capital stock and investment. For stat-istical reasons, uncertainty can only be meas-ured in those enterprises where annual ac-counts exist for at least eight consecutive fi-nancial years. After excluding statistical out-liers, the panel is left with 6,745 firms andnearly 50,000 observations.

77western German manufacturing industry rela-

The estimation approach
In order to be econometrically useful, a meas-
ure of uncertainty must vary not only overtime but also among firms. Uncertainty is acharacteristic of the subjective image that de-cision-makers form of their environment andcannot be recorded with the same precisionas the prices or quantity of output.
The reference variable is profit, defined as the
difference between earnings and costs. Forboth variables, uncertainty indicators are con-structed from their respective volatility. Theunderlying premise is as follows: the moresharply revenue and costs have fluctuated inthe past few years, the less certain the entre-preneur in question is regarding their futuredevelopment.
For real sales, initially a first-order auto-
regressive equation with a firm-specific con-stant was estimated for 78 groups of firms.The groups were formed using the character-istics of sector and size. The residues of theestimation for a given company and a givenyear can be interpreted as a firm-specific“sales shock”. As an indicator of sales un-certainty, the square of the sum of residualsquares was formed for the past three years.An analogous approach was used to con-
struct an indicator for cost uncertainty. A realcost variable was formed by calculating thedifference between sales and the operatingresult and deflating it with output prices.Since costs are to a great degree determinedby the amount sold, in a second step for eachcompany a least-squares regression of costson real sales was conducted. This filtered outall direct and indirect linear effects of earn-ings on costs. The residues left over are inter-preted as time-specific and firm-specific “costshocks” and taken to form uncertainty indi-cators similarly to sales shocks.
The decision on the investment equation to
be estimated is also important. If a significantfactor is left out, something might be attrib-uted to uncertainty although its cause is com-pletely different. The study uses the frequent-ly adopted “accelerator equation”, in whichchanges in real sales play a key role. More-over, the company’s cash flow was enteredinto the equation to take account of enter-prises’ profit expectations and financing con-straints. The influence of interest and taxeson the user costs of capital, just like turbu-lence following German unification and othercyclical disruptions, were filtered out by ad-justing for all macroeconomic movementsusing time dummies. Finally, the two uncer-tainty variables were included and testedboth in isolation and in combination with oneanother.

78The main results of the study
As the estimated results show, uncertainty
may be classified as clearly disruptive to de-mand for investment. The strength of thenegative effect is considerable. This becomesevident if one looks at an average deviation ofthe indicators from their mean value, alsoknown as a standard deviation. If both indica-tors deviate upwards by one standard devi-ation, companies’ investment will decline byan average of around 6
12%. A downward
deviation would, ceteris paribus, cause invest-ment activity to go up accordingly. In addition,sales and cost uncertainty have roughly thesame importance, i.e. each is responsible forroughly half of the overall effect.
Conversely, this means that the potentially
positive impact, the Hartman-Abel effect, isapparently not dominant in Germany. As ex-plained above, this transmission mechanismpresupposes that the use of important vari-able factors can be adjusted to changing mar-ket conditions rapidly and at minor cost. Inmany cases the interplay of various labour-market-policy rules and high recruitmentcosts make such rapid adjustment to chan-ging operational conditions more difficult. Insuch an institutional environment, though,the Hartman-Abel effect can only prevail incertain market niches, if at all.
11
However, diagnosing a net negative effectdoes not permit one to conclude which ofthe three possible channels – risk aversion,asymmetrical information or irreversibility – isthe chief culprit. Particularly the role of the fi-nancial structure in investment behaviour willneed to be clarified in further studies by the
Bundesbank and the research network of theEurosystem’s central banks.
In economic policy terms, it becomes clear
that it will be much less difficult for Germanentrepreneurs to “bet on the future” if theyknow where they stand within their econom-ic environment. However, this certainly can-not mean that the government could orshould relieve them of their entrepreneurialrisk. Yet the government, through reliableeconomic policies, can provide a stable foun-dation for private-sector planning. This wouldalso enhance companies’ willingness to in-vest.
However, an even more important element in
regulatory policy terms is to create and main-tain entrepreneurial freedom of action. Themore the hands of tomorrow’s investors aretied, the more hesitant they will be today andthe less real capital they will provide to thesite in question. By contrast, more flexibility inoperations management, such as in regulatingworking hours, will create incentives to invest.The additional capacity, once it has been cre-ated, also benefits labour as a factor of pro-duction, through increased employment and,over the longer term, higher wages.
11If the capital intensity chosen at one point in time
must be maintained until the end of a capital good’s life-
cycle, this does not mean that the corporate sector could
not adjust to changes in the business environment over
the medium and long term. Investment in rationalisa-
tion is just as possible as is non-reinvestment or the drop-
ping of expansion plans or even terminating operations
at certain sites entirely. The medium-term consequences
of the attempt to use the short-term immobility of capital
as a factor of production for high wage demands are
covered in: Deutsche Bundesbank, Factor prices, employ-
ment and capital stock in Germany: results of a simula-
tion study, Monthly Report, July 2001, page 49ff.

investment projects which are not only irreversiblebut where there is also discretionary scope regard-ing the choice of when to invest. Those two char-acteristics are crucially important under uncer-tainty. The key statement is: in order for an irre-versible investment to be made under uncertainty,the expected return must be greater than if the in-vestment were freely reversible or if certainty wereto exist. There are two equivalent methods of justi-fying this in economic terms:
– Irreversibility constitutes a restriction in future
entrepreneurial activity. There is a certain prob-ability that this restriction will be binding infuture periods, in which the capital stock willprove to be too big. Yet since the latter cannotbe reduced, the capacity overhang causeslosses which could have been avoided if the in-vestor would have waited. If the investment isto be made, the expected return must coverthis possibility of a loss.
– Making an irreversible investment robs the in-
vestor of the opportunity to make the investmentdecision at a later point in time. This possibility –given imperfect competition, at any rate – gener-ally has a positive value. From the entrepreneur’spoint of view the investment opportunity repre-sents a real option, the value of which can be cal-culated like that of an option to purchase a divi-dend-bearing security. If the investment is made,the option is gone. Its value must therefore betaken into account in the investment decision asan additional opportunity cost.1. A simple two-period model
This basic statement can be explained in some-
what more depth using a two-period model.
12To
start with, the structure of two-period irreversibleinvestment decisions is characterised by maximis-ing expected returns. Then, the principles of op-tion valuation are explained. Building upon that, itwill be shown that an irreversible investment deci-sion can just as easily be described as a decision onwhether to exercise a real option.
In the example, it shall be assumed that a potential
investor wants to build a factory and has a choicebetween two possible dates for investment. Thereare irreversible costs of I = 1,600 money units(MU), i.e. these costs must be borne in full even ifthe project ends up losing money. In every period,the factory produces one unit of output, theprice of which moves at random. Let the price attime t = 0 be 200 MU. In the next period it will risewith a probability of q = 0.5 to 300 MU. With thereverse probability 1 – q = 0.5 it will fall to 100 MU.Then the price remains at its new level forever.
For simplicity, this model does not include ongoing
production costs; the development of prices istherefore identical with the development of re-turns. Finally, it shall also be assumed for simplicitythat either the investor is risk-neutral or the pricedevelopment risk can be eliminated by means of asuitable method of diversification. In this case, theexpected payment flows are relevant to the invest-ment decision, and they can be discounted at
12For a similar explanation see, among others: Pindyck,

ment. Journal of Economic Literature, 29, pages 1110 to
1148. The formulas and calculations in this section were

81interest rate R for risk-free investment. In this
example, let R = 10%.
If the investor is unable to delay the decision, it is
necessary to check whether the investment willlead to a positive net present value (NPV) if it ismade in t = 0. The result for the (expected) netpresent value is:
( 1.1)tE(Pt)(1) E(NPV) = – 1,600+ ∑ = 600,
t=0∞
since E(P t) = 200 for all values of t. Since the
present value of the expected net payments ex-ceeds the one-off purchase costs, the investmentshould be made according to the net present valuecriterion.
Now, if the investor is able to postpone the deci-
sion to a later point in time, this creates the oppor-tunity to track price developments. If the pricegoes down to P
1=100, the investment no longer
pays off: the present value of the returns in t = 1would then only be 1,100 MU, which would notcover the initial outlays. For P
1=100 no investment
is made and the losses associated with this envir-onment are avoided. By contrast, in the best-casescenario, where P
1=300, investment is profitable.
Further hesitation would be senseless, only leadingto the loss of current income.
If the expected value of the net present value
NPV* is calculated for the delay of investment forone period, the result is:
E(NPV*) = 0.5 · 0 + 0.5 · [ – +∑1,600
1.1300
( 1.1)t] = 772.73 MU 
t=1∞
It is apparent that the project’s expected present
value is greater if the decision is put off. A rationalinvestor will therefore not make the investmentright away although the expected net presentvalue is positive. Instead, it is better to wait and in-
vest only when the price movements are advan-tageous. The difference between the two netpresent values, 172.73 MU, denotes the value ofthe option of waiting one period before decidingwhether or not to invest.
2. The binomial model of option pricingTreating an investment opportunity as an option in
the analytical sense, too, is possible and revealing.The decision maker has the right to make an in-vestment outlay within a certain time period andto acquire a project whose value fluctuates sto-chastically over time. This decision resembles thatof the owner of a call option on a dividend-bearingsecurity, such as a share. The decision on the opti-mum time of the investment can therefore bemodelled just like the decision on exercising a calloption.
In the following, the binomial option pricing model
will be explained, with the help of which such op-tions can be evaluated. It was developed by Cox,Ross and Rubinstein (1979).
13In its simplest ver-
sion, with two points in time, it may be applieddirectly to the above case.
A security will be examined, the price of which
(prior to dividend payment) is subject to a simplestochastic process:
V
t=w tVt-1
The factor w tis a random variable. With a prob-
ability of q it assumes the value u and, with the re-verse probability 1 – q, a lower value d. The values

pricing: A simplified approach, Journal of Financial Eco-
nomics, 7, pages 229 to 263, 1979.

82u and d therefore give the price changes in the
best-case and worst-case scenarios, respectively.At the end of period t, or at the beginning of t + 1,the holder of the security receives a dividend of
D
t=dVt.
Holding a security during a period, i.e. between
t = 0 and t = 1, will lead in the second period, witha probability of 1, to the value (u+ d)V
0and with
the probability of 1–q to a lower value (d+ d)V0.
V0(u + d)V0
(d + d)V0q

A call option gives its holder the right to buy the
security at a fixed price K, the strike price, from theoption seller. There are two basic types. A Euro-pean option grants the right to purchase the paperat only one single point in time, at maturity. Theholder of an American option, by contrast, can ex-ercise the right to purchase at any single point intime prior to maturity. Here, a European optionwith a maturity of one period will be examined;the purchaser therefore has the right to purchasethe underlying security in the following period atprice K. The value of the option at the time ofmaturity, F
1, can be determined for all states of
nature. It is calculated using the returns underoptimum behaviour:
(2) F
1= max[V 1–K,0]
This value is a function of V 1=w 1V0and thus itself
a random variable. F uis the value for favourable
price developments, F dthat given unfavourable
price developments. Both values are non-negative.It is in the option’s nature that it does not need to
be exercised and therefore never leads to net out-payments. Option price theory looks at the pricesof other marketable assets and calculates the valueof the option according to the best arbitrage possi-bilities.
To value the option an “equivalent portfolio” is
built with a pattern of yields that exactly tracks de-velopments in the value of the option. It has twocomponents: a number of units of the underlyingsecurity, and credit liabilities. The composition ofthe equivalent portfolio is selected in such a wayas to generate the same payments as the option it-self under all possible states of nature. Then, inequilibrium, the market price of the option mustequal the value of its equivalent portfolio. Other-wise, by issuing new options while simultaneouslypurchasing the equivalent portfolio or by buyingthe option and selling the portfolio, one can reapvirtually unlimited risk-free arbitrage profits.
In general, the value of a financial investment is
measured in terms of the cash flows it generates.If a financial investment leads to the same pay-ments as another financial investment for all statesof nature with a positive probability, those invest-ments are perfect substitutes and have the samevalue.
Let it be assumed that the investor, by issuing or
purchasing zero-coupon bonds, could invest anyamount of money at the market rate R or borrowmoney. Let the associated interest factor ber=(1+R). If R and dare equilibrium rates of return,
the following must hold:
u+d.r.d+d

83The interest factor belonging to the risk-free secur-
ity must be higher than the percentage value de-velopment of the risky security given an unfavour-able price development. Otherwise, even given anunfavourable price development, the total returnon the share would be higher than that on therisk-free investment, and unlimited arbitrageprofits would be possible. For the same reason,given a favourable development, the return on thesecurity must be higher than r.
Now, let Q
Vbe the number of dividend-yielding se-
curities contained in the equivalent portfolio andQ
Bthe number of zero bonds with a price normal-
ised to unity. Q Bis negative if the investor borrows
money on the capital market. The market value ofthe portfolio, in t=0, is:
(3) F
0=V0QV+QB
At the point in time t =1, after the dividends have
been paid and the interest has matured, the valueof the portfolio is:
F
1=(w+ d)V0QV+rQ B
The portfolio, Q Vand Q B, must be chosen such
that its value corresponds to that of the option inevery state of nature:
uV
0QV+dV0QV+rQ B=Fu
dV0QV+dV0QV+rQ B=Fd
Solving this system leads to:
Fd – Fu
d – uQB = Fu (d + d) – Fd (u + d)
(d – u)r, and V0QV = 
This determines the equivalent portfolio. The value
of the European option is equal to the value of theportfolio in t=0 according to equation (3):r(u – d)Fu (r – d – d) – Fd (r – u – d)(4) F0 = V0QV + QB = 
Let it now be assumed that uV 0.K.dV0. In this
case, the optimum behaviour for the investor is,where the price pattern is favourable, to exercisethe option, and to let it elapse where prices areunfavourable. This means that for (2):
F
u=uV 0–K and F d=0
By inserting it into (4) one obtains
ruV0 – K(5) F0 = u – dr – d – d> 0 
for the value of the European option at the starting
time t=0. The holder of an otherwise identicalAmerican option can choose whether to exercise itright away, thus obtaining in t=0 the paymentV
0–K, or to hold the option for another period. If
the option is not exercised, its value then corres-ponds to that of a European option. That means itsvalue is F
0:
(6)F0=max[V 0–K,F 0]
The option is exercised if the realised yield is higher
than the value of the option when held, i.e. if thefollowing holds:
r(u – d)Fu (r – d – d) – Fd (r – u – d)V0 – K ‡ 
3. The investment opportunity as a
“real option”
Following these preliminary considerations, the de-
cision problem described in section 1 can be de-scribed as a problem of evaluating an option tobuy. The strike price K corresponds to irreversible

84investment outlays, with I=1,600 MU. The interest
factor is r = 1.1. The expected net value of immedi-ate investment corresponds to the market valueof the security in the option pricing problem, sothat:
( 1.1)tPtV0 = E ∑ = 2,200
t=0∞
Accordingly, the present value of future returns in
the next period is uV 0=3,300 MU given favourable
price movements and dV 0=1,100 MU given un-
favourable price movements. The return of 200MU from the sale of the product for immediate in-vestment corresponds in economic terms to a divi-dend payment of (1+R)·200, resulting in D
0=220.
For the value of a European option containingthese features, by insertion into (5) one obtains:
1.13,300 – 1,600F0 = 11.1 –  0.5 – 0. 1= 772.73 MU · 
That would be the amount paid in the financial
markets for the right to make an investment in thefollowing period. Instead, though, investment canalso be made immediately. The investment oppor-tunity is therefore not a European option but anAmerican option and must be valued accordingto (6) at F
0=max[V 0–I,F0]. Immediate investment
is preferable for V 0–I$F0. Since
ruV0 – lV0 – l < u – dr – d – d, or V0 – l = 600 < 772.73 
immediate investment would be unwise. There-
fore, F0=F0.
This illuminates from another angle the problem of
choosing the right time to invest. The net presentvalue criterion does not accurately evaluate the in-vestment opportunity and fails as a decision-makingrule since it does not completely describe the deci-sion problem – it does not take into account all theopportunity costs. Valuation in terms of the net
present value implies that the opportunity costs con-sist of nothing but the forfeited returns discountedat the risk-free interest rate R. In reality, though,when investment is made in t=0 the possibility ofinvesting at a later time is lost, and with it the abilityto decide on the basis of new information.
In order to make the investment seem profitable,
in the event of immediate investment the expectedtotal earnings less interest must not only coversunk costs but also the value of the investment op-portunity in the next period under optimum behav-iour influenced by new information. The value ofthat opportunity under optimum behaviour showsup as the value of an option with the appropriatecharacteristics.
Annex 2:
Uncertainty as an entrepreneurial opportunity
Wherever an enterprise is able to adapt optimally
to a changing environment, uncertainty may alsoadd value to an investment project. An examplewill serve in the following to explain this principle,called the Hartman-Abel effect.
Unlike the option pricing model introduced in Ap-
pendix 1, there is no delaying possibility here: in-vestment is made either immediately or not at all.Besides capital, another variable factor is enteredinto the equation, L, which will be called labourhere. The nominal wage rate is w MU, the life-span of the project is infinite, and the productionfunction is
Y=F(K,L)=K
1/2L1/2

85The purchase of a capital unit K=1 is considered.
The optimal labour input maximises the periodical-ly occurring returns:
P(P ,L)=PY–wL=PL
1/2–wLRmax!
Depending on the sales price P , this leads to a de-
mand for labour L(P) and returns P(P ,L(P)) where
41L(P) = 2
 and P(P ,L(P)) =wP() 41P wP( ) . 
Let w = 100 MU. In a case of certainty, if the sales
price in this period and all subsequent periods isP=200 MU, we then obtain L*=1 and P*=100
MU. Now let us assume uncertainty: let the price,with a probability of q = 0.5, take on a value ofP=P
u=300 MU for this and all subsequent periods,
otherwise a value of P=P d=100 MU is assumed.The expected value E(P) thus remains unchanged
at 200 MU.
Now it is of crucial importance to know whether
the investor, to match the demand situation, canfreely determine the input of factors. If the labourinput must be definitively set at the time of the in-vestment,
14the decision-maker maximises expect-
ed returns: the result is an optimum labour inputof L*=1 as before and expected returns of
E(P)=qP(P
u,L*)+(1–q) P(Pd,L*)=100 MU
just as in the certainty case. However, if the invest-

86is known what the sales situation is like, then it is
optimal to use more labour if demand is high andless labour if demand is low. In both cases the in-vestor can increase returns compared with thefixed labour input situation. For P=P
u=300 the in-
vestor then demands L(P u)=2.25, and for
P=P d=100 labour demand is confined to
L(Pd)=0.25. This corresponds to annual returns of
E(P)=qP(Pu,L(P u))+(1–q) P(Pd,L(P d))=125 MU.
At an interest rate of 10% the present value of
returns is now 1,375 MU compared with only1,100 MU under either certainty or uncertaintywithout the possibility of adjustment. If the invest-or is able to adjust, uncertainty adds value to theproject. At the same time, in a situation of uncer-tainty the value of the project is increased by thepossibility of adjustment. The project is more prof-itable and will also be implemented at a higherprice. This relationship can be easily demonstratedin graph form.The straight line P(P ,L*) shows the returns as a
function of the price of output P for a given labourinput L*. The relationship is linear because no ad-justment is made. However, if labour input is ad-justed, the returns in the best-case scenario, pointA, as well as that in the worst-case scenario, pointB, are both higher than in the non-adjustmentcase. The graph of the returns function is a convexcurve, and the expected value, point C, is higherthan in the case of certainty.
There are many ways to generalise this principle.
However, if it is possible not only to adjust but alsoto wait, combined with irreversibility, the impact ofuncertainty is ambiguous: it increases the presentvalue of returns yet at the same time creates anoption value for the possibility of waiting.
