CommentariesEconomic conditions
Underlying trends
The	momentum 	behind 	current 	economic 	ac-
tivity 	in	Germany 	is	shifting 	increasingly 	to-
wards 	domestic 	demand. 	While 	the	external 	
stimuli 	were 	muted 	of	late,	the	available 	indi-
cators 	suggest 	that	domestic 	demand, 	espe-
cially 	the	procurement 	of	new	machinery 	and	
equipment, 	picked 	up	considerably. 	This	was	
accompanied 	by	a	marked 	rise	in	imports. 	But	
there 	are	also	signs 	that	the	macroeconomic 	
momentum 	is	slowing 	down. 	Although 	en-
terprises’ 	assessment 	of	the	current 	situation 	
improved 	again, 	their	previously 	extremely 	
optimistic 	expectations 	continued 	to	steadily 	
weaken. 	This	applies 	to	exports 	in	particular. 	
However, 	the	further 	expansion 	in	employ -
ment 	and	the	increase 	in	fixed 	capital 	forma -
tion	point 	to	the	fact	that	the	medium-term 	
economic 	outlook 	continues 	to	be	rated 	fa-
vourably. 	The	high	survey 	scores 	measured 	by	
the	consumer 	research 	institution 	Gesell -
schaft für Konsumforschung 	(GfK) 	support 	
the	assumption 	that	private 	consumption 	has	
picked 	up	further.
By	contrast, 	the	much 	noted 	strong 	decline 	in	
retail 	sales 	in	May	compared 	with	April, 	which 	
was	initially 	recorded 	at	2.8% 	in	real	terms 	
after 	seasonal 	adjustment, 	is	not	very	inform -
ative. 	This	recorded 	decline 	is	mainly 	due	to	
the	considerable 	shortcomings 	of	this	statisti -
cal	figure 	at	the	moment. 	The	recorded 	fall	Shift of

has	since 	been 	adjusted 	to	2.5%, 	and	further 	
upward 	corrections 	are	to	be	expected.1
Industry
On	a	seasonally 	adjusted 	basis, 	month-on-
month 	industrial 	output 	increased 	by	1.2% 	in	
May. 	This	increase 	is	likely 	to	considerably 	
overstate 	the	underlying 	cyclical 	tendency 	as	
there 	were 	no	public 	holidays 	or	associated 	
extended 	week-ends 	in	May	this	year. 	Aver-
aged 	output 	in	April 	and	May, 	taking 	account 	
of	the	upward 	revision 	for	April, 	surpassed 	
the	first-quarter 	level	by	1.7%. 	While 	the	pro-
duction 	of	intermediate 	goods 	and	consumer 	
goods 	rose	by	around 	1.5%, 	output 	of	capital 	
goods 	increased 	by	2%,	chiefly 	owing 	to	very	
strong 	expansion 	in	the	automotive 	industry.
Although 	overall 	demand 	for	industrial 	goods 	
increased 	markedly 	by	1.8% 	in	May	com-
pared 	with	April, 	it	was	once 	again 	greatly 	
boosted 	by	orders 	received 	for	other 	trans -
port	equipment. 	After 	the	volume 	of	orders 	in	
the	shipbuilding 	industry 	had	been 	unusually 	
large 	in	April, 	a	domestic 	manufacturer 	of	
railway 	stock 	received 	a	very	large 	order 	in	the	
reporting 	month. 	Excluding 	other 	transport 	
equipment, 	orders 	received 	in	virtually 	all	eco-
nomic 	sectors 	declined 	by	an	average 	of	1 %.	
A	similar 	contraction 	occurred 	when 	compar -
ing	the	average 	level	of	April 	to	May	with	that	
of	the	first	quarter. 	Overall 	domestic 	demand 	
increased 	by	6¾% 	due	to	large 	orders, 	
whereas 	orders 	from 	abroad 	fell	by	1 %.Output

Domestic	 industrial	 sales	 decreased	 by	1 %	in	
seasonally	 adjusted	 terms	 in	May	 compared	
with	 April.	 However,	 on	an	average	 of	April	
and	 May	 domestic	 sales	 rose	 by	3¾%	 com-
pared	 with	 the	first	 quarter,	 while	 foreign	
sales	 fell	by	¼%.	 Exports	 of	goods,	 which	
have	 fluctuated	 strongly	 in	recent	 months	 on	
a	seasonally	 adjusted	 basis,	 rebounded	 sig-
nificantly	 in	May	 by	value	 following	 a	steep	
drop	 in	April;	 the	 two-month	 average	 for	
April	 and	May	 exceeded	 the	first-quarter	 fig-
ure	by	1.8%.	 The	value	 of	imports	 recorded	 a	
noticeably	 stronger	 increase	 of	2.7%	 in	the	
context	of	largely	steady	prices.
Construction
Construction	 raised	 its	output	 by	1 %	in	May	
compared	 with	 April,	 the	figures	 for	which	
were	 slightly	 revised	 upwards.	 As	a	result,	 the	
mean	 level	 of	production	 over	 April	 and	May	
matched	 that	 of	the	first	 quarter.	 Since	 the	
output	 losses	 from	 December	 had	most	 likely	
already	 been	 made	 good	 in	the	 first	 few	
months	 of	2011,	 this	indicates	 a	strong	 cycli-
cal	upswing	 in	this	economic	 sector.	 However,	
the	lack	 of	public	 holidays	 and	 long	 week-
ends	 might	 have	 played	 a	role	 in	this	case,	
too.	 Construction	 orders	 decreased	 again	 in	
April	 after	 they	 had	 increased	 in	March.	 The	
level	 of	orders	 in	both	 commercial	 and	 resi-
dential	 construction	 nonetheless	 remained	
high,	 whereas	 it	stayed	 low	 in	public	 con-
struction	despite	a	slight	rise.
Labour market
The	 favourable	 development	 on	the	labour	
market	 continues.	 According	 to	the	 provi -sional	 figures	 of	the	Federal	 Statistical	 Office,	
the	number	 of	persons	 in	work	 in	Germany	
went	 up	by	a	seasonally	 adjusted	 34,000	 on	
the	month	 in	May.	 This	corresponds	 to	a	year-
on-year	 increase	 of	488,000	 persons	 or	1.2%.	
The	percentage	 of	persons	 in	jobs	 subject	 to	
full	social	 security	 contributions	 in	this	rise	is	
likely	 to	have	 increased	 further	 as	in	April	
these	 jobs	 exceeded	 the	level	 of	the	same	
period	 last	year	 by	680,000	 or	2.5%.	 Accord -
ing	to	the	ifo	employment	 barometer,	 em-
ployers’	 willingness	 to	recruit	 staff	 dipped	 a	
little	 in	May	 from	 a	very	 high	 level,	 whereas	
the	Federal	 Employment	 Agency’s	 BA-X	 index	
rose	 noticeably	 following	 a	slight	 drop	 in	the	
previous	month.
In	June,	 the	official	 unemployment	 figure	 fell	
slightly	 by	a	seasonally	 adjusted	 8,000	 to	2.97	
million.	 The	 seasonally	 adjusted	 unemploy -
ment	 rate	 (using	 the	 Federal	 Employment	
Agency’s	 definition)	 remained	 unchanged	 at	
7.0%.	 Given	 that	 labour	 market	 policy	 meas -
ures	 are	now	 being	 reduced	 as	a	result	 of	the	
improved	 employment	 situation,	 unemploy -
ment	 in	the	broader	 sense	 fell	much	 more	
sharply	 than	 the	 official	 jobless	 figure	
(-297,000	 over	 12	months	 compared	 with	
-255,000).
Prices
At	a	monthly	 average	 of	US$113¾	 in	June,	
the	price	 of	a	barrel	 of	Brent	 crude	 oil	was	
largely	 unchanged	 from	 May.	 Although	
OPEC’s	 continued	 adherence	 to	its	production	
quotas	 initially	 tended	 to	push	 up	interna -
tional	 quotations,	 the	 International	 Energy	
Agency’s	 surprising	 announcement	 to	with-Domestic sales

draw 	60	million 	barrels 	from 	the	global 	strate -
gic	oil	reserve 	caused 	the	spot	price 	to	fall	
drastically 	in	the	second 	half	of	the	month. 	
The	forward 	price 	curve 	flattened 	markedly 	at	
the	same 	time. 	Since 	then, 	crude 	oil	prices 	for	
both 	immediate 	and	long-term 	deliveries 	
have 	been 	increasing 	again. 	As	this	report 	
went 	to	press, 	the	price 	of	crude 	oil	stood 	at	
US$116¾. 	Prices 	for	future 	deliveries 	of	crude 	
oil	were 	being 	quoted 	at	slight 	discounts 	
across 	the	entire 	maturity 	range.
The	decline 	in	oil	prices 	from 	April 	to	May	was	
reflected 	in	the	price 	development 	at	the	up-
stream 	stages 	of	the	economy. 	Overall, 	im-
ports 	became 	0.8% 	cheaper 	in	seasonally 	ad-
justed 	terms 	in	May. 	Excluding 	energy, 	aver-
age	prices 	remained 	largely 	unchanged. 	Do-
mestic 	producer 	prices 	merely 	fell	by	0.2% 	
owing 	to	their	lower 	energy 	input. 	The	year-
on-year 	rise	in	import 	prices 	decreased 	mark -
edly	to	8.1 %, 	and	only	slightly 	to	6.1 % 	in	the	
case	of	domestic 	producer 	prices.
Seasonally 	adjusted 	month-on-month 	con-
sumer 	prices 	remained 	unchanged 	in	June. 	
The	EHEC 	epidemic 	resulted 	in	sharp 	price 	re-
ductions 	for	some 	vegetables, 	and	fuels 	were 	
also	cheaper 	than	in	May. 	By	contrast, 	there 	
were 	perceptible 	seasonally 	adjusted 	prise 	in-
creases 	for	some 	other 	foods 	and	certain 	serv-
ices.	Annual 	inflation 	was	unchanged 	at	2.3% 	
according 	to	the	national 	Consumer 	Price 	In-
dex	(CPI)	and	at	2.4% 	as	measured 	by	the	
Harmonised 	Index 	of	Consumer 	Prices 	(HICP).Public finances2
Local government finances
The	local	governments’ 	core	budgets 	posted 	
a	deficit 	of	just	under 	€5½	billion 	in	the	first	
quarter 	of	2011.3	This	constitutes 	a	year-on-
year	decline 	of	just	over	€1	billion. 	Revenue 	
increased 	by	just	under 	7½% 	(or	€2½	billion). 	
On	balance, 	this	rise	was	almost 	entirely 	at-
tributable 	to	growth 	in	tax	receipts 	(+23% 	or	
just	over	€2	billion), 	which 	was	ultimately 	due	
to	the	strong 	expansion 	in	local	business 	tax	
revenue 	(+32% 	after 	deduction 	of	the	shares 	
accruing 	to	other 	government 	levels). 	At	the	
same 	time, 	expenditure 	rose	by	just	over	3%	
(or	just	under 	€1½	billion) 	owing, 	in	particu -
lar,	to	an	increase 	in	personnel 	expenditure 	
resulting 	from 	higher 	negotiated 	pay	rates4	
and	growth 	in	other 	operating 	expenditure 	
(+4½% 	or	just	under 	€½	billion 	in	both 	cases). 	
Fixed 	asset 	formation 	also	experienced 	a	fur-
ther	sharp 	rise,	while 	spending 	on	social 	ben-
efits	remained 	virtually 	unchanged.

2	In	the	short 	commentaries 	on	public 	finances, 	the	em-
phasis 	is	on	recent 	outturns. 	The	quarterly 	editions 	of	the	
Monthly 	Reports 	(published 	in	February, 	May, 	August 	and	
November), 	by	contrast, 	contain 	a	detailed 	description 	of	
the	development 	of	public 	finances 	during 	the	preceding 	
quarter. 	For	detailed 	data	on	budgetary 	developments 	
and	public 	debt, 	see	the	statistical 	section 	of	this	report.
3	These 	figures 	are	derived 	from 	the	general 	government 	
budget’s 	cash	balance. 	Following 	an	adjustment 	to	the	
reporting 	group, 	the	result 	recorded 	in	the	Federal 	Statis -
tical	Office’s 	press 	release 	No	246	dated 	30  June 	2011 	
additionally 	contains 	some 	local	government 	off-budget 	
entities 	that	are	attributable 	to	the	government 	sector. 	
Overall, 	these 	off-budget 	entities 	are	slightly 	in	deficit.
4	However, 	growth 	in	personnel 	expenditure 	is	likely 	to	
have 	been 	uniquely 	high	given 	that	the	higher 	negoti -
ated	pay	rates 	were 	not	yet	cash	effective 	in	the	first	
quarter 	and	a	one-off 	payment 	was	made 	at	the	begin -
ning	of	2011.

is	likely	 to	weaken	 considerably	 in	the	coming	
quarters.	 Even	 so,	in	view	 of	the	sharp	 rise	in	
state	 government	 tax	revenue	 and	the	higher	
local	 government	 receipts	 from	 state	 govern -
ment	 general	 grants	 that	 such	 rises	 generally	
entail,	 as	well	 as	the	subdued	 pace	 of	ex-
penditure	 on	social	 benefits	 since	 the	autumn	
of	2010,	 it	can	be	assumed	 that	 the	deficit	
will	continue	 to	fall	in	the	year	 as	a	whole	
even	 if	other	 operating	 expenditure	 and	fixed	
asset	 formation	 continue	 to	rise	perceptibly.	
Given	 that	 tax	revenue	 and	 probably	 also	
general	 grants	 from	 state	 government	 are	
forecast	 to	rise	significantly	 and	 that	 central	
government	 will	be	gradually	 assuming	 the	
costs	 of	the	basic	 allowance	 for	the	elderly	
and	people	 with	 reduced	 earning	 capacity,	 lo-
cal	government	 budget	 deficits	 are	likely	 to	
fall	from	2012	onwards.
The	 figures	 on	local	 government	 debt	 now	
not	only	 encompass	 core	 budgets	 but	also	
off-budget	 entities	 that	are	attributable	 to	the	
government	 sector.	 The	increase	 of	€6½	 bil-
lion	in	credit	 market	 debt	 compared	 with	 the	
end	of	2010	 was	 probably	 due,	 above	 all,	to	
the	 inclusion	 of	these	 off-budget	 entities.	
However,	 the	renewed	 rise	of	€2½	 billion	 in	
cash	 and	 liquidity	 advances	 to	a	record	 level	
of	€43	billion	 is	probably	 more	 a	reflection	 of	
the	very	 strained	 financial	 situation	 of	a	num-
ber	of	municipalities.	 They	 still	seem	 to	be	
using	 cash	 and	liquidity	 advances	 –	which	 are	
actually	 only	 intended	 for	bridging	 short-term	
liquidity	 shortfalls	 –	to	finance	 their	 current	
expenditure.	 Not	least	 given	 many	 municipal -
ities’	 very	 strained	 budgetary	 situation,	 which	
is	thus	 likely	 to	persist	 in	the	future,	 it	would	be	inappropriate	 to	make	 tax	cuts	 without	
counter-financing	measures.
Statutory health insurance scheme
According	 to	provisional	 figures,	 the	health	
insurance	 fund	 and	the	statutory	 health	 insur -
ance	 institutions	 posted	 a	surplus	 of	€1	billion	
in	the	first	quarter	 of	2011,	 with	 the	fund	 re-
cording	 a	deficit	 of	€½	billion	 and	the	insur -
ance	 institutions	 a	surplus	 of	€1½	 billion.	 This	
constituted	 an	improvement	 of	more	 than	 €1	
billion	 on	the	slight	 deficit	 recorded	 a	year	
earlier.	 All	in	all,	revenue	 increased	 by	just	
over	 5%,	 particularly	 as	a	result	 of	the	rise	in	
the	general	 contribution	 rate	 from	 14.9%	 to	
15.5%,	 whereas	 expenditure	 grew	 by	only	
half	as	much.Deficit

The	large 	surplus 	recorded 	by	the	health 	in-
surance 	institutions 	is	due	to	the	fact	that	
their	first-quarter 	spending 	rose	by	just	over	
2	½%	and	thus	considerably 	more 	slowly 	than	
expected 	for	the	year	as	a	whole 	(around

fund, 	which 	are	made 	in	equal 	monthly 	instal -
ments, 	are	based 	on	the	higher 	expenditure 	
projected 	by	the	group 	of	statutory 	health 	in-
surance 	estimators 	in	the	autumn 	of	2010. 	In	
particular, 	spending 	on	pharmaceuticals 	was	
down 	by	just	over	5%	on	the	year	owing 	to	
higher 	manufacturer 	discounts 	and	lower 	
maximum 	prices 	covered 	by	the	health 	insur -
ance 	institutions 	for	specific 	pharmaceutical 	
products. 	By	contrast, 	expenditure 	in	the	
other 	areas 	of	provision 	rose	more 	sharply 	
again 	overall. 	Outlays 	on	sickness 	benefit 	in-
creased 	by	as	much 	as	10½%. 	The	strong 	growth 	recorded 	in	this	area	for	some 	time	
now	is	associated 	with	the	rising 	average 	age	
of	insurees, 	which 	partly 	explains 	longer 	sick-
ness-related 	absences 	from 	work. 	In	addition, 	
by	drawing 	sickness 	benefit, 	insurees 	can	
avoid 	the	pension 	deductions 	associated 	with	
taking 	early 	retirement.
The	deficit 	in	the	health 	insurance 	fund 	was	
up	only	slightly 	on	the	year. 	Contrary 	to	ex-
pectations, 	the	fund’s 	finances 	do	not	appear 	
to	be	deteriorating 	substantially. 	All	in	all,	the	
fund’s 	revenue 	rose	by	just	over	5%,	and	con-
tribution 	receipts 	increased 	by	as	much 	as	6%	
(adjusted 	for	the	contribution 	rate	rise:	+2%). 	
This	reflects, 	above 	all,	favourable 	wage 	and	
employment 	developments. 	By	contrast, 	con-
siderably 	fewer 	contributions 	were 	paid	on	
behalf 	of	the	unemployed 	and	short-time 	
workers. 	Furthermore, 	following 	the	waiver 	
of	the	pension 	adjustment 	in	mid-2010, 	the	
increase 	in	pensioner 	contributions 	was	due	
almost 	entirely 	to	the	contribution 	rate	rise.
The	statutory 	health 	insurance 	scheme 	as	a	
whole 	looks 	likely 	to	record 	a	considerable 	
surplus 	for	2011. 	The	health 	insurance 	fund’s 	
reserves 	will	probably 	receive 	a	substantial 	
boost 	and	exceed 	the	statutory 	minimum 	re-
quirement 	as	early 	as	the	end	of	this	year. 	The	
health 	insurance 	institutions, 	too,	could 	
record 	a	positive 	result 	on	balance 	(with 	barely 	
any	increase 	in	additional 	contributions) 	if	ex-
penditure 	growth 	does 	not	pick	up	again, 	eg	
as	a	result 	of	additional 	financial 	incentives 	
for	doctors 	in	rural	areas.

continues 	to	rise	more 	rapidly 	than	insurees’ 	
income 	subject 	to	compulsory 	insurance 	con-
tributions, 	the	individual 	health 	insurance 	in-
stitutions 	will	increasingly 	have 	to	charge 	
non-income-related 	additional 	contributions 	
to	plug	gaps 	in	funding. 	To	avoid 	placing 	an	
excessive 	burden 	on	lower 	income 	groups, 	
social 	equalisation 	is	envisaged 	for	cases 	
where 	the	pre-estimated 	average 	additional 	
contribution 	measured 	across 	all	health 	insur -
ance 	institutions 	exceeds 	2%	of	an	individu -
al’s	income. 	The	relief 	provided 	to	these 	con-
tribution 	payers 	is	initially 	being 	funded 	from 	
the	health 	insurance 	fund’s 	reserves. 	Where 	
necessary, 	additional 	payments 	are	to	be	
made 	from 	the	central 	government 	budget 	
for	this	purpose 	from 	2015 	onwards.
Securities markets
Bond market
In	May	2011, 	the	issue 	volume 	in	the	German 	
bond 	market 	was	down 	on	the	month, 	gross -
ing	€115.5 	billion 	(compared 	with	€128.0 	bil-
lion	in	April). 	After 	deducting 	redemptions, 	
which 	were 	down 	considerably, 	and	taking 	
account 	of	changes 	in	issuers’ 	holdings 	of	
their	own	bonds, 	net	sales 	of	domestic 	debt	
securities 	amounted 	to	€24.8 	billion, 	com-
pared 	with	net	redemptions 	of	€6.3	billion 	in	
April. 	Sales 	of	foreign 	debt	securities 	totalled 	
€7.0	billion 	in	net	terms; 	on	balance, 	it	was	
mostly 	euro-denominated 	securities 	that	were 	
placed 	on	the	market. 	Therefore, 	the	volume 	
of	outstanding 	debt	securities 	in	Germany 	in-
creased 	by	€31.8 	billion 	overall 	in	the	report -
ing	month.Among 	domestic 	borrowers, 	the	public 	sector 	
tapped 	the	bond 	market 	for	the	largest 	
amount 	in	May	(€23.4 	billion). 	Central 	gov-
ernment 	was	the	main 	issuer, 	with	net	sales 	
of	€18.0 	billion. 	Central 	government 	primarily 	
issued 	two-year 	Federal 	Treasury 	notes 	
(Schätze: 	€6.8	billion) 	and	five-year 	Federal 	
notes 	(Bobls: 	€6.3	billion), 	as	well	as	ten-year 	
Federal 	bonds 	(Bunds: 	€4.1	billion). 	Mean -
while, 	it	redeemed 	€2.5	billion 	worth 	of	Treas -
ury	discount 	paper 	(Bubills). 	In	the	reporting 	
month, 	the	state 	governments 	placed 	bonds 	
worth 	€5.4	billion 	net	on	the	capital 	market, 	
compared 	with	€3.6	billion 	in	April.
In	May, 	German 	enterprises 	tapped 	the	bond 	
market 	for	€3.3	billion 	net.	On	balance, 	sales 	
of	short-term 	paper 	dominated, 	with	€2.2	bil-
lion.
Domestic 	credit 	institutions 	reduced 	their	
capital 	market 	debt	by	€1.9	billion 	in	May	fol-
lowing 	net	redemptions 	of	€10.5 	billion 	in	
April. 	Especially 	other 	bank 	bonds 	(€8.3 	bil-
lion), 	but	also	public 	Pfandbriefe 	(€1.0 	billion) 	
were 	redeemed 	in	net	terms. 	By	contrast, 	
bonds 	issued 	by	specialised 	credit 	institutions 	
and	mortgage 	Pfandbriefe 	were 	sold	on	the	
market 	for	€6.0	billion 	and	€1.4	billion 	in	net	
terms.
Foreign 	investors 	were 	the	main 	purchasers 	of	
debt	securities 	in	May. 	They 	invested 	€43.5 	
billion 	in	the	German 	bond 	market, 	acquiring 	
securities 	from 	both 	private 	and	public 	issuers 	
in	almost 	equal 	measure. 	Domestic 	credit 	in-

Equities
In	the	reporting 	month, 	domestic 	enterprises 	
issued 	new	shares 	worth 	€5.9	billion 	(net)	on	
the	German 	equity 	market. 	This	was	due	
mainly 	to	a	capital 	increase 	by	one	credit 	insti-
tution. 	The	outstanding 	volume 	of	foreign 	
equities 	in	the	German 	market 	increased 	by	
€4.0	billion. 	German 	equities 	were 	purchased 	
predominantly 	by	foreign 	investors 	(€12.8 	bil-
lion). 	In	addition, 	resident 	non-banks 	pur-
chased 	€9.7	billion 	worth 	of	equities, 	while 	
German 	credit 	institutions 	reduced 	their	
equity 	holdings 	by	€12.6 	billion; 	in	net	terms, 	
this	involved 	domestic 	instruments 	only.Mutual fund shares
In	May, 	domestic 	mutual 	funds 	recorded 	only	
a	marginal 	inflow 	(April: 	€2.5	billion). 	In	net	
terms, 	only	mutual 	funds 	open 	to	the	general 	
public 	placed 	shares 	on	the	market 	(€1.2 	bil-
lion), 	while 	specialised 	funds 	reserved 	for	in-
stitutional 	investors 	saw	outflows 	of	around 	
the	same 	amount. 	Among 	the	mutual 	funds 	
open 	to	the	general 	public, 	equity-based 	
funds 	in	particular 	managed 	to	acquire 	new	
resources 	(€1.5 	billion), 	as	did,	to	a	lesser 	ex-
tent, 	open-end 	real	estate 	funds 	(€0.3 	billion) 	
and	mixed 	securities-based 	funds 	(€0.2 	bil-
lion). 	By	contrast, 	bond-based 	funds 	(€0.5 	bil-
lion), 	money 	market 	funds 	(€0.3 	billion) 	and	
mixed 	funds 	(€0.1 	billion) 	repurchased 	shares 	
in	net	terms. 	Foreign 	funds 	traded 	on	the	
German 	market 	also	saw	outflows 	totalling 	
€0.8	billion 	in	May	after 	having 	recorded 	net	
sales 	of	€3.3	billion 	in	April. 	In	the	reporting 	
month, 	mutual 	fund 	shares 	were 	purchased 	
exclusively 	by	foreign 	investors, 	who	acquired 	
€1.6	billion 	worth 	of	paper. 	By	contrast, 	Ger-
man	credit 	institutions 	and	resident 	non-
banks 	disposed 	of	fund 	shares 	worth, 	in	net	
terms, 	€1.7	billion 	and	€0.7	billion 	respec -
tively.

deficit	 on	invisibles,	 which	 comprise	 services,	
income	and	current	transfers.
According	 to	provisional	 figures	 from	 the	Fed-
eral	Statistical	 Office,	 in	May	 the	foreign	 trade	
surplus	 rose	 by	€3.9	 billion	 on	the	month	 to	
€14.8	 billion.	 After	 adjustment	 for	seasonal	
and	 calendar	 variations,	 it	went	 up	by	€0.9	
billion	 to	€12.8	 billion.	 Following	 a	fall	in	the	
previous	 month,	 the	value	 of	both	 exports	
and	imports	 grew	 strongly,	 at	4.3%	 and	3.7%	
respectively.	 In	April	 and	May	 as	a	whole,	 sea-
sonally	 adjusted	 nominal	 exports	 were	 1.9%	
above	 the	first-quarter	 average,	 while	 imports	
were	 up	by	2.7%.	 On	this	occasion,	 price	 ef-
fects	 are	likely	 to	have	 played	 a	minor	 part	
solely	in	terms	of	exports.
In	May,	 Germany’s	 deficit	 on	invisibles	 wid-
ened	 substantially	 to	stand	 at	€7.2	 billion,	 fol-
lowing	 a	small-scale	 deficit	 of	€0.6	 billion	 in	
April.	 This	 was	 mainly	 the	result	 of	a	marked	
turnaround	 in	cross-border	 income,	 which	 re-
corded	 net	expenditure	 of	€5.5	 billion	 in	the	
reporting	 month,	 largely	 on	account	 of	the	
generally	 relatively	 high	 dividend	 payments	
that	 are	made	 to	non-residents	 in	May.	 By	
contrast,	 the	deficits	 on	services	 and	 current	
transfers	went	down	by	€0.2	billion	and	€0.6	
billion	respectively.
As	regards	 cross-border	 portfolio	 investment,	
with	 the	growing	 tensions	 in	the	European	
bond	 markets	 there	 were	 significant	 net	capi-
tal	imports	 (€47.9	 billion)	 in	May,	 after	 capital	
exports	 of	€7.3	 billion	 had	 been	 recorded	 in	
April.	 The	main	 reason	 for	this	was	 the	high	
inflow	 of	funds	 to	Germany	 from	 foreign

to	debt	securities 	(€43.5 	billion). 	These 	inves -
tors	purchased 	€27.6 	billion 	worth 	of	bonds 	
and	notes, 	as	well	as	money 	market 	paper 	in	
the	value 	of	€15.9 	billion. 	They 	also	acquired 	
domestic 	shares 	(€12.3 	billion). 	For	their	part, 	
German 	investors 	spent 	€9.6	billion 	on	securi -
ties	issued 	by	non-residents, 	purchasing 	both 	
bonds 	and	notes 	(€4.6 	billion) 	and	money 	
market 	instruments 	(€2.4 	billion). 	In	addition, 	
they	added 	foreign 	shares 	worth 	€3.3	billion 	
to	their	investment 	portfolios.
In	May, 	direct 	investment 	again 	resulted 	in	net	
capital 	exports 	(€3.4 	billion, 	compared 	with	
€1.7	billion 	in	April). 	On	the	one	hand, 	Ger-
man	enterprises 	provided 	their	foreign 	sub-
sidiaries 	with	€1.8	billion 	worth 	of	funds, 	
both 	by	increasing 	their	equity 	stakes 	(€3.4 	
billion) 	and	reinvesting 	earnings 	(€1.5 	billion). 	
At	the	same 	time, 	however, 	intra-group 	credit 	
transactions 	resulted 	in	a	withdrawal 	of	funds 	
from 	their	foreign 	subsidiaries 	(€3.2 	billion). 	
On	the	other 	hand, 	the	transactions 	of	Ger-
man	subsidiaries 	with	their	foreign 	parent 	
companies 	generated 	capital 	exports 	(€1.5 	
billion), 	primarily 	through 	dividend 	payments 	
and	intra-group 	loans.Other 	statistically 	recorded 	investment, 	com-
prising 	financial 	and	trade 	credits 	(where 	
these 	are	not	allocated 	to	direct 	investment) 	
as	well	as	bank 	deposits 	and	other 	assets, 	saw	
net	capital 	exports 	of	€51.7 	billion 	in	May. 	
Non-banks 	accounted 	for	€17.6 	billion 	of	this	
sum. 	The	activities 	of	enterprises 	and	house -
holds 	(€17.0 	billion) 	were 	a	key	factor 	in	this	
development; 	while 	these 	players 	increased 	
their	bank 	deposits 	abroad, 	they	also	issued 	
additional 	financial 	loans. 	By	contrast, 	general 	
government 	transferred 	only	modest 	amounts 	
of	funds 	abroad 	(€0.6 	billion). 	A	further 	€34.1 	
billion 	were, 	however, 	channelled 	abroad 	via

mainly 	redeemed 	short-term 	foreign 	debt	ob-
ligations, 	accounted 	for	€19.1 	billion 	of	this	
sum. 	The	remaining 	€15.0 	billion 	were 	ac-

Developments in the exports of the four largest 
euro-area member states since the launch of 
monetary union
The	current 	phase 	of	economic 	recovery 	has	seen	German 	exports 	rise	very	sharply 	in	real	terms. 	
Of	the	four	large 	euro-area 	member 	states 	(EMU 	4),	only	Spanish 	exports 	displayed 	similar 	mo-
mentum, 	while 	French 	and	Italian 	exporters 	achieved 	considerably 	smaller 	gains. 	Germany’s 	lead	
in	terms 	of	export 	growth 	is	no	new	phenomenon; 	it	was	also	observed 	in	the	years 	between 	the	
start	of	the	third 	stage 	of	monetary 	union 	and	the	onset 	of	the	global 	financial 	and	economic 	
crisis. 	This	article 	will	take	a	closer 	look	at	the	differences 	in	these 	four	countries’ 	export 	growth.
Germany’s 	strong 	export 	performance 	had	a	broad 	regional 	base. 	Its	deliveries 	to	most 	of	the	
large 	sales 	regions 	grew 	at	a	faster 	pace 	than	those 	of	its	three 	partner 	countries. 	Overall, 	all	
EMU 	4	countries 	recorded 	the	strongest 	trade 	growth 	in	trade 	with	China, 	followed 	by	the	Com -
monwealth 	of	Independent 	States 	(CIS), 	the	Middle 	East	and	the	new	EU	member 	states 	(NMSs). 	
What 	all	four	countries 	have 	in	common 	is	that	the	percentage 	of	exports 	to	the	euro	area	and	
other 	industrial 	countries 	has	diminished 	appreciably 	over	the	past	ten	years.
Looking 	at	its	main 	determining 	factors, 	export 	growth 	can	be	broken 	down 	into	a	global 	trade 	
effect, 	which 	exerts 	by	far	the	largest 	influence; 	regional 	and	competition 	effects; 	and	a	residual. 	
It	is	evident 	that	growth 	in	the	sales 	markets 	of	all	four	countries 	was	unable 	to	match 	the	expan -
sion	of	global 	trade, 	mainly 	because 	exports 	are	still	fairly 	strongly 	biased 	towards 	the	industrial 	
countries. 	In	addition, 	it	should 	be	noted 	that	Germany’s 	real	exports 	were 	boosted 	by	improved 	
price 	competitiveness, 	while 	this	factor 	had	a	negative 	effect 	for	Italy	and	Spain, 	and	was	virtually 	
negligible 	for	French 	exports.
The	residual 	contains, 	amongst 	other 	things, 	product 	range 	effects, 	although 	differences 	in	the	
sectoral 	focus 	of	goods 	supply 	explain 	only	a	fairly 	small 	part	of	the	heterogeneity 	in	the	export 	
growth 	of	the	EMU 	4.	In	addition, 	there 	is	some 	evidence 	to	suggest 	that	different 	earnings 	de-
velopments 	in	manufacturing 	excluding 	construction 	have 	had	a	perceptible 	impact 	on	the	ex-
port	growth 	of	the	large 	euro-area 	countries. 	Differences 	in	enterprises’ 	globalisation 	strategies 	
are	an	additional 	factor. 	In	this	connection, 	the	strong 	export 	focus 	of	German 	Mittelstand 	com-
panies 	is	also	significant. 	However, 	such	factors 	can	be	determined 	only	in	qualitative 	terms.DEUTSCHE

Exports of the four large euro-area 
 countries since the cyclical low of the 
 second quarter of 2009
The	degree 	to	which 	euro-area 	member 	states 	
have 	benefited 	from 	the	revival 	of	global 	trade 	
with	the	global 	economic 	recovery 	differs 	
fairly 	strongly. 	This	can,	by	way	of	example, 	be	
demonstrated 	for	the	four	major 	euro-area 	
countries. 	By	the	first	quarter 	of	2011, 	real	ex-
ports 	had	risen 	by	24½% 	in	Germany 	and	by	
22½% 	in	Spain 	from 	their	cyclical 	low	in	the	
spring 	of	2009.1	By	contrast, 	France 	and	Italy	
experienced 	much 	smaller 	gains 	of	15% 	each. 	
The	very	strong 	growth 	in	German 	exports 	
must, 	all	other 	things 	being 	equal, 	surely 	be	
seen	as	a	reaction 	to	the	previous 	dramatic 	
decline, 	when 	exports 	plummeted 	by	18½% 	
from 	the	pre-crisis 	cyclical 	peak 	in	the	first	
quarter 	of	2008 	to	the	second 	quarter 	of	
2009. 	However, 	this	does 	not	explain 	the	dif-
ferences 	between 	the	four	countries. 	The	
downturn 	was	only	a	little	weaker 	in	France 	
and	Spain, 	but	considerably 	more 	pronounced 	
in	Italy.	Overall, 	in	Germany 	and	Spain, 	exports 	
in	the	first	quarter 	of	2011 	slightly 	exceeded 	
their	respective 	pre-crisis 	highs, 	whereas 	ex-
ports 	in	France 	and	Italy	were 	still	3½% 	and	as	
much 	as	12½% 	lower 	respectively.
Longer-term trends in the exports  
of the EMU 4
Germany’s 	strong 	export 	performance 	com-
pared 	to	other 	euro-area 	countries 	is	no	new	
phenomenon 	and	was	in	evidence 	even 	be-
fore	the	crisis. 	Between 	the	launch 	of	the	
third 	stage 	of	European 	monetary 	union 	at	the	beginning 	of	1999 	and	2008, 	real	exports 	
in	Germany 	expanded 	at	an	average 	annual 	
rate	of	7½%, 	compared 	with	+4½% 	in	Spain, 	
+3½% 	in	France 	and	+2% 	in	Italy.2	As	the	nu-
merator 	increased 	apace, 	while 	gross 	domes -
tic	product 	(GDP), 	as	the	denominator, 	ex-
panded 	only	moderately, 	Germany’s 	export 	
ratio	rose	from 	28½% 	in	1998 	to	47½% 	in	
2008, 	while 	it	increased 	only	slightly 	in	France 	
and	Italy,	to	27% 	and	28½% 	respectively, 	and	
remained 	virtually 	unchanged 	in	Spain, 	at	
26½%.
The	German 	export 	economy’s 	growth 	lead	
was	evident 	both 	in	goods 	and	services. 	Ex-
ports 	of	real	services 	in	Germany 	even 	out-
paced 	goods 	exports, 	whereas 	exports 	of	
services 	expanded 	less	strongly 	in	the	other 	
three 	countries. 	This	was	due,	amongst 	other 	
things, 	to	the	strong 	increase 	in	German 	ex-
ports 	of	transport 	services 	and	business-
related 	services, 	which 	are	closely 	related 	to	
the	cross-border 	trade 	in	goods. 	In	France 	and	
Italy,	exports 	of	services 	still	represented 	a	
larger 	percentage 	of	total	exports, 	at	21 %	
and	18% 	respectively, 	than	in	Germany 	
(14½%), 	but	the	gap	has	narrowed. 	Spain 	
continued 	to	occupy 	the	top	spot	with	33% 	
on	the	strength 	of	its	tourism 	industry. 	How -
ever, 	Germany’s 	strong 	export 	focus 	means 	
that	its	percentage 	of	services 	exports 	in	GDP	
is	higher 	than	in	France 	and	Italy	and	just	
2	percentage 	points 	lower 	than	in	Spain.German and

A	longer-term 	comparison 	of	developments 	
in	real	exports 	in	the	EMU 	4	must 	also	take	
into	account 	differences 	in	how	the	nominal 	
series 	are	deflated. 	In	Germany 	and	France, 	it	
is	based 	on	export 	price 	indices, 	while 	in	Italy	
and	Spain 	unit	values 	are	used 	in	some 	in-
stances.3	The	export 	deflators 	for	Italy	and	
Spain 	increased 	by	3%	and	2%	a	year	respec -
tively 	between 	1999 	and	2010, 	while 	those 	
for	Germany 	and	France 	rose	by	½%	each. 	
The	sharper 	rise	in	Spain 	and	Italy	is	probably 	
partly 	due	to	larger 	price 	increases. 	Product 	
range 	and	quality 	effects, 	which 	are	not	ad-
justed 	for	in	unit	values, 	are	an	additional 	fac-
tor	here. 	This	distortion 	of	unknown 	propor -
tions 	probably 	helps 	explain 	why	the	real	
growth 	reported 	for	Italian 	and	Spanish 	ex-
ports 	tends 	to	be	understated 	and	therefore 	
deviates 	more 	to	the	downside 	from 	the	(less

responding 	German 	and	Spanish 	exports 	in-
creased 	at	an	average 	rate	of	6½% 	a	year, 	
compared 	with	3%	in	France 	and	4½% 	in	
Italy.	Given 	the	relatively 	strong 	growth, 	the	
percentage 	of	extra-euro-area 	trade 	increased 	
across 	the	board 	and	that	of	trade 	within 	the	
euro	area	fell	accordingly. 	In	Germany’s 	case, 	
the	weight 	of	non-euro-area 	countries 	rose	
to	60½% 	between 	1998 	and	2010, 	compared 	
with	52½% 	in	France, 	58% 	in	Italy	and	44½% 	
in	Spain.
In	the	1999 	to	2010 	period, 	German 	exports 	
to	China 	grew 	faster, 	at	an	annual 	average 	of	
20%, 	than	to	any	other 	third 	country.5	This

of	the	other 	three 	countries, 	which 	ranged

However, 	it	should 	be	noted 	that	China’s 	
weight 	as	a	sales 	market 	was	still	too	low	in	
the	pre-crisis 	years, 	even 	in	Germany, 	to	have 	
a	major 	impact 	on	growth 	in	overall 	exports. 	
Deliveries 	to	China 	have 	gained 	a	perceptibly 	
greater 	significance 	only	in	recent 	years. 	For	
instance, 	exports 	to	China 	rose	from 	just	
more 	than	3%	of	overall 	German 	deliveries 	in	
2007 	to	5½% 	in	2010, 	compared 	with	a	slight

Deutsche BundesbankGoods exports of the four large euro-area countries to China
China’s rise to a leading economic power and its increasing 
integration into the world economy have boosted its for-
eign trade with the four large euro-area countries (EMU 4). 
For the German economy, in particular, the Chinese sales 
market has gained considerably in importance. Since the 
start of the third stage of monetary union at the beginning 
of 1999, German goods exports to China have increased by 
20% per year on average in nominal terms. Their share in 
German goods exports has thus been continuously rising 
and, at 5½%, China achieved seventh place in the ranking 
of the most important foreign buyers in 2010. Conversely, 
Germany is the ﬁ  fth most important import country for 
China (excluding Hong Kong). Although exports to China 
from France, Italy and Spain also underwent very dynamic 
growth, this was not as strong as in Germany. Therefore, 
China’s weighting in the respective total exports of goods 
in 2010 was signiﬁ  cantly lower in France (3%), Italy (2½%) 
and Spain (1½%). One possible explanation for the comparatively high level of 
German exports to China could be that the German econo-
my‘s range of products better meets the Chinese demand 
for imported goods than that of the other three euro-area 
countries. The car industry provides a good example of this. 
Germany has beneﬁ  ted to a much greater extent from the 
booming demand for cars in China in recent years than 
the other three euro-area countries have.  Since small and 
medium-sized vehicles are predominantly produced in China 
itself, Chinese foreign demand mainly focuses on premium 
vehicles, for which German car manufacturers are very well 
positioned in the global market.2 Therefore, at 9½%, the 
share in deliveries to China as a percentage of total car 
exports in 2010 for Germany was much higher than for 
France and Spain (½% and slightly over 0%, respectively), 
where predominantly small and medium-sized vehicles are 
produced. In Italy, which is home to some smaller manufac-
turers of luxury vehicles, the share amounted to 2%.
In order to systematically record the inﬂ  uence of the range 
of export goods on the differences in the exportation of 
goods from the EMU 4 to China with regard to all product 
groups, we will perform several model calculations.3 We 
will begin with the general export potential, calculated for 
a given country on the assumption that its share in total 
Chinese import demand will correspond to its world mar-
ket share. This value is compared with a country‘s speciﬁ  c 
export potential vis-à-vis China, taking into account, in 
addition, the product-related congruence between the 
Chinese demand for import goods and a country‘s export 
supply. To this end, the Chinese demand for imports is bro-
ken down into around 5,000 product groups.4 On this basis, 
we calculate the size of a country‘s total exports to China if 
its share of Chinese import demand for individual products 
corresponds with its world market share for the respective 
product. The speciﬁ  c export potential corresponds to the 
general export potential if the country-speciﬁ  c range of 
export goods is identical to that of world trade. The level 
of congruence, measured as the ratio of the two variables, 
would thus be one. By contrast, if the level of congruence 
falls below this reference value, the goods structure of 
the export country does not ﬁ  t Chinese import demand as 
well as the global export supply. Conversely, if the level of 
1 The data for the EMU 4 countries correspond to the share of a given 
sector in the total exports of the EMU 4 countries (including intra-
trade) in relation to the share of the corresponding sector in the 
international export volume (Balassa index of revealed comparative 
advantage). A value greater than one means that the EMU 4 have 
specialised in exports in a certain sector, as the share of this sector 
in total exports is higher than the share of the same sector in global 
exports. For China, the values relate to the share of a sector in the total imports of the country. The sectors were formed from groups of 
goods at the two-digit level of the Harmonized Commodity Descrip-
tion and Coding System (HS). — 2 According to Chinese data, the aver-
age value of a car imported by China – relative to the imports from all 
countries – amounted to just under US$38,000 in 2010, compared with 
an average sales value of around US$10,000 for a new car produced 
in China. — 3 The chosen approach is based on the concept of bilat-
eral trade intensity and complementarity. See T Vollrath, Diagnostic EMU 4 goods export specialisation and

congruence is greater than one, this means that a country’s 
export supply better matches Chinese import demand than 
the proﬁ  le of world exports as a whole.
For all of the four large euro-area countries, measured in global terms, this results in a below-average congruence 
with Chinese import demand during the period from 2007 to 2009. This is due to the fact that the Chinese import demand 
largely focuses on commodities and electronic goods, both 
of which play only a minor role in the range of products 
of the EMU 4 countries. It is therefore not surprising that 
South Korea and Japan, owing to their strong position in 
the electronic goods market, and Australia, as a supplier of commodities, have – measured in such terms – an above-average level of congruence with Chinese import demand. With regard to the range of products, with a congruence level of around one, the export supply of the United States also matches Chinese demand more closely than the large euro-area countries do.
There are nevertheless clear differences between the EMU 4 
countries. The negative effect, measured as the relative 
deviation between the general and the speciﬁ  c export 
potential is, at just over one-quarter, signiﬁ  cantly lower for 
Germany than for the other three large euro-area countries. According to this calculation, Spain comes last with a gap of -50%. The result implies that Spanish exports to China would be two-ﬁ  fths higher if its range of export goods 
corresponded to the German range. France and Italy could export, respectively, one-sixth or one-ﬁ  fth more goods 
to China. As shown by a further calculation, Germany‘s comparative advantage is due not least to its specialisation in the mechanical engineering and vehicle manufacturing sectors, for which there is a signiﬁ  cantly higher level of 
congruence with the speciﬁ  c Chinese demand.
We now compare the export potential of a trade partner, calculated using the product-related world market shares, with the actual export value. It becomes evident that all of the EMU 4 countries lagged behind their speciﬁ  c potential 
on an average for the years 2007 to 2009. The share of 
the four countries as a whole in Chinese imports was 50% 
lower than would have been expected according to their potential. One important reason for this is undoubtedly 
the large geographical distance and the consequently high 
transport costs.
5 This is supported by the fact that economies 
in geographical proximity to China ranked particularly high. 
In addition to the lower transport costs, closer cultural ties could also play an important role.
However, it is once again clear that there are pronounced 
differences between the EMU 4 countries. At two-ﬁ  fths, 
Germany has the lowest shortfall between actual exports 
and its speciﬁ  c export potential; Spain has the highest 
shortfall at just under three-quarters. As geographical distance cannot be considered as an explanatory factor for 
the differences, it is likely that other factors played a role. One possible cause could be that German exporters entered the Chinese market earlier than their European competitors and are now reaping the beneﬁ  ts.
Overall, the analysis suggests that German exports to 
China performed better than those of its euro-area partner 
countries partly as a result of the greater congruence of the German range of export goods. Furthermore, Germany was able to exploit this higher speciﬁ  c export potential better 
than the other three large euro-area countries.

Sectoral export developments  
of the EMU 4
The	structure 	of	EMU 	4	goods 	exports 	is	very	
similar 	in	that	intermediate 	goods 	(as	defined 	
for	the	classification 	of	goods 	by	Broad 	Eco-
nomic 	Categories) 	represented 	roughly 	half	
of	the	nominal 	exports 	of	goods 	in	2010. 	
These 	mainly 	comprised 	industrially 	manufac -
tured 	intermediate 	goods, 	including 	parts 	and	
accessories 	for	capital 	goods, 	and	transport 	
equipment. 	At	the	current 	end,	however, 	cyc-
lical	factors 	must 	also	be	considered. 	In	the	
first	recovery 	phase, 	which 	lasted 	into	2010, 	
for	instance, 	there 	was	increased 	stockbuild -
ing,	which 	boosted 	demand 	especially 	for	
intermediate 	products. 	By	contrast, 	capital 	
goods 	(excluding 	passenger 	cars)	took	a	back 	
seat	during 	this	stage 	of	the	recovery 	process. 	In	2010, 	exports 	of	these 	goods 	were 	there -
fore	between 	7%	(France) 	and	13% 	(Italy) 	be-
low	their	2008 	levels. 	In	all	four	countries, 	the	
importance 	of	capital 	goods 	was	smaller 	in	
2010 	than	in	1998. 	However, 	the	exception -
ally	weak 	performance 	of	French 	manufactur -
ers	meant 	that	the	percentage 	of	investment 	
goods 	in	French 	exports 	had	already 	fallen 	by	
6	percentage 	points 	between 	1998 	and	2008, 	
while 	their	weight 	in	German 	and	Italian 	ex-
ports 	has	declined 	only	since 	the	onset 	of	the	
crisis. 	The	ratios 	were 	fairly 	similar 	in	Ger-
many, 	France 	and	Italy	in	2010, 	with	figures 	of	
between 	17½% 	(Italy) 	and	20% 	(Germany), 	
whereas 	in	Spain, 	capital 	goods 	represented 	
only	10% 	of	total	goods 	exports.
Throughout 	the	1999 	to	2010 	period, 	Ger-
many 	achieved 	the	highest 	rates 	of	growth 	in	
almost 	all	sectors; 	only	Spain 	posted 	more 	
pronounced 	gains 	for	intermediate 	goods 	
(+6½%). 	The	sharp 	increase 	in	German 	ex-
ports 	of	consumer 	goods 	(+7½%) 	is	also	
noteworthy. 	Nonetheless, 	their	share 	in	total	
exports 	of	goods 	was	much 	lower 	in	2010, 	at	
16½%, 	than	in	the	other 	three 	countries, 	
partly 	because 	this	category 	includes 	proc-
essed 	and	unprocessed 	food, 	which 	is	a	more 	
important 	export 	product 	there.
Diverging 	trends 	can	be	observed 	particularly 	
for	exports 	of	passenger 	cars	(excluding 	vehi-
cle	parts). 	Between 	1999 	and	2010, 	German 	
and	Spanish 	auto	exports 	increased 	by	an	av-
erage 	of	5%	and	2½% 	a	year, 	respectively. 	In	
Italy,	by	contrast, 	they	rose	only	½%, 	and	in	
France 	they	even 	fell	by	½%. 	In	this	context, 	it	
should 	be	borne 	in	mind 	that	Germany’s 	part-
ner	countries 	produce 	mainly 	small 	cars	and	Intermediate

mid-sized 	and	luxury 	class	make 	up	a	much 	
larger 	percentage 	of	German 	exports 	of	pas-
senger 	cars.	Italian 	manufacturers 	are	also	ac-
tive	in	this	area	of	the	market, 	but	unit	sales

ment 	benefited 	considerably 	from 	dynamic 	
growth 	in	non-EU 	markets 	over	the	past	dec-
ade.	Thus, 	the	wealthy 	clientele, 	who	have 	a	
marked 	preference 	for	imported 	luxury 	cars,	
have 	expanded 	sharply 	in	the	emerging 	mar-

Main determinants of export develop -
ments in the EMU 4
One	of	the	main 	determinants 	of	a	country’s 	
exports 	is	growth 	in	global 	trade 	and	relative 	
price 	competitiveness. 	To	what 	extent 	the	
stimuli 	exerted 	by	global 	demand 	can	be	ex-
ploited 	is	determined, 	first,	by	the	regional 	
structure 	of	import 	demand 	and,	second, 	by	
the	bias	of	a	country’s 	export 	industry. 	In	ad-
dition, 	a	series 	of	other 	factors 	play	a	role	in	
this	context, 	such	as	differences 	in	product 	
range 	and	in	enterprises’ 	globalisation 	strate -

In	a	simple 	statistical 	analysis, 	real	growth 	in	
the	goods 	exports 	of	the	four	countries 	under 	
observation 	can	be	broken 	down 	into	a	global 	
trade 	effect, 	a	regional 	effect, 	a	competition 	
effect 	and	other 	effects. 	The	global 	trade 	ef-
fect	represents 	global 	import 	growth 	minus 	
the	imports 	of	the	export 	country 	under 	re-
view, 	in	other 	words, 	the	exogenous 	stimulus 	
exerted 	by	the	global 	economy. 	The	regional 	
effect 	refers 	to	the	deviation 	in	the	growth 	of	
the	export 	markets 	of	a	country 	from 	that	of	
global 	trade 	(after 	subtracting 	the	imports 	of	
the	country 	in	question). 	A	positive 	(negative) 	
deviation 	can	be	interpreted 	as	meaning 	that	
exporters 	had	a	stronger 	position 	in	regions 	
with	above 	(below)-average 	import 	momen -
tum. 	Growth 	in	the	sales 	markets 	is	calculated 	
based 	on	Dutch 	Centraal 	Planbureau 	(CPB) 	
estimates 	of	real	import 	developments 	in	
seven 	regions 	of	the	world. 	Based 	on	the	
IMF’s 	Directions 	of	Trade 	Statistics, 	these 	were 	
weighted 	using 	these 	regions’ 	respective 	
share 	in	exports. 	Discrepancies 	between 	the	
growth 	of	sales 	markets 	and	that	of	the	re-
spective 	country’s 	exports 	indicate 	market 	
share 	gains 	or	losses 	on	the	sales 	markets; 	
they	can	be	attributed 	to	changes 	in	price 	
competitiveness 	and	other 	effects. 	The	latter 	
reflect 	any	deviations 	of	export 	growth 	from 	
export 	market 	growth 	that	cannot 	be	ex-
plained 	by	competition 	effects. 	For	the	pur-
poses 	of	this	statistical 	analysis, 	they	will	ini-
tially	be	treated 	as	a	residual, 	but	will	be	ex-
amined 	in	more 	detail 	in	the	following. 	Other 	
effects 	reflect, 	first,	the	influence 	of	the	dif-
ferent 	range 	of	products 	on	offer 	from 	the	
four	countries’ 	exporters. 	A	consistent 	and	
distinct 	measurement 	of	the	product 	range 	
effect 	is	impossible 	because 	there 	are	no	real	data, 	broken 	down 	by	group 	of	goods, 	across 	
all	countries. 	Second, 	this	metric 	includes 	the	
effects 	of	all	other 	conceivable 	determinants 	
of	exports, 	which 	are	usually 	difficult 	to	meas -
ure.	This	measure 	also	reflects 	statistical 	dis-
tortions, 	for	instance 	as	a	result 	of	the	differ -
ent	deflation 	methods 	mentioned 	above.
Changes 	in	an	economy’s 	price 	competitive -
ness	cause 	substitution 	processes 	among 	for-
eign	buyers. 	When 	an	exporter’s 	prices 	rise	
perceptibly, 	demand 	generally 	shifts 	towards 	
suppliers 	whose 	prices 	have 	risen 	more 	slowly. 	
Various 	indicators 	are	used 	to	measure 	price 	
competitiveness; 	they	often 	coincide 	only	in	
trend 	terms.7	This	article 	uses	total	sales 	defla -
tors,8	which 	reflect 	price 	developments 	in	the	
entire 	economy 	and	therefore 	the	relative 	
price 	of	potential 	export 	(or	import) 	goods.
The	size	of	the	competition 	effect 	is	deter -
mined 	by	the	price 	elasticity 	of	demand 	in	
terms 	of	price 	competitiveness 	and	the	extent 	
of	relative 	price 	changes. 	According 	to	an	
econometric 	analysis 	of	the	four	euro-area 	
member 	states 	under 	review, 	the	sensitivity 	of	
export 	growth 	to	changes 	in	this	price 	ratio	is	
assumed 	to	be	0.4	for	the	period 	since 	the	Diverging price

price	 competitiveness	 –	as	measured	 against	
24	industrial	 countries	 based	 on	total	 sales	
deflators	 –	has	improved	 considerably	 in	Ger-
many	 (+10½%)	 and	 moderately	 in	France	
(+1 %),	 while	 it	has	 deteriorated	 sharply	 in	
	Italy	(-13½%)	and	Spain	(-18%).
These	 diverging	 trends	 can	be	explained,	 first,	
by	different	 trends	 in	wage	 cost	 pressure.	 If	
alternatively	 one	 looks	 at	the	real	exchange	
rate	 based	 on	overall	 unit	 labour	 costs,	 the	
French	 economy	 became	 slightly	 less	 com-
petitive	 in	the	period	 under	 observation.	 In	
Italy,	 the	deterioration	 was	 even	 worse	 than	
suggested	 by	the	indicator	 determined	 using	
total	 sales	 deflators.	 By	contrast,	 real	 ex-
change	 rates	 based	 on	unit	 labour	 costs	 sug-
gest	 a	more	 marked	 improvement	 in	price	
competitiveness	 for	Germany	 and	a	moderate	
deterioration	 for	Spain.	 Second,	 cost-cutting	
through	 increased	 sourcing	 of	intermediate	
goods	 from	 low-wage	 countries	 may	 make	
itself	 felt	in	price	 competitiveness	 on	the	basis	
of	total	 sales	 deflators,	 but	not	in	the	measure	
based	 on	unit	labour	 cost.	 Different	 trends	 for	
these	 two	 indicators	 are	reflected	 in	shifting	
profit	 margins,	 which	 will	 be	discussed	 in	
greater	detail	below.
The	chart	 on	this	page	 shows	 the	influence	 of	
the	global	 trade	 effect,	 the	regional	 effect,	
the	competition	 effect	 and	 other	 effects	 on	
growth	 in	the	real	exports	 of	the	four	 large	
euro-area	 countries.	 In	all	four	 countries,	
growth	 in	 exports	 during	 the	 1999

weight 	of	deducted 	imports, 	this	does 	not	ex-
plain 	the	considerable 	differences 	in	export 	
performance.
The	regional 	effect 	was	negative 	for	all	coun -
tries	over	the	past	decade, 	as	EMU 	4	exports 	
are	still	relatively 	heavily 	biased 	towards 	the	
slower-growing 	sales 	markets 	in	the	euro	area	
and	other 	industrial 	countries. 	At	the	same 	
time, 	it	is	also	evident 	that	the	strength 	of	the	
response 	of	exporters 	in	the	four	countries 	to	
the	regional 	shift	in	the	growth 	markets 	has	
differed. 	The	negative 	regional 	effect 	was	
comparatively 	small 	in	Germany 	as	well	as	It-
aly	at	just	under 	¼	percentage 	point. 	In	France 	
and	Spain, 	by	contrast, 	the	regional 	compo -
nent	lowered 	export 	growth 	by	½	percentage 	
point 	and	¾	percentage 	point 	respectively. 	Ul-
timately, 	however, 	the	regional 	effect 	explains 	
only	a	comparatively 	small 	part	of	the	hetero -
geneity 	of	real	export 	growth.
The	considerable 	discrepancy 	between 	the	
growth 	of	the	respective 	sales 	markets 	and	
that	of	the	four	countries’ 	exports 	means 	that	
exporters 	in	the	EMU 	4	exploit 	opportunities 	
arising 	on	their	sales 	markets 	to	different 	de-
grees, 	which 	can	be	attributed 	to	price 	and	
other 	factors. 	For	instance, 	looking 	at	the	av-
erage 	for	the	years 	1999 	to	2010, 	growth 	of	
Spanish 	exports 	was	1	percentage 	point, 	that	
in	French 	exports 	2½	percentage 	points 	and	
that	of	Italian 	exports 	4½	percentage 	points 	
lower 	than	growth 	of	the	sales 	markets 	would 	
have 	suggested. 	In	Germany, 	by	contrast, 	ex-
ports 	expanded 	by	¾	percentage 	point 	more 	
than	would 	have 	been 	anticipated. 	Based 	on	
this	analysis, 	the	improvement 	in	price 	com-
petitiveness 	lifted 	German 	export 	growth 	by	¼	percentage 	point, 	while 	its	deterioration 	
dragged 	export 	growth 	in	Spain 	and	Italy	
down 	by	½	percentage 	point 	in	both 	in-
stances. 	In	France, 	the	competition 	effect 	was	
virtually 	negligible. 	Like	the	regional 	effect, 	
the	competition 	effect 	–	as	measured 	based 	
on	total	sales 	deflators 	–	therefore 	also	ex-
plains 	only	a	relatively 	small 	proportion 	of	the	
differences 	in	export 	developments. 	Thus, 	
other 	effects 	are	thought 	to	make 	negative 	
contributions 	of	2½	and	3¾	percentage 	
points 	respectively 	in	the	case	of	France 	and	
Italy,	but	just	½	percentage 	point 	for	Spain. 	
The	corresponding 	figure 	for	Germany 	is	
+½	percentage 	point, 	however. 	These 	effects 	
will	be	analysed 	in	more 	detail 	below 	(see	also	
box	on	pages 	32-33).
Significance of the product range effect
The	sectoral 	structure 	of	exports 	in	the	EMU 	4	
countries 	was	not	explicitly 	factored 	into	the	
preceding 	cause-and-effect 	analysis. 	Where 	
growth 	in	global 	import 	demand 	has	a	spe-
cific	sector 	composition, 	which 	is	more 	(or	
less)	in	line	with	a	country’s 	export 	supply, 	the	
country 	will	receive 	more 	(or	less)	stimuli 	from 	
global 	trade, 	regardless 	of	its	price 	competi -
tiveness. 	It	should 	be	noted, 	however, 	that	
the	range 	of	products 	that	a	country’s 	export 	
industry 	offers 	is	often 	only	inadequately 	de-
scribed 	by	the	standard 	statistical 	goods 	clas-
sifications. 	In	the	business 	world, 	factors 	that	
help	differentiate 	between 	products 	are	also	
relevant 	but	statistically 	difficult 	to	quantify, 	
such	as	product 	quality, 	reliability 	and	acces -
sibility 	of	customer 	service, 	a	brand’s 	prestige 	
or	the	manufacturer’s 	reputation.Negative

groups	 of	goods	 were	 defined	 based	 on	the	
67	divisions	 (two-digit	 codes)	 of	the	Standard	
International	 Trade	 Classification	 (SITC).	 The	
analysis	 is	conducted	 at	the	nominal	 level,	 as	
the	data	 needed	 for	a	real	calculation	 –	which	
would,	 in	principle,	 be	preferable	 –	are	not	
available,	 as	mentioned	 above.	 Moreover,	 an	
analysis	 over	 an	extended	 period,	 as	is	the	
case	 here,	 would	 have	 to	take	 into	 account	
the	fact	 that	 the	range	 of	export	 goods	 is	
likely	to	be	adjusted	to	demand	over	time.
It	becomes	 evident	 that	 in	all	four	 euro-area	
countries	 the	potential	 export	 growth	 calcu -
lated	 in	this	 manner	 has	lagged	 growth	 in	
global	 trade	 as	a	result	 of	their	 sectoral	 export	
structure.	 The	negative	 effect	 is	due,	 amongst	
other	 things,	 to	the	fact	 that	 global	 trade	 in	
commodities,	 in	which	 the	EMU	 4	are	virtually	
not	 involved,	 has	 expanded	 disproportion -
ately	 sharply	 partly	 because	 of	China’s	 rapid	
industrialisation	 and	 fast-rising	 prices	 for	
these	 products.	 For	Germany	 and	France,	 the	
shortfall	 as	compared	 to	average	 growth	 in	
nominal	 world	 trade	 (8%	 on	a	US	dollar	 basis)	
is	½	percentage	 point	 on	average	 for	1999	
to	2009,	 but	slightly	 larger	 for	Italy	and	Spain,	at	1	percentage	 point.12	Overall,	 the	calcula -
tion	therefore	 suggests	 that	the	clearly	 weaker	
growth	 in	French	 and	Italian	 exports,	 in	value	
terms,	 cannot	 be	explained	 by	the	sectoral	 fo-
cus	of	its	goods	 supply	 in	the	case	 of	France	
and	only	 to	a	small	 degree	 in	the	case	 of	Italy.	
The	main	 reason	 for	growth	 differentials	 was,	
in	fact,	 that	 both	 countries	 have	 lost	global	
market	 share	 in	many	 sectors	 of	industry	 over	
the	past	 ten	years,	 whereas	 German	 –	and

maintain 	or	even 	expand 	their	market 	posi-
tion.
In	this	context, 	it	is,	however, 	also	important 	
to	determine 	whether 	the	intensity 	of	compe -
tition 	on	the	international 	product 	markets 	in	
which 	the	individual 	countries’ 	enterprises 	
have 	specialised 	is	high	or	increasing, 	poten -
tially	making 	it	more 	difficult 	for	enterprises 	
to	hold	on	to	their	global 	market 	share. 	China 	
especially 	has	in	recent 	years 	upped 	the	com-
petitive 	pressure 	on	foreign 	competitors 	in	
many 	sectors 	and	considerably 	expanded 	its	
position. 	This	article 	will	go	on	to	examine 	
whether 	any	one	of	the	EMU 	4	countries 	was	
particularly 	exposed 	to	competition 	with	
China 	as	a	result 	of	its	sectoral 	export 	struc -
ture	and	whether 	a	country’s 	range 	of	exports 	
could 	have 	had	a	dampening 	effect 	on	export 	
trends 	for	this	reason. 	China’s 	aggregate 	glo-
bal	market 	share 	across 	the	individual 	sectors, 	
weighted 	by	the	relevant 	sector’s 	percentage 	
in	the	total	exports 	of	China’s 	competitor 	
country, 	shall	serve 	as	an	indicator 	of	the	ex-
tent	to	which 	an	economy’s 	export 	sector 	
competes 	with	China. 	The	year	1998 	was	se-
lected 	as	the	base	year	for	the	sector’s 	share 	
in	total	exports, 	while 	the	year	2009 	was	used 	
as	the	base	year	for	China’s 	global 	market 	
shares. 	For	Germany, 	an	analysis 	based 	on	
SITC	two-digit 	classifications 	shows 	a	mean 	
(weighted) 	global 	market 	share 	of	10% 	for	
China 	across 	all	sectors. 	Whereas 	the	corre -
sponding 	market 	shares 	for	France 	(10½%) 	
and	Spain 	(10%) 	are	in	the	same 	magnitude, 	
the	figure 	for	Italy	is	appreciably 	higher 	
(13½%).13	This	is	an	indication 	that	the	
stronger 	competitive 	pressure 	from 	China 	
could 	be	a	reason 	for	Italy’s 	comparatively 	weak 	export 	performance. 	In	the	case	of	
France, 	the	argument 	appears 	to	have 	no	ex-
planatory 	power, 	however.
Diverging earnings growth
The	other 	effects 	also	capture 	the	impact 	of	
changes 	in	profit 	margins 	on	export 	growth. 	
It	has	already 	been 	pointed 	out	that	changes 	
in	wage 	costs 	are	not	always 	fully	passed 	
through 	to	buyers 	and	that	some 	of	them 	
feed	into	the	profit 	margin 	instead. 	This	ulti-
mately 	applies 	to	all	types 	of	cost. 	Such 	
changes 	in	profit 	margins 	are	also	reflected 	in	
macroeconomic 	indicators 	such	as	gross 	op-
erating 	surplus 	as	a	percentage 	of	gross 	value 	
added.14	In	Germany, 	this	earnings 	indicator 	
rose	sharply 	from 	29½% 	to	36½% 	in	manu -
facturing 	excluding 	construction 	for	the	1999 	
to	2008 	period. 	The	cost	advantages 	as	a	re-
sult	of	wage 	moderation 	and	the	increased 	
sourcing 	of	intermediate 	goods 	from 	low-
wage 	countries 	were 	apparently 	also	used 	to	
boost 	profit 	margins.15	This	in	turn	is	likely 	to

13	Another 	study 	compares 	the	percentage 	of	sectors 	in	
which 	China 	and	its	competitor 	country 	have 	an	export 	
specialisation. 	It	found 	that	Spain 	had	the	largest 	export 	
overlap 	with	China 	of	the	EMU 	4	countries 	in	the	2005 	
to	2008 	period 	(see	F	di	Mauro, 	K	Forster 	and	A	Lima 	
(2010), 	The	global 	downturn 	and	its	effect 	on	euro	area

ries,	No	119,	p	22).
14	The	ratio	is	not	a	profit 	ratio	in	the	narrower 	sense, 	as	
depreciation 	is	contained 	in	both 	the	numerator 	and	the	
denominator.
15	For	Germany, 	this	finding 	is	backed 	by	data	from 	the	
corporate 	balance 	sheet 	statistics, 	which 	show 	that	en-
terprises’ 	gross 	return 	on	sales 	rose	by	almost 	2	percent -
age	points 	from 	its	low	in	2003 	to	its	historic 	high	of	
5¼% 	in	2007. 	The	subsequent 	decline 	can	be	attributed 	
to	the	economic 	slowdown 	and	is	consequently 	probably 	
only	temporary 	(see	Deutsche 	Bundesbank, 	German 	en-

ther	increase 	their	export 	activities, 	for	in-
stance 	by	redoubling 	their	efforts 	to	expand 	
their	market 	position 	and	open 	up	new	mar-
kets. 	While 	this	metric 	fell	especially 	sharply 	in	
Germany 	in	the	recession 	year	of	2009, 	it	in-
creased 	appreciably 	again 	in	2010. 	Export 	en-
terprises’ 	investment 	activity 	is	therefore 	un-
likely 	to	have 	been 	permanently 	weakened.
In	Spain, 	the	earnings 	indicator 	also	rose	be-
tween 	1998 	and	2010. 	Given 	large 	wage 	in-
creases 	there, 	this	was	achieved 	partly 	by	sig-
nificantly 	raising 	prices, 	which 	has,	however, 	
reduced 	price 	competitiveness. 	Meanwhile, 	
this	metric 	fell	considerably 	in	the	French 	and	
Italian 	manufacturing 	sector. 	In	both 	coun -
tries, 	higher 	costs 	have 	apparently 	been 	ab-
sorbed 	to	a	greater 	extent 	by	lowering 	profit 	
margins. 	This	likely 	meant 	that	yields 	in	the	export 	industry 	dropped 	and	that	production 	
of	export 	goods 	became 	less	profitable.16	
Overall, 	that	suggests 	that	cost	increases 	(or	
reductions) 	that	are	not	passed 	through 	to	ex-
port	prices 	may	also	weigh 	on	(or	support) 	
export 	developments 	in	the	medium 	and	long	
term.
Different globalisation strategies
The	main 	drivers 	of	international 	trade 	in	the	
past	two	decades 	include 	increasing 	vertical 	
specialisation 	in	production, 	which 	has	re-
sulted 	in	a	pronounced 	expansion 	of	cross-
border 	supply 	chains.17	In	this	context, 	it	
should 	also	be	borne 	in	mind 	that	splitting 	up	
production 	chains 	tends 	to	boost 	export 	
growth.18	According 	to	calculations 	which 	are	
based 	on	the	input-output 	data	of	the	na-

port	 content	 is	also	likely	 to	have	 risen,	 though	
no	comparable	data	are	available.20
Increased	 sourcing	 of	intermediate	 goods	
from	 abroad	 (outsourcing)	 is	not	 the	 only	
strategy	 to	lower	 costs.	 Another	 is	to	transfer	
the	 entire	 production	 or	finishing	 to	low-
wage	 countries	 (offshoring).21	In	the	past	 two	
decades,	 Germany’s	 manufacturing	 sector	
has	 significantly	 expanded	 the	sourcing	 of	
parts	 from	 abroad.	 By	contrast,	 French	 enter -
prises	 appear	 to	have	 preferred	 to	establish	
and	 acquire	 capacity	 to	produce	 final	 prod -
ucts	 abroad.22	The	fact	that	 Germany	 had	at	
its	disposal	 more	 of	the	capacity	 needed	 to	
expand	 exports	 than	 France,	 as	domestic	 de-
mand	 growth	 has,	 at	times,	 been	 weak	 over	
the	past	decade	may	also	have	been	a	factor.
Such	 differences	 in	globalisation	 strategy	 can	
be	demonstrated	 using	 the	automobile	 indus -
try	as	an	example.	 By	buying	 low-cost	 parts,	
preferentially	 from	 neighbouring	 central	 and	
east	 European	 countries,	 German	 manufac -
turers	 have	 managed	 to	continue	 to	carry	 out	
most	 final	 vehicle	 assembly	 domestically	 and	
still	make	 a	profit.	 The	French	 auto	 industry,	
by	contrast,	 appears	 to	have	 been	 less	active	
in	establishing	 supply	 chains	 with	 enterprises	
in	the	central	 and	 east	 European	 countries.	
Instead,	 it	has	tended	 to	set	up	final	 assembly	
plants	 at	foreign	 locations,	 which	 also	process	
parts	 produced	 by	French	 factories,	 however.	
Moreover,	 one	French	 manufacturer	 has	pro-
moted	 globalisation	 by	allying	 itself	 with	 a	
large	 non-European	 car	manufacturer.	 The	
Spanish	 automobile	 sector	 is	like	its	German	
counterpart	 in	that	 a	relatively	 large	 share	 of	
parts	 are	sourced	 from	 abroad.	 This	 is	partly	because	 all	auto	 plants	 in	Spain	 belong	 to	the	
production	 network	 of	large	 international	
groups.	 The	weak	 export	 performance	 of	the	
Italian	 auto	 industry	 over	 the	past	 decade	 is	
likely	 related	 to	the	structural	 crisis	 at	the	
country’s	 largest	 manufacturer,	 which	 it	has	
probably	 overcome	 now,	 at	least	 in	part.	 With	
the	takeover	 of	a	US	car	producer,	 it	launched	
a	globalisation	 offensive	 in	recent	 years	 whose	
focus	is	similar	to	the	French	strategy.
Another	 German	 particularity	 which	 may	 help	
explain	 the	strong	 export	 performance	 even	
though	 its	influence	 is	difficult	 to	quantify	 is	
the	large	 number	 of	Mittelstand 	companies,	
which	 occupy	 relatively	 small	 market	 niches,

Determinants of euro-area exports – results of econometric estimations
Deutsche BundesbankTo supplement the statistical analysis of export growth 
components in the EMU 4 explained in detail in the main 
text, we estimated export functions for a panel of coun-
tries based on the elasticities approach. We assume that 
the change in export volumes depends on growth in real 
demand on the sales markets (RD) and movements in the 
real exchange rate (RER) as an indicator of price competi-
tiveness. Given that these traditional determinants ex-
plain only part of the heterogeneity in the euro-area 
countries’ export growth, we also look at the impact of 
other macroeconomic factors. The estimating equation 
thus also contains variables that aim to reﬂ  ect the inﬂ  u-
ence of various other effects (OE).
X = f (RD, RER, OE ) 1
Based on the panel approach used here, the estimated 
coeffi  cients are the same for all of the countries in the 
analysis. Differences in export growth arise from the 
 heterogeneity of the explanatory variables, a country- 
specifi  c constant and the country-specifi  c residual (other 
effects). While in the main text (pages 23 to 26) differ-
ences are explained by the rate of change in weighted 
demand on the sales markets, shifts in price competitive-
ness and a residual, in this analysis the effect of growth in 
the sales markets on exports is calculated econometrically 
and can differ from one. Therefore, the main focus of the 
study is not what caused the market share to change but 
the factors that can generally determine the heterogen-
eity of euro-area countries’ export developments.
Real goods exports, as defi  ned in the national accounts, 
are the response variable. We approximate demand on 
the sales markets using weighted (real) import demand in 
the United States, Japan, the euro area, Asian emerging 
economies, Latin American emerging economies, the 
Middle East and North Africa, as well as Central and East-
ern Europe. The data on imports are taken from the 
World Trade Monitor, which is published by the Dutch 
economic research institute Centraal Planbureau (CPB), 
and the shares in exports are from the IMF’s Direction of 
Trade Statistics. Real exchange rates vis-à-vis 24 partner 
countries are calculated using deﬂ  ators of total sales.
The analysis also takes account of the following other ef-
fects: (i) the degree of outsourcing, approximated using 
the share of intermediate goods imports (excluding oil) in 
total gross value added, (ii) the relative performance of 
industry compared with the market services sectors and 
construction, measured by their relative profi  tability 
( ratio of the respective share in gross operating surplus to gross value added as defi  ned in the national accounts). 
The purpose of this is to discover to what extent dispari-
ties in domestic demand have led to differing concentra-
tions of production capacity in the services sectors and 
construction. In addition, the analysis looks at (iii) the ef-
fect of profi  tability in the production sector excluding 
construction. We approximate profi  tability using the 
share of the gross operating surplus in gross value added 
for the production sector excluding construction as an 
earnings indicator. In doing this, we aim to take account 
of the fact that the real exchange rate selected in this 
analysis merely reﬂ  ects price competitiveness; it does not 
show how the profi  tability of domestic production facili-
ties has evolved in this price setting. However, profi  tabil-
ity also affects supply. If rising wage cost pressure is not 
passed through to prices, it inﬂ  uences export activity via 
the supply channel. Furthermore, we calculate (iv) the im-
pact of innovation (measured by per-capita expenditure 
on research and development in euro) and (v) the impor-
tance of high-technology sectors. The share of chemical 
industry (including the pharmaceutical industry) and 
manufacture of offi  ce machinery and equipment, com-
puters, electrical engineering and optical and precision 
equipment in domestic value added feeds into the esti-
mations.
The panel comprises ten countries (Germany, France, 
 Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, 
Finland and Austria). Belgium and Luxembourg are not 
included because of insuffi  cient data, while Slovenia, 
Malta, Cyprus, Slovakia and Estonia are left out because 
they joined the euro area relatively recently. We perform 
the estimations using seasonally adjusted quarterly 
growth rates for the period beginning in the fi  rst quarter 
of 2000. The shares of intermediate goods imports in 
value added and the profi  tability ratios are included in 
differentials, and the share of high-technology sectors in 
value added is included as a ratio. The fact that the esti-
mations cover a relatively short period of time is due both 
to data constraints in some member states and our desire 
to restrict the analysis to the period following the launch 
of monetary union. This means that the main focus is on 
short-term elasticities; the coeffi  cients cannot be com-
pared one-to-one with estimated elasticities in long-term 
models. We carry out the estimations using the panel 
fi  xed effects approach with cluster-robust standard er-
rors.

The parameter in front of the demand variable is discern-
ibly less than one, meaning that the euro-area countries 
do not usually fully exploit the potential created by im-
port growth in the sales markets.
In the estimations for the period extending to the second 
quarter of 2010, the two quarters that show the sharpest 
slump in global trade (the fourth quarter of 2008 and the 
fi  rst quarter of 2009) turn out to be outliers. Tests show 
that the special effect primarily reﬂ  ects the slump in de-
mand rather than abrupt shifts in real exchange rates. 
We therefore include an interaction term between weighted global demand and a dummy variable for these 
two quarters. The tests illustrate that the elasticity to 
growth in global trade rose substantially not only in the 
two crisis quarters but possibly also in the period starting 
in the second quarter of 2009. The effect of price com-petitiveness also appears to have increased. The recovery 
in goods exports thus tended to be stronger in countries 
where prices moderated more signifi  cantly.
Including additional explanatory variables in the estimat-
ing equation reduces the estimated elasticities to de-
mand and relative prices in all cases. The impact of out-
sourcing proves to be very robust. In addition, countries 
where high-technology sectors account for a larger share 
of value added are shown to have stronger export 
growth. Expenditure on research and development also 
turns out to have a positive impact on exports. However, this impact is often statistically insignifi  cant and is there-
fore left out of the table. The earnings indicator likewise 
has a clear positive correlation with export growth, but 
only in the shorter period. This may be related to differ-
ences in how industrial companies responded to the sharp slump in global trade; profi  ts fell very sharply par-
ticularly in areas where the slump was viewed as being 
temporary and companies therefore chose not to cut 
jobs. Regarding the relative profi  tability of industry com-
pared with the services sectors (including construction) – which depends, among other things, on domestic de-
mand growth – the tests confi  rm that growth in goods 
exports tended to be slower when market services were 
more profi  table.
Estimating the export functions for goods and services 
produces fairly similar results to those for goods. In par-ticular, the elasticity to growth in sales markets seems to 
be virtually identical to that of goods exports and the 
elasticity to price competitiveness only slightly higher. 
However, the effect of outsourcing is somewhat weaker, and exports do not display any signifi  cant elasticity to the 
relative earnings indicator for industry and market serv-
ices. Hence, although a higher concentration of produc-
tion capacity in the services sector dampened the mo-
mentum of goods exports, it was not necessarily 
associated with a weaker rise in exports as a whole, ie 
including services.

in	73	categories 	(1½%) 	for	France, 	162	(3%) 	
for	Italy	and	44	categories 	(1 %) 	for	Spain. 	The	
different 	sizes	of	the	economies 	is	probably 	
relatively 	irrelevant.
According 	to	a	study 	by	Venohr 	and	Meyer, 	
“hidden 	champions”, 	ie	German 	Mittelstand 	
companies 	that	are	ranked 	first	or	second 	in	
their	segment 	worldwide, 	exhibited 	much 	
more 	pronounced 	growth 	–	as	measured 	by	
turnover 	–	at	8½% 	a	year	for	the	1994 	
to	2004 	period 	than	DAX-30 	companies 	(5%) 	
and	German 	enterprises 	overall 	(2½%).23	The	
specialised 	nature 	of	many 	German 	Mittel -
stand 	companies 	and	their	extraordinary 	ex-
port	orientation 	are	two	sides 	of	the	same 	
coin. 	Focusing 	on	technically 	sophisticated 	
niche 	products 	makes 	particularly 	good 	busi-
ness	sense 	if	large 	segments 	of	the	global 	
market 	are	supplied. 	Conversely, 	exporting 	is	
generally 	fairly 	profitable 	for	such	Mittelstand 	
companies 	as	their	niches 	provide 	compara -
tively 	good 	protection 	against 	large 	enter -
prises 	both 	in	the	industrial 	countries 	and	in	
emerging 	market 	economies, 	which 	do	not	
have 	sufficient 	potential 	sales 	volume 	to	enter 	
the	market. 	Moreover, 	German 	Mittelstand 	
companies 	frequently 	have 	a	good 	brand 	im-
age	and	occupy 	the	high-end 	segment. 	They 	
are	also	better 	able	to	accommodate 	specific 	
client 	requests 	than	large 	enterprises. 	These 	
advantages 	must 	be	continually 	shored 	up	
through 	research-intensive 	innovation, 	ad-
justments 	to	product-related 	services 	and	
constant 	optimisation 	of	the	production 	proc-
ess.	However, 	this	appears 	to	have 	been 	suc-
cessful 	in	recent 	years. 	Contributory 	factors, 	besides 	the	pronounced 	long-term 	focus 	of	
the	frequently 	family-run 	enterprises, 	are	
likely 	to	be	the	high	standard 	of	training 	en-
joyed 	by	skilled 	workers 	and	engineers 	and	
the	fairly 	close 	ties	between 	management 	
and	staff.
Summary
In	the	years 	since 	the	launch 	of	the	third 	stage 	
of	monetary 	union, 	the	German 	–	and	with	a	
slight 	lag,	the	Spanish 	export 	industry 	–	have 	
benefited 	from 	the	strong 	growth 	in	global 	
trade 	significantly 	more 	than	their	French 	and	
Italian 	counterparts. 	It	is	striking 	that	growth 	
in	the	sales 	markets 	of	all	four	countries 	un-
der	review 	was	unable 	to	match 	the	expan -
sion	of	global 	trade, 	as	exports 	are	still	fairly 	
strongly 	biased 	towards 	the	euro	area	and	
other 	industrial 	countries. 	In	addition, 	it	
should 	be	noted 	that	Germany’s 	real	exports 	
were 	boosted 	to	a	degree 	by	improved 	price 	
competitiveness, 	while 	this	factor 	had	a	nega -
tive	effect 	for	Italy	and	Spain, 	and	a	neutral 	
effect 	for	France. 	Deviations 	in	the	sectoral 	
bias	of	the	supply 	of	goods 	only	partly 	explain 	
differences 	in	the	export 	growth 	of	the	EMU 	4	
countries. 	In	addition, 	there 	is	evidence 	sug-
gesting 	that	different 	earnings 	developments 	
in	the	four	countries 	and	enterprises’ 	diverg -
ing	globalisation 	strategies 	have 	impacted 	on	
the	export 	performance 	of	the	large 	euro-

Leasing financing in Germany
Over 	the	last	four	decades, 	leasing 	has	become 	a	permanent 	feature 	of	corporate 	financing 	in	
Germany. 	Today, 	almost 	one-fifth 	of	fixed 	investment 	in	the	business 	sector 	is	financed 	through 	
leasing, 	the	main 	focus 	being 	on	motor 	vehicles. 	This	special 	form 	of	external 	financing 	is	an	al-
ternative 	to,	and	supplements, 	the	bank 	loan. 	Leasing 	enables 	enterprises 	to	invest 	in	buildings 	
or	machinery 	and	equipment 	without 	having 	to	use	capital 	or	debt. 	This	alleviates 	the	problem 	
that	demand 	for	new	capital 	goods 	may	not	be	met,	particularly 	during 	an	upturn, 	because 	en-
terprises 	eager 	to	invest 	experience 	financing 	and	collateralisation 	difficulties. 	Leasing 	is	an	at-
tractive 	financing 	instrument 	for	lessors 	because 	it	allows 	them 	not	only	to	avoid 	the	usual 	credit 	
risks	but	also	to	pass	the	property 	and	price 	risks	involved 	in	capital 	goods 	on	to	the	lessee. 	The	
reasons 	why	the	parties 	opt	for	leasing 	are	not	limited 	to	purely 	financing 	and	risk	aspects, 	how-
ever; 	they	also	take	organisational 	and	marketing 	aspects 	into	account.
A	special 	analysis 	of	the	annual 	accounts 	of	leasing 	firms 	contained 	in	the	Deutsche 	Bundes -
bank’s 	database 	for	the	last	available 	financial 	year, 	2008, 	shows 	these 	enterprises 	to	have 	special 	
balance 	sheet 	and	income 	statement 	structures; 	moreover, 	they	resort 	to	a	variety 	of	sources 	for	
refinancing. 	The	low	level	of	own	funds 	that	is	characteristic 	of	the	leasing 	industry 	heightens 	risk	
potential. 	For	example, 	the	crisis-induced 	disruptions 	in	the	financial 	system 	led	to	lasting 	finan -
cing	difficulties 	for	some 	leasing 	firms. 	This	was	compounded 	at	the	time	by	the	strong 	reluc -
tance 	of	enterprises 	to	invest, 	causing 	demand 	for	leasing-financed 	movable 	property 	to	fall	
considerably. 	Moreover, 	the	motor 	vehicle 	leasing 	sector 	sustained 	losses 	due	to	the	heavy 	decline 	
in	used 	car	prices 	caused 	by	the	crisis 	and	the	car	scrapping 	premium 	scheme, 	as	it	proved 	impos -
sible	to	sell	used 	leased 	vehicles 	at	the	prices 	with	which 	the	buyback 	had	been 	calculated 	in	the	
lease 	contracts.
There 	are	big	differences 	between 	independent 	leasing 	companies, 	which 	have 	to	obtain 	finan -
cing	from 	banks 	and	on	the	capital 	market, 	and	the	majority 	of	manufacturer 	or	bank-dependent 	
enterprises, 	which 	can	turn, 	above 	all,	to	their	parent 	company 	or	financial 	services 	network 	as	
their	funding 	source. 	This	means 	that, 	for	the	latter, 	sufficient 	finance 	is	available 	even 	when 	risk	
provisions 	are	small.DEUTSCHE

The importance of leasing in Germany
Over 	many 	years, 	leasing 	has	become 	a	major 	
financing 	instrument 	for	German 	enterprises. 	
According 	to	the	ifo	Institute, 	the	overall 	leas-
ing	ratio	–	ie	all	leasing-financed 	investments 	
to	overall 	fixed 	investment 	–	rose	from 	2%	in	
1970 	to	more 	than	18% 	in	2005.1	Its	market 	
share 	subsequently 	dropped 	somewhat, 	due	
mainly 	to	the	decline 	in	real	estate 	leasing, 	
which 	decoupled 	from 	commercial 	construc -
tion	demand. 	In	movable 	property 	leasing, 	
when 	investment 	in	machinery 	and	equip -
ment 	plummeted 	in	the	wake 	of	the	financial 	
and	economic 	crisis, 	the	lucrative 	business 	
years 	were 	followed 	by	a	drop 	in	new	busi-
ness. 	As	a	result, 	the	share 	of	leasing-financed 	
machinery 	and	equipment 	has	changed 	little	
in	recent 	years 	and	was	just	over	one-fifth 	in	
2010.
Just	how	important 	leasing 	is	for	the	corpo -
rate	sector 	is	demonstrated 	by	the	share 	of	
externally 	financed 	investment 	accounted 	for	
by	leasing, 	which 	according 	to	the	ifo	Insti-
tute’s 	estimates 	has	averaged 	almost 	50% 	in	
recent 	years.2	This	shows 	that	for	enterprises 	
which 	cannot 	or	cannot 	fully	realise 	their	in-
vestment 	projects 	with	internal 	financing, 	
leasing 	is	an	important 	alternative 	to	classic

Leasing as financing instrument  
for enterprises
When 	it	comes 	to	investment 	financing, 	en-
terprises 	can	make 	use	of	a	wide 	range 	of	
possibilities. 	Whereas 	internal 	financing 	refers 	
to	those 	forms 	of	capital 	procurement 	which 	
involve 	enterprises 	drawing 	on	their	own	fi-
nancial 	strength 	(for	example, 	retained 	
profits), 	funds 	raised 	via	external 	sources 	are	
subsumed 	under 	external 	financing. 	Depend -
ing	on	the	legal 	position 	of	the	entity 	provid -
ing	capital, 	external 	financing 	can	be	divided 	
into	equity 	and	debt	financing 	as	well	as	hy-
brid	financial 	instruments 	(mezzanine 	cap-
ital),	which 	are	a	mixed 	form 	in	terms 	of	liabil-
ity	and	rights 	to	participate 	in	business 	deci-
sions. 	Debt 	financing 	is	based 	on	third-party 	
claims 	in	respect 	of	which 	the	enterprise 	must 	pay	not	only	a	fixed 	interest 	rate	but	also	spe-
cified 	redemption 	amounts. 	This	category 	in-
cludes 	bank 	loans, 	bonds 	(debt 	securities), 	
supplier, 	customer 	and	intra-group 	loans 	as	
well	as	leasing.
To	be	more 	precise, 	leasing 	denotes 	a	special 	
form 	of	corporate 	finance 	whereby 	a	com-
pany 	(lessor) 	grants 	the	business 	partner 	(les-
see)	the	contractually 	areed 	right 	to	use	for	a	
specified 	period, 	in	return 	for	payment, 	
movable 	or	immovable 	capital 	goods 	in	the	
form 	of	lease 	or	rent	contracts. 	Instead 	of	a

mains 	the	beneficial 	owner, 	he	must 	carry 	the	
leased 	assets 	in	his	balance 	sheet 	in	accord -
ance 	with	section 	246 (1) 	of	the	German 	Com -
mercial 	Code 	(Han delsgesetzbuch ).	Commer -
cial	law	contains 	no	other 	provisions 	in	this	
respect. 	However, 	the	German 	tax	authorities 	
have, 	with	reference 	to	section 	39	(1)	and	(2)	
of	the	German 	Fiscal 	Code 	(Abgabenord -
nung ),	laid	down 	in	several 	decrees4	what 	is	
deemed 	to	be	a	leased 	asset 	that	must 	be	re-
ported 	in	the	lessor’s 	balance 	sheet 	(see	the	
annex 	on	pages 	45-47).
Advantages for the lessee
Leasing 	financing 	of	fixed 	investment 	gives 	
rise	to	at	least	temporary 	tax	advantages 	for	
the	lessee 	compared 	with	the	classic 	bank 	
loan	because 	the	complete 	leasing 	payments 	
(interest, 	cost	and	redemption 	component) 	
and,	above 	all,	the	special 	one-off 	payments 	
constitute 	tax-deductible 	operating 	expenses. 	
Given 	the	disproportionately 	high	cost	com-
ponent 	at	the	start	of	the	contract, 	these 	may	
be	considerably 	greater 	in	the	initial 	phase 	
than	the	interest 	and	redemption 	payments 	
for	a	bank 	loan	of	a	similar 	amount 	and	the	
depreciation 	values 	in	accordance 	with	the	
relevant 	tax	guidelines.5
A	further 	advantage 	for	the	lessee 	stems 	from 	
the	fact	that	operational 	investments 	in	build -
ings	or	machinery 	and	equipment 	can	be	real-
ised	without 	actually 	having 	the	necessary 	
funds 	at	the	time	of	investment. 	Apart 	from 	
special 	payments 	to	be	made 	at	the	start	of	
the	contract 	term, 	neither 	debt	nor	equity 	need 	be	used 	–	not	even 	in	the	form 	of	collat -
eral,	which 	ties	up	own	funds. 	Thus, 	leasing 	is	
a	type	of	financing 	that	conserves 	both 	liquid -
ity	and	equity. 	This	makes 	it	particularly 	inter-
esting 	for	newly 	established 	firms 	which 	are	
usually 	undercapitalised, 	have 	a	low	oper-
ational 	cash	flow	and	often 	have 	to	finance 	
high	initial 	investments. 	Leasing 	can	act	as	an	
investment 	motor 	inasmuch 	as	the	expansion 	
of	demand 	for	capital 	goods 	is	not	impeded 	
by	financing 	or	collateral 	problems 	affecting 	
firms 	that	wish	to	invest. 	In	addition, 	avoiding 	
financing 	restrictions 	on	innovative 	firms 	
benefits 	the	rapid 	rollout 	of	new	technologies 	
and	products, 	and	thus	accelerates 	the	tech-
nological 	diffusion 	process.
Another 	argument 	in	favour 	of	leasing 	is	that	
it	is	usually 	possible 	to	cover 	the	entire 	invest -
ment 	amount, 	whereas 	full	financing 	is	nor-
mally 	not	possible 	with	a	bank 	loan	(especially 	
in	the	real	estate 	sector). 	Given 	that, 	under

3	According 	to	the	regulations 	applicable 	in	Germany, 	
lease 	contracts 	differ 	from 	normal 	rent	agreements 	pur-
suant 	to	section 	535	ff	of	the	German 	Civil	Code 	(Bürger -
liches 	Gesetzbuch) 	in	that	the	lessor 	passes 	the	property 	
and	price 	risk	on	to	the	lessee; 	however, 	the	latter 	is	him-
self	able	to	choose 	the	object 	to	be	“rented”. 	Moreover, 	
lease 	contracts 	usually 	stipulate 	that	the	lessee 	must 	bear	
the	costs 	of	maintenance 	and	repairs, 	and	is	responsible 	
for	asserting 	warranty 	claims 	against 	the	manufacturer.
4	The	main 	decrees 	are	the	decree 	on	movable 	property 	
leasing 	(Mobilienleasingerlass) 	of	19	April 	1971, 	the	de-
cree	on	real	estate 	leasing 	(Immobilienleasingerlass) 	of	
21 March 	1972, 	the	decree 	on	partial 	amortisation 	(Teil-

cree	on	partial 	amortisation 	in	respect 	of	real	estate 	
	leasing 	(Teilamortisationserlass 	zum	Immobilienleasing) 	
of	23 December 	1991.
5	A	major 	factor 	in	this	connection 	is	that, 	in	early 	2010, 	
the	section 	of	the	business 	tax	reform 	of	2008 	which 	had	
provided 	for	a	pro	rata	addition 	of	the	financing 	compon -
ent	of	the	leasing 	payment 	to	the	assessment 	basis 	for	
taxable 	profits 	with	regard 	to	the	calculation 	of	business 	
tax	payable 	by	the	lessee 	(revocation 	of	the	banks’ 	privil -
ege	in	respect 	of	business 	tax	for	leasing 	companies) 	was	
revoked 	if	certain 	conditions 	were 	fulfilled.

goods 	are	not	reported 	as	assets 	in	the	les-
see’s	balance 	sheet, 	this	type	of	financing 	
– unlike 	the	other 	external 	funds 	–	is	not	re-
flected 	in	the	balance 	sheet. 	This	means 	that, 	
in	some 	cases, 	the	rating 	as	well	as	the	terms 	
and	conditions 	for	borrowing 	funds 	may	re-
main 	unaffected.6
Furthermore, 	leasing 	means 	that	the	asset 	
can	be	used 	productively 	while 	the	rent	pay-
ments 	are	being 	made, 	so	that	the	investment 	
asset 	finances 	itself 	(pay	as	you	earn	prin-
ciple). 	Additionally, 	the	instalment 	payments, 	
which 	are	fixed 	in	advance, 	provide 	a	reliable 	
basis 	for	planning 	and	costing 	for	operational 	
controlling 	and	standard 	cost	accounting 	pur-
poses. 	In	return 	for	these 	advantages 	and	the	
greater 	flexibility, 	the	lessee 	accepts 	that	this	
form 	of	financing 	is	relatively 	expensive 	be-
cause 	the	payment 	instalments 	are	higher 	
than	the	cost	for	the	user	if	the	asset 	were 	
purchased.
Advantage for the lessor
For	the	lessor, 	lease 	contracts 	–	as	compared 	
to	other 	investment 	forms 	–	offer 	the	advan -
tage	that	they	reduce 	credit 	risk.	Because 	the	
lessor 	retains 	ownership 	of	the	asset 	during 	
the	term 	of	the	contract 	and	transfers 	only	
the	right 	of	use,	he	largely 	avoids 	the	disad -
vantages 	of	the	asymmetric 	distribution 	of	in-
formation 	that	usually 	exists 	between 	creditor 	
and	debtor. 	In	the	event 	of	the	lessee’s 	inabil -
ity	or	unwillingness 	to	pay,	the	creditor 	has	
the	right 	to	call	for	the	asset 	to	be	handed 	
over. 	Thus, 	the	lessor 	has	a	preferential 	status 	
vis-à-vis 	the	debtor 	such	as	also	exists 	with	a	collateralised 	loan. 	This	privilege 	implies 	that	
transaction 	cost	such	as	that	incurred 	by	both 	
parties 	through 	the	provision 	of	collateral 	
under 	a	loan	contract 	do	not	occur.
A	further 	possibility 	offered 	by	leasing 	is	that	
all	property 	and	price 	risks	connected 	to	the	
investment 	asset 	can	be	passed 	on	to	the	les-
see.	It	is	assured, 	at	least	with	contracts 	that	
are	in	keeping 	with	the	relevant 	decrees,7	that	
the	lessor’s 	acquisition 	or	production 	cost, 	
funding 	and	administrative 	cost	as	well	as	the	
profit 	mark-up 	will,	as	a	rule,	be	reimbursed 	
in	full.	Where 	sales 	proceeds 	are	generated 	
that	are	less	than	the	object-specific 	residual 	
amortisation 	amount 	(and	therefore 	less	than	
the	difference 	between 	paid	leasing 	pay-
ments 	and	the	lessor’s 	total	cost), 	the	lessee 	
has	to	make 	up	the	difference.8	Where 	sales 	
proceeds 	are	higher, 	the	lessor 	is	entitled 	to	at	
least	part	of	them. 	Thus, 	he	does 	not	usually 	
bear	any	risk	of	a	loss	in	value 	but	participates 	
in	any	increase 	in	value. 	Unlike 	in	the	case	of	
rent	agreements, 	maintenance 	and	repairs 	
obligations 	are	likewise 	usually 	passed 	on	to	
the	lessee. 	Yet	another 	typical 	feature 	of	leas-
ing	is	that	the	right 	to	claim 	warranty 	against 	Pay as you earn 
principle
The usual credit 
risk is avoidedRisks passed on 
to the lessee
6	If	the	reforms 	proposed 	by	the	IASB	on	lease 	account -
ing	are	pushed 	through, 	these 	advantages 	will	largely 	be-
come 	obsolete 	for	IFRS	consolidated 	financial 	statements. 	
According 	to	the	Exposure 	Draft 	Leases 	of	17	August 	
2010, 	a	distinction 	is	no	longer 	to	be	made 	between 	op-
erating 	and	finance 	leases. 	Instead, 	the	lessee 	has	to	re-
port	an	asset 	in	his	balance 	sheet 	according 	to	the	right 	
of	use	approach. 	Its	value 	equates 	to	the	discounted 	leas-
ing	payments 	and	the	initial 	direct 	costs 	pertaining 	to	the	
transfer 	of	the	leased 	asset. 	
7	This	refers 	to	lease 	contracts 	which 	take	the	Federal 	
Ministry 	of	Finance’s 	four	decrees 	on	leasing 	into	ac-
count, 	and	as	a	result 	of	which 	the	leased 	assets 	are	re-
ported 	in	the	lessor’s 	balance 	sheet.
8	By	contrast, 	general 	price 	risks	on	the	secondary 	mar-
kets, 	for	example 	as	a	result 	of	an	economic 	slump, 	are	
borne 	by	the	lessor 	in	that	an	adjustment 	is	made 	to	the	
residual 	amortisation.DEUTSCHE

the	supplier, 	which 	would 	otherwise 	rest	with	
the	lessor 	as	the	buyer 	of	the	asset, 	is	trans -
ferred 	to	the	lessee. 	By	the	same 	token, 	the	
transfer 	to	the	lessee 	of	most 	of	the	cost	and	
risks	of	course 	implies 	that	leasing 	financing 	is	
a	relatively 	expensive 	alternative 	method 	of	fi-
nancing 	for	the	lessee, 	who	has	to	pay	the	
lessor 	for	the	gains 	in	terms 	of	flexibility 	and	
efficiency 	described 	above.
Producers 	of	and	dealers 	in	machinery 	and	
equipment 	often 	use	leasing 	offers 	to	boost 	
sales. 	One	important 	factor 	here	is	the	consid -
erable 	flexibility 	with	which 	lease 	contracts 	
can	be	tailored 	to	the	customer’s 	needs. 	Thus, 	
they	may	offer 	package 	solutions 	that	go	well	
beyond 	the	confines 	of	pure	financing. 	
Marketing-oriented 	concepts 	of	this	kind	
have 	established 	themselves, 	above 	all,	in	
motor 	vehicle 	leasing. 	The	services 	provided 	
range 	from 	simple 	service 	lease 	contracts 	
(covering 	maintenance 	and	repairs 	by	the	les-
sor)	to	full	service 	leasing 	(fleet 	management) 	
by	the	leasing 	companies; 	the	latter 	takes 	into	
account 	the	trend 	at	many 	industrial 	enter -
prises 	of	focusing 	on	core	business 	and	out-
sourcing 	services.
Diffusion of leasing
According 	to	the	Association 	of	German 	Leas-
ing	Companies 	(BDL), 	in	2010, 	road	vehicles 	
(ie	passenger 	cars	and	commercial 	vehicles) 	
accounted 	for	64% 	of	new	leasing 	business. 	
This	was	the	largest 	share 	in	movable 	prop -
erty	leasing 	and	included 	both 	corporate 	and	
private 	customers, 	which 	probably 	represent 	
around 	one-third 	of	the	entire 	vehicle 	leasing 	market. 	The	outstanding 	importance 	of	ve-
hicle	leasing 	also	in	the	commercial 	sector 	is	
partly 	due	to	the	fact	that	leasing 	companies 	
have 	in	recent 	years 	added 	product-related 	
services 	such	as	maintenance 	and	repairs 	to	
the	agreements 	they	offer, 	making 	them 	par-
ticularly 	attractive 	for	businesses. 	Other 	im-
portant 	categories 	in	the	leasing 	sector 	are,	as	
in	the	past, 	production 	machinery 	(notably 	
construction 	machinery, 	industrial 	trucks 	and	
forklifts) 	with	a	share 	of	around 	12%, 	office 	
and	IT	equipment 	(around 	9%), 	telecommu -
nication 	engineering 	and	signalling 	equip -
ment 	as	well	as	other 	equipment 	(just	over	
7%). 	Because 	of	tax	law	changes 	with	regard 	
to	the	framework 	conditions 	for	movable 	
property 	leasing 	funds 	(abolition 	of	tax	loss	
allocations 	in	the	case, 	for	example, 	of	aircraft 	
and	ship	leasing 	funds) 	and	the	aviation 	crisis, 	
the	importance 	of	leasing 	in	this	category 	has	
halved 	in	recent 	years 	and	currently 	amounts 	
to	a	mere 	2%.9
The	largest 	commercial 	customer 	group 	in	
movable 	property 	leasing 	comes 	from 	the	ser-
vices 	sector 	(33%) 	–	this	is	probably 	due	in	
part	to	the	prominent 	role	played 	by	vehicle 	
leasing 	in	this	customer-oriented 	sector 	–	fol-
lowed 	by	manufacturing 	(roughly 	22%), 	trade 	
and	commerce 	(11 %) 	and	transport 	and	tele-
communication 	engineering 	(9%). 	Leasing 	
customers 	in	construction 	account 	for	a	share 	
of	only	6%.	In	this	sector, 	the	orders 	situation 	
has	been 	affected 	by	considerable 	uncertainty 	
in	recent 	years, 	leading 	to	a	decline 	in	leasing 	
financing. 	Instead, 	construction 	machinery 	is	
obtained 	from 	hire-only 	companies 	on	a	Package

to	the	annual 	accounts 	in	the	leasing 	sector

assets, 	accounting 	for	just	over	80% 	of	the	
balance 	sheet 	total. 	Thus, 	this	item	contains 	
those 	leased 	assets 	which 	do	not	appear 	in	
the	balance 	sheets 	of	producing 	enterprises 	
and	service 	providers, 	yet	make 	a	very	signifi -
cant	contribution 	to	their	value 	added. 	With 	
tangible 	fixed 	assets 	of	around 	€56	billion, 	
the	enterprises 	chosen 	here	probably 	repre -
sent	at	least	one-quarter 	of	all	leasing-
financed 	machinery 	and	equipment 	in	Ger-
many. 	According 	to	the	ifo	Institute, 	the	stock 	
of	leasing-financed 	tangible 	fixed 	assets 	in	
2008 	totalled 	around 	€250 	billion. 	However, 	
it	must 	be	borne 	in	mind 	that	the	annual 	ac-
counts 	analysed 	here	capture 	only	the	re-
sidual 	book 	values 	in	the	ifo	Investment 	Sur-
vey,	which 	are	substantially 	lower 	than	re-
sidual 	book 	values.12	This	means 	that	cover -
age	would 	be	considerably 	greater 	with	a	
comparable 	valuation.
Three-quarters 	of	the	remaining 	(just	under) 	
20% 	of	the	assets 	comprise 	receivables, 	al-
though 	such	claims 	on	lessees 	(trade 	receiva -
bles)	only	account 	for	just	over	5%	of	the	bal-
ance 	sheet 	total. 	This	share 	is	less	than	half	of	
the	value 	reported 	by	non-financial 	corpor -
ations 	as	a	whole. 	Among 	other 	things, 	the	
low	share 	of	customer 	receivables 	is	a	result 	
of	leasing 	companies’ 	special 	refinancing 	
structures. 	This	is	because, 	in	addition 	to	
manufacturer 	and	bank-dependent 	leasing

bles	via	asset-backed	 securities	 (ie	by	originat -
ing	and	distributing	 different	 claims)	 and	fac-
toring	 (selling	 current	 receivables).	 Moreover,	
these	 companies	 use	the	sale	 of	future	 cus-
tomer	 receivables	 (forfaiting)	 to	refinance	
their	operations.
The	 liability	 side,	 too,	 clearly	 reflects	 how	
these	 two	groups	 of	leasing	 companies	 differ	
with	 regard	 to	financing.	 In	the	vast	 majority	
of	cases,	 firms	 in	which	 banks	 or	industrial	
enterprises	 hold	 a	major	 share	 receive	 intra-
group	 funding.	 Thus,	 intra-group	 liabilities	
are,	 on	the	whole,	 leasing	 companies’	 most	
important	 funding	 source,	 accounting	 for	
one-third	 of	the	balance	 sheet	 total.	 This	 no	
doubt	 partly	 explains	 why	 leasing	 companies	
have	 an	especially	 low	capital	 ratio	 compared	
with	 other	 business	 sectors	 of	just	above	 3%.	
Manufacturer	 and	 bank-dependent	 leasing	
firms	 can	 afford	 such	 low	 risk	provisioning	
only	 because	 they	 have,	 within	 the	group	 to	
which	 they	 belong,	 refinancing	 partners	 that	
provide	 them	 with	 the	funds	 they	 need.13	By	
contrast,	 for	independent	 leasing	 firms,	 which	
are	mainly	 small	 and	 medium-sized	 enter -
prises,	 bank	 liabilities	 are	an	important	 finan -
cing	 source,	 totalling	 just	over	 €12	 billion	 or	
around	 18%	 of	the	aggregate	 balance	 sheet	
total.
Insolvency	 statistics	 show	 that	 –	except	 where	
bank	 or	manufacturer-dependent	 companies	
are	concerned	 –	this	low	capital	 ratio	 entails	
risk	potential.	 For	instance,	 the	number	 of	in-
solvency	 proceedings	 in	the	renting	 of	ma-
chinery	 and	equipment	 sector,	 which	 also	 in-
cludes	 leasing	 firms,	 rose	 again	 in	2010	 (2%),	
whereas	 manufacturing	 saw	a	decline	 of	16%	during	 the	same	 period.	 In	the	last	two	years,	
which	 have	 been	 shaped	 by	the	financial	 and	
economic	 crisis,	 a	large	 number	 of	SME	 leas-
ing	companies	 have	 exited	 the	market	 ac-
cording,	 also,	 to	the	ifo	Institute.14	Not	only	
were	 they	 beset	 by	crisis-induced	 financing	
problems	 and	lost	revenue	 from	 leasing	 oper-
ations:	 they	 also	 suffered	 heavy	 declines	 in	
sales	 and	 prices	 in	the	secondary	 market	 for	
used	 and	 returned	 leased	 assets	 (such	 as	
motor	 cars),	 which	 had	not	been	 anticipated	
when	the	contracts	were	drawn	up.
By	contrast,	 larger	 leasing	 companies	 also	
have	 the	option	 of	procuring	 the	necessary	 fi-
nance	 on	the	capital	 market.	 In	2008,	 despite	
financial	 market	 tensions,	 they	 issued	 bonds	
in	relatively	 large	 amounts.	 In	the	case	 of	the	
leasing	 companies	 under	 consideration	 here,	
bonds	 accounted	 for	around	 €3.5	 billion	 or	
no	less	than	5%	of	all	funds	raised.
Also	 typical	 of	leasing	 is	the	large	 volume	 of	
deferred	 income,	 which	 constitutes	 a	sizeable	
liability	 item	 and	 accounts	 for	just	over	 €20	
billion	 or	slightly	 more	 than	 29%	 of	the	bal-
ance	 sheet	 total.	 This	 involves,	 on	the	one	
hand,	 counterpart	 entries	 against	 inflows	Liability side

13	The	BDL	 points	 out	that	 the	capital	 ratios	 of	leasing	
firms	 are	systematically	 distorted	 down.	 Given	 the	diver -
gence	 between	 lease	 contracts’	 durations	 and	tax	depre -
ciation	 times,	 and	because	 the	sales	 revenue	 is	taken	 into	
consideration	 upon	 termination	 of	the	contract,	 asyn-
chronous	 developments	 of	expenditure	 and	income	 arise	
in	the	leasing	 companies’	 single-entity	 accounts	 that	 are	
drafted	 in	accordance	 with	 the	 German	 Commercial	
Code	 (Handelsgesetzbuch )	due	 to	the	perio disation	 re-
quirement	 and	the	completed-contract	 method. 	See	Bun-
desverband	 Deutscher	 Leasing-Unternehmen	 (2003),

in	the	case	 of	leasing	 companies,	 but	leads	 to	corres -
ponding	 distortions	 in	the	balance	 sheet	 and	 income	
statement	of	all	enterprises	with	long-term	production.

stemming 	from 	the	forfaiting 	of	future 	leas-
ing	receivables. 	Because, 	in	this	connection, 	
income 	is	received 	which 	will	not	arise	until	
the	future, 	deferred 	income 	has	to	be	stated 	
on	the	liability 	side	in	the	amount 	of	the	
present 	value 	of	the	sold	receivable, 	and	will	
then	be	gradually 	written 	back 	over	the	term 	
of	the	lease 	contract. 	Moreover, 	special 	pay-
ments 	made 	by	the	lessees 	(in	particular, 	ad-
vance 	rent	payments 	as	well	as	implementa -
tion	costs) 	have 	to	be	allocated 	on	an	accrual 	
basis 	of	accounting 	and	included 	in	deferred 	
income. 	For	the	lessee, 	this	constitutes 	ex-
penditure 	which 	is	tax-deductible 	in	its	entir-
ety	provided 	the	contracting 	parties 	can	
present 	economic 	reasons 	for	these 	one-off 	
payments. 	This	is	why, 	in	practice, 	there 	is	
such	great 	interest 	in	agreeing 	high	one-off 	
payments 	and	helps 	explain 	the	unusually 	
high	amount 	of	deferred 	income 	in	the	ag-
gregate 	balance 	sheets 	of	the	leasing 	com-
panies 	considered 	here.
Leasing 	companies’ 	income 	statements 	like-
wise	contain 	a	number 	of	special 	features. 	For	
instance, 	the	result 	of	leasing 	firms 	is	shaped, 	
above 	all,	by	the	cost	of	materials 	(€15	billion 	
or	48% 	of	sales), 	which 	represents 	the	cost	of	
acquiring 	the	leased 	assets. 	Especially 	typical, 	
however, 	is	the	substantial 	volume 	of	depreci -
ation 	on	tangible 	fixed 	assets 	and	relatively 	
high	financing 	cost	with	comparatively 	low	
personnel 	cost. 	It	has	to	be	borne 	in	mind 	
here	that	depreciation, 	which 	amounts 	to	
around 	€13	billion 	(representing 	over	40% 	of	
sales) 	and	is	therefore 	almost 	equal 	to	the	
cost	of	materials, 	often 	exceeds 	the	agreed 	
leasing 	payments, 	particularly 	in	the	initial 	
phase 	of	contracts. 	Since 	declining-balance 	depreciation 	was	abolished 	under 	the	Annual 	
Tax	Act	2008 	(Jahressteuergesetz 2008 ),	this	
is	primarily 	due	to	the	tax	deductibility 	of	ex-
cessive 	first	rents 	as	well	as	of	installation 	or	
implementation 	cost, 	which 	according 	to	
regulations 	issued 	by	the	German 	tax	author -
ities	must 	be	reported 	as	assets 	and	depreci -
ated	within 	five	years. 	In	some 	cases, 	this	
leads 	to	losses 	which 	are	only	recouped 	over	
the	entire 	term 	of	the	lease 	contract. 	It	is	
probably 	also	because 	new	business 	volume 	
was	still	high	in	2008 	that	the	leasing 	com-
panies 	examined 	here	posted 	only	a	very	low	
annual 	profit 	totalling 	€70	million 	after 	taxes 	
–	a	negligible 	amount 	compared 	with	sales. 	
Besides 	the	strong 	need 	for	depreciation, 	
interest 	expenditure 	also	had	an	impact, 	
amounting 	to	over	€2	billion 	as	a	result 	of	the	
volume 	of	bank 	liabilities 	and	equivalent 	to	
around 	7%	of	sales.
Conclusion
In	recent 	decades, 	leasing 	has	become 	firmly 	
established 	in	Germany 	as	a	corporate 	finan -
cing	instrument. 	Leasing 	is	a	business 	model 	
that	is	geared, 	not	least, 	to	the	funding 	needs 	
of	particularly 	growth-oriented 	and	frequently 	
high-risk 	enterprises. 	It	opens 	up	greater 	
scope 	for	obtaining 	finance 	for	investments 	
than	would 	be	possible 	with	classic 	financing 	
instruments 	on	their	own, 	thereby 	contribut -
ing	to	the	dynamics 	of	business 	cycles 	and	
economic 	activity 	and	facilitating 	technology-

stalment 	payments, 	this	form 	of	financing 	
provides 	a	considerable 	number 	of	German 	
enterprises 	with	an	attractive 	alternative 	or	
supplement 	to	the	classic 	bank 	loan	because 	
it	involves 	lower 	transaction 	cost	and	at	least	
temporary 	tax	advantages 	as	well	as	the	fact	
that	lease 	contracts 	may	be	drawn 	up	flexibly.
The	type	of	financing 	that	leasing 	companies 	
choose 	depends 	primarily 	on	whether 	they	
belong 	to	a	bank 	or	a	financial 	services 	net-
work, 	or	to	a	manufacturer 	of	machinery 	and	equipment 	as	group-dependent 	companies, 	
or	have 	direct 	links	with	the	money 	and	cap-
ital	market. 	Because 	of	their	often 	low	capital 	
base, 	those 	that	operate 	as	independent 	en-
terprises 	are	exposed 	to	financing 	risks	which 	
can	jeopardise 	their	very	existence, 	especially 	
in	times 	of	crisis. 	By	contrast, 	dependent 	en-
terprises 	can	afford 	low	provisions 	against 	risk	
because 	they	are	supplied 	with	adequate 	fi-
nance 	from 	within 	the	group 	or	financial 	ser-
vices 	network, 	regardless 	of	their	particular 	
risk	profile.
Annex
Tax rules on the financial reporting of leased 
assets on the lessor’s balance sheet
The	allocation 	of	a	leased 	asset 	for	tax	purposes 	
pursuant 	to	section 	39	(2)	number 	1	of	the	Fiscal 	
Code 	is	based 	on	the	question 	of	who	is	the	eco-
nomic 	owner. 	With 	rental 	leasing, 	this	question 	is	
relatively 	easy	to	answer. 	Because 	the	lessee 	can	
terminate 	the	rent	agreement 	at	any	time, 	the	
main 	economic 	risks	inherent 	in	the	leased 	asset 	
remain 	with	the	lessor. 	Moreover, 	the	user	cannot 	
preclude 	the	civil-law 	owner 	from 	exercising 	any	
control 	over	the	economic 	good. 	As	a	result, 	in	this	
case	the	economic 	good 	is	attributable 	to	the	les-
sor.15
The	situation 	is	much 	more 	complex 	in	the	case	of	
financial 	leasing, 	however. 	Here, 	the	individual 	
contractual 	arrangements 	have 	to	be	examined, 	
for	which 	the	leasing 	decrees 	provide 	the	relevant 	
decision 	criteria. 	To	assess 	the	tax	treatment 	and	
for	tax	allocation 	purposes, 	a	differentiation 	is	
made, 	first,	between 	partial 	and	full	amortisation 	contracts. 	With 	the	latter 	(full	payout 	contracts), 	it	
is	agreed 	at	the	outset 	that	the	lessee’s 	leasing 	pay-
ments 	will	cover 	the	complete 	cost	of	acquisition 	
or	production, 	the	financing 	and	administrative 	
cost	as	well	as	the	lessor’s 	profit 	mark-up. 	With 	
partial 	amortisation 	contracts 	(non-payout 	con-
tracts), 	under 	which 	the	leased 	asset 	has	a	residual 	
value 	at	the	end	of	the	leasing 	period 	and	the	leas-
ing	payments 	made 	during 	the	term 	cover 	only	a	
portion 	of	the	lessor’s 	income 	and	expenses 	com-
ponents, 	the	lessee 	–	who	is	contractually 	obliged 	
to	make 	good 	any	difference 	between 	the	residual 	
amortisation 	and	the	purchase 	price 	–	bears 	the	
risk	of	a	loss	in	value.
15	The	summarised 	description 	refers 	only	to	contracts 	
which, 	according 	to	the	decrees 	issued 	by	the	German 	
tax	authorities, 	require 	the	lessee 	to	report 	the	leased 	
assets 	on	his	balance 	sheet, 	as	well	as	to	the	leasing 	fi-
nancing 	of	machinery 	and	equipment. 	The	rules 	apply 	
analogously 	to	real	estate 	lease 	contracts; 	however, 	given 	
the	disproportionately 	larger 	number 	of	agreement 	op-
tions, 	it	is	now	virtually 	impossible 	to	standardise 	such	
contracts.DEUTSCHE

As	a	basic 	prerequisite 	for	tax	deductibility 	–	and	
this	applies 	in	like	measure 	to	partial 	and	to	full	
amortisation 	contracts 	–	it	first	has	to	be	assured 	
that	the	basic 	lease 	term 	is	between 	40% 	and	
90% 	of	the	average 	useful 	life	according 	to	the	
relevant 	tables 	for	tax	write-downs. 	If	the	lower 	
bound 	is	undershot, 	legislators 	assume 	abuse 	of	
law,	because 	a	lessee 	acting 	as	an	economic 	agent 	
would 	not	be	prepared 	to	assume 	the	lessor’s 	total	
costs 	and	profit 	mark-ups 	in	such	a	short 	basic 	
lease 	term. 	Such 	contract 	arrangements 	would 	be	
advantageous 	to	the	lessee 	only	if	he	could 	subse -
quently 	purchase 	the	leased 	asset 	at	particularly 	
favourable 	conditions; 	this	would 	suggest 	a	hidden 	
hire-purchase 	agreement 	and	would 	therefore 	
have 	to	be	reported 	on	the	lessee’s 	balance 	sheet. 	
If	the	upper 	bound 	is	overshot, 	it	must 	be	assumed 	
from 	the	financial 	authorities’ 	viewpoint 	that	the	
lessor 	is	de facto 	excluded 	from 	the	predominant 	part	of	the	useful 	life	of	the	asset 	and	that	ultim -
ately 	a	good 	nearing 	the	end	of	its	useful 	life	will	
be	returned 	to	him.	Within 	the	meaning 	of	section 	
39	(2)	of	the	Fiscal 	Code, 	therefore, 	only	the	lessee 	
can	be	considered 	the	economic 	owner; 	thus, 	the	
lessee 	has	to	state 	the	leased 	asset 	in	his	balance 	
sheet.
Where 	full	amortisation 	contracts 	are	concerned, 	
provided 	the	parties 	observe 	the	basic 	limits 	for	the	
period 	of	use,	the	leased 	asset 	must 	always 	be	at-
tributed 	to	the	lessor 	unless 	the	contract 	addition -
ally	contains 	an	option 	to	purchase 	or	an	option 	to	
extend 	the	lease 	term. 	In	such	cases, 	the	question 	
of	whether 	the	lessor 	is	precluded 	on	a	permanent 	
basis 	from 	having 	any	control 	over	the	leased 	as-
set,	giving 	rise	to	a	leased 	asset 	which 	for	tax	pur-
poses 	must 	be	reported 	on	the	lessee’s 	balance 	
sheet, 	depends 	on	the	probability 	that	the	lessee 	Forms of movable property leasing

will	 actually	 exercise	 the	option.	 If,	in	cases	 in	
which	 the	lease	 term	 is	extended,	 the	subsequent	
leasing	 payments	 are	lower	 than	 the	depreciation	
that	 is	to	be	charged	 during	 that	 period	 according	
to	the	tax	rules,	 or	if	the	agreed	 purchase	 price	 is	
below	 the	calculated	 residual	 book	 value	 for	tax	
purposes,	 it	must	 be	assumed	 that	 the	lessee	 will	
exercise	 the	option	 and	is	therefore	 to	be	deemed	
the	economic	 owner.	 In	the	case	 of	special	 leasing,	
economic	 ownership	 always	 rests	 with	 the	lessee,	
as	the	lessor	 is	precluded	 from	 future	 use	of	the	
leased	asset	if	only	because	of	its	specificity.
With	 partial	 amortisation	 contracts,	 the	answer	 to	
the	attribution	 question	 takes	 its	bearings	 primarily	
from	 the	criterion	 of	whether,	 at	the	end	 of	the	
period	 of	use,	 the	lessor	 can	take	 advantage	 of	the	
opportunity	 of	an	increase	 in	value,	 or	whether	 –	in	
the	case	 of	extraordinary	 impairment	 –	the	lessor	
always	 has	to	bear	 the	risk	of	loss.	 If,	according	 to	
the	 overall	 picture	 of	the	 contractual	 arrange -
ments,	 both	 the	substance	 of	and	the	income	 from	
the	leased	 asset	 remain	 in	the	lessor’s	 ownership	
sphere,	 the	economic	 good	 in	question	 must	 be	
stated	 in	the	lessor’s	 balance	 sheet	 for	tax	pur-
poses.	 Where	 a	contract	 provides	 for	the	surplus	
proceeds	 to	be	divided,	 the	law	assumes	 that	 the	
lessor	 still	participates	 in	the	increase	 in	value	 to	an	economically	 sufficient	 extent	 if	he	receives	 at	least	
25%	 of	the	part	 of	the	sales	 proceeds	 that	 exceeds	
the	residual	amortisation.
When	 a	contract	 provides	 for	the	lessor’s	 right	 to	
sell	the	asset	 at	the	end	 of	the	basic	 lease	 term,	
only	 the	lessor	 has	the	possibility	 of	benefitting	
from	 an	increase	 in	value	 since	 the	lessee	 cannot	
force	 the	purchase	 of	the	asset.	 Of	course,	 the	les-
sor	is	under	 no	obligation	 to	exercise	 the	right	 of	
sale.	 In	this	case,	 too,	 therefore,	 the	asset	 is	re-
ported	on	the	lessor’s	balance	sheet.
Under	 partial	 amortisation	 contracts	 with	 a	right	 of	
termination	 and	an	offset	 of	the	sales	 proceeds,	 a	
maximum	 of	90%	 of	the	selling	 price	 may	 be	off-
set	against	 the	lessee’s	 final	 payment	 covering	 the	
residual	 amortisation.	 Surpluses	 accrue	 to	the	les-
sor.	However,	 if	the	selling	 price	 does	 not	cover	 the	
lessor’s	 total	 costs	 and	profit	 mark-up,	 the	lessee	 is	
required	 to	make	 a	final	 payment	 equal	 to	the	dif-
ference.	 When	 a	contract	 contains	 elements	 such	
as	these,	 any	increase	 in	value	 that	occurred	 during	
the	basic	 lease	 term	 is	passed	 in	full	to	the	lessor.	
Because	 the	lessor	 is	not	only	 the	legal	 but	also	the	
economic	 owner,	 the	leased	 asset	 must	 be	re-
ported	in	the	lessor’s	balance	sheet.DEUTSCHE

Reliability and revision profile of  
selected German economic indicators
Economic 	analyses 	and	forecasts 	are	often 	based 	on	provisional 	data, 	which 	are	then	revised 	at	a	
later	date	when 	new	information 	becomes 	available. 	The	deviations 	between 	the	data	initially 	
published 	and	the	final	data	enable 	conclusions 	to	be	drawn 	about 	the	reliability 	of	the	economic 	
indicators 	as	well	as	the	underlying 	analyses. 	Evaluations 	based 	on	the	Bundesbank’s 	real-time 	
database 	show 	that	there 	are	considerable 	differences 	in	the	revision 	profile 	of	German 	economic 	
indicators. 	Such 	differences 	stem 	from 	the	particular 	collection, 	preparation 	and	estimation 	
methods 	used 	as	well	as	from 	other 	characteristics 	of	the	time	series 	in	question. 	For	instance, 	
corrections 	to	the	industrial 	production 	index 	are	minimal 	while 	the	relatively 	high	level	of	revision 	
in	the	construction 	sector 	is	due	to	specific 	weather 	conditions. 	Retail 	sales 	are	characterised 	by	
a	large 	proportion 	of	estimates 	in	the	data	initially 	published 	as	well	as	by	the	methods 	used.
Revisions 	are	often 	the	greatest 	in	the	early 	stages. 	During 	the	financial 	and	economic 	crisis, 	re-
visions 	were 	not	extraordinarily 	large. 	The	cyclical 	turning 	points 	had	already 	been 	shown 	cor-
rectly 	in	the	first	publications.
As	a	rule,	the	results 	of	the	revision 	analysis 	undertaken 	show 	that	economic 	observers 	should 	
exercise 	caution 	when 	interpreting 	data	at	the	current 	end.	There 	is	often 	a	trade-off 	between 	
the	timeliness 	and	the	reliability 	of	indicators. 	Official 	statisticians, 	together 	with	reporting 	par-
ties,	are	thus	faced 	with	the	challenge 	of	trying 	to	issue 	as	complete 	a	data	set	as	possible 	at	the	
current 	end	to	keep 	revisions 	to	a	minimum 	from 	the	outset. 	Official 	statisticians 	should 	therefore 	
stand 	firm	and	not	give	in	to	the	urgent 	call	to	make 	data	available 	at	an	ever	earlier 	date	if	this	
were 	to	have 	too	great 	an	adverse 	impact 	on	the	reliability 	and	accuracy 	of	the	information. 	The	
empirical 	information 	value 	of	the	statistics 	is	the	key	quality 	criterion 	and	should 	not	be	jeopard -
ised.	If	in	doubt, 	the	reliability 	of	the	indicators 	is	more 	important 	than	the	speed 	at	which 	they	
are	provided.DEUTSCHE

Importance of revision analysis
Economic 	analyses 	and	forecasts 	are	often 	
based 	on	data	that	are	provisional 	and	incom -
plete. 	At	the	current 	end	of	a	time	series, 	it	is	
rare	for	all	relevant 	information 	to	be	avail-
able, 	meaning 	that	statistics 	are	often 	based 	
on	estimates 	and	assumptions. 	In	the	revision 	
process, 	estimates 	are	substituted 	with	fig-
ures	from 	reports 	submitted 	at	a	later	date	
and	this	gradually 	improves 	the	quality 	of	the	
statistics. 	In	general 	terms, 	revisions 	can	be	
seen	as	the	price 	that	has	to	be	paid	for	very	
up-to-date 	statistics. 	Just	how	high	this	price 	
can	be,	is	shown 	in	the	following 	analysis.
Real-time 	data	show 	the	data	currently 	avail-
able	at	certain 	points 	in	time. 	For	some 	time	
now, 	they	have 	been 	used 	not	just	in	eco-
nomic 	analyses 	but	also	increasingly 	in	macro -
economic 	forecasts.1	They 	can	also	be	used 	to	
reconstruct 	the	information 	underlying 	earlier 	
decisions 	and	to	model 	decision-making 	pro-
cesses.2	Furthermore, 	the	most 	recent 	infor-
mation 	at	the	end	of	a	time	series 	can	be	used 	
as	a	basis 	for	projections. 	Perceptible 	revisions 	
to	these 	data	can	trigger 	a	new	forecast. 	
Moreover, 	an	evaluation 	of	the	forecast 	shows 	
that	the	crucial 	factor 	is	the	period 	of	time	in	
which 	the	revisions 	are	made. 	For	instance, 	
the	extent 	of	the	forecast 	error 	in	the	previous 	
year’s 	gross 	domestic 	product 	depends 	to	a	
large 	degree 	on	whether 	the	quarterly 	values 	
at	the	beginning 	of	the	forecast 	horizon 	are	
revised 	or	those 	for	a	later	quarter.3	To	ensure 	
that	forecasts 	are	as	reliable 	as	possible, 	ex-
pected 	revisions 	therefore 	need 	to	be	taken 	
into	consideration. 	Statistics 	producers 	them -
selves 	ultimately 	also	use	the	analysis 	of	real-time	data. 	Such 	an	analysis 	points 	to	potential 	
systematic 	errors 	in	provisional 	figures 	that	
are	to	be	corrected 	as	well	as	to	particularly 	
problematic 	weaknesses 	in	the	process 	of	col-
lecting 	and	estimating 	statistics.
Reasons for revision
The	reasons 	for	revising 	statistics 	are	mani -
fold.	Original 	values 	are	chiefly 	revised 	as	a	
result 	of	data-driven 	or	methodology-related 	
changes.4	The	former 	largely 	arise	from 	the	
substitution 	of	estimates 	with	figures 	ob-
tained 	from 	reports 	submitted 	at	a	later	date. 	
In	isolated 	cases, 	statistics 	may	also	be	
changed 	as	a	result 	of	the	incorporation 	of	
data	corrections 	that	went 	unnoticed 	in	the	
initial 	plausibility 	checks 	of	the	results 	and	
were 	only	later	found 	to	be	incorrect 	by	the	
reporting 	parties 	or	the	statistical 	institutions. 	
Furthermore, 	monthly 	data	is	also	adjusted, 	
for	instance, 	to	take	account 	of	more 	com-
prehensive 	quarterly 	or	annual 	information 	
based 	on	a	larger 	group 	of	reporting 	parties.
Methodology-related 	changes 	are	also	pos-
sible. 	Refinements 	to	estimation 	methods 	en-
able	statistical 	results 	to	better 	approximate 	
the	situation 	to	be	measured. 	In	the	case	of	
indices, 	there 	are	often 	new	patterns 	as	a	re-Need for

bers	when 	the	base	year	is	switched. 	The	
European 	harmonisation 	of	recording 	
methods 	also	often 	results 	in	revisions 	to	past	
data.5
Occasionally 	the	definition 	of	an	economic 	in-
dicator 	itself 	may	change, 	for	example 	if	new	
goods, 	services 	and	production 	processes 	are	
to	be	included 	in	updated 	product 	classifica -
tions 	or	classifications 	of	economic 	activities. 	
It	is	debatable 	whether 	changes 	in	data	as	a	
result 	of	such	circumstances 	are	to	be	classed 	
as	“normal” 	revisions 	or	as	a	new	time	series, 	
which 	is	to	be	treated 	in	a	fundamentally 	dif-
ferent 	way	and	is	not	intended 	for	compari -
son	with	previous 	data	sets.	This	decision 	de-
pends 	on	how	the	statistical 	findings 	are	to	be	
used. 	An	economic 	analyst 	who	wants 	to	
check 	his	clarification 	model 	using 	historical 	
information 	may	treat 	larger 	conceptual 	
changes 	in	the	statistics 	in	the	same 	way	as	
any	other 	data	revision. 	By	contrast, 	a	statisti -
cian	who	wants 	to	use	empirical 	revision 	ana-
lyses	to	determine 	additional 	improvements 	
for	the	process 	of	producing 	statistics 	may	
closely 	examine 	any	differences 	between 	the	
definitions 	and	concepts 	in	earlier 	and	in	cur-
rent	data.
Revisions 	to	original 	values 	can	be	seen	in	
seasonally 	adjusted 	data. 	In	addition, 	the	pro-
cess	of	seasonal 	adjustment 	itself 	entails 	revis-
ing	seasonally 	adjusted 	figures. 	The	proced -
ures	to	filter	data	used 	in	seasonal 	adjustment 	
are	sensitive 	to	incorporating 	new	informa -
tion	at	the	current 	end.6	Estimating 	calendar 	
effects 	also	causes 	seasonally 	and	calendar-adjusted 	figures 	to	change 	at	a	later	point 	in	
time, 	especially 	in	the	case	of	short 	time	series 	
due	to	the	low	number 	of	observation 	values. 	
Thus 	in	order 	to	assess 	the	reliability 	of	the	
seasonally 	adjusted 	indicators 	used 	for	the	
current 	economic 	observation, 	it	is	not	suffi-
cient 	to	observe 	merely 	revisions 	caused 	by	
new	original 	values 	but	the	effect 	of	these 	re-
visions 	on	seasonally 	adjusted 	data	must 	also	
be	taken 	into	account. 	On	the	other 	hand, 	
neglected 	revisions 	do	not	necessarily 	demon -
strate 	the	quality 	of	statistics. 	Hence 	the	easi-
est	way	to	minimise 	revisions 	is	to	not	con-
duct	any	at	all.	Statistical 	findings 	would 	thus	
remain 	provisional 	and	new	information 	
would 	not	be	taken 	into	consideration.

bour 	market 	reports 	as	well	as	price 	statistics. 	
Depending 	on	availability, 	some 	figures 	are	
contained 	in	both 	original 	and	seasonally 	ad-
justed 	and/or 	calendar-adjusted 	form. 	From 	
these 	figures, 	the	total	revision 	for	a	reporting 	
period 	can	be	calculated 	as	the	difference 	be-
tween 	the	final	value 	and	the	initial, 	provi -
sional 	figure. 	Unless 	otherwise 	marked, 	the	
data	up	to	the	end	of	2009, 	which 	were 	avail-
able	when 	the	revision 	analysis 	was	con-
ducted 	(March 	2011), 	are	taken 	as	being 	final. 	
For	the	most 	part, 	these 	data	are	based 	on	
information 	that	is	available 	in	full.8
In	order 	to	determine 	the	reliability 	of	the	se-
lected 	indicators, 	five	different 	summary 	stat-
istics 	are	calculated. 	For	this	purpose, 	rates 	of	
change 	are	used 	that	are	central 	to	economic 	
observation. 	The	arithmetic 	mean 	of	the	revi-
sions 	can	be	used 	to	determine 	potential 	sys-
tematic 	distortions 	of	the	provisional 	data. 	
The	mean 	absolute 	revision 	(ie	in	terms 	of	ab-
solute 	value) 	provides 	additional 	information. 	
When 	calculating 	this	figure, 	the	positive 	and	
negative 	corrections 	do	not	offset 	each 	other, 	
thus	giving 	rise	to	the	impression 	of	a	“nor-
mal” 	amount 	of	changes 	to	the	data. 	A	fur-
ther	measure 	is	the	standard 	deviation. 	This	
demonstrates 	how	far	away 	the	revisions 	
spread 	from 	the	mean. 	One	answer 	to	the	
question 	of	how	reliably 	the	initial 	(provi -
sional) 	publication 	maps 	the	development 	
trend 	at	the	current 	end	is	indicated 	by	the	
relative 	frequency 	of	cases 	in	which 	the	data	
from 	the	initial 	estimate 	shows 	the	same 	sign	
as	the	final	results. 	As	an	indicator 	of	quality, 	
the	ratio	between 	the	average 	absolute 	rates 	of	change 	of	the	final	results 	(signal) 	and	the	
mean 	absolute 	revisions 	(noise) 	is	examined.
In	the	following 	analysis, 	these 	summary 	stat-
istics 	are	applied 	to	real-time 	data	of	selected 	
economic 	indicators 	that	are	of	particular 	in-
terest 	for	the	calculation 	and	projection 	of	
gross 	domestic 	product 	(GDP).
The	industrial 	production 	index 	calculated 	
each 	month 	by	the	Federal 	Statistical 	Office 	
has	a	prominent 	role	in	economic 	analysis. 	
Since 	January 	2007, 	the	monthly 	values 	have 	
been 	based 	on	information 	supplied 	by	en-
tities 	with	at	least	50	employees; 	prior 	to	this	
date, 	the	reports 	were 	based 	on	a	smaller 	
group 	of	reporting 	parties.9	Figures 	for	late	re-
ports 	were 	estimated 	in	order 	for	the	provi -
sional 	monthly 	data	initially 	published 	to	be	
as	precise 	as	possible. 	Revisions 	to	the	data	
initially 	published 	for	a	month 	thus	result, 	
first,	from 	substituting 	estimates 	with	late	re-
ports. 	Second, 	after 	the	close 	of	each 	report -
ing	quarter 	corrections 	arise	due	to	the	in-
corporation 	of	reports 	from 	smaller 	entities. 	
Third, 	as	part	of	the	annual 	correction 	process 	
each 	spring, 	prior-year 	data	are	corrected 	by	
entering 	reports 	submitted 	at	a	later	date. 	
Hence, 	a	complete 	revision 	cycle 	for	primary 	
statistical 	data	takes, 	on	average, 	almost 	one	Summary

the	extent 	of	revision 	for	seasonally 	adjusted 	results 	gen-
erally 	decreases 	over	time, 	due	to	technical 	reasons 	the

and	a	half	years. 	The	underlying 	aggregates 	
can	still	change, 	even 	after 	this	cycle 	has	been 	
completed. 	Additional 	revisions 	are	made 	at	
roughly 	5-year 	intervals 	as	a	result 	of	changes 	
to	the	methodology, 	the	base	year	as	well	as	
to	the	classification 	of	economic 	activities 	and	
goods.
A	look	at	the	above-mentioned 	summary 	
statistics 	shows 	the	following 	for	industrial 	
output: 	with	an	average 	revision 	of	
0.1	percentage 	points 	over	the	entire 	period 	
examined, 	the	month-on-month 	seasonally 	
adjusted 	rate	of	change 	shows 	virtually 	no	
bias.	The	mean 	absolute 	revision 	amounts 	
to	0.9	percentage 	points. 	The	distribution 	of	
the	corrections 	is	virtually 	symmetrical. 	In	over	
four-fifths 	of	the	cases, 	the	provisional 	month-
on-month 	change 	has	the	same 	sign	as	the	
final	results.
However, 	such	long-term 	averages 	do	not	re-
flect	the	typical 	revision 	profile 	in	every 	period. 	
Taking 	industrial 	output 	as	a	case	in	point, 	it	
can	be	illustrated 	to	what 	extent 	the	revision 	
structure 	can	be	dependent 	on	which 	con-
ventions, 	measurement 	concepts 	and	collec -
tion	procedures 	are	used. 	For	instance, 	up	to	
the	end	of	2004, 	missing 	results 	from 	local	
units 	were 	substituted 	with	the	values 	re-
ported 	for	the	previous 	month.10	This	meant 	
larger 	revisions 	if	special 	effects, 	such	as	the	
timing 	of	school 	holidays, 	had	a	major 	impact 	
on	the	previous 	month’s 	value. 	Since 	2005, 	
these 	transitional 	gaps 	in	information 	have 	
been 	filled 	by	estimated 	figures 	based 	on	
changes 	on	the	previous 	month 	derived 	from 	
reports 	submitted 	on	time. 	This	has	demon -
strably 	improved 	the	provisional 	data	on	in-dustrial 	output 	published. 	In	the	period 	from 	
2005 	onwards, 	both 	mean 	absolute 	revision 	
and	dispersion 	are	lower 	than	in	the	previous 	
period. 	The	reliability 	of	the	initially 	published 	
tendency 	of	the	findings 	has	also	increased. 	
The	information 	value 	of	data	for	the	summer 	
months 	August 	and	September, 	which 	are	af-
fected 	by	school 	holidays 	and	plant 	shut-
downs, 	increased 	in	particular. 	Prior	to	the	
change 	in	the	estimation 	method, 	the	mean 	
absolute 	revision 	for	these 	months 	stood 	at	
1.3	percentage 	points 	and	afterwards 	it	re-
turned 	to	the	average 	for	all	months.
Revisions 	to	construction 	output 	–	which 	
comprises 	both 	general 	building 	and	civil	en-
gineering 	–	are	less	evenly 	distributed 	than	in	
the	industrial 	sector. 	Coupled 	with	pro-
nounced 	irregular 	effects, 	in	terms 	of	value, 	
the	level	of	revision 	to	seasonally 	and	calendar-
adjusted 	figures 	observed 	is	comparatively 	
high. 	In	the	case	of	construction, 	these 	effects 	
are	extraordinary 	weather 	conditions.
This	indicator, 	too,	shows 	a	decline 	in	the	
amount 	of	revision 	in	response 	to	improve -
ments 	in	the	method 	for	calculating 	and	pub-
lishing 	provisional 	data. 	Since 	2005, 	when 	the	
method 	was	first	changed 	for	the	period 	from 	
March 	to	October, 	construction 	output 	has	
been 	adjusted 	in	advance 	to	anticipate 	the	
expected 	correction 	in	the	total	annual 	survey 	
on	the	construction 	industry. 	This	put	an	end	
to	the	overestimation 	of	the	month-on-month 	
provisional 	rate	of	change, 	which 	had	been 	
observed 	until	that	time. 	The	extent 	of	abso -Extent of

more	 employees.	 This	does	 not	include	 single

distantly	 connected	 to	this	source	 of	energy.	
The	data	 initially	 published	 for	this	indicator	
show	 a	comparatively	 high	 proportion	 of	esti-
mated	values.
In	the	case	 of	energy	 output,	 the	initial,	 provi -
sional,	 seasonally	 adjusted	 rates	 of	change	
are,	 on	average,	 half	 a	percentage	 point	
below	 the	final	 figures.	 Moreover,	 the	mean	
absolute	 revision	 amounts	 to	2.3	percentage	
points.	 The	revisions	 are	not	distributed	 sym-
metrically.	 The	uncertainty	 of	the	initial	 esti-
mate	 can	also	 be	seen	 in	the	fact	 that	 just	
over	 one-third	 of	all	cases	 does	 not	have	 the	
same	 sign	 as	the	final	 results.	 All	in	all,	initial	
data	 show	 more	 statistical	 coincidences	 than

should	 not	be	interpreted	 in	economic	 terms.

Since 	October 	1996, 	the	seasonally 	adjusted 	
month-on-month 	rates 	of	change 	initially 	
published 	have 	been, 	on	average, 	0.3	percent -
age	points 	below 	the	final	value.11	The	value 	
of	initial 	figures 	was	corrected 	by	an	average 	
of	1.4	percentage 	points. 	The	revisions 	are	
not	distributed 	symmetrically 	in	this	case	ei-
ther.	The	two	largest 	distribution 	classes 	are	
those 	with	revisions 	of	between 	½	and	
1½	percentage 	points. 	According 	to	the	sig-
nal-to-noise 	ratio, 	statistical 	noise 	exceeds 	the	
news 	value. 	To	improve 	the	quality 	of	these 	
data, 	the	estimation 	method 	was	changed, 	
most 	recently 	in	2003.12	As	no	particular 	con-
sideration 	was	given 	to	features 	affecting 	the	
number 	of	working 	days, 	such	as	the	date	on	
which 	Easter 	falls,	which 	is	particularly 	im-
portant 	for	retail 	trade, 	or	the	number 	of	sell-
ing	days, 	this	has	resulted 	in	higher 	revisions 	
to	date, 	predominantly 	in	March 	and	April. 	
For	instance, 	the	seasonally 	and	calendar-
adjusted 	month-on-month 	change 	in	March 	
2010 	which, 	at	-1.8% 	in	the	initial 	publica -tion,	indicated 	an	unusually 	sharp 	slump 	for	
retail, 	was	revised 	to	a	positive 	rate	of	change 	
of	1.0% 	(data 	as	of	June	2011) 	chiefly 	due	to	
the	substitution 	of	estimates 	with	late	re-
ports.
A	further 	particularity 	of	retail 	sales 	can	be	
seen	in	the	period 	from 	June	2010 	onwards. 	
This	corresponds 	with	the	time	when 	a	new	
automated 	sample 	rotation 	was	introduced.13	
Since 	then, 	revision 	has	increased 	and,	at	
below 	50%, 	the	proportion 	of	cases 	where 	
the	provisional 	data	in	the	initial 	estimate 	has	
the	same 	sign	as	the	revised 	results 	is	particu -
larly	low.	Given 	this	situation, 	the	information 	
value 	of	the	initially 	published 	data	on	retail 	
sales 	for	private 	consumption 	is	currently 	par-
ticularly 	low.
For	external 	trade, 	information 	about 	cross-
border 	goods 	trade 	outside 	of	Germany 	is	col-
lected 	by	the	customs 	authorities; 	for	EU	in-
tra-trade, 	this	information 	is	reported 	directly 	
by	companies. 	To	ease	the	reporting 	burden 	
on	companies, 	minimum 	thresholds 	have 	
been 	set	for	which 	no	statistical 	reports 	are	
necessary. 	Up	until	the	end	of	2010, 	there 	
was	a	two-stage 	revision 	procedure. 	The	first

Deutsche BundesbankQuality requirements for statistics from a national and European perspective
When observing the economy, it is only possible to 
answer questions concerning the dynamics and direc-
tion of economic activity in its different facets with the 
aid of short-term statistics. In this regard, it is of key 
importance to identify cyclical turning points at an early 
juncture. Most economists share this fundamental view. 
Nevertheless, there is a fair chance that the judgement 
made when weighing up the timeliness and reliability of 
statistics will differ depending on whether the analysis 
is based on European or national data. This also impacts 
on the matter of the preferred initial publication date 
for statistics.
Considerations relating to sample theory and time series 
analysis are of key relevance to this argument. The 
former considerations presuppose that, in the case of a 
small random sample taken from a large population, the 
reliability of the sample mean is mainly predicated on its 
absolute size, and less so on the proportion of observed 
cases in the population.1 Hence, it is safe to assume that 
smaller samples taken at the national level, which deliver 
unreliable ﬁ  gures with high sampling errors, can be 
aggregated at the European level to form a large sample 
that allows sufﬁ  ciently sound conclusions to be drawn 
about the aggregate. Following this idea, the European 
ﬁ gures could, with the same degree of reliability, be 
published at an earlier date than national data, provided 
a sufﬁ  ciently large number of cases have been observed 
in Europe but not at the national level.
A similar line of argument is pursued in terms of time 
series analysis.  In this case, use is made of the season-
ally adjusted ﬁ  gures that represent a key area of interest 
with regard to current economic developments. These 
are based on models and comprise the components of 
the (long-term) growth trend, cyclical ﬂ  uctuations and 
irregular movements (including special factors that can 
be explained in economic terms, such as large orders or 
strikes, but also random factors and statistical measure-
ment errors). Where such randomly occurring irregular 
ﬂ uctuations recorded at the national level have no strong 
positive correlation with one another, they tend to be 
cancelled out when forming larger aggregates. Conse-quently, more highly aggregated time series generally 
follow a calmer and smoother path than their individual 
components. Accordingly, as long as they are equally 
timely, European seasonally adjusted data are, ceteris 
paribus , more reliable for the purpose of observing cur-
rent economic developments than the corresponding 
ﬁ gures for individual member countries. In other words, 
seasonally adjusted data for Europe could be published 
ahead of those pertaining to individual countries while 
providing the same degree of reliability.
These arguments are shown to be correct if the revisions 
to the seasonally adjusted rates of change for German 
GDP vis-à-vis the previous quarter are compared with 
those of the 12 countries of the former European Mon-
etary Union2 (EMU 12) for the period from the ﬁ  rst quar-
ter of 2003 to the fourth quarter of 2009.3 What becomes 
clear is that the extent of mean absolute corrections at 
EMU-12 level on both the ﬁ  rst and the later calculation 
dates is consistently below or equivalent to that for Ger-
many. At 0.2 percentage points, the standard deviation

EMU 12 is likewise somewhat below the result measured 
for Germany (0.3 percentage points).
Moreover, none of the investigated cases indicated a 
reverse pattern in developments from one quarter to the 
next when switching from the provisional ﬁ  gures to the 
ﬁ nal data. Last but not least, in Germany and the EMU 
12 alike, the ratio between the average absolute rate of 
change and the mean absolute revision stands at a value 
of around ﬁ  ve. These combined factors demonstrate a 
high quality of data, especially as ﬂ  ash estimates do not, 
on average, show any distortions.
In the recent past, the high degree of data reliability has 
prompted a Europe-wide debate as to whether the ﬂ  ash 
estimate should be published in advance of its current 
release date, namely after a period of just 30 days as 
opposed to the present 42-day interval. In this context, 
announcing the initial European results on their own is 
considered inadequate as, in the interest of transpar-
ency, there is a wish to identify the manner and force 
with which each country has contributed to shifts in the 
European aggregate. At this point, however, the line of reasoning becomes circular, for these same theoretical 
considerations support an accelerated announcement of 
purely European statistics, with national data published at a later date. If national and European data are to be 
announced simultaneously then it is necessary to wait 
for qualitatively sound data for the last national ﬁ  gure 
before going ahead with publication. This is especially 
pertinent given that national data are not used by 
national policy-makers alone. Among other things, they 
also serve as a starting point for international discussions 
about the varying dynamics and heterogeneity of differ-ent country groups and nations within areas operating 
a monetary union. The van Rompuy initiative and the 
scoreboard approach at the European level recently stressed this very perspective.
4 National statistics relat-
ing to the excessive deﬁ  cit procedure are also of great 
importance for economic policy.
What is more, the notion of bringing forward the release 
date for   GDP statistics, to just 30 days after the end of the reporting period (GDP in t+30) instead of the cur-rent 42-day wait, could push statistics to their limits. For 
instance, at such an early calculation date, no reliable 
data are yet available from the individual statistical ﬁ  elds 
for the third month of any given quarter. Hence, most 
of this information would have to be estimated. There 
would then be a danger that special effects or cyclical turning points, whose future occurrence is particularly 
hard to pinpoint, would not be included in the calcula-
tion of GDP in the last month of the quarter. Had the GDP calculation date been set 30 days after the end of 
the reporting period, the crisis-induced sharp decline in 
industrial output in September 2008 could not have been 
taken into account when initially determining the ﬁ  gure 
for the third quarter of 2008. Such a scenario would have 
harboured the risk of sending a wrong signal at ﬁ  rst, 
namely of “no signiﬁ  cant events” having occurred thus 
far. An assertion of this kind would have necessitated painful adjustment of the statistics at a later date.
Two additional demands that play a role in the debate 
surrounding timeliness and reliability are consistency and 
coherence. Up-to-date and reliable ﬁ  gures calculated on 
the basis of all available information should not only be 
consistent within individual statistical ﬁ  elds but also, and 
more importantly, the statistics should create a coher-
ent, interlinked and consistent overall system. Arguably, 
it is at best possible in theory to meet all these demands 
at the same time. This would necessitate the quasi-con-tinuous incorporation of all new reports into the primary 
statistics and the ongoing adjustment of the aggregated 
accounts up to and including the European system of 
national accounts. Such activity, however, would gener-
ate high statistical production costs and entail substan-tial adjustments on the part of the user, for example in 
terms of the timeliness of their analyses and forecasts. It 
is, therefore, impossible to totally avoid inconsistencies between ﬁ  gures taken from available reports and the 
latest published statistical results or between these data 
and those contained in the national accounts, and due 
account should be taken of such inconsistencies when 
making analyses and evaluations.

ers	that	are	economically 	active. 	They 	are	
available 	as	early 	as	30	days	after 	the	end	of	
the	month 	under 	review 	and	therefore 	much 	
earlier 	than	the	results 	of	many 	specialist 	stat-
istics 	or	the	initial 	estimates 	for	employees 	
subject 	to	social 	security 	contributions. 	Due	
to	this	tight 	timeframe, 	employment 	data	
that	are	initially 	published 	are	based 	largely 	
on	estimates.14
Over 	a	longer 	period, 	the	month-on-month 	
rates 	of	change 	in	employment 	initially 	re-
ported 	show, 	on	average, 	no	positive 	or	nega -
tive	bias.	At	only	0.1	percentage 	points, 	the	
mean 	absolute 	revision 	is	the	lowest 	of	all	
economic 	indicators 	examined 	in	this	article. 	
This	shows 	that	the	generally 	expected 	devel -
opment 	of	these 	stock 	statistics 	can	be	suc-
cessfully 	anticipated 	by	means 	of	the	estima -
tion	algorithms 	used. 	However, 	in	the	area	of	
cyclical 	turning 	points, 	the	need 	for	revision 	is	
much 	higher. 	Precisely 	in	those 	times 	that	are	
of	particular 	interest 	for	economic 	analysis, 	
initial 	figures 	released 	for	this	indicator 	are	to	
be	interpreted 	with	great 	caution. 	This	is	
clearly 	evident 	when 	considering 	data	from 	
the	summer 	and	autumn 	of	2005. 	Provisional 	
data	at	this	time	initially 	indicated 	a	continu -
ation 	of	the	trend 	hitherto, 	which 	had	since 	
been 	reversed, 	towards 	a	decline 	in	employ -
ment. 	It	was	not	until	months 	later	when 	the	
primary 	statistics 	for	employment 	were 	com-
plete 	that	it	could 	be	seen	that	the	decline 	in	
employment 	had	come 	to	an	end	and	em-
ployment 	was	actually 	on	the	rise.
The	indicators 	discussed 	so	far	are	required 	to	
extrapolate 	the	data	in	the	national 	accounts 	
up	to	the	current 	end	of	the	time	series. 	They 	are	ultimately 	reflected 	in	the	aggregate 	
measure 	of	an	economy’s 	performance, 	
namely 	the	GDP . 	Since 	the	revision 	of	the	na-
tional 	accounts 	in	2005, 	the	figures 	have 	
been 	calculated 	in	previous-year 	prices 	on	the	
basis 	of	a	Laspeyres 	chain 	index.15	Due	to	the	
high	number 	of	provisional 	and	revised 	fig-
ures	contained 	in	the	calculation 	of	the	GDP , 	
the	original 	values 	are	considered 	provisional 	
–	not	just	within 	the	calendar 	year. 	Once 	a	
year	in	August, 	the	annual 	statistics 	and	cor-
rections 	to	monthly 	indicators 	stretching 	back 	
for	some 	time	are	incorporated 	into	the	calcu -
lation.
In	the	underlying 	observation 	period 	(1995 	
Q2	to	2009 	Q4),	the	seasonally 	adjusted 	real	
GDP	does 	not	show 	any	systematic 	over	or	
underestimation 	of	the	initial, 	provisional 	rate	
of	change 	compared 	to	the	previous 	period. 	
Similarly, 	the	mean 	absolute 	revision 	amounts 	
to	only	two-tenths 	of	a	percentage 	point. 	Just	
under 	two-thirds 	of	the	revisions 	are	in	the	
correction 	range 	of	±0.2 	percentage 	points. 	
This	is	reflected 	in	the	reliability 	of	the	sign	for	
the	rate	of	change 	in	the	provisional 	data. 	In	
the	period 	under 	review, 	only	two	(out	of	57)	
cases 	had	a	different 	sign	to	the	final	results.

To examine the possible impact of the finan-
cial and economic crisis on the revision pro-file, revisions for the months from September 2008 to April 2009 were closely analysed. They show that the initial indications of a sharp slump in industrial output became es-tablished rather quickly and did not require notable revision. The provisional figures over-estimated the decline by 0.4 percentage points on average. However, this is put into perspective when considering the extent of the downturn. For instance, at 4.8, the signal-to-noise ratio in the period from September 2008 to April 2009 is much higher than in the overall period under review (1.4). Most of the other indicators present a similar picture. Dur-ing the financial and economic crisis, the eco-nomic indicators were able to show the cyc-lical turning points very accurately.
Convergence of revisions
The way in which provisional figures converge 
to final results shows that the path to the final data and, with it, the tailing off of revisions is different for each indicator. For instance, in the case of industrial output, revisions to the month-on-month rate of change as a result of incorporating late reports declines notably just one month after publication of the provi-sional results. The second publication then provides a fairly reliable picture of the trend in development at the current end. After that, the mean absolute revision declines at only a slow pace. Even after one year, it has not van-ished entirely. On the one hand, the annual correction of the original values has not yet been included in full. On the other hand, Revision low

changes 	in	seasonal 	and	working-day 	factors 	
ease	over	time	but	never 	completely 	disap -
pear	as	additional 	values 	contain 	new	infor-
mation 	for	estimating 	the	seasonal 	compon -
ent.	Aggregate 	rates 	of	change 	for	two	or	
three 	consecutive 	months 	vis-à-vis 	their	cor-
responding 	previous 	period 	are	less	prone 	to	
revision 	than	the	month-on-month 	rates 	of	
change. 	Looking 	at	a	moving 	three-month 	
average, 	the	mean 	absolute 	revision 	is	below 	
half	a	percentage 	point, 	even 	for	the	initial 	
publication.
At	the	start, 	revisions 	to	construction 	output 	
amount 	to	just	under 	2	percentage 	points. 	It	
takes 	roughly 	eight 	months 	for	this	to	be	
halved. 	When 	using 	three-month 	averages, 	
the	amount 	of	revisions 	falls	from 	1.2	percent -
age	points 	in	the	data	initially 	published 	
to	0.9	percentage 	points 	after 	six	months. 	At	
in	excess 	of	2	percentage 	points 	on	average, 	
revisions 	to	the	data	initially 	published 	for	en-
ergy	are	higher 	still.	For	these 	data, 	one	year	
is	needed 	before 	the	mean 	absolute 	revision 	
falls	below 	1	percentage 	point.
From 	an	initial 	level	of	1.4	percentage 	points, 	
revisions 	to	retail 	sales 	decrease 	to	less	than	
1	percentage 	point 	after 	six	months. 	There 	is	
little	change 	in	the	mean 	absolute 	revision 	to	
the	rates 	of	change 	vis-à-vis 	the	previous 	
period 	on	the	basis 	of	three-month 	averages. 	
It	amounts 	to	0.9	percentage 	points 	for	the	
first	publication 	date	and	0.6	percentage 	
points 	one	year	later. 	Thus, 	depending 	on	the	
observation 	method, 	it	takes 	about 	six	
months, 	and	in	some 	cases 	longer, 	before 	the	
amount 	of	revision 	declines 	notably.Conclusion
Overall, 	there 	are	considerable 	differences 	in	
the	revision 	profile 	of	the	economic 	indicators 	
examined. 	In	addition 	to	GDP , 	a	range 	of	indi-
cators 	(for	example, 	for	industrial 	output 	and	
the	number 	of	employees) 	generally 	proves 	to	
be	sufficiently 	reliable 	with	regard 	to	the	data	
initially 	published. 	However, 	a	greater 	amount 	
of	caution 	should 	be	exercised 	when 	examin -
ing	others 	(for	instance, 	energy 	output 	and	
retail 	sales) 	and	it	is	advisable 	to	wait	for	a	
more 	complete 	data	basis 	before 	drawing 	
conclusions 	about 	economic 	developments.
However, 	merely 	providing 	information 	about 	
the	uncertainty 	of	current 	statistical 	results 	
from 	revision 	analyses 	–	as	demonstrated 	in	
this	article 	–	is	not	sufficient 	for	practical 	use	
in	economic 	policy. 	Instead, 	it	is	the	responsi -
bility 	of	statisticians, 	together 	with	reporting 	
parties, 	to	ensure 	that	current 	data	are	always

Deutsche Bundesbank Spring Conference 2011 – 
fiscal and monetary policy challenges  
in the short and long run
This	year’s 	Spring 	Conference, 	which 	was	jointly 	organised 	by	the	Bundesbank 	and	the	Banque 	
de	France, 	focused 	on	the	consequences 	of	the	financial 	and	economic 	crisis. 	One	particular 	
point 	of	discussion 	was	the	impact 	on	public 	finances 	and	the	implications 	for	the	macropruden -
tial	regulation 	of	the	financial 	system. 	During 	the	crisis, 	central 	banks 	and	governments 	in	many 	
industrial 	countries 	were 	forced 	to	take	unconventional 	monetary 	and	fiscal 	policy 	measures. 	
Central 	banks 	cut	their	interest 	rates 	to	zero	(or	close 	to	zero) 	and	provided 	the	financial 	sector 	
with	large 	amounts 	of	liquidity. 	In	the	process, 	however, 	they	took	on	considerable 	risks	in	their	
balance 	sheets. 	At	the	same 	time, 	governments 	assumed 	risks	from 	the	banking 	sector 	and	is-
sued 	blanket 	guarantees. 	Along 	with	direct 	measures 	taken 	to	stabilise 	the	economy, 	this	led	to	
a	sharp 	rise	in	government 	debt	in	many 	economies. 	The	financial 	and	economic 	crisis 	therefore 	
resulted 	in	a	situation 	in	which 	confidence 	in	the	soundness 	of	public 	finances 	was	called 	into	
question 	in	a	number 	of	euro-area 	peripheral 	countries.
Against 	this	backdrop, 	the	Spring 	Conference 	on	the	topic 	of	“fiscal 	and	monetary 	policy 	chal-
lenges 	in	the	short 	and	long	run” 	(as	well	as	the	preceding 	workshop, 	which 	was	likewise 	dedi-
cated 	to	current 	macroeconomic 	challenges) 	heard 	academic 	contributions 	focusing 	on	these 	
aspects 	of	the	crisis.1	The	issues 	discussed 	included 	the	factors 	that	contributed 	to	the	severity 	of	
the	financial 	crisis 	and	what 	precautions 	seem 	appropriate 	for	avoiding 	similar 	escalations 	in	the	
future; 	the	causes 	of	the	crisis 	and	its	impact 	on	public 	finances 	–	focusing 	in	particular 	on	the	
special 	conditions 	of	European 	monetary 	union; 	and	how	monetary 	and	fiscal 	policy 	should 	be	
framed 	in	the	future. 	Furthermore, 	the	conference 	highlighted 	the	importance 	of	effective 	macro-
prudential 	rules 	for	the	financial 	system 	and	demonstrated 	that	there 	is	no	way	of	getting 	around 	
the	need 	for	a	fiscal 	consolidation 	strategy.

Background information
The	crisis 	was	triggered 	by	problems 	at	finan -
cial	institutions 	that	had	invested 	either 	dir-
ectly	or	indirectly 	in	the	US	housing 	market. 	
Shrinking 	confidence 	among 	market 	partici -
pants 	caused 	risks	premiums 	to	rise,	financial 	
market 	prices 	to	decline 	and	some 	securities 	
markets 	to	freeze 	up	totally. 	This	called 	for	
large-scale, 	internationally 	coordinated 	sup-
port	measures, 	by	both 	central 	banks 	and	
governments, 	in	order 	to	prevent 	the	collapse 	
of	banks 	and	the	financial 	system. 	The	subse -
quent 	downturn 	in	economic 	activity 	was	al-
leviated 	by	means 	of	rescue 	measures 	and	
spending 	programmes. 	The	downturn 	had	a	
particularly 	hard	impact 	on	countries 	which 	
had	previously 	experienced 	an	upswing 	
strongly 	driven 	by	private 	or	public 	borrow -
ing,	such	as	Spain, 	Greece, 	Portugal 	and	Ire-
land.
For	central 	banks, 	these 	measures 	meant 	ex-
tending 	their	balance 	sheets, 	with	the	associ -
ated	incurrence 	of	credit, 	interest 	rate	and	
exchange 	rate	risks. 	For	governments, 	the	fis-
cal	measures, 	including 	the	granting 	of	guar-
antees, 	meant 	a	massive 	expansion 	of	their	
existing 	public 	debt	or	future 	expenditure 	
commitments.
Crises in the financial system
An	important 	prerequisite 	for	avoiding 	a	re-
currence 	of	the	financial 	and	economic 	crisis 	
that	we	have 	experienced 	over	the	past	few	
years 	is	to	obtain 	a	good 	understanding 	of	its	
root	causes. 	Many 	studies 	have 	described 	the	role	of	misguided 	incentives 	for	individual 	
decision-makers, 	the	lack	of	transparency 	
concerning 	financial 	assets 	and	uncertainty 	
about 	the	precise 	form 	that	financial 	sector 	
oversight 	should 	take.2	But	other 	issues 	such	
as	the	most 	effective 	way	to	regulate 	the	fi-
nancial 	system 	and	how	to	deal	with	the	re-
percussions 	on	the	real	sector 	are	still	under 	
discussion. 	Three 	papers 	presented 	at	the	
conference 	drew 	policy-relevant 	conclusions 	
on	these 	issues 	on	the	basis 	of	models 	which 	
each 	address 	important 	aspects 	of	the	finan -
cial	system 	that	played 	a	role	in	the	crisis.
Bianchi 	and	Mendoza3	show 	that	households 	
and	enterprises 	tend	to	overborrow 	in	normal 	
times, 	as	they	do	not	take	sufficient 	account 	
of	the	fact	that	the	value 	of	the	assets 	which 	
they	need 	to	post	as	collateral 	in	order 	to	ob-
tain	credit 	could 	be	significantly 	eroded 	in	a	
crisis 	as	a	result 	of	panic 	selling. 	The	amount 	
of	this	loss	in	value 	depends 	on	the	aggregate 	
level	of	borrowing, 	over	which 	the	individual 	
borrower 	has	no	control. 	In	such	circum -
stances, 	macroprudential 	regulation 	can	in-
fluence 	lending 	so	as	to	mitigate 	both 	the	
severity 	and	frequency 	of	crises 	and	reduce 	
the	economy’s 	vulnerability 	to	exogenous 	
shocks. 	An	important 	feature 	of	this	study 	is	
its	successful 	use	of	a	macroeconomic 	equilib -
rium	model 	(DSGE) 	to	explain 	normal 	eco-
nomic 	cycles 	and	rare,	yet	severe 	crises, 	thus	
facilitating 	a	basic 	understanding 	of	the	crisis 	Propensity to 
excessive risk-
taking can be 
reduced 
through macro-
prudential 
 regulation

itself	 and	 hence	 of	potential	 remedies.	 The	
macroprudential	 taxes	 proposed	 by	the	au-
thors	 could	 therefore	 be	one	 of	the	new	 in-
struments	 for	safeguarding	 financial	 stability	
which	 were	 called	 for	by	Christian	 Noyer,	 the	
governor	 of	the	Banque	 de	France,	 in	his	
speech	at	the	Spring	Conference.
While	 Bianchi	 and	Mendoza	 analyse	 how	 the	
likelihood	 and	the	severity	 of	crises	 can	be	re-
duced	 through	 prudent	 regulation,	 Cooper	
and	Kempf,4	as	well	 as	Cukierman	 and	Izhak -
ian,5	consider	 the	impact	 that	 private	 players’	
ex ante 	expectations	 of	subsequent	 govern -
ment	 rescue	 measures	 could	 have	 on	the	de-
velopment	 of	financial	 crises.	 On	the	 one	
hand,	 the	anticipation	 of	such	 bailouts	 can	
lead	 to	excessive	 lending	 and	thus	 make	 the	
financial	 system	 more	 vulnerable	 to	financial	
crises.	 On	the	other	 hand,	 expectations	 as	to	
whether	 and,	 if	so,	how	 rescue	 measures	 will	
actually	 be	implemented	 during	 a	crisis	 may	
trigger	 panic	 reactions,	 even	 though	 this	 is	
exact	 ly	what	 such	 measures	 are	supposed	 to	
prevent.	 One	 example	 of	this	are	deposit	 in-
surance	 schemes,	 which	 in	many	 countries	
guarantee	 deposits	 up	to	a	certain	 amount,	
but	which,	in	extreme	circumstances,	may	re -
quire	 additional	 government	 funding.	 In	the	
United	 Kingdom,	 for	example,	 the	collapse	 of	
Northern	 Rock	 during	 the	crisis	 led	to	a	run	
on	the	banks	 because	 it	was	unclear	 whether	
and,	 if	so,	in	what	 way	the	government	 would	
intervene.6
The	work	 of	Cooper	 and	Kempf,	 building	 on	
this	 reasoning,	 points	 out	 that	 those	 who	
benefit	 from	 rescue	 measures	 are	generally	
not	the	ones	 who	 pay	for	them.	 Thus,	 some	large	 investors	 in	the	money	 market,	 such	 as	
investment	 banks	 and	 their	 shareholders,	
benefit	 from	 a	government	 rescue	 of	banks,	
whereas	 taxpayers,	 who	 generally	 do	not	par-
ticipate	 in	these	 markets,	 are	left	to	carry	 the	
costs.	 Against	 this	backdrop,	 it	is	conceivable	
that	 political	 resistance	 to	ex ante 	promises	 of	
state	 aid	may	 make	 it	impossible	 to	honour	
them	 and	consequently	 undermine	 the	stabil -
ity	of	the	financial	system.
In	fact,	 a	reassessment	 of	the	likelihood	 of	
government	 rescue	 measures	 can	have	 dra-
matic	 effects,	 which	 might	 explain	 the	strong	
reaction	 of	the	financial	 markets	 to	the	col-
lapse	 of	Lehman	 Brothers.	 The	paper	 by	Cuki-
erman	 and	Izhakian	 shows	 that	 banks’	 lever-
age	 increases	 with	 the	likelihood	 that	 they	
will	be	rescued	 by	the	state	 in	an	emergency.	
This	 not	only	 supports	 the	argument	 that	 cri-
ses	are	more	 likely	 to	occur	 per se ,	as	put	for-
ward	 by	Bianchi	 and	Mendoza,	 but	also	 sug-
gests	 that	 even	 a	slight	 reassessment	 of	the	
likelihood	 of	a	bailout	 can	itself	 trigger	 a	cri-
sis.
Niepmann	 and	 Schmidt-Eisenlohr7	analyse	
the	incentives	 to	conduct	 bank	 rescues	 using	
a	macroeconomic	 model	 with	 an	internation -
ally	integrated	 interbank	 market,	 which	 al-

find	that, 	within 	the	scope 	of	their	model, 	
bank 	rescues 	by	individual 	countries 	are	not	
carried 	out	on	a	sufficient 	scale, 	as	they	do	
not	take	account 	of	the	(positive) 	externalities 	
on	other 	countries. 	At	the	same 	time, 	a	“free 	
rider” 	problem 	arises 	if	the	measures 	taken 	in	
a	neighbouring 	country 	reduce 	the	incentive 	
to	rescue 	one’s 	own	banking 	system. 	These 	
are	major 	arguments 	in	favour 	of	inter 	national 	
coordination 	in	the	case	of	closely 	integrated 	
banking 	systems. 	However, 	they	are	counter -
weighed 	by	other 	problems, 	such	as	moral 	
hazard.
Government debt and the sovereign 
debt crisis
In	many 	countries, 	government 	intervention 	
to	stabilise 	the	financial 	system 	and	the	real	
economy, 	in	combination 	with	the	economic 	
contraction, 	has	led	to	a	sharp 	rise	in	sover -
eign	debt. 	In	several 	cases, 	this	has	shaken 	
confidence 	in	the	long-term 	sustainability 	of	
public 	finances 	and,	owing 	to	the	rise	in	sov-
ereign 	risk	spreads, 	has	made 	it	increasingly 	
difficult 	to	finance 	general 	government 	def-
icits.	In	an	individual 	country, 	this	could 	po-
tentially 	result 	in	a	sudden 	halt	to	capital 	in-
flows 	and	a	slide	in	the	currency’s 	value, 	thus	
triggering 	a	collapse 	of	both 	government 	fi-
nances 	and	the	domestic 	banking 	system. 	In	a	
monetary 	union, 	in	which 	banks 	post	govern -
ment 	securities 	as	collateral 	to	obtain 	liquidity 	
from 	the	central 	bank, 	further 	complications 	
and	contagion 	effects 	may	arise	from 	inter-
linkages 	in	the	interbank 	market.Two	papers 	focused 	explicitly 	on	the	problems 	
of	sovereign 	debt	crises 	in	a	monetary 	union. 	
Roch 	and	Uhling8	highlight 	the	role	of	self-
fulfilling 	sovereign 	debt	crises, 	which 	can	be	
triggered 	by	the	mere 	expectation 	of	a	de-
fault. 	They 	also	explain 	how	countries 	tend	to	
become 	over-indebted 	as	a	result 	of	the	short-
termism 	of	government 	policy. 	The	model 	
demonstrates 	a	complex 	interaction 	between 	
these 	elements. 	At	the	end	of	the	day,	how-
ever, 	there 	are	only	ever	two	options: 	either 	
the	country 	is	“rescued” 	by	other 	countries 	or	
by	international 	institutions 	(IMF), 	ie	their	
debts 	are	assumed 	by	others, 	or	the	country 	
defaults. 	Granting 	short-term 	loans 	to	coun -
tries	with	payment 	problems 	is	not	a	solution, 	
as,	ultimately, 	it	only	reduces 	their	incentive 	
to	consolidate 	public 	finances 	and	can	actu-
ally	increase 	the	cost	of	rescue 	operations.
Auerbach9	questioned 	the	effectiveness 	of	in-
stitutional 	regulations, 	such	as	the	Stability 	
and	Growth 	Pact	in	the	European 	economic 	
and	monetary 	union. 	His	argument 	is	based 	
on	the	fact	that	the	US	government 	did	not	
impose 	any	central 	fiscal 	framework 	on	the	
federal 	states 	to	control 	public 	finances. 	In-
stead, 	the	US	states, 	owing 	partly 	to	the	cen-
tral	government’s 	strict 	compliance 	with	its	
“no-bailout” 	principle, 	imposed 	similar 	rules 	
on	themselves. 	By	contrast, 	support 	measures 	
adopted 	by	other 	states 	during 	a	crisis 	out	of	
self-interest 	can	lead	to	excessive 	deficits,

parency	 and	the	disciplining	 role	of	the	mar-
kets.	 He	argues	 that	 fiscal	 discipline	 could	 be	
achieved	 via	independent	 institutions	 which	
draw	 up	and	 publicise	 long-term	 public	 fi-
nance	 projections.	 In	his	discussion,	 von	
Hagen	 favoured	 an	alternative	 institutional	
approach,	 proposing	 a	framework	 for	the	or-
derly	 settlement	 of	sovereign	 defaults	 that	
would	 be	enforced	 by	an	independent,	 and	
therefore	 credible,	 court	 of	law.	 Bundesbank	
President	 Jens	 Weidmann,	 on	the	other	 hand,	
stressed	 the	need	 for	a	stronger	 Stability	 and	
Growth	 Pact,	 as	well	 as	a	clearly	 defined	
mechanism	 for	 dealing	 with	 crises,	 with	
greater	 attention	 being	 paid	 to	market	 sig-
nals.	 Weidmann	 expressed	 doubt,	 however,	
that	 an	institution	 whose	 sole	 purpose	 is	to	
keep	 a	critical	 eye	on	budgets	 could	 ultimately	
prove	to	have	a	sufficiently	stabilising	effect.
Another	 theoretical	 approach	 to	addressing	
the	issue	 of	sovereign	 defaults,	 without	 run-
ning	 the	risk	of	jeopardising	 the	international	
financial	 system,	 is	analysed	 by	Adam	 and	
Grill.10	These	 authors	 develop	 a	model	 frame -
work	 which,	 in	principle,	 allows	 sovereign	 de-
faults,	 subject	 to	clear,	 well-known	 condi -
tions.	 Accordingly,	 unlike	 in	other	 models,	
defaults	 do	not	result	 from	 breaches	 of	con-
tract	 stemming	 from	 overly	 weak	 incentives	
to	comply	 with	 the	terms	 of	the	contract.	 As	
long	 as	a	country	 has	to	bear	 at	least	 some	 of	
the	costs	 in	the	event	 of	a	default,	 it	will	
choose	 to	exercise	 this	option	 only	 in	extreme	
circumstances.	 Although	 these	 costs	 are	fac-
tored	 in	by	international	 investors,	 this	barely	
affects	 the	financing	 conditions	 of	states,	 as	
the	likelihood	 of	such	 a	harsh	 restructuring	 is	
small.	 The	paper’s	 findings	 are	predicated	 on	the	assumption	 of	a	credible	 promise	 that	
payment	 obligations	 will	be	met,	 except	 in	
certain,	 clearly	 defined	 circumstances.	 But	
given	 that,	 in	reality,	 it	could	 be	in	the	inter-
ests	 of	states	 to	subsequently	 change	 their	
conduct,	 there	 is	a	need	 for	the	additional	
mechanisms	 proposed	 by	von	 Hagen	 which	
would	 allow	 sovereign	 defaults	 only	 in	ex-
treme	circumstances.
The	debate	 on	the	problem	 of	sovereign	 de-
faults	 has	also	covered	 another	 means	 of	debt	
relief	 that,	 in	principle,	 is	open	 to	sovereign	
states:	 the	devaluation	 of	outstanding	 nom-
inal	government	 debt	 through	 inflation.	 This	
assumes,	 however,	 that	 government	 debt	 is	
denominated	 in	the	domestic	 currency	 and	
that	 the	government	 can	 control	 monetary	
policy.	 A	devaluation	 of	the	debt	 may	 then	
succeed	 if	the	actual	 rate	of	inflation	 is	higher	
than	 the	rate	 expected	 at	the	time	 the	nom-
inal	 interest	 rate	 on	long-term	 government	
debt	is	determined.
The	 work	 by	Krause	 and	 Moyen11	examines	
this	relationship	 in	a	model	 using	 long-term	
sovereign	 debt	 and	 endogenous	 long-term	
interest	 rates	 on	government	 securities.	 It	can	
be	seen	 that	 short-term	 and	also	 unexpected	
increases	 in	inflation	 cannot	 contribute	 sig-
nificantly	 to	consolidating	 the	 government	
budget.	 Even	 if	the	objective	 of	securing	 low	
inflation	 over	 the	medium	 term	 is	abandoned	
completely,	 permanently	 high	 levels	 of	infla-
tion	would	 have	 a	rather	 moderate	 impact	 on	Orderly 
sovereign defaultsInflation  unsuitable as 
an instrument to reduce sovereign debt

government 	debt. 	The	main 	reason 	for	this	is	
that	nominal 	interest 	rates 	increase 	with	ris-
ing	inflation 	and	thus	the	country’s 	interest 	
burden 	remains 	high. 	The	benefits 	of	relieving 	
the	burden 	on	the	government 	budget 	by	
pursuing 	an	inflationary 	policy 	must 	therefore 	
be	rated 	as	limited 	on	the	whole.
The effectiveness of fiscal policy  
and monetary policy
If	sovereign 	default 	and	inflation 	are	ruled 	out	
as	potential 	solutions 	to	sovereign 	debt	prob -
lems	because 	of	the	huge 	negative 	impact 	
they	have 	on	economies, 	unsustainable 	debt	
levels 	must 	be	reduced 	by	means 	of	a	strict 	
consolidation 	strategy. 	In	this	regard, 	several 	
papers 	dealt 	with	the	effects 	of	fiscal 	meas -
ures	in	general 	and	in	the	special 	context 	of	
the	crisis 	in	particular. 	These 	include 	the	scen-
ario	of	short-term 	interest 	rates 	being 	close 	to	
the	zero	lower 	bound, 	which 	means 	that	the	
principal 	monetary 	policy 	instrument 	can	no	
longer 	be	effectively 	deployed 	and	that	un-
conventional 	measures 	have 	to	be	taken. 	
However, 	this	may	boost 	the	effectiveness 	of	
fiscal 	measures 	compared 	with	“normal” 	
times, 	as	corrective 	monetary 	measures 	can	
be	factored 	out.
Against 	the	background 	of	the	ongoing 	con-
troversy 	regarding 	the	effects 	of	fiscal 	policy, 	
Leeper, 	Traum 	and	Walker12	examine 	the	con-
ceptual 	question 	of	the	extent 	to	which 	the	
selection 	of	a	particular 	model 	predetermines 	
the	results 	of	an	empirical 	study 	into	the	im-
pact	of	government 	spending 	on	economic 	
activity. 	This	is	also	an	issue 	in	the	case	of	dy-namic 	stochastic 	general 	equilibrium 	(DSGE) 	
models. 	For	example, 	allowing 	for	imperfectly 	
optimising 	households 	can	result 	in	higher 	
levels 	of	government 	spending 	not	being 	off-
set	directly 	by	a	reduction 	in	private 	consump -
tion	because 	households 	do	not	rationally 	
anticipate 	the	subsequent 	tax	hikes 	that	this	
entails. 	The	authors 	show 	the	extent 	to	which 	
various 	model 	assumptions 	determine 	the	re-
sults	ex ante .	Empirical 	findings 	are	always 	
prone 	to	this	problem 	and	must 	therefore 	be	
interpreted 	critically. 	At	the	same 	time, 	it	must 	
also	be	taken 	into	account 	that	theory 	can,	of	
course, 	never 	be	agnostic 	and	that	certain 	
elem 	ents, 	in	particular 	for	reasons 	of	plausi -
bility, 	need 	to	be	included 	in	a	model 	and	
consequently 	influence 	its	structure. 	The	con-
clusion 	implied 	by	this	paper 	is	that	the	cycli-
cal	effects 	of	fiscal 	policy 	should 	be	regarded 	
as	rather 	limited.
Coenen, 	Straub 	and	Trabandt13	use	such	a	
model 	to	analyse 	the	European 	Economic 	Re-
covery 	Plan	(EERP), 	which 	was	coordinated 	by	
the	European 	Commission 	and	aimed 	at	
stimu 	lating 	the	European 	economy 	during 	
the	crisis. 	Their 	analysis 	shows 	that	the	Plan	
tempered 	the	decline 	in	European 	GDP	dur-
ing	the	recession 	by	up	to	½%. 	The	paper’s 	
discussant 	pointed 	out	that	this	result 	was	
also	based 	on	assumptions 	that	are	disputed. 	
Therefore, 	the	estimated 	effects 	must 	be	in-
terpreted 	with	caution.Size of govern-

Fiscal 	aspects 	that	are	important 	in	the	con-
text	of	the	crisis 	were 	considered 	in	the		papers 	
by	Corsetti, 	Kuester, 	Meier 	and	Müller,14 and	
Cook 	and	Devereux15.	Corsetti 	et al examine 	
the	cyclical 	impact 	of	the	consolidation 	meas -
ures	on	the	economy 	in	the	special 	situation 	
of	a	zero	lower 	bound 	on	interest 	rates, 	cou-
pled	with	a	high	general 	government 	debt	
level. 	If	interest 	rates 	cannot 	be	cut	any	fur-
ther,	the	phasing-out 	of	expansionary 	fiscal 	
policy 	measures 	is	more 	contractionary 	than	
in	normal 	circumstances. 	At	the	same 	time, 	
however, 	the	expectation 	of	lower 	defi 	cits	in	
the	future 	can	stimulate 	consumption. 	One	
particular 	element 	of	the	analysis 	is	the	feed-
back 	effects 	of	high	government 	debt	on	risk	
premiums, 	which, 	in	turn, 	dampen 	enter -
prises’ 	investment. 	By	running 	simulations 	on	
their	model, 	the	authors 	find	that	consolida -
tion	measures 	can	actually 	have 	an	expan -
sionary 	effect 	during 	particularly 	severe 	crises, 	
thus	allaying 	fears 	that	the	current 	reduction 	
of	government 	deficits 	will	lead	to	another 	
recession.
Cook 	and	Devereux 	also	consider 	the	zero	
inter	est	rate	bound 	in	their	analysis 	of	the	
inter 	national 	coordination 	of	monetary 	and	
fiscal 	policy, 	and	again, 	this	element 	provides 	
fresh 	insight 	into	the	crisis, 	which 	was	lacking 	
in	traditional 	model 	variants. 	The	authors 	first	
demonstrate, 	under 	the	assumption 	that	
goods 	trade 	between 	two	countries 	or	re-
gions 	is	fully	integrated, 	that	following 	a	
sharp 	negative 	shock 	in	one	country, 	the	opti-
mal	policy 	in	both 	countries 	is	to	cut	the	key	
interest 	rate	to	zero	and	adopt 	an	expansion -
ary	fiscal 	policy. 	This	no	longer 	applies, 	how-
ever, 	if	there 	is	incomplete 	integration 	of	trade. 	In	this	case, 	the	deflationary 	effect 	is	
greater 	in	the	country 	that	experienced 	the	
shock 	and	therefore, 	as	a	result 	of	the	zero	
lower 	bound 	on	interest 	rates, 	its	real	interest 	
rate	rises	more 	than	that	of	its	trading 	part-
ners. 	This,	in	turn, 	weakens 	the	exchange 	rate	
and	exacerbates 	the	downturn. 	The	optimal 	
fiscal 	and	monetary 	policy 	in	the	neighbour -
ing	country 	is	therefore 	not	only	to	slightly 	
increase 	government 	spending, 	but	also	to	
raise	the	key	interest 	rate	with	a	view	to	shift-
ing	exchange 	rate	parities 	in	favour 	of	the	
country 	that	experienced 	the	shock. 	Remark -
ably,	this	is	the	optimal 	policy 	for	both 	re-
gions.
Conclusions
Overall, 	the	conference 	and	the	preceding 	
workshop 	gave 	a	good 	overview 	of	the	cur-
rent	state 	of	the	academic 	debate 	on	the	
causes 	of	the	crisis, 	as	well	as	the	mechanisms 	
that	contributed 	to	its	exacerbation 	and	ul-
timately 	resulted 	in	its	spillover 	to	govern -
ment 	finances. 	Several 	papers 	discussed 	
measures 	deemed 	appropriate 	for	prevent -
ing,	or	at	least	reducing 	the	likelihood 	of,	
similar 	developments 	in	the	future. 	These 	in-
clude 	greater 	macroprudential 	supervision, 	
which 	will	counteract 	overgenerous 	lending 	
by	the	financial 	sector 	and	help	to	prevent 	ir-
responsible 	behaviour 	fuelled 	by	the	ex ante 	
anticipation 	of	a	government 	bailout. 	The	
conference 	also	confirmed 	the	belief 	that	Fiscal policy at

there 	is	no	alternative 	to	the	rigorous 	consoli -
dation 	of	public 		finances. 	Attempting 	to	solve 	
these 	problems 	by	increasing 	inflation 	ap-
pears 	to	be	more 	or	less	doomed 	from 	the	
start, 	owing 	to	the	sensitivity 	of	the	private 	
sector 	in	this	regard 	–	not	to	mention 	the	sub-
sequent 	permanent 	damage 	it	would 	do	to	
the	credibility 	of	monetary 	policy. 	In	this	con-
text,	it	is	also	important 	to	note	that	a	con-
solidation 	strategy 	is	likely 	to	have 	a	positive 	
impact 	on	employment 	and	growth, 	in	par-ticular 	given 	a	high	government 	debt	level. 	At	
the	same 	time, 	it	also	became 	clear 	that	it	is	
necessary 	to	exercise 	caution 	when 	assessing 	
fiscal 	measures. 	If	reasonably 	reliable 	conclu -
sions 	are	to	be	drawn, 	it	is	vital	to	choose 	the	
appropriate 	model 	carefully. 	This	suggests 	
that	policymakers 	should 	make 	only	sparing 	
use	of	fiscal 	measures 	in	order 	to	influence 	
economic 	activity, 	particularly 	in	“normal” 	
times.
