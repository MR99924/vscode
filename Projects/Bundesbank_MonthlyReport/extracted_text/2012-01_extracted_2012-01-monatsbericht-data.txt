Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Economic growth is likely to have come to a 
halt in Germany in the final quarter of 2011. 
After the strong increase in economic output in 
the third quarter, even a slight contraction of 
GDP cannot be ruled out. Industry, in particular, 
suffered from the slowing pace of global eco -
nomic growth and irritations resulting from the 
sovereign debt crisis in the euro area. By con -
trast, the construction sector has probably con -
tinued to benefit from a high level of demand. 
In spite of the positive development on the la -
bour market, private consumption appears to 
have hardly risen following a clear increase in 
the previous quarter. This picture emerges from 
the economic indicators available so far, which 
are quite volatile at present. There are indica -
tions that the German economy will move side -
ways at the start of 2012. The decline in indus -
trial orders slowed down markedly in the first 
two months of the fourth quarter of 2011 com -
pared with the preceding quarter and business 
expectations have recovered somewhat from 
their low in the summer.
Industry
Industrial output in November was a seasonally 
adjusted 1% lower than in October, where it 
had shown a month-on-month increase. On an 
average of October and November, it was 2% 
down on the previous quarter’s average. With 
a decline of 2¾%, producers of intermediate 
goods were more strongly affected than manu -
facturers of capital goods, whose output fell by 
1½%.
German industry received significantly fewer 
orders on the whole in November than in the 
previous month. Compared with October, which recorded a 5% increase, the decline was 
4¾%. On an average of October and Novem -
ber, the volume of orders was down 1% on the 
third quarter. The losses in the intermediate 
goods sector came in at a very pronounced 4% 
in this period, while there was a 1% increase in 
demand for capital goods. Orders of consumer 
goods fell by 1%. Both domestic orders and 
orders from the rest of the euro area declined 
by just under 2½%, whilst those from non-
euro-area countries increased by 1½%.
In November, industrial sales declined in line 
with output by 1% on the month. On an aver -
age of the first two months of the fourth quar -
ter, they were 1½% below the third quarter 
with its large volume of sales. Intermediate 
goods underwent a sharp fall of 3%. The figure 
for capital goods was -1¼%. The value of ex -
ported goods increased again significantly in 
November after a sharp decline in the previous 
month, whereas imports declined slightly.
Construction
Construction output rose strongly in November 
by 4½% in seasonally adjusted terms. In com -
parison with the previous quarter, there was a 
clear increase of 2¼% on average for October 
and November. The annual correction under -
taken with the reporting month of November 
has significantly increased the level of construc -
tion output for the preceding months. By con -
trast, construction orders in October – more 
recent data are unavailable at present – were 
down on the month again with a decline of 
1%. This represents a fall of 4¾% on the quar -
ter.Economic slow-

Labour market
The labour market pick-up continued in the au -
tumn. In November, the number of persons in 
work in Germany increased again perceptibly 
on the month at a seasonally adjusted +25,000. 
This constitutes a year-on-year increase of 
521,000, or 1.3%. The number of persons in 
jobs subject to full social security contributions 
is likely to have shown a further increase. Year-
on-year job growth in September amounted 
to 719,000, or 2.5%. According to the Ifo em -
ployment barometer, enterprises’ willingness to 
recruit staff remained at a level indicating ex -
pansion in December despite an obvious de -
cline. The Federal Employment Agency’s BA-X 
job index remained high.
In November, the official unemployment figure 
fell by a seasonally adjusted 22,000 to 2.89 
million. The seasonally adjusted unemployment 
rate (using the Federal Employment Agency’s 
definition) fell to 6.8%. Given that labour mar -
ket policy measures are being scaled back 
 further, total underemployment (excluding 
short-time work) as recorded by the Federal 
 Labour Agency fell more sharply on the year 
(-491,000) than registered unemployment 
(-231,000). As in the previous month, the num -
ber of unemployed persons claiming insurance 
benefits decreased considerably following a 
stagnation in the second and third quarters. 
There was also a fall in the number of long-
term job seekers.
Prices
At the end of the year, the price for a barrel of 
Brent crude oil, at US$107½, was somewhat 
lower than in November. Owing to the height -
ened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East 
and unrest in Nigeria, prices recently increased 
again, however. The price of crude oil went up 
for domestic users on account of the depreci -
ation of the euro. As this report went to press, 
the price of crude oil stood at US$110¾. Crude 
oil futures were being quoted at a discount of Continued

US$1 six months ahead and US$3½ 12 months 
ahead. 
Due to rising crude oil prices and a depreci -
ation of the euro, import prices for energy in -
creased in November by a seasonally adjusted 
3.5% on the month. If energy is excluded, they 
also increased perceptibly by 0.6%. Domestic 
energy prices declined by 0.7% in December. 
The prices of other industrial goods remained 
unchanged. In November, the year-on-year fig -
ure for import prices went down to 6.0% and 
for domestic producer prices to 4.0%.
Consumer prices in December rose by a sea -
sonally adjusted 0.1% compared with Novem -
ber. Food prices remained unchanged. Fuels 
and heating oil saw price reductions. Services 
became slightly more expensive. The annual 
Consumer Price Index (CPI) decreased signifi -
cantly from +2.4% to +2.1%. The Harmonised 
Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) fell from 
+2.8% to +2.3%. This was also due to the fact 
that the sharp increase in energy prices one 
year previously was no longer included in the 
calculation of year-on-year rates. On an aver -
age for 2011, CPI inflation was 2.3% and HICP 
inflation 2.5%, after 1.1% and 1.2% respect -
ively in 2010.
Public finances1
Local government finances
The favourable development of local govern -
ment fiscal balances continued in the third 
quarter of 2011, albeit at a somewhat slower 
pace. According to the latest cash statistics fig -
ures released by the Federal Statistical Office, 
the municipal core budgets still recorded a 
slight deficit, compared with a shortfall of €1½ 
billion one year previously.2 Revenue was sig -
nificantly up on the year (6%, or €2½ billion), 
although the rise was more moderate than in 
the previous quarter (7½%). Tax revenue rose 
by 8%, driven by the strong growth in business 
tax (9% after deduction of the shares accruing to other government levels) and shares of in -
come tax (9½%). At 4½%, local government 
revenue from state government also saw 
marked growth, despite falling investment 
grants. Furthermore, revenue from business ac -
tivities was also up on the year (€½ billion). 
Growth in expenditure accelerated to 3% (€1½ 
billion) and thus dampened deficit reduction. 
Although expenditure on capital formation de -
clined by 8½% (compared with -2% in the pre -
vious quarter), major current expenditure rose 
perceptibly. There was above all growth in 
other operating expenditure (6½% compared 
with 2%) and spending on social benefits (5½% 
compared with 1½%). However, personnel ex -
penditure also grew at a faster pace (2½% 
compared with ½%).
It is likely that the favourable development of 
local government fiscal balances will have con -
tinued until the end of 2011 and that the deficit 
for the year as a whole will be around half of 
the 2010 figure (-€7½ billion). In light of the 
further growth in tax revenue forecast in the 
official tax estimate from November, the fore -
seeable rise in general grants from state gov -
ernment as well as the marked increase in cen -
tral government’s share of the costs of the 
basic allowance for the elderly and people with 
reduced earning capacity, local government 
budgets could even post a surplus at the end of 
2012, provided growth in current expenditure 
can be contained. It is essential that particularly 
the many local governments whose budget 
plans are not balanced as required strictly limit 
their current expenditure. The extremely prob -Marked acceler-

1 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Reports (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
the development of public finances during the preceding 
quarter. For detailed data on budgetary developments and 
public debt, see the statistical section of this report.
2 Since spring 2009, the Federal Statistical Office has pub -
lished only cumulated cash statistics data rather than a de -
tailed breakdown for individual quarters due to the need 
for intra-year revisions following the introduction by many 
local governments of the commercial double-entry book -
keeping system. There is now a greater emphasis on data 
including off-budget entities that are attributable to the 
government sector. Under this definition, the deficit was 
somewhat higher, at €½ billion in total.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

lematic developments in this area are ultimately 
reflected in the fact that the third quarter also 
saw a further increase in the volume of cash 
advances, which are actually only intended to 
bridge short-term liquidity shortfalls. As other 
sources of funding are often not available in 
sufficient amounts, these advances are evi -
dently being used for the long-term financing 
of current expenditure. While, due to the usual 
need to prove sufficient financial capacity, the 
volume of budgetary loans remained virtually 
unchanged compared with the level at the end 
of the second quarter of 2011, the volume of 
cash advances rose by a further €½ billion and 
now stands at just under €44½ billion (includ -
ing off-budget entities). In this context, cash 
advances are still essentially concentrated on a 
few federal states. Thus the lion’s share of the 
increase is attributable to local governments in 
North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse and Rhineland-
Palatinate, which are on average already bur -
dened with very high volumes of cash ad -
vances.Securities markets
Bond market
At €138.6 billion (gross), the issue volume in 
the German bond market in November 2011 
was significantly higher than in the previous 
month (€110.1 billion). Taking account of the 
decrease in redemptions and changes in is -
suers’ holdings of their own bonds, the out -
standing volume of domestic debt securities in 
the market rose by €21.5 billion. In addition, 
foreign debt securities worth €1.5 billion were 
sold in the German market.
Public sector issues amounted to €16.0 billion 
in the reporting month. Developments in the 
primary market were, for the most part, domin -
ated by central government, which issued 
mainly five-year Federal notes (Bobls: €6.4 bil -
lion) as well as two-year Federal Treasury notes 
(Schätze: €5.8 billion) and ten-year Federal 
bonds (Bunds: €5.4 billion). By contrast, it re -
deemed Treasury discount paper (Bubills: €4.0 
billion). The Federal states tapped the capital 
market for €1.8 billion on balance.
In November, German credit institutions in -
creased their capital market debt by €8.3 bil -
lion net. Sales focused, above all, on other 
bank debt securities which can be structured 
flexibly (€7.4 billion) but also, to a lesser extent, 
on debt securities issued by specialised credit 
institutions and mortgage Pfandbriefe (€2.7 bil-Pfandbriefe (€2.7 bil-  (€2.7 bil -
lion and €1.8 billion respectively). Meanwhile, 
net redemptions of public Pfandbriefe  totalled 
€3.6 billion.
In the reporting month, German enterprises 
further reduced their capital market debt by 
€2.8 billion (October: €11.0 billion). On bal -
ance, only bonds with original maturities of 
more than one year were redeemed.
Almost all investor groups purchased bonds.

€9.1 billion net, only German credit institutions 
sold debt securities worth €8.7 billion.
Equity market
In November, domestic enterprises – the major -
ity of which were listed companies – placed 
€0.3 billion worth of new shares in the German 
equity market. The outstanding volume of for -
eign equities in the German market decreased 
by €1.8 billion. Shares were acquired by do -
mestic non-banks, which added equities total -
ling €4.1 billion to their portfolios. By contrast, 
foreign investors and resident credit institutions 
disposed of shares with a value of €5.0 billion 
and €0.6 billion respectively.
Mutual funds
In the reporting month, domestic mutual funds 
recorded a net inflow of €5.7 billion, compared 
with €5.2 billion in October. The fresh funds 
ultimately flowed solely into specialised funds 
reserved for institutional investors (€6.8 billion). 
Of the mutual funds open to the general pub -
lic, only equity-based funds were able to sell 
new shares (€0.3 billion). Meanwhile, bond-
based funds and mixed securities-based funds 
in particular recorded outflows (€1.4 billion and 
€0.5 billion respectively). In November, foreign 
funds traded in the German market sold new 
shares totalling €0.2 billion. Mutual fund shares 
were acquired exclusively by domestic non-
banks, which added paper worth €7.2 billion to 
their portfolios. Foreign investors and German 
credit institutions sold mutual fund shares for 
€1.1 billion and €0.1 billion respectively.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus – in unadjusted terms – of €14.3 billion in 
November 2011. This was €4.4 billion up on 
the October level. The change was primarily 
due to a rise in the trade surplus. By contrast, the surplus on invisibles, which comprise ser -
vices, income and current transfers, remained 
unchanged.
According to provisional figures from the Fed -
eral Statistical Office, in November the foreign 
trade surplus rose by €4.8 billion on the month 
to €16.2 billion. After adjustment for seasonal 
and calendar variations, it went up by €2.6 bil -
lion to €15.1 billion. The value of exports rose 
clearly by 2.5%, while the value of imports saw 
a slight decrease of 0.4%. On an average of 
the months of October and November, after 
seasonal adjustment, nominal exports stayed 
largely at the third-quarter level (-0.1%), with 
price effects playing virtually no role. Despite a 
rise in import prices, the value of imports de -
creased by 0.7%.
In November, as in October, invisible current 
transactions recorded a slight surplus of €0.4 
billion. The changes in the three sub-accounts

sub-account improved by €0.4 billion to post a 
marginal deficit of €0.1 billion. However, the 
overall figure masks some significant individual 
shifts. Thus travel expenditure of Germans 
abroad decreased significantly in comparison 
to October. But there was a marked fall-off, 
too, in revenue from insurance, transport and 
financial services. The surplus on cross-border 
income fell by almost €0.5 billion and stood at 
around €4.1 billion in the period under review. 
The deficit from current transfers remained at 
€3.6 billion as in October.
Cross-border portfolio investment resulted in 
net capital imports in November (€5.2 billion) 
after capital outflows had been recorded in Oc -
tober (€17.7 billion). This was mainly due to for -
eign portfolio investors becoming net buyers 
instead of sellers (€4.8 billion compared with 
-€16.5 billion in October). These investors pur -
chased German bonds and notes (€11.7 bil -
lion), chiefly issued by the public sector, 
whereas they redeemed private debt securities 
on balance. Besides short-dated securities (€0.7 
billion) they primarily sold shares (€5.0 billion) 
and mutual fund shares (€1.1 billion) emanat -
ing from Germany. In net terms, German in -
vestors sold a small quantity of foreign secur -
ities (€0.3 billion). They offloaded foreign equi -
ties (€2.0 billion) whilst moderately enlarging 
their portfolios of debt securities (€1.5 billion). 
In doing so they increased their holdings of for -
eign bonds and notes (€8.1 billion) and de -
creased their stocks of money market instru -
ments (€6.6 billion).
In November, direct investment also resulted in 
net capital imports (€6.9 billion, compared with 
-€4.9 billion in October). This was mainly due 
to the fact that foreign firms provided their 
German affiliates with funds (€5.6 billion). This 
occurred almost exclusively in the form of intra-
group credit transactions (€5.6 billion) and here 
mainly in the form of short-term financial loans. 
In contrast, German parent companies with -
drew capital from their foreign subsidiaries 
(€1.3 billion compared with capital exports of 
€9.4 billion in October). This development was Shift in portfolio

particularly due to intragroup cross-border 
credit transfers (€7.3 billion) – first and fore -
most short-term financial loans – whereby the 
granting of loans by foreign subsidiaries to 
their German parent companies (“reverse

other hand, profit reinvestment and equity top-
ups abroad resulted in outflows in the region of 
€3.8 billion and €2.2 billion respectively.

prising financial and trade credits (where these

prises and households recorded capital imports 
(€4.6 billion), the operations of general govern -
ment resulted in capital exports (€3.8 billion).

Long-term developments in corporate  
financing in Germany – evidence based  
on the financial accounts
It is evident from the financial accounts that total financing of enterprises in Germany has 
increased over the past two decades – both in nominal and in real terms. This is essentially a 
response to overall economic growth. At the same time, the financing structure has changed. 
While internal funds have basically been the most important source of finance and have risen in 
trend terms, external financing has been characterised by strong cyclicality, which has been 
closely correlated with economic developments.
In addition, there have been structural shifts within external financing. With a few exceptions, 
loans have consistently been the most important instrument. However, there have been changes 
in terms of lenders: while this role was, in the past, assumed mainly by banks, a trend towards 
increased substitution in favour of other lenders can be observed in the period under review. For 
instance, large (international) groups increasingly distribute funds via special financing vehicles 
within the group. The bank loan, by contrast, though still the most important source of external 
funding, has systematically seen its importance wane over the past 20 years. Overall, intermedi -
ation services via traditional credit business have therefore declined.
These structural changes have much to do with a changing macroeconomic and institutional 
environment. The growing economic integration, which has been very pronounced, mainly within 
the European Union with the foundation of the monetary union and the eastern enlargement, 
probably contributed to these developments. Moreover, more stringent regulatory requirements 
and changes in corporate taxation are also likely to have had an impact on financing.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Non-financial corporations’ total financing and 
financing structure reflect numerous real eco -
nomic and financial factors. Corporate finan -
cing data contain important information on 
macroeconomic developments, as financing 
decisions are primarily based on investment de -
cisions, while at the same time providing valu -
able insight into financing conditions within 
the corporate sector. Corporate financing is 
therefore a key metric at the interface between 
a country’s financial sector and its real econ -
omy.
As a consequence, it is also particularly import -
ant for monetary policy, as it influences the ef -
fectiveness of monetary policy measures. For 
instance, adjustments to the policy interest rate 
change funding costs via the “interest rate 
channel” of monetary policy transmission and 
impact on investment, economic activity and 
ultimately price developments. In addition, 
monetary policy may also affect enterprises’ ac -
cess to funds via the “credit channel” and thus 
additionally influence economic developments 
and prices.1
The present article describes and analyses 
develop  ments in non-financial corporations’ 
funding in Germany between 1991 and 2010. 
The data used are the financial accounts, which 
– as an integral component of the national ac -
counts – allow a uniform and consistent de -
scription of corporate financing over the entire 
period. This long-term perspective allows both 
structural changes and cyclical patterns to be 
identified. In addition, the information gleaned 
from the macroeconomic circular flow permits 
a study of the interaction and the feedback be -
tween corporate financing and the funding of 
other sectors of the economy.Instruments and structure  
of corporate financing
Enterprises have a number of financial instru -
ments at their disposal, which differ, in particu -
lar, in terms of the source of the funds and the 
legal position of the capital providers. While in -
ternal funds stem from within the corporate 
process, external funds are supplied by capital 
providers outside of the enterprise. In terms of 
the legal position of the capital providers, a dis -
tinction is made between equity and debt, with 
equity conferring a right to a share in the enter -
prise’s profits, while those providing debt cap -
ital act as creditors.
An analysis of the determinants of financing 
behaviour is closely associated with the ques -
tion of optimal financing volume and structure. 
It is generally assumed that decision-makers 
will endeavour to maximise the enterprise’s net 
worth.2
Only under certain, fairly strict conditions3 does 
the capital structure and thus leverage (the 
ratio of debt to equity capital) have no impact 
on the net worth, ie the value generated by 
investments is independent of how they are 
funded (irrelevance theorem).4 As these condi -
tions are not met in reality, however, the finan -
cing structure has an impact on the net worth 
and must therefore be determined by manage -Corporate finan-
cing as interface between the real economic and the finan-cial sphere

Report, September 2001, pp 51-70.
2 Based on the present value approach, this figure equates 
to the sum of all the enterprise’s future net cash flows dis -
counted using the cost of capital.
3 The assumptions relate to a perfect capital market. Gen -
erally, this is understood to mean a market with no transac -
tion costs, homogenous expectations when using publicly 
available information and the assumption that market par -
ticipants are price takers and quantity setters. See 
also F Modigliani and M H Miller (1958), The cost of cap -
ital, corporation finance, and the theory of investment, 
American Economic Review, 53, pp 433-443.
4 An increase in the percentage of external capital in cor -
porate financing initially lowers the average cost of capital. 
However, as an increasing volume of net cash flows is used 
to service interest on debt, the residual claim of equity pro -
viders declines. This raises equity risk and consequently the 
required return on equity, which means that the average 
cost of capital will remain constant in a no-arbitrage equi -
librium.Deutsche Bundesbank

ment, taking into account the cost and benefits 
of alternative forms of financing. What finan -
cing structure is chosen depends, amongst 
others, on micro and macroeconomic deter -
minants as well as on the financial and the tax 
system.
Tax conditions, for instance, influence the 
choice between debt and equity financing: 
seen in isolation, the taxation of profit payouts 
is a disadvantage for equity financing if the 
cost of debt is tax deductible.5 However, this 
cost has to be weighed against the cost of add -
itional debt in the form of bankruptcy costs 
and higher interest on debt if creditworthiness 
deteriorates. A weighing of the costs and bene -
fits of financing options in this fashion yields an 
optimal leverage ratio, which the enterprise will 
endeavour to achieve over time, but which 
may in turn change with altered conditions.
Information and incentive problems among dif -
ferent capital providers as well as between 
owners and management also influence finan -
cing structure. The principal-agent relationship 
between management (agent) and capital pro -
viders (principal) and the fact that the former 
has an information advantage over the latter 
gives rise to a preference order with regard to 
financing instruments. Forms of financing in -
volving a less pronounced information and in -
centive problem are favoured. This dictates a 
pecking order for financing instruments, 
headed by internal funds, followed by debt 
and, finally, equity financing (theory of finan -
cing hierarchy).6
Information aspects and the institutional set-up 
are also important for the decision on the 
structure of external financing. For this reason, 
the banking sector is an important source of 
external funds for enterprises, as banks gener -
ally have a cost advantage over alternative cap -
ital providers in terms of monitoring their bor -
rowers.7 By contrast, access to market-based 
forms of financing – say issuing corporate 
bonds – is subject to special requirements, such 
as a high degree of transparency, as evidenced in the voluntary submission of information on 
the enterprise and in meeting legally prescribed 
disclosure requirements, which many enter -
prises do not wish to comply with for oper -
ational reasons or cannot meet due to other 
restrictions.
In addition, macroeconomic developments, 
particularly the business cycle, also influence fi -
nancing. For instance, economic developments 
impact on enterprises’ earnings situation and 
thus their internal financing capacity. However, 
reduced earnings also make access to external 
funds more expensive if the provider of exter -
nal funds fears a conflict of interest because 
the percentage of internal financing is small 
and the valuation of assets accepted as collat -
eral is, moreover, low and therefore demands 
an interest rate premium as compensation for a 
heightened risk of loss.8
Finally, supply-side factors can also affect total 
financing and financing structure. Active bal -
ance sheet management on the part of finan -
cial intermediaries can alter the supply of funds, 
for example if their activities are limited by valu -
ation effects relating to the intermediaries’ 
own assets, more restrictive access to short-In reality, the

5 By way of example, reference may be made to the with -
holding tax in Germany, which was introduced with the 
Business Tax Reform Act of 2008 (Unternehmenssteuer -
reformgesetz 2008)  and which is not neutral with regard 
to financing, giving preference to debt over equity. For a 
broad general overview of the effects of taxation on cor -
porate financing, see J R Graham (2003), Taxes and corpor -
ate finance – a review, Review of Financial Studies, 16, 
pp 1075-1129.

nomic Perspectives, 15, pp 91-102; R G Rajan and L Zin -

ture? Some evidence from international data, The Journal 
of Finance, 50, pp 1421-1460; and E F Fama and K French

8 In this case, the literature speaks of an “external finan -
cing premium”. It is defined as the difference between the 
cost of capital for internal and external financing. See B S 
Bernanke and M Gertler (1989), Agency costs, net worth 
and business fluctuations, American Economic Review, 79, 
pp 14-31; and G L Hubbard (1998), Capital-market imper -

term revolving refinancing or regulatory capital 
requirements.9 This may amplify the business 
cycle – particularly if enterprises’ ability to re -
sort to other forms of financing is constrained.10 
For instance, they may then be forced, in eco -
nomic downturns, either to resort to internal 
funding options – which are themselves limited 
by a poorer earnings situation – or to adjust 
their spending accordingly.11
While these considerations imply that invest -
ment demand and overall financing are procy -
clical across the business cycle, the develop -
ment in the ratio between equity and debt fi -
nancing on the one hand and the composition 
of debt financing on the other during the busi -
ness cycle cannot always be clearly identified 
beforehand. They depend, amongst others, on 
how severely the above-mentioned financial 
frictions on the supply and demand side impact 
the corporate sector. It is clear that capital pro -
curement from external sources declines and 
that the cost of debt financing, including po -
tential insolvency costs, increases during down -
turns. Leveraging would therefore also tend to 
decrease. In this context, however, when look -
ing at the degree of leveraging in the entire 
corporate sector, the percentage of enterprises 
able to resort to alternative forms of external 
financing is decisive.
Valuation effects on wealth also play a role for 
the financing structure, as falling asset prices 
on the financial market are usually associated 
with a greater need for write-downs, which re -
duce the equity position. This raises the lever -
age ratio and may hamper investment dynam -
ics, especially where debt is excessive.12 If the 
corporate sector uses payment surpluses in 
order to successively reduce debt and bring 
down the leverage ratio, this can ultimately re -
sult in a long period of adjustment with low 
investment activity.13Developments in corporate 
financing in Germany 
 between 1991 and 2010
The following empirical observation is based on 
data taken from the financial accounts and the 
national accounts, which are compiled accord -
ing to the European System of Accounts 1995 
(ESA 95). The sector non-financial corporations 
as defined there includes all corporations (pub -
lic limited companies or AGs, and private 
limited companies or GmbHs) and quasi-
corporations (partnerships, ie general partner -
ships or OHGs, and limited partnerships or KGs, 
etc) domiciled in Germany.14 A disaggregated 
analysis, for instance by enterprise size or sec -
tor, is not possible. Financial instruments are 
broken down by liquidity, maturity and legal 
features and can be sub-divided primarily into 
deposits, securities and loans.Link between

term “credit channel of monetary policy transmission”.

605; and P Disyatat (2011), The bank lending channel re -

organised banking networks weakens credit supply-side fi -

sociation, 2, pp 1148-1171.
10 A credit crunch is a situation in which the supply of 
bank loans is so limited in quantitative terms by bank-side 
factors that it represents a significant economic risk. See 
also Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report, October 
2010, p 36.
11 For this reason, non-financial corporations generally 
hold a significant percentage of their assets in liquid form 
to allow them to continue financing ongoing investment 
projects in times of credit constraints. See B Holmström 
and J Tirole (2011), Inside and outside liquidity, Paris, MIT 
Press.

These underlying data differ from other statis -
tics such as corporate balance sheet statistics.15 
However, one key advantage of this approach 
is that it looks at the corporate sector in an 
(internationally) consistent and virtually com -
prehensive way over the entire period.
The financing of German enterprises was char -
acterised by strong momentum in the period 
from 1991 to 2010. First, progress in informa -
tion and communication technology and the 
increasing liberalisation of the international 
goods and financial markets drove integration 
and increased competitive pressure. Second, as 
enterprises’ production processes became in -
creasingly international, firms adapted their 
funding opportunities to the changing eco -
nomic landscape.
Total financing of non-financial corporations in 
Germany was on a positive trend between 
1991 and 2010 both in nominal and in real 
terms. While overall financing was still around 
€280 billion in nominal terms in 1991, a figure 
of €400 billion was recorded as at end-2010. In 
line with the theoretical statements on the 
choice of financing structure, enterprises mainly 
used internal financing sources. Thus, the per -
centage of internal financing in total capital 
raised averaged more than 65% and thereby 
consistently exceeded external financing in vol -ume terms, except in 1999 and 2000, when 
the stock market boom triggered an increased 
issuance of shares in particular.
The importance  
of internal financing
As part of internal financing, depreciation al -
lowances in the form of liquid funds played a 
prominent role; their percentage share of in -
ternal financing averaged around 85%. The 
volume of such funds rose almost continuously 
over time, from just under €120 billion in 1991 
to more than €190 billion at the end of 2010. 
This was largely attributable, first, to the in -
creased capital stock in the corporate sector 
over this period, which is largely the result of 
investment in machinery and equipment, and, 
second, to the method for calculating depreci -
ation.16

transfers) represented only 15% of internal 
funds on average. As compared to depreci -Total financing

ation, they were, moreover, significantly more 
volatile as they depend on the general earnings 
situation, which is closely correlated to the 
business cycle. Since the turn of the century, 
they have shown a positive trend, however.17 
This can be attributed, amongst other factors, 
to enterprises’ efforts to consolidate their bal -
ance sheets. While in the second half of the 
1990s German enterprises’ leverage ratio rose 
from some 170% to more than 190% as meas -
ured by gross value added, enterprises distrib -
uted less of their earnings following the reces -
sion in 2001 and increasingly used them to pay 
down debt.18 Debt levels stabilised as a result 
and were lowered to a level of around 170% in 
the following years from 2002 to 2005. The 
outcome of these efforts were an improved 
equity capital position and an increase in in -
ternal funds. These developments were pro -
moted by the overall favourable global eco -
nomic climate over this period and the im -
provement in the international competitiveness 
of German enterprises, which was in turn sup -
ported by moderate wage increases. However, 
as the financial and economic crisis intensified, 
the earnings situation deteriorated again, caus -
ing retained earnings to fall sharply in 2008 
and 2009. With the economic recovery, they 
accelerated strongly again in 2010.
The trend increase in retained earnings can, 
moreover, be explained by the business tax re -
form of 2000. The object of the reform was to 
give preferential tax treatment to earnings re -
tention as compared to earnings distribution, 
which led to a bias in favour of internal finan -
cing over other forms of financing.19 Nonethe -
less, there is some evidence that the renewed 
changes in corporate taxation in 2008 have 
tended to increase external financing using 
debt and thus the leverage ratio because they 
raise the cost of self-financing and equity finan -
cing relative to external financing.20 The cyclical 
component in corporate financing currently 
may still mask this effect.
The almost constant increase in all internal 
funding opportunities has, for some years, even meant that German enterprises have at 
their disposal more internal funds than are 
needed to expand the capital stock. While 
gross investment rose continuously between 
2002 and 2008, it still fell short of the sum of 
retained earnings and depreciation. Overall, 
these developments caused surplus funds in 
the non-financial corporations sector. Looking 
at the economy as a whole, enterprises, which 
overall typically act as net borrowers in the eco -
nomic process, have therefore for several years 
provided other sectors with funds on a net 
basis. The main recipients of these funds were 
German enterprises’ foreign affiliates, which 
covered part of their funding needs using the 
equity capital provided by their parent com -
panies. German enterprises have increasingly 
moved parts of the supply chain to eastern Eur -
ope, in particular following the eastern en -
largement of the European Union, and have 
provided their foreign affiliates with funds for 
the purpose of expanding their capital stock.
Developments  
in external financing
In the period under review, external financing 
had, on average, a smaller role to play in cor -
porate financing than internal financing. It 
made up roughly one-third of total funds raised 
per year. Overall, external financing lacked a 
clear trend; in fact, it exhibited a pronounced 
cyclical pattern as compared to internal finan -
cing. The first cycle covered the years 1997 
to 2004. In this period, more external funds 
were initially raised, peaking at just under €290 
billion in 2000. Subsequently, borrowing was 
curtailed sharply; in 2004, outstanding liabil -… and im-

17 The sharp increase in 1995 can be attributed mainly to 
the assumption of Treuhand agency debt by the Redemp -
tion Fund for Inherited Liabilities, which was classified as a 
transfer of assets from the government to enterprises.
18 In this context, debt refers to the sum of outstanding 
liabilities minus shares and other equity.

ities were even redeemed on a net basis. This 
cycle was driven mainly by strong borrowing 
during the New Economy boom (1997-2000).21 
In the following cycle, net inflows peaked at 
around €175 billion in 2007 and their dynamic 
subsequently slowed down as the financial and 
economic crisis intensified. In 2010, they were 
around €128 billion.
Like internal financing, the extent to which en -
terprises raised external funds depended pri -
marily on the domestic economic environment. 
During economic upswings, more external 
funding was raised, while it tended to be scaled 
back in recessionary economic phases. This can 
be explained by declining demand for capital 
goods as well as, amongst other things, the 
fact that the external financing premium on ex -
ternal financing instruments is countercyclical. 
The premium tends to shrink during an eco -
nomic recovery, because the value of the assets 
accepted as collateral increases, thus enhan -
cing the attractiveness of external financing as 
financing costs come down.22 At the same 
time, the cyclical development in external fi -
nancing can also be attributed to credit-supply 
factors, because the fact that profitability in 
lending fluctuates with economic activity as 
well as creditors’ equity levels implies cyclical 
credit growth.23
External financing has generally lagged growth 
in the real gross domestic product.24 Possible 
reasons could be contractual rigidities or pre -
cautionary reasons. In the early phases of an 
economic downturn, enterprises cannot imme -
diately adjust to the changing economic envir -
onment, for instance due to payment obliga -
tions vis-à-vis suppliers or the need to finance 
inventories. By contrast, as the economy starts 
to recover, improved cash flows are probably 
one reason why external financing is initially 
expanded only slowly. Moreover, enterprises’ 
expectations regarding the sustainability of the 
upturn and the associated profitability of in -
vestment projects likely play a role.Besides the domestic economic situation, struc -
tural factors have also influenced external fi -
nancing over the past 20 years. These include 
continual efforts to facilitate access to external 
funds through measures to enhance transpar -
ency and the availability of corporate informa -
tion.25 Further, the tax changes of 2008 men -
tioned above have probably also had an impact 
on the choice of financing. For instance, the

Structure  
of external financing
The structure of external financing, too, is very 
dynamic. In the European context, the creation 
of the single market and the introduction of 
the euro especially have increased the intensity 
of competition among external capital pro -
viders. This has led to larger and more liquid 
financial markets as well as to an increased 
supply of innovative financing instruments.

ised by a bank-based financing system, has 
seen the importance of alternative forms of fi -
nance rise significantly in recent years.
The table above shows the outstanding liabil -
ities of non-financial corporations at the end of 
selected years within the observation period. It 
should be noted that holdings of securities (in 
particular shares) are strongly impacted by 
valuation changes, which limits comparability 
of the percentages that they contribute to 
overall liabilities with the remaining data. In the 
following, the significance of securities is there -
fore discussed based on transaction volumes, 
which are not affected by valuation effects.
Among the various financing instruments, 
loans were the most important source of fi -
nance with an average percentage of just 
under 33% of total liabilities. The majority of 
these loans were granted by banks. Over time, 
the importance of bank loans declined steadily, 
however, with their share dropping from 
around 32% in 1991 to 18% in 2010. By con -
trast, there was a sharp rise in loans from other 
creditors (including insurers, other financial in -
stitutions and other enterprises). Their percent -
age more than doubled from some 6% in 1991 
to just under 14% at the end of 2010. If one 
considers all the years in the observation period 
(see chart on page  21), it is clear that banks were substituted by other creditors mainly in 
the second half of the observation period. 
Loans from non-banks played an increasingly 
important role especially in phases in which ex -
ternal financing was reduced (2000 to 2004 
and 2007 to 2009).
Non-financial corporations made less use of 
market-based financing instruments. During 
the period from 1991 to 2010, more funds 
were, for the most part, raised through loans 
than through shares and other equity, and 
other securities. While annual new borrowing 
in the form of loans averaged just under €50 
billion, an average of some €37 billion in shares 
and other equity and just under €6 billion in 
securities (other than shares) was issued. Disre -
garding the sharp expansion of equity issuance 
around the turn of the century, the average fig -
ure for funds raised in this way even drops to 
less than €30 billion.27
With just over 5% of overall liabilities, insur -
ance technical reserves played a small role.

and advances, represented an important source 
of finance for German enterprises. Although 
their share of overall liabilities fell from more 
than 17% in 1991 to around 12% at the end of 
2010, they nonetheless contributed to finan -
cing throughout the period under review.
In summary, it can be stated that external fi -
nancing of non-financial corporations in the 
period from 1991 to 2010 was heavily domin -
ated by loan financing compared with market-
based financing. The large importance of 
credit-based financing overall was initially the 
result of the traditionally large share of bank 
loans in total liabilities.
This observation can be attributed, amongst 
others, to how the corporate sector in Ger -
many is structured. Small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs), which are characteristic of 
the German corporate landscape, were fre -
quently unable to tap the capital market given 
their size or legal form.28 Besides the costs as -sociated with going public, which weigh heav -
ily on SMEs’ liquidity, information deficiencies 
may contribute to a reticent supply of funds.29 
However, banks, too, were keen to maintain 
long-term business relationships with enter -
prises, as they needed to cover the high cost of 
credit monitoring in order to generate positive 
income across a long credit exposure in an in -
tensely competitive environment.
As a result, long-term lending relationships, fre -
quently with just one bank – known as the 
“house bank” – were the norm. This meant 
that banks in Germany, in contrast to capital 
providers with less close business relationships 
with enterprises, frequently had privileged ac -

Developments in external fi  nancing for euro-area 
non-fi  nancial corporations during the global fi  nancial and economic crisis
As fi  nancial market tensions built up in the 
third quarter of 2007, leading to the global economic crisis, many – and in some cases, substantial – adjustments were visible in the 
behaviour of private market participants. Within this context the fi  nancing situation 
of non-fi  nancial corporations in Germany is 
compared with those of other large euro-
area countries in the following. This allows us to draw important conclusions concern-
ing the impact of the global fi  nancial tur-moil on corporate fi  nancing in individual 
countries and on how the corporate sector in each country responded.
The chart on page 23 shows developments 
in the structure of external fi  nancing of 
non-fi  nancial corporations since the fi  rst quarter of 2006 for the euro area as a 
whole as well as for Germany, Spain, France 
and Italy, based on four-quarter moving sums. External fi  nancing is broken down 
into the following liabilities: securities, short 
and long-term loans, shares and other 
equity as well as other liabilities (including, 
inter alia, trade credits and insurance tech-
nical reserves). A comparative analysis of developments in internal fi  nancing is not possible in this context due to insuffi   cient 
data availability on the countries selected.
In the euro area, as in Germany, the struc-
ture of external fi  nancing prior to the fi  nan-
cial and economic crisis was characterised 
by a large proportion of loan fi  nancing. The 
volume of external fi  nancing was very dy-
namic up to the end of 2007. From the fi  rst 
quarter of 2008, however, the volume de-
clined signifi  cantly mainly due to subdued 
dynamics in bank loans. After the collapse 
of Lehman Brothers, short-term loans in particular came to a virtual halt in the au-
tumn of 2008 and in the subsequent quar-
ters.1 This development resulted, not least, 
from stricter credit standards being imposed by the banking system, which also affected 
small and medium-sized enterprises, mak-ing it more diffi   cult for them to access credit. Market-based fi  nancing, on the other hand, presented a different picture. Whereas equity fi  nancing stayed relatively 
stable throughout the period under review, 
there was a noticeable increase in securi-ties-based fi  nancing from the fi  rst quarter 
of 2009 onwards. This indicates a substitu-
tion of loans by market-based external fi  -
nancing in the euro area. During the crisis, 
the share of market-based external fi  nan-
cing rose considerably as a result.
A similar development can also be identi-
fi  ed at the country level. In some European 
neighbouring countries, total external fi  -
nancing fell steeply in the wake of the eco-
nomic crisis. By comparison, the years be-fore had seen very pronounced fi  nancing 
dynamics amidst strong growth in domestic 
demand.2 This effect was especially pro-
nounced in Spain. In the second half of 
2009 and the fi  rst half of 2010, there was 
even a net repayment of loans, primarily because of outfl  ows recorded for short-term loans and other liabilities. Long-term

loans to non-fi  nancial corporations likewise 
dropped considerably. This decline was 
likely due in part to tensions in the Spanish 
banking sector (above all in the savings 
bank sector). Combined with the continu-
ing consolidation process in Spain’s banking sector and the reduction of household debt on the one hand, and the high savings ratio 
and households’ low consumption on the 
other, these developments led to subdued 
investment and borrowing activity right up 
to recent quarters.
In France and Italy, too, loan fi  nancing 
made a negative contribution to external fi  -
nancing during the crisis quarters. In con-
trast to Spain, however, the corporate sec-
tor in these countries was able, to an ex-
tent, to switch to alternative market-based 
forms of fi  nancing. This is because the im-
balances that were built up prior to the fi  -
nancial and economic crisis were not as 
substantial as in Spain, which probably re-
sulted in lower quantitative restrictions in terms of access to fi  nancing.
3 Thus, the 
transaction volume in securities fi  nancing 
expanded while, at the same time, equity-
based fi  nancing and the injection of other 
funds into equity displayed robust growth. 
Despite a slight rise in infl  ows via external fi  nancing since the fi  rst quarter of 2010, total external fi  nancing in both countries has fallen short of fi  gures recorded in the 
pre-crisis quarters.
A mixed picture emerges in Germany with 
regard to external fi  nancing. This is due, 
fi  rst, to the fact that the decrease was much 
less pronounced in Germany than in the 
euro area and the member countries under 
review. Although the overall fi  nancing vol-
ume contracted slightly in the second quar-ter of 2009, it stabilised from then onwards. 
Second, compared with the other coun-tries, Germany experienced a fairly stable 
infl  ow of funds via loan fi  nancing in particu-lar, although bank loans were substituted to 
a great extent by fi  nancing through intra-group loans. At the same time, there was an increase in fi  nancing through other li-abilities including, inter alia , trade credits 
and advances – although these are less sig-
nifi  cant in quantitative terms. The drop in 
short-term loans in the crisis quarters, ie the second quarter of 2009 to the fi  rst quarter of 2010, was probably partly attributable to 
bank-related factors.4 By comparison, mar-
ket-based external fi  nancing played a far 
less important role than it did in the other 
member states under review, and indeed in the euro area as a whole.
The adjustments in corporate fi  nancing clearly show that the fi  nancial market tur-moil and the existence of country-specifi  c 
fi  nancial frictions and structural factors led 
to different responses with regard to exter-
nal fi  nancing; these depended, inter alia , 
on the extent to which imbalances had pre-
viously built up in each individual country. 
From a monetary policy perspective, an an-alysis of these developments is important as it sheds light on how monetary policy meas-
ures affect country-specifi  c fi  nancing struc-
ture and, therefore, the monetary transmis-sion. From an economic policy perspective, 
country-specifi  c developments are import-
ant, as possible differences at the individual 
country level may signal a need for adjust-
ment.
3 International studies indicate that the substitution of 
bank-based by market-based forms of fi  nancing during the occurrence of fi  nancial crises is a typical pattern in 
the development of external fi  nancing in industrial 
countries. See E P Davis and M R Stone (2004), Cor-
porate fi  nancial structure and fi  nancial stability, Journal of Financial Stability, 1, pp 65-91.4 See B Blaes, Bank-related loan supply factors during the crisis: an analysis based on the German bank lend-ing survey, Discussion Paper, Deutsche Bundesbank Re-search Centre, Series 1, No 31/2011.Deutsche Bundesbank

equately assess the enterprise’s economic situ -
ation and development potential. This also had 
a positive effect on enterprises’ financing costs.
As competition on the financial markets has in -
tensified and in view of globally active enter -
prises’ international focus, an incipient shift in 
corporate financing has been observed over 
the past ten years. Since the turn of the cen -
tury, bank loans have increasingly been re -
placed by lending within the corporate sector. 
During the periods of economic weakness in 
the years 2001-03 and 2008-09 especially, this 
credit component gained in importance, while 
there was even a net repayment of bank loans 
as external financing was reduced. This process 
was driven by factors attributable to develop -
ments both in the corporate sector and in the 
banking system.
Globalisation has led to an increased formation 
of large international enterprises, which con -
duct centralised liquidity and finance manage -ment within the group. In this respect, intra-
group financing vehicles provide funds. One 
characteristic is that liquidity positions within 
the group are pooled, with liquidity distributed 
and netted across group enterprises as re -
quired. As part of the group-wide objective of 
increasing profitability, this cash pooling can re -
duce interest payments and thus financing 
costs at group level.30 Individual group mem -
bers need not resort to comparatively expen -
sive forms of financing provided by third par -
ties, while other subsidiaries need not invest 
their excess liquidity at relatively unfavourable 
terms and conditions. The financing vehicle ex -
ploits the creditworthiness of the group as a

invest surplus liquidity profitably.31 Such a strat -
egy – albeit currently only open to enterprises 
of a certain minimum size – allows increasing 
independence from external creditors and 
lowers the risk of restricted access to funds for 
the individual group members. In addition, the 
growing number of international interlinkages 
means that enterprises are increasingly also 
seeking loans from foreign banks. Annual new 
bank loans from abroad almost doubled in the 
second half of the period under observation.
Bank-related factors are also likely to have con -
tributed to the shift in corporate financing. It 
cannot be ruled out, for instance, that the tem -
porary tightening of credit standards in the last 
two downturns and rising regulatory require -
ments under the Basel Agreement have 
prompted enterprises to turn to alternative 
forms of financing. This development was pro -
moted by the existence of the cash pools out -
lined above. At the same time, the intensity of 
global competition in the intermediation sector 
and the above-mentioned international focus 
of potential borrowers are likely to have aggra -
vated the already high margin pressure in credit 
business, prompting large, capital-market fo -
cused banks, in particular, to extend their busi -
ness activities to include commission business 
and investment banking.
Finally, bank loans’ reduced significance is also 
evident in the maturity structure (see chart on 
page 25). While the vast majority of funding 
was based on long-term bank loans during the 
1990s, the increase in loans from non-banks, 
notably loans from other enterprises, was asso -
ciated with shorter loan lives. At the same time, 
it can be seen that cutbacks mainly affected 
short-term bank loans during economic down -
turns. This is probably because large enterprises 
resorted less to the use of bank credit lines, in -
stead primarily using short-term funding within 
the group.Conclusions and outlook
The way in which enterprises in Germany fi -
nance themselves underwent considerable 
changes over the 20-year observation period. 
Internal funds were generally more important 
than external funds, their volume rising con -
tinuously throughout, but nonetheless dis -
played a certain cyclicality in terms of retained 
earnings, which can mainly be attributed to 
economic developments. By contrast, develop -
ments in external financing were much more 
volatile than those in internal financing. This, 
too, can be attributed chiefly to cyclical factors. 
The ratio between internal and external finan -
cing therefore fluctuated sharply over time.
With just a few exceptions, loans consistently 
played the most important role within external 
financing. While in the past, banks were the 
main lenders, they tended increasingly to be 
substituted in favour of other creditors, includ -
ing affiliated enterprises, in the period under 
review. Especially during economic downturns, 
enterprises resorted to this form of financing 
and thus reinforced the trend.
This structural shift reflects the ongoing inte -
gration of the goods and capital markets and 
the associated internationalisation of – finan -
cial and non-financial – (large) corporations. It 
could, however, also be related to (bank) 
supply-side factors which, in the form of stricter 
credit standards during economic downturns, 
rising regulatory requirements and growth of 
commission business, helped enhance the rele -
vance of alternative sources of funding. As a … in a changed

31 In this context, the argument can be made that the in -
creasing significance of the shadow banking system can be 
attributed, amongst others, to the existence of these inter -
national cash pools. In order to diversify, these institutions 
do not invest their short-term liquidity surplus only in bank 
deposits, trying instead to use market-based forms of 
short-term investment (for instance money market funds). 
Demand from cash pools for short-term investment oppor -
tunities is, moreover, an attractive refinancing alternative 
for the other financial intermediaries (eg special purpose 
vehicles), in particular in the context of securitisation.

result, the significance of bank loans, which still 
represent the single most important source of 
external financing, waned considerably over 
the observation period. Overall, intermediation 
services through traditional credit business 
therefore declined.
By contrast, the percentage of market-based 
external financing has remained virtually un -changed since 1991. Disregarding the tempor -
arily enormous volume of funds raised during 
the New Economy boom towards the end of 
the 1990s, this form of funding continues to 
play a less important role, also by European 
standards.Importance of

The PHF: a survey of household wealth  
and finances in Germany
The Bundesbank conducted its first survey of the wealth and finances of households resident in 
Germany between September 2010 and July 2011. The results of this voluntary survey have been 
summarised under the name “Panel on Household Finances” (Private Haushalte und ihre Finan -
zen, or PHF). The data mainly comprise households’ balance sheets, their pension entitlements, 
savings activity and income, data on employment, consumption, beliefs and expectations and a 
large number of demographic characteristics. The PHF is part of a new, harmonised survey being 
carried out in all euro-area countries. It will therefore be relatively easy to place the German 
results in a European context.
In future, the data will provide a comprehensive view of households’ assets and debts and their 
determinants, thus allowing a better understanding of issues such as saving and consumption 
behaviour, the distribution of wealth or insolvency risks.
A representative sample comprising 3,565 households provided data for the first survey wave 
between September 2010 and July 2011. Wealthy households are overrepresented to enable a 
better analysis of the composition and distribution of wealth. The next wave is tentatively sched -
uled for 2014, and will involve as many of the households surveyed in the first wave as possible.
This article introduces the underlying framework of the PHF and explains the various steps of stat -
istical data processing. Some of these steps have not yet been completed, meaning that the fig -
ures presented here are provisional. However, this article can already provide an initial impression 
of selected results. What the article shows, in particular, is how housing wealth is distributed in 
Germany and the size of the associated debt burden borne by the various household groups. The 
US subprime crisis showed just how important such information can be.Deutsche Bundesbank

An initiative of the European 
System of Central Banks
In 2006, at the initiative of the ECB, a group of 
economists and statisticians from Eurosystem 
central banks began working on a joint survey 
of household finances, the Household Finance 
and Consumption Survey (HFCS). To make the 
results comparable across countries, a common 
blueprint for the questionnaires was developed 
as a template for new surveys and as a point of 
orientation for surveys already in place in some 
euro-area countries. The blueprint determines 
the content of the survey (output harmonisa -
tion), while national central banks are free to 
choose what they consider to be the best 
method of conducting the survey, thus allow -
ing the special institutional features of a coun -
try to be taken into account. Moreover, the 
national surveys contain many variables which 
are either specific or especially important to 
that particular country.
Heterogeneity of households
Households’ financial situation, as well as their 
borrowing and savings behaviour, are key in -
gredients of an economy’s ability to grow, and 
also impact on financial stability. They deter -
mine how unexpected developments, such as a 
drop in income caused by the loss of a job, can 
be cushioned and whether a household will 
become overindebted. Heterogeneity – an -
other term for individual variability – is a de -
cisive factor. Assuming a notional “representa -
tive household” is often insufficient to provide 
an understanding of consumption and saving 
decisions and the effects of monetary policy, 
much as the concept of a “representative bank” 
does not permit a proper analysis of financial 
stability. This is especially the case when – as 
with data on wealth – the differences between 
households are very large. The HFCS in general 
and the German PHF in particular therefore col -
lect household and individual data. Some ex -
amples below shall serve to highlight the ben -
efits of using such data.Debt

household debt is constrained in a number of 
ways. The Bundesbank’s borrowers statistics 
show that the total debt of households (em -
ployees, sole proprietors and entrepreneurs) 
stood at €1,403 billion at the end of 2010. Div -
iding this figure by the number of households 
at that particular time yields an average house -
hold debt of €34,813. However, such averages 
mask important information which can only be 
obtained using microdata. Provisional PHF fig -
ures show that only 41.9% of German house -
holds are actually in debt at all. These house -
holds must consequently bear an average debt 
of €83,098. Yet this does not tell the whole 
story, either. In fact, it is less the averages and 
more the tails of distributions which matter for 
financial stability. Heavily indebted households 
whose incomes are insufficient to service their 
debts flee into bankruptcy, leaving their credi -
tors to foot the bill. Central banks therefore 
need to be able to assess how concentrated 
indebtedness is and how much debt is borne 
by those households for which the ratio of pay -
ment obligations to disposable income exceeds 
a given threshold. Information on distributions 
is necessary to breathe life into terms such as 
“loss given default” or “value at risk”. The sec -
tion on mortgage debt below serves to illus -
trate the importance of information on distri -
bution.
Analysis of individual 
 behaviour
To understand individual behaviour, we have to 
look at the dependent variable, such as wealth 
or its components, as well as its possible deter -
minants at the level of the individual. As a case 
in point, the ownership of homes and property 
is much less widespread in Germany than in 
comparable countries in Europe and elsewhere. 
This has important ramifications for the distri -
bution of wealth and debt. In order to explain 
the distribution of home and property owner -Common euro-

ship, we have to observe, at the level of the 
individual, as many determinants for the acqui -
sition of property as possible, and, preferably, 
compare them across countries. Such determi -
nants include income, transaction costs, financ -
ing constraints, tax considerations and family 
structure, along with the significance of inherit -
ance for the transfer of property ownership.
Another example is the well-known stylised 
fact that aggregate household shareholding is 
very low in the light of the risk and return struc -
tures. At least this applies if we refer to the 
standard portfolio selection models. Without 
micro data, we cannot even obtain the funda -
mental insight that these are also threshold ef -
fects – most households in Germany do not 
hold shares, either directly or indirectly. Eco -
nomic researchers can use multivariate distribu -
tions to establish which households hold 
shares, how the value of the wealth tied up in 
shares is distributed and how these two ele -
ments correlate with individual characteristics.
Content and focal point  
of the PHF1
At the heart of the PHF is a detailed breakdown 
of assets and liabilities. The chart above pro -
vides a schematic overview. The PHF contains 
the following modules.
– Household structure
– Socioeconomic characteristics
– Consumption
– Non-financial assets and their financing
– Liabilities
– Businesses and financial assets
– Inheritances and gifts
– Employment
– Old-age provision
– Income
While it shares the common core seen in all 
national HFCS surveys, the German PHF has 
certain distinctive features. Firstly, the survey 
stresses two key themes of German economic policy: pensions and saving. Whereas the 
prototype HFCS largely omits household sav -
ing, the PHF requests information on saving in 
relation to all relevant categories of wealth. But 
the outlook is different as well: while the HFCS 
guidelines only provide for a cross-section, the 
decision to conduct the German survey as a 
panel also allows us to observe the accumula -
tion of assets over the life-cycle.
Three prominent predecessors in Germany 
served as models for the PHF. The Federal Stat -
istical Office’s large-scale Sample Survey of In -
come and Expenditure (Einkommens- und Ver -
brauchsstichprobe, EVS)  also provides an out -

Germany.2 The methodology for recording pri -
vate saving was developed in SAVE, an aca -
demic study organised by MEA in Munich. The 
self-renewing panel structure was borrowed 
from the SOEP ( Sozio-ökonomisches Panel,  or 
Socioeconomic Panel) conducted by DIW Ber -
lin. The PHF merges the successful methodo -
logical traits of these studies in a new set of 
statistics which is conceptually firmly grounded 
in the structure of the household balance sheet 
and is fully comparable with similar surveys in 
all other euro-area countries.3 The PHF’s panel 
dimension, moreover, enables a precise under -
standing of asset formation over time and, on 
this basis, allows sound statements to be made 
about the long-term trend in the distribution of 
wealth.
The design of the survey
Participation in the survey is voluntary. It is de -
signed to be representative of the population. 
Any household in Germany has a given likeli -
hood of making it into the sample. Conversely, 
the probability of being selected can be stated 
for each household in the sample. This is a pre -
condition for ensuring that the determination 
of design weights ist statistically robust. The 
survey’s design ensured that wealthy house -
holds had a higher probability of being selected 
for the sample. They are intentionally overrep -
resented. Wealth is considerably more concen -
trated than income, and a proportional sample 
would contain only a few wealthy households. 
It would thus be impossible to obtain any use -
ful information on many categories of wealth. 
To oversample wealthy households, a relatively 
large number of smaller and medium-sized 
communities with high income tax revenue 
were selected, and in cities the sample also 
used microgeographic information relating to 
street sections, such as purchasing power, 
building type and quality of the residential area.
All participating households will be contacted 
again in the subsequent waves. If the house -
hold composition changes – such as by adult children moving out or through divorce – all 
household members will be tracked. The new 
households created by such splitting-off will be 
added to the panel. Refreshment samples will 
be needed to offset natural reduction in the 
panel size (panel mortality). However, this is 
also a way of taking account of new or under -
represented socio-demographic groups. The 
second wave is currently scheduled for spring 
2014.
The lion’s share of the questionnaire refers to 
the household as a whole. A household mem -
ber with particularly good knowledge of the 
overall household’s financial situation was 
asked these questions in a computer-assisted 
personal interview (CAPI). Moreover, the survey 
also collects information from individual house -
hold members on several issues: income, old-
age provision and employment. For this part of 
the survey, there was also the option of using 
paper versions and an online interface along -
side the CAPI.
The PHF is a data set intended for scientific pur -
poses, and it is also available to external re -
searchers. Before the data are passed on to 
academic users for specific projects, they are 
carefully anonymised to ensure that survey in -
formation cannot be matched with participat -
ing households under any circumstances. The 
applicants and their projects are also vetted. An 
anonymised data set which can be released for 
use by researchers will probably be ready in the 
spring of 2013.Random

2 However, it is impossible to generate the variables of the 
HFCS blueprint using EVS data. The PHF models wealth 
structures and indebtedness in greater detail than the EVS, 
which focuses chiefly on income and expenditure. The EVS 
omits households with a net monthly income of more than 
€18,000. The EVS’ roughly 13,000 households are selected 
using quotas and not at random.
3 It is also highly comparable with the US Federal Reserve 
System’s Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which was a 
key model for the common structure of the European 
HFCS.Deutsche Bundesbank

Field phase and participation
The sampling and field work were carried out 
by the infas Institute, which is based in Bonn. 
The field phase of the first wave ran from Sep -
tember 2010 to July 2011. 20,501 addresses 
were used in total, and 3,565 valid household 
interviews were conducted. The response rate 
was 18.6%.4 It is lower than the response rate 
for directly comparable studies in other coun -
tries and is also somewhat disappointing by 
German standards.
A high non-response rate can indicate a sys -
tematic bias in the sample composition. How -
ever, there is no sign of severe selection bias in 
the PHF survey either after comparison with ex -
ternal statistics or following a statistical study 
of response behaviour. The charts in this sec -
tion compare the population structure data 
from the 2010 microcensus with the composi -
tion of the PHF sample. The PHF households 
are assigned inverse selection probabilities 
given by the sample design (design weights) in 
order to make up for the oversampling of 
wealthy households. The adjacent chart shows 
the age composition of the German population 
according to the microcensus compared with 
the (design-weighted) PHF sample. The young -
est age cohort is somewhat underrepresented 
and the group aged 55 to 74 is somewhat 
overrepresented. The upper chart on page 34 
on household size shows that single-person 
households occur a bit too frequently yet cov -
erage of large households is also good. The 
comparison according to employment status of 
the main income earner in the lower chart on 
page  34 shows clearly that both the unem -
ployed and non-labour force members are 
overrepresented, whereas workers are less well 
represented. Such discrepancies can be re -
solved by adjusting the weights.
The table on page 35 shows the income distri -
bution in the sample, a decisive factor in the 
representativeness of a survey on wealth. In the 
PHF, a household’s total income can be calcu -
lated from the sum of its components, a large percentage of which are even available for indi -
viduals. For comparison purposes, household 
income here, just like in the microcensus, is de -
termined based on the response to a question 
about the household’s total income.5 In order 
to show the impact of oversampling, the table 
shows both the unweighted and the weighted 
composition of the PHF sample. The un -
weighted composition in the second column of 
the table on page  35 is produced by simple 
counting.
This shows clearly that the oversampling of 
wealthy households was actually rather suc -
cessful. The four highest income categories are Comparison

missing.
5 Asking interviewees to name a figure for total income 
produces values which are systematically too low because 
of memory gaps among the respondents. Here, however, 
the focus is on the structural comparison.Deutsche Bundesbank

clearly overrepresented, with the top category 
(total monthly income of €4,500 or more) oc -
curring in the sample more than twice as fre -
quently as in the population at large. If we use 
design weights to neutralise the effect of over -
sampling (third column), this creates a picture 
that is extremely close to the income distribu -
tion seen in the microcensus.
Finally, looking at households’ ownership of 
their main residences is also informative. The 
chart below compares the share of households 
in owner-occupied housing to all households 
and also by household size. Relative to all Ger -
man households in the microcensus, this share 
was 40.9% in 2006. The percentage extrapo -
lated from PHF data using design weights is 
44.2%, indicating a certain selection bias to -
wards homeowners. The chart also shows that 
the bias is attributable mainly to single-person 
households and childless couples.
The design-weighted share of foreigners in the 
PHF is 5.9%, compared with 8.7% in the entire 
population. The composition of countries of 
origin is satisfactory. However, the migrants in 
the sample could well be better integrated into 
the majority population than the migrant pop -
ulation as a whole.
On the whole, the identified selection bias is 
relatively small and can be offset by modifying 
the weights on the basis of statistical models of 
response behaviour and adjusting marginal dis -
tributions for the overall population.
Participants’ response 
 behaviour
Data on wealth are considered extremely sensi -
tive and complex. This makes item non-
response – the fact that even those willing to 
participate do not respond to all questions – a 
particular problem. The reason is not necessar -
ily that participants are unwilling to respond; 
often they do not understand the question or 
do not know the answer themselves. Item non-Item non-

response is frequently systematic, ie correlated 
with the true value of the missing response. For 
instance, someone with no debt whatsoever 
knows it and will also be perfectly willing to say 
so. In that case, debt is correctly entered as 
“0”. An indebted respondent, however, may 
not know the exact amount or may be embar -
rassed to talk about it. This is sufficient for a 
correlation. If we ignore item non-response 
– eg by setting all missing responses to 0 or 
looking only at the responses that are there – 
the mean values will be skewed downward de -
pending on the strength of the correlation be -
tween the true value and willingness to re -
spond. In certain cases, such a bias can be 
mitigated or eliminated by imputation. This 
means replacing missing data with values that 
“fit” the interviewee based on the existing re -
sponses. Imputation in the PHF is explained on 
pages 37 to 39.
In wealth surveys, it is typically data on the 
value of wealth or debt that is most difficult to 
obtain. It is more difficult to give an exact fig -
ure than a simple yes or no answer. In the PHF, 
information on figures can be given at three 
levels. The interviewee is initially asked for an 
exact value. If s/he cannot answer the ques -
tion, s/he is asked to give an upper or lower 
threshold for the value. If this also fails, the in -
terviewee can choose from a list of pre-defined 
ranges. Such information makes the imputa -
tion much more accurate.
The table on page 36 shows item non-response 
to several particularly sensitive questions re -
volving around numerical values. The first col -
umn in the table shows the percentage of re -
sponses which did not state an exact numerical 
value. The second column lists the frequency 
with which neither an exact figure nor a range 
was given. As in other surveys on wealth, it is 
particularly difficult to state the value of an 
existing self-owned business. No response 
whatsoever is given to this question in 12.1% of 
cases. There are also some financial indicators 
which cause difficulty: the value of a house -
hold’s bonds and debt securities is completely Imputation of

missing in around 12.4% of cases in which the 
existence of such instruments is reported. Most 
other questions about values, however, were 
answered considerably more successfully – in -
cluding, rather surprisingly, the questions about 
the level of debt. The incidence of item non-
response to other types of questions was gen -
erally very low.
PHF data: initial impressions
The processing of the survey is currently still in 
progress. The first step is to carefully edit the 
responses for logical consistency and coher -
ence of content, which includes a search for 
“outliers”. This also frequently reveals written 
errors made by the interviewers. These must be 
corrected or, alternatively, the value is set to 
“missing”. Imputation supplements the data 
set with missing data based on conditional 
probability distributions of the relevant vari -
ables. Weights are adjusted to eliminate bias 
caused by the unit non-response of some par -
ticipants. Once enough information on non-
respondents is available, a statistical response 
behaviour model can be used to adjust the 
weights. Any remaining bias can be eliminated 
by making adjustments to the marginal distri -
butions (calibration).The PHF data are therefore still provisional five 
months after completion of the field phase, as 
is usual for such surveys. However, it is already 
possible at this juncture to obtain an impres -
sion of the data base’s performance. It is not 
primarily about estimating large aggregates; 
the financial components of household wealth, 
including debt, are modelled well on the whole 
by the statistics provided by the Bundesbank, 
especially the financial accounts, banking sta -
tistics and securities deposit statistics. Moreo -
ver, the Bundesbank and the Federal Statistical 
Office have jointly compiled a balance sheet for 
the household sector which also includes non-
financial assets.6 The PHF will also be able to fill 
knowledge gaps in the calculation of aggre -
gated asset positions, especially by capturing 
certain market values for business equity in -
vestments in unlisted corporations and for ex -
isting housing. However, the PHF’s true strength 
lies in its ability to break down aggregates by 
population group, to look at size distributions 
and to use interrelationships between variables 
at the level of the individual. Some of this will 
be illustrated in the following paragraphs using 
property ownership and the attendant indebt -
edness as an example.7 The US subprime mort -
gage crisis made it clear just how important it 
is to have a clear picture of how property own -
ership and indebtedness are distributed. When 
the real estate bubble burst, many households 
turned out to be overindebted.

Imputation of the survey data
Item non-response and imputation
The term item non-response is used to de-
scribe the lack of responses to individual 
questions from surveyed households or in-
dividuals. This leads to missing data, with 
which a number of problems are associ-ated. First, standard data analysis tech-niques can generally only be applied to 
complete data sets, and simply omitting all data sets containing missing values can se-
verely diminish and distort the information 
content. Second, the occurrence of item 
non-response is not a random process, but depends rather on the characteristics of the 
household. If this mechanism is not taken into account, this leads to biased estima-
tions for the variables concerned.
A case in point is indebtedness. If overind-
ebted households often tend not to answer such questions, this results in distorted esti-
mations if only the available answers are 
considered. This effect can be signifi  cantly 
reduced by replacing the missing value using a mathematical procedure which simulates the mechanism underlying the 
non-response.
This type of procedure which serves to re-
place missing values using estimated values is known as imputation. All imputation pro-cedures of this kind are based on the “miss-
ing at random” assumption, which states 
that the probability of a missing observation 
can be fully explained using the observed values in the data set. However, it is not 
possible to verify whether this assumption is indeed true. Even if this condition does not hold, imputation can still simulate that par-
ticular share of the mechanism underlying the non-response which can be derived 
from the observed data.Imputation in the PHF
A linear stochastic regression model is used 
for imputing continuous variables (espe-
cially euro amounts) in the PHF. Missing val-
ues are substituted by their best linear pre-
dicted value, plus a normally distributed 
random variable. The prediction equation is
ˆymis=Xˆ+ˆu;ˆuN(0,2I) ;
ˆˆ
=(X X )1Xy ββ σ
where y is the variable to be imputed, ymis is 
an individual missing value, ŷmis is its substi-
tute, n is the number of observed values of 
y, and k is the number of selected regres-
sors for the imputation of y. X is the nxk 
matrix, which is made up of the n values of 
the k regressors. The variance ˆσ2 is esti-
mated using the residuals from the predic-
tion equation.
For the imputation of the value of the 
house, for example, we use regressors 
which allow good predictions, such as the 
value of the total assets of the household as 
well as socio-demographic information, such as age and level of education. If the 
respondent did not report the exact value, 
but specifi  ed an upper or a lower bound for 
the value, the imputation is repeated until 
the substitute value falls into the interval.
Binary variables are imputed in a similar way 
using a linear stochastic model. Binary vari-
ables are often indicator variables, such as 
the question of whether the household 
owns any property. The number of missing values in the PHF resulting from such ques-tions is relatively small.
Hot deck imputation is used for the imput-
ation of categorical variables. Here, a miss-Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
January 2012  
37

ing value is replaced by an observed value 
of another household, which should resem-
ble the household with the missing value as 
much as possible in terms of the selected characteristics. One example to demon-
strate the use of a hot deck procedure is the imputation of the highest level of education 
completed, which can be entered in nine 
different categories in the PHF.
If the regressors are correctly selected, then 
the characteristic features of the distribu-
tion of the imputed variables are retained. 
The retention of the general statistical fea-
tures of the entire data set, especially the 
covariance structure, is the main objective 
of the stochastic imputation and takes pre-
cedence over fi  nding the most probable 
value in each individual case.
The imputation algorithm must refl  ect the 
logical structure of the questionnaire to en-
sure the consistency of the data. This may 
also embrace imputed values for questions 
that were not even asked during the inter-
view. If, for example, the question relating 
to the ownership of property was answered with “don’t know”, the entire property sec-
tion of the questionnaire is left out during 
the interview. If the initial question is im-puted as “yes”, then the subsequent 
property-related questions also have to be 
imputed. All imputed values are marked for 
the data users with a special imputation 
fl  ag in the corresponding fl  ag variable.
The signifi  cance of multiple imputationSimple imputation, ie the creation of a sin-
gle imputed data set, does not take into ac-
count the uncertainty of the selected im-
putation model because all the values in the imputed data set are treated like “real” ob-served values. As a consequence, variances and covariances in the imputed data set are 
underestimated. This is why several im-puted data sets are generated – hence the name multiple imputation – whereby every 
missing value is replaced by a number of independently imputed values, known as implicates. This routine is based on the bootstrap procedure. The variance of a multiply imputed data set is calculated as the sum of the weighted variances within each implicate and the variance between the implicates (the latter is not taken into consideration in the simple imputation 
method). Five imputed data sets are gener-
ated in the PHF. The inclusion of fi  ve data sets is a generally accepted norm, which has been agreed on between the central 
banks participating in the HFCS.
The imputation of the PHF data is done it-
eratively. In the fi  rst iteration, all imputed variables containing missing values are re-
placed by a value which is estimated purely 
on the basis of the observed data. The 
second iteration and all following iterations 
recalculate these values in the light of the 
previous iteration, thereby building a com-
plete data set without missing values in the predictors as a basis for the imputation. The 
key criterion for the convergence of the 
procedure is that the variance between the 
implicates is small in comparison with the 
variance within the implicates. A suffi   cient 
convergence is generally achieved after six 
iterations.
During the imputation and analysis of the 
results, problems frequently become appar-ent in the data, such as inadmissible or im-plausible values, which are then rectifi  ed in the course of a further editing procedure. A two-way process therefore occurs between 
editing and imputation, which has a posi-
tive impact on the quality of the data.Deutsche Bundesbank

Ownership of the main residence is shown sep -
arately. In addition, the table displays the com -
position of housing wealth both by type of 
property and also by their owners’ membership 
of various socio-demographic groups. With re -
gard to the property type, a distinction is first 
made between owner-occupied housing (main 
residence) and other property, with ownership 
of the main residence broken down further 
into houses, flats and mixed-use property (such 
as a residential house with a shop on the 
ground floor or a farm building). The composi -
tion of owners is broken down by age group, 
labour market status, household income and 
number of children below the age of 18. In the 
table on page 41, the average gross value of 
housing and property wealth, the average net 
value (ie less existing mortgage loans) and the 
relevant medians are calculated for property 
owners in the population at large and those in 
certain groups of the population. It should be 
noted that these calculations include the entire 
housing wealth of a household, which can also encompass multiple properties. The table also 
shows the percentage of owner-occupied 
housing either inherited or received as a gift. 
The estimated averages are a good fit with the 
sectoral balance sheet compiled by the Federal 
Statistical Office and the Bundesbank: house -
holds’ housing wealth extrapolated from the 
PHF data amounts to €5,024 billion (including 
the value of business property belonging to the 
self-employed and sole proprietors), while the 
estimate in the sectoral balance sheet is €5,197 
billion for residential housing and land under -
lying buildings and structures.8
In the case of property ownership as a whole, 
as well as owner-occupied housing, there is a 
kind of life-cycle. Home ownership is low Ownership rate

Finally, an example may prove helpful. As 
part of the module focusing on fi  nancial assets, respondents were asked to specify the value of any tradable shares that they 
own. A total of 646 respondents said that 
their household owns shares. Of these re-
spondents, 553 answered the question re-
lating to the value of these assets by speci-fying a fi  gure, 27 opted to select an interval and 66 did not provide any further details.
Missing values will not cause any major 
problems as long as intervals are available. 
Either the interval midpoint can be used for analytical purposes or a value in the interval can be simulated based on the assumption of equal distribution. By contrast, if no fur-
ther information is provided, this can lead 
to severe bias.The imputation algorithm provides proxy values in all 66 cases where no interval is 
available. The 580 remaining values yield a 
mean (unweighted) portfolio value of 
€67,026, which is signifi  cantly higher than 
the median of €14,100 owing to a number 
of very high realisations. The 66 imputed 
values lie closer to the mode, with a mean 
average of €44,645 and a median of 
€8,875. Overall, the mean and the median 
amount to €64,739 and €13,000 respect-ively after imputation. The weighted vol-
ume of equity holdings (after extrapolation) 
amounts to €126.9 billion before imput-
ation and €135.2 billion after imputation.

(2010), op cit. The figures for the sectoral balance sheet 
include property owned by private not-for-profit organisa -
tions and the property owned by self-employed and sole-

among the young cohort and rises with ad -
vancing age, peaking in the 60 to 64 age 
bracket. Inheritance is also a significant factor 
in explaining this finding, alongside purchasing. 
Among households where the main income 
earner is 50 or older, the percentage of owner-
occupied housing surpasses the 50% mark. 
Unless this is caused by cohort effects, most 
Germans will be able to fulfil their dream of 
owning their own home at least sometime 
later in life.
If property-owning households are grouped by 
employment status of the main income earner, 
certain socio-economic patterns come to the surface. Property ownership predominates 
among the self-employed and entrepreneurs, 
at 67.9%. The average value of owned prop -
erty is also highest in this group. Civil servant 
households are not far behind, with a home 
and property ownership rate of 65.2%. Civil 
servants are also on a level pegging with the 
self-employed and entrepreneurs in terms of 
median gross housing wealth, yet the mean 
value of their homes and property is much 
lower – the very expensive properties are miss -
ing from this employment category. Home-
owning employees possess almost the same 
mean amount of housing and property wealth 
as civil servants; however, property ownership … the self-

is less widespread among employees, at 46.2%. 
The ownership ratio among households headed 
by workers is even lower, yet at 37.1% it is still 
well above that of the unemployed (9.4%). The 
high incidence of property ownership among 
non-labour force households is surprising at 
first glance. This effect is determined by the 
home ownership ratio of pensioners; more 
than half of this group own their own homes.
Breaking down households by household in -
come reveals a close correspondence between 
income and property ownership – including 
with regard to the mean and median values of 
homes and property. Finally, having children in the household also appears to favourably influ -
ence the tendency to acquire property. The 
ownership rate for the main residence is under 
40% for households with one child or none 
whatsoever but increases sharply at two or 
more children.
Inheritances and gifts
A total of 23% of households that own their 
main residence obtained it as either an inherit -
ance or a gift. This demonstrates the major im -

distribution of wealth, given the large values … among

often associated with property ownership. In -
heritances and gifts can also be an instrument 
of social compensation. The table on page 41 
shows that low-income and unemployed 
households also own property, and a dispro -
portionately high percentage of these house -
holds acquired this property as an inheritance 
or a gift. Naturally, the percentage of inherit -
ance is higher for older property owners.
Mortgages
If the property is not an inheritance or a gift, 
the flip side of property ownership is its finan -cing. Purchasing property often involves many 
years of paying off mortgages. Since questions 
regarding debt are considered sensitive, the 
statistical analysis begins with validation of the 
PHF data on property financing.
According to the Bundesbank’s borrowers stat -
istics, at the end of 2010 a total of €965 billion 
in loans had been granted to households to fi -
nance the purchase of residential property. Of 
this figure, €799 billion were mortgage loans 
with an original maturity of more than five 
years and €166 billion were either unsecured 
loans or mortgages with an original maturity of 
five years or less (see adjacent chart). These fig -
ures correspond closely with the PHF data for 
households. Extrapolated using provisional an -
alytic weights, the PHF data produce a figure of 
around €918 billion in loans for house pur -
chase, with longer-term mortgages making up 
around €764 billion and unsecured lending and 
shorter-term mortgages together accounting 
for another €155 billion or so.9
In the tables on the following pages, the assets 
from housing and property wealth are there -
fore contrasted with liabilities in the form of 
loans of all maturities secured by mortgage. 
The table on page 43 presents an overview of 
mortgage loans. 44.8% of property owners 
have a mortgage loan to pay off. This percent -
age is naturally higher for younger households. 
Only 19.6% of pensioners who own homes 
and property are still paying off a mortgage, 
and in the case of main residences, the figure is 
only 16.2%. For a wide area of the income dis -
tribution, the percentage of property owners 
owing money on mortgage loans is larger for Comparison

Only 26.0% of their total volume can be reproduced by the 
PHF. At 17.1%, the share that can be reproduced is even 
smaller for the self-employed and entrepreneurs than for 
economically dependent households, which still report 
34.4% of their other borrowing. The gap may therefore be 
due in part to problems drawing a line between the private

higher-earning households. This is not a con -
tradiction in terms since a large number of 
lower-income property owners are inheritors.
The average outstanding amount of mortgage 
loans (among households that report them) is 
€117,461. The conditional averages vary be -
tween the population groups in the study in 
the expected manner. Lower-income house -
holds have smaller outstanding mortgages 
than higher-income ones, and younger mort -
gage holders have larger mortgage debts than 
older groups. In both cases, this is a conse -
quence of intertemporal budget constraints.Distribution of housing 
wealth by size
It is possible to examine how housing wealth is 
distributed by recording, at household level, 
gross housing wealth and the attendant mort -
gages. The table on page 41 shows the distri -
bution of gross and net housing wealth by 
socio-demographic group, and the table above 
draws attention to the fact that the significance 
of mortgage loans varies widely between the 
different groups. The table on page 44 brings

values are ordered by size, and the rows show 
nine deciles, the 95% quantile and the 97.5% 
quantile. The first decile is the value that is less 
than or equal to the lowest 10% of values; the 
second decile is equal to or greater than the 
lowest 20%, and so on. The 95% quantile and 
97.5% quantile are exceeded by only 5% and 
2.5% of observed values respectively. The reli -
ability of the 97.5% quantile is limited owing to 
the low number of data points. The figures are 
based on the sum total of all surveyed house -
holds in Germany which own homes and prop -
erty. All these households have a positive gross 
housing wealth, but not all hold mortgages. 
The first five deciles therefore show a value of 
zero for mortgage loans. The averages in the 
first row for outstanding mortgage debt and 
the interest rate burden refer to all property 
owners, including those with no debt.
Median gross housing wealth (among owners) 
stands at €200,000 and median net housing 
wealth at €152,500, underlining the major im -portance of property for household wealth. 
The third column is not calculated as the differ -
ence of the first two: the distributions given in 
the columns are not connected with one an -
other, and the quantile values do not refer to 
the same households. The values for the 95% 
and 97.5% quantiles show once again that ef -
forts to include wealthy households in the PHF 
were not in vain.
Wealth is more concentrated than incomes, 
and the table describes inequality also within 
the category of property owners. The last 
decile, ie the 10% of property owners with the 
largest gross housing wealth, hold 40.2% of 
overall housing wealth. Setting the bar at the 
top 20% of property owners (or around 9% of 
all households if non-owners are also included) 
increases the figure to 55.3%. Net housing 
wealth is even slightly more concentrated: the 
relevant values are 43.9% and 59.9% respec -
tively.Inequality

The fourth column contains interest payments 
as a percentage of household income, ar -
ranged by their size. The higher quantiles in this 
column should be treated with particular cau -
tion since the household income in the denom -
inator is potentially flawed and extremes at the 
tails of the distributions could also reflect meas -
urement errors. With that proviso, there is 
good news at the end of the table. Mortgage 
interest rates have been rather low for quite 
some time now, and this has impacted broadly 
on the interest rate burden on existing loans. 
Values for the interest rate burden near the tails 
of the distributions still seem to be manage -
able. The finances of private mortgage holders 
in Germany and the recoverability of their loans 
will therefore be in good shape if interest rates remain at their current level. The survey data, 
however, can also be used to simulate the ef -
fect of a change in this interest rate level, since 
they include information on interest rate fix -
ation periods and maturities.
Outlook
The PHF is a new and very fruitful resource for 
monetary policymakers and researchers alike. 
Work in 2012 will be dedicated not only to fi -
nalising the data base but also to carrying out 
a targeted evaluation in order to draw a precise

The European single market in payments 
nearing completion
For around ten years, the European Union, the Eurosystem and the European banking industry 
have been working on creating the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) in Europe.1 The project has 
now reached a key milestone: end-dates have been set for migration to SEPA. National payment 
schemes for credit transfers and direct debits will be replaced by the new SEPA payment instru -
ments from February 2014 onwards. These deadlines have been outlined in an EU regulation 
scheduled to come into force in the second quarter of 2012. The formal endorsement by the 
European Parliament and the European Council is still pending. The regulation specifies technical 
requirements for credit transfers and direct debits in euro that do not apply solely to interbank 
transactions but also directly to bank customers.
However, alongside credit transfers and direct debits, cashless payments also encompass card 
payments and new innovative procedures for payments via the internet or by mobile phone, 
which show considerable market potential. To boost the synergy effects of a single European 
market in this area too, politicians are paying increasing attention to these market segments. 
With the current public consultation on a Green Paper,2 the European Commission is starting to 
analyse the problem areas with a focus on engendering greater competition, transparency, innov -
ation and security as well as enhancing customer confidence.

EU stipulates end-dates for 
national payment schemes
It was the EU’s Lisbon Agenda of 2000 which 
laid the foundations for the creation of a single 
European market for cashless payments (Single 
Euro Payments Area: SEPA). Aimed at increas -
ing competition and efficiency, the Agenda 
sought to introduce uniform procedures and 
standards for the settlement of euro-
denominated payments on a Europe-wide 
basis. To this end, the European banking indus -
try set up the European Payments Council (EPC) 
in 2002. The EPC set out to develop and intro -
duce SEPA schemes in Europe based on a mar -
ket-driven approach. The European Union sup -
ported this process and ensured that there was 
a common European legal framework, particu -
larly by means of the Payment Services Direc -
tive.3 This was supplemented by regulation (EC) 
No 2560/2001 of the European Parliament and 
of the Council on cross-border payments in the 
Community,4 which ensured that cross-border 
euro payments of no more than €50,000 in -
curred the same fees as those for domestic 
euro payments.
Around 4,500 payment service providers5 
across Europe have been offering the SEPA 
Credit Transfer Scheme (SCT) since 28 January 
2008. Major changes from the customer’s per -
spective include the need to use the IBAN (In -
ternationaI Bank Account Number) to identify 
the account concerned and the BIC (Business 
Identifier Code) to identify the payment service 
provider. The BIC is an 11-digit internationaly 
standardised bank code that can uniquely iden -
tify credit institutions across the globe. The 
IBAN is somewhat longer than a conventional 
German account number but is largely com -
posed of familiar elements, such as the bank 
sort code and the account number. The only 
new features are the standardised country 
code (DE for Germany) and the two-character 
check digit. For the general public, this means 
an initial period of adapting to the new system, 
which has met with some criticism, especially 
in Germany. However, past experience in Ger -many, such as with the postcode changeover, 
has shown that, by and large, changes of this 
kind are quickly mastered. Added to this, the 
banking industry has a vested interest in mak -
ing sure that the transition runs as smoothly as 
possible for its customers. Other countries have 
already successfully completed this process.
The SEPA Direct Debit Scheme (SDD) has been 
available from the majority of European pay -
ment service providers since 2  November 
2009.6 Along with the SEPA Core Direct Debit 
Scheme (SDD Core), they offer a scheme that is 
tailored exclusively for business customer trans -
actions, the SEPA Business to Business Direct 
Debit Scheme (SDD B2B). With effect from No -
vember 2010, the aforementioned regulation 
on cross-border payments in the Community 
has required all euro-area payment service pro -
viders to be reachable for the settlement of 
SDD Core, provided they can also be reached 
for national euro-denominated direct debits. In 
the case of the SEPA direct debit, the payer’s 
and the payee’s accounts are likewise identified 
by the IBAN, while the payment service pro -
vider is indicated by the BIC. In contrast to the 
German Elektronische Lastschriftverfahren  
(ELV), a one-off direct debit scheme used by 
merchants, the SDD Scheme requires the pay -
ment service provider to observe certain dead -
lines. One-off or first-time SDD Core direct deb -
its should be presented to the debtor bank five 
business days prior to the due date, while any 
subsequent direct debits have to be submitted 
two days beforehand. As regards the SDD B2B 
direct debits, the relevant lead time is one busi -
ness day.Market-driven

The market-driven approach to implementing 
SEPA has not proven to be particularly effec -
tive. Utilisation of SEPA schemes has been rela -
tively limited since the outset. Even so, the 
share of SEPA credit transfers among all euro-
area credit transfers settled by clearing houses 
has risen and now stands at 22.7%. The in -
creased take-up since the end of 2010 is in 
large part attributable to the ongoing migra -
tion to SEPA credit transfers on the part of pub -
lic administrations. Recourse to the SEPA direct 
debit has been much more modest. The share 
of SEPA Core direct debits among all direct 
debits settled via clearing houses stood at just 
0.2% in November 2011.
The low level of market penetration achieved 
by the SEPA schemes bears witness to the fact 
that the European banking industry has been 
unable of its own accord to achieve the desired 
critical mass that would have led to the na -
tional payment schemes being replaced. In the 
absence of any firmly stipulated dates for the 
national payment schemes to cease operation, 
it was difficult to set the SEPA process in mo -
tion. However, the industry could not agree on 
a date for discontinuing the national payment 
schemes. This prompted the EPC to join forces 
with a host of other interest groups during a 
European Commission public consultation in 
the summer of 2010 and call for binding dead -
lines to be set through regulation.
In December 2010, the European Commission 
presented a “Proposal for a Regulation estab -
lishing technical requirements for credit trans -
fers and direct debits in euros and amending 
Regulation (EC) No 924/2009” (SEPA Migration 
Regulation).7
Upon completing their negotiations, which 
went on for almost a year, the European Com -
mission, the European Council and the Euro -
pean Parliament finally presented a significantly 
modified draft regulation. This set out binding 
technical requirements for euro-denominated 
credit transfers and direct debits that broadly 
mirrored the requirements stipulated by the EPC in its rulebooks for SEPA credit transfers 
and for SEPA direct debits, the overall conse -
quence being that only the SEPA schemes are 
valid for use after the specified end-dates. The 
existing national schemes typically do not fulfil 
these criteria. The SEPA Regulation is scheduled 
to enter into force during the second quarter of 
2012.8
Laid out in binding form, the various end-dates 
for the national payment schemes are the bed -
rock of the Regulation. From February 2014 
onwards, the payment schemes offered by EU 
countries for the settlement of euro-
denominated credit transfers and direct debits 
shall be required to meet the criteria set out in 
the Regulation as a matter of course. Defining 
a binding end-date for the national payment 
schemes ensures that there is clarity for each Low level

and every actor involved. This is necessary be -
cause the existing non-binding framework for 
changeover has thus far failed to motivate a 
meaningful number of companies and public 
administrations to start migrating their pay -
ment schemes. The specification of end-dates 
makes it possible to plan with certainty. It also 
makes it necessary to forge ahead with the 
changeover process. The resulting momentum 
gives good reason to expect a continued steady 
increase in the level of usage of SEPA credit 
transfers as well as of SEPA direct debits in the 
run-up to the end-date.
In addition to setting mandatory deadlines for 
the national credit transfer and direct debit 
schemes, the SEPA Regulation also enhances 
the rights enjoyed by the consumer. For in -
stance, it awards account holders additional 
rights that protect their accounts from im -
proper direct debit transactions. A direct debit 
may not be executed, for example, if it exceeds 
a certain amount or if the beneficiary is not in -
cluded on a list of recognised payees.
Boasting a 48.2% share of transactions in the 
euro area, ie 8.7 billion direct debits annually, 
Germany is by far the most significant actor 
when it comes to euro-denominated direct 
debits.9 For a long time there was no answer to 
the question of how collection authorisations pre-issued for execution via the German direct 
debit scheme (“Einzugsermächtigungslast -
schriftverfahren”)  could be adapted for use un -
der the SEPA direct debit mandate. This is be -
cause (legacy) collection authorisations issued 
by the payer for the benefit of the payee do 
not contain a payer instruction telling the pay -
ment service provider to honour the direct 
debit, which is vital for the SEPA direct debit 
mandate to be valid. Upon migrating to the 
SEPA Direct Debit Scheme, direct debit credi -
tors would therefore have had to collect a 
whole new set of mandates. The Bundesbank 
has repeatedly emphasised that legal certainty 
is an essential prerequisite for any solution to 
this problem.
In its judgment of 20 July 2010 (XI ZR 236/07), 
the Federal Court of Justice outlined a way for -
ward for the banking industry to convert exist -
ing collection authorisations and thus make 
them compatible with the SEPA direct debit 
mandate by amending the General Terms and 
Conditions that apply to the relationship be -
tween the payer and his payment service pro -
vider. For its part, the banking industry has al -

tor’s General Terms and Conditions, and these 
modified conditions are set to become effec -
tive on 9 July 2012.
The SEPA Regulation also stipulates that, in the 
absence of any national legislation or contrac -
tual agreement concerning the validity of direct 
debit mandates, all pre-issued national man -
dates (eg in Germany: collection authorisation) 
will remain valid and that upon granting a 
payee collection authorisation, the payer is au -
tomatically instructing his payment service pro -
vider to honour any direct debit presented by 
the payee.
This provides the basis for a legally sound con -
version of existing collection authorisations to 
SEPA direct debit mandates and in so doing has 
removed a major obstacle to smooth SEPA mi -
gration in Germany. It may be assumed that 
the concerns of some important users of the 
direct debits (eg insurance providers and pub -
lishers of newspapers, journals and periodicals) 
have therefore been allayed.
When drawing up the SEPA Regulation, all of 
the parties involved attached great importance 
to making the changeover as consumer-friendly 
as possible. With this in mind, the SEPA Regula -
tion incorporates several requirements aimed at 
realising this objective. These go well beyond 
the scope of the requirements contained in the 
EPC’s SEPA rulebooks for credit transfers and 
direct debits.
The designated rulebooks for the SEPA schemes 
require the user to specify both the IBAN and 
the BIC as the basis for identifying an account. 
However, since any given IBAN already con -
tains the information needed to identify the 
payment service provider, it is difficult to con -
vince the bank customer of the need to specify 
both codes. Thanks to the SEPA Regulation, 
with effect from 1  February 2016 customers 
will no longer be mandatorily required to give 
the BIC. In the case of national payments, this 
provision shall take effect as early as 1 February 
2014, unless the member state utilises the de -ferral option afforded by the SEPA Regulation, 
thereby granting itself an exception. Much of 
the German banking industry has already sig -
nalled that it would have no qualms about im -
plementing the “IBAN only” model for national 
payments by 1 February 2014.
In addition, member states can authorise pay -
ment service providers to continue to accept 
the conventional account identifiers (ie the ac -
count number and bank sort code in the case 
of Germany) from their customers up to 1 Feb -
ruary 2016. In such cases, payment service pro -
viders would be obliged to provide a free of 
charge and secure service for conversion to 
IBAN. During the negotiations, the German 
government emphatically argued for the intro -
duction of just such a conversion tool. There is 
therefore good reason to assume that German 
legislators will take advantage of this option. 
Together with the “IBAN only” model, this 
could make a significant contribution to ensur -
ing a smooth migration to SEPA.
The SEPA Regulation also provides for the tried 
and tested electronic direct debit system (ELV) 
that is widely used in the German retail sector 
to continue to be used up to an end-date of 
1  February 2016. Under the electronic direct 
debit system, payment is effected using a pay -
ment card at the cash desk. This generates a 
collection authorisation slip which the cus -
tomer then signs. Operating as a rival to guar -
anteed card payment schemes, in 2010 the ELV 
had a 12.3% market share of retail transactions 
in terms of value.10 The envisaged deferral pro -
vision ought to give retailers and the banking 
industry in Germany enough time to draw up a 
SEPA-compatible alternative to the aforemen -
tioned procedure, which evolved over time.
In May 2011, the Bundesbank and the Federal 
Ministry of Finance set up the German SEPA 
Council to further support the SEPA project.

the SEPA migration process. Its mission is to es -
tablish common positions towards SEPA imple -
mentation in Germany by strengthening the 
dialogue between the banking industry and 
end users and by promoting consensus.
Aided in its design by various market consult -
ations, the SEPA Regulation, as it now stands, 
offers an essentially sound and stable founda -
tion for the future of payments settlement in 
Europe. Assuming there is sufficient harmonisa -
tion at the European level, the various options 
for individual member states offered by the 
SEPA Regulation take adequate account of na -
tional particularities and thus allow time for the 
necessary changeover process to occur. This 
also applies to the extended deadline for multi -
lateral interchange fee (MIF) arrangements for 
national direct debit transactions, which is sig -
nificant from the point of view of several other 
countries (including France). The MIF is a stand -
ardised fee paid by the payee’s bank to the 
payer’s bank. From the perspective of competi -
tion law, transaction-related interbank fees are 
deemed not permissible as they constitute a 
hidden price element that is ultimately passed 
on and borne by the submitter. As of 1 Febru -
ary 2017, the SEPA Regulation shall therefore 
prohibit the levying of transaction-related inter -
bank fees on national direct debits, which is in 
any case not practised today in Germany.
Further diversification  
on the markets
The SEPA Regulation sets out basic require -
ments relating to credit transfer and direct 
debit transactions which are capable of sur -
mounting the market isolation caused by na -
tional barriers within Europe and of fostering 
competition in the internal market. Thanks to 
this aspect, it will be possible for payment serv -
ice providers to further expand their range of 
services. From a technical standpoint, the com -
mon standards introduced by the EPC on the 
basis of ISO  20022 and contained in the SEPA 
Implementation Guidelines serve as a spring -board for further services relating to SEPA pay -
ments. Hence, the SEPA rulebooks, which de -
scribe the individual SEPA schemes, envisage 
not just the basic schemes themselves but also 
optional elements. These optional compo -
nents, which have to be licensed by the EPC, 
are designed to satisfy the wishes of specific 
user groups. Payment service providers can de -
cide for themselves whether they wish to offer 
such additional services. They are also at liberty 
to set the relevant prices. In particular, two op -
tional services that are already available have 
the potential to ensure that adequate account 
is taken of the interests of certain user groups 
even after migration to SEPA.
With regard to SEPA direct debits, in response 
to a special request from parts of the German 
banking industry, the EPC has sanctioned an 
option allowing the SEPA Core direct debit lead 
time to be shortened to one business day, ef -
fective from 17 November 2012. This step could 
result in a closer alignment with the German 
direct debit scheme under which a direct debit 
is honoured by the payer’s payment service 
provider immediately upon presentation. Par -
ticularly for first-time and one-off transactions, 
this option has its benefits as the payee can 
expect to be provided with liquidity more 
quickly. Public administrations charged with 
collecting taxes and charges or levying customs 
duties have shown a particularly keen interest 
in using a SEPA direct debit structured along 
these lines. A shorter lead time ought also to 
be of interest to insurance corporations or in -
vestment companies, for example in connec -
tion with the settlement of securities purchases. 
The German banking industry is currently con -
sidering whether to support this option in Ger -
many and, if so, in what manner. However, in 
order to ensure that any such additional serv -
ices are used efficiently, universal reachability 
must be guaranteed, at least within Germany. 
This could be realised through contractual ar -
rangements between the payment service pro -
viders, for example in the form of payment op -
eration agreements which are commonplace in 
the German banking industry.Exercise

Furthermore, the EPC’s SEPA Direct Debit 
Scheme Rulebook also offers the option to 
 issue mandates created through the use of 
electronic channels – often referred to as 
e-mandates. This e-mandate is designed to fa -
cilitate the electronic, ie paperless, generation 
of a direct debit mandate. The SEPA direct debit 
could then develop into a legally watertight 
payment instrument, especially in the ever 
growing field of e-commerce, suitable for use 
throughout Europe. One major drawback when 
using the current German direct debit scheme 
for domestic internet transactions is that, con -
trary to the procedural rules, no written issu -
ance of a collection authorisation is involved. 
An e-mandate could eradicate this loophole. 
Up to now, the e-mandate model has not been 
implemented in a single member state. Prior to 
the national procedures being replaced in Feb -
ruary 2014, it is incumbent on the European 
banking industry to devise a sustainable univer -
sal solution.Future of the European 
 payment card market
The use of payment cards is steadily increasing. 
Between 2008 and 2010, the number of pay -
ment transactions made by credit or debit card 
in Germany rose by an annual average of 
7.7%.11 The German market was thus ahead of 
the euro area as a whole, which recorded a 
three-year average of 6.8%. However, this indi -
cates that there is still potential for growth in 
Germany. Indeed, in 2010 just 15.5% of all 
cashless payments in Germany were made us -
ing a card, as opposed to the United Kingdom 
and France where the corresponding shares 
were 53.2% and 43.3% respectively. The per 
capita levels of usage paint an even starker pic -
ture of these national differences. While users 
in Germany were responsible for slightly fewer 
than 33 card payments each, the per capita The e-mandate

Steady rise in

The global ISO 20022 standard 1 is a univer-
sal model for developing international mes-
sage standards for fi  nancial services and is 
based on XML (eXtensible Markup Lan-
guage), a widely used syntax for electronic 
communication.
The European Payments Council (EPC) spe-
cifi  ed the SEPA message formats on the basis of the ISO 20022 standard. For this 
purpose, the EPC selected the message for-
mats suitable for the SEPA schemes (SEPA credit transfer and SEPA direct debit) from 
the ISO 20022 standard and adjusted these 
to the needs of European payment service 
providers. The specifi  cation of these adjust-
ments is outlined in the Implementation Guidelines applicable for the respective 
SEPA scheme. The underlying processes, on 
the other hand, are described in the Rule-
books of the respective SEPA schemes.During the course of the migration to the SEPA schemes, clearing and settlement in-
frastructures for the processing of payments 
were adjusted to process ISO 20022/XML messages. A migration of additional pay-ment messages to ISO 20022/XML stand-ards, for instance those relating to the clearing of card transactions, would make 
sense as it would allow such transactions to 
be processed via these infrastructures and 
thus enable higher economies of scale. On the whole, applying ISO 20022 standards to 
the SEPA schemes could spark a trend  towards a global-level adoption of these 
standards and serve as the basis for further innovations.

rate for France was 114 and in the United King -
dom it was as high as 142.
Unlike the market for credit transfers and direct 
debits, the market for card payments is charac -
terised by the much larger number of actors 
involved in the processing of payments as well 
as by a plethora of different procedures and 
systems. This results in a far greater degree of 
complexity, which complicates efforts to har -
monise payments operations at the European 
level.
Settling a card payment requires the involve -
ment of several parties on both sides of the 
equation. Apart from the card-issuing bank, 
the cardholder, the acquirer and the card ac -
ceptor, a host of other service providers can be 
involved in the processing of a card payment. 
Moreover, the manufacturers of the cards and 
terminals are a further example of actors in the 
card payment market who are obliged to con -figure their products according to the different 
national standards that have applied thus far.
The European card payment market remains 
largely dominated by national card schemes. In 
many European countries, these national card 
schemes (notably the Girocard in Germany and 
Cartes Bancaires in France) enjoy a strong mar -
ket position. The banking industry of any given 
country therefore usually issues cards that are 
compatible with the national card schemes 
used in that country. In spite of this fact, the 
big international card payment schemes (par -
ticularly MasterCard and VISA), which provide 
not just credit cards but also debit cards (nota -
bly Maestro and V-Pay) via the card-issuing in -
stitutions, are gaining more and more ground 
in national markets across Europe. Attempts to 
create a Europe-wide card scheme have thus 
far failed to go any further than just the plan -
ning and pilot phase. The Euro Alliance of Pay -
ments Schemes (EAPS) constitutes an excep -
tion. However, handling no more than around High degree of

2 million transactions in 2010, this scheme has 
grown at a very limited pace up to now.
Unlike with credit transfers and direct debits, 
the EPC has not yet been able to reach agree -
ment on a detailed rulebook for a SEPA card 
payment scheme. In Europe at present, numer -
ous different requirements relating to the set -
tlement of card payments are set by the na -
tional and international card scheme providers 
in the form of technical specifications. This 
makes it difficult for new providers to gain a 
foothold in the market and for national service 
providers to introduce cross-border services for 
the settlement of card payments. In most cases, 
this means that card acceptors have a limited 
choice in terms of the pool of potential con -
tractual partners.
To help overcome this inadequacy, it is envis -
aged that functional and security-related re -
quirements will be defined by the “SEPA Cards 
Standardisation Volume – Book of Require -
ments” (“the Volume”) at the European level. 
This work is the responsibility of the Cards 
Stakeholders Group, which is made up of rep -
resentatives from all of the key sectors involved 
in the settlement of card payments (banks, card 
schemes, processors, merchants and manufac -
turers). However, owing to the divergent inter -
ests of those involved, there has been no dis -
cernible progress in reaching agreement on the 
universal SEPA specifications needed for the 
practical implementation of the requirements.
Just as with standardisation, efforts to harmon -
ise the certification of cards and terminals for 
the European market have been fraught with 
difficulty. For instance, manufacturers operat -
ing on a pan-European basis are forced to ob -
tain different certificates in the respective 
member states. There are therefore plans to es -
tablish a SEPA (Security) Certification Frame -
work. Based on a set of harmonised security 
requirements, test laboratories are to be used 
to evaluate cards and terminals with the results 
being passed on to recognised agencies for the 
purpose of certification. These certificates would then serve as the basis for licensing 
within the various card schemes, thus enabling 
manufacturers to acquire licences for several 
card schemes using a single certificate
In view of the above, from the Eurosystem per -
spective there should be a particular focus on 
standardisation and certification within the 
card payment market. The European Commis -
sion feels similarly obliged to push for a new 
mix of regulation, self-regulation and competi -
tion enforcement,12 to be drawn up using a 
broad-based Green Paper consultation.13
With respect to competition law, particular at -
tention has been paid in recent years to the 
establishment of a multilateral interchange fee 
(MIF) by the card scheme providers, not just in 
Europe but also in the United States, Canada 
and Australia. This is a fixed, multilaterally 
agreed fee levied on each card payment, to be 
paid by the card acceptor’s bank to the card-
issuing bank as compensation for costs in -
curred by the latter. By and large, this MIF has 
been borne by the card-accepting agent, which 
in most cases means the merchant who, for his 
part, indirectly integrates such charges in the 
price of the goods or services he sells. Until 
now, most contracts signed with the card 
scheme providers have prohibited merchants 
from passing these costs on directly to their 
customers via surcharging when the latter 
make a card payment.
Within Europe, the European Commission ad -
dresses competition-related matters on a case-
by-case basis, in other words where there is 
concrete cause for doubt it will check for com -
pliance with the principles outlined in Article 
101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the Eu -
ropean Union (formerly Article 81 of the EC 
Treaty). In April 2009 (in the case of Master -
Card) and December 2010 (for VISA Europe), 
the Commission adopted the position that a European card 
market neither standardised nor harmonised

MIF of just 0.2% for debit cards (MasterCard 
and VISA) and of 0.3% for credit cards (Master -
Card only) may apply to (cross-border) transac -
tions in the European Economic Area (EEA). 
MasterCard responded to this ruling by lodging 
an appeal with the European Court of First In -
stance, which is still being heard. The Commis -
sion has since declared that its decision was 
taken on the basis of what it calls the “tourist 
test”. This rests upon the idea that a merchant 
should be indifferent to the means of payment 
selected by the customer, meaning that when a 
“one-time” customer, such as a tourist, makes 
a one-time payment using a card this should 
not incur greater costs for the merchant than if 
cash had been used for the transaction. Never -
theless, it is not fully clear exactly which costs 
should be considered on the merchant’s side, 
especially in the case of a cash payment. The 
Commission’s approach toward evaluating the 
appropriateness of MIFs in the area of card 
payments as described here has encountered 
persistent criticism from the market. Uncer -
tainty remains on the part of both existing and 
potential card scheme providers inasmuch as 
they cannot see how a sustainable business 
model is to be determined on such a basis.
Article 52 of the Payment Services Directive 
prohibits payment service providers (including 
card scheme providers) from attempting to pre -
vent payees (merchants) levying an additional 
fee on the payer for the use of a certain pay -
ment instrument (eg card payment). Neverthe -
less, member states are allowed to deviate 
from this rule, as has happened in Germany 
where payment service providers remain able 
to incorporate a surcharging ban in the con -
tracts they conclude with the payees. That said, 
the payee may not be refused the right to offer 
discounts on the use of specific payment in -
struments.
Different card schemes have different policies 
with regard to surcharging. MasterCard per -
mits surcharging throughout the EEA, whereas 
VISA only sanctions it in accordance with na -
tional legislation. The German Girocard scheme is scheduled to allow surcharging as of Febru -
ary 2012. A key argument in favour of authoris -
ing the practice of surcharging is that it can 
ensure a level playing field for the various rival 
payment instruments. On the other hand, its 
oft-criticised uncertainty in terms of the exact 
costs of individual payment instruments, in -
cluding cash, might well constitute an obstacle. 
It is also necessary to consider the reaction of 
customers who might feel cheated if charged 
additional fees, especially in connection with 
large payments. It may be assumed that the ex -
tent to which merchants adopt and apply sur -
charging is strongly dependent on their individ -
ual market position.
Future of innovative 
 payment solutions in Europe
The term “innovative payment instruments” 
encompasses all solutions for initiating pay -
ments that depend on the support of modern 
information and communications technology. 
In most cases, these payments are subsequently 
settled using established payment solutions (eg 
for credit transfers, direct debits, card pay -
ments),14 whereby a general distinction is made 
between solutions designed for the processing 
of payments arising from internet transactions 
(ePayments) and solutions based on the use of 
mobile end-devices (mPayments). However, it is 
not always possible to classify payments clearly 
because, for example, mobile end-devices are 
increasingly also being used to access the inter -
net and make online payments.
At present, special attention is being paid to 
developments in the area of ePayments. Thanks 
to the explosion of e-commerce, this market 
exhibits good growth prospects. In Germany, 
the volume of online transactions has been ris -
ing steadily for years at an average rate of just 
under 10%.15 Nevertheless, recent studies con -Surcharging for

ducted by the European Commission indicate 
that the market in Europe remains stubbornly 
national in character.16
Up to now, the vast majority of e-commerce 
transactions have been paid for using tradi -
tional instruments, in other words on the basis 
of a credit transfer, direct debit or the use of 
payment cards.17 Even so, the growing signifi -
cance of this sales channel also means an in -
creased need for more modern payment solu -
tions that offer the merchant and the customer 
alike a quick and secure means of settlement. 
This is because the unprotected sharing of ac -
count details or a credit card number with a 
merchant when making an online payment by 
direct debit or card intrinsically harbours an in -
creased risk of abuse.
With the exception of the big international 
schemes, such as PayPal, there has been little 
movement in this market to date. In particular, 
no banking industry solution with Europe-wide 
reach exists as yet. In cooperation with the 
EPC, the three online banking-based internet 
payment solutions in operation in the Nether -
lands (iDEAL), Austria (eps) and Germany (gi -
ropay) started work on drawing up a common 
framework for linking their solutions. Neverthe -
less, these efforts came to a halt when the Eu -
ropean Commission initiated an antitrust inves -
tigation into the framework in question.
These efforts by the European Commission re -
flect the fact that the market for payment serv -
ices, and especially for ePayments, is no longer 
monopolised by credit institutions. Rather, 
other providers are attempting to secure a 
foothold. A case in point is the internet search 
engine Google, which already offers payment 
services to its US customers in the form of 
“google wallet” and “google checkout”. In 
Germany, providers of this kind include “sofort -
überweisung.de“ ,  which offers bank customers 
access to online banking-based services and 
has achieved a certain degree of market suc -
cess in the area of online payment settlement.On top of this, a major role has been played by 
the increased endeavours to utilise “Near Field 
Communication” (NFC) technology in conjunc -
tion with various payment instruments. This 
technology enables the contact-free transmis -
sion of data over short distances and can, for 
example, be used to transfer the data needed 
to initiate a payment from the chip contained 
in a debit or credit card to the merchant termi -
nal. This speeds up the payment process and 
makes it more convenient to use. NFC can be 
used not just in combination with a payment 
card but can also, for example, be integrated 
into a mobile phone. Application of this tech -
nology is very much focused on small payments 
where cash is the dominant means of settle -
ment and rapid processing is of great impor -
tance. Since a widespread availability of NFC 
technology would necessitate large-scale in -
vestment on the part of the provider and of the 
accepting party, the hurdles blocking a break -
through are very high.
Against this background, praise is due for the 
German banking industry’s initiative which will 
allow bank cards and savings bank cards to be 
equipped with a contactless payment function 
on the basis of the “Girogo” product from the 
spring of 2012 onwards. In this context, sav -
ings banks and cooperative banking institutions 
will be launching the biggest ever European pi -
lot project for contactless payment in the city 
of Hanover and its environs, with more than 
one million cards being equipped with the rel -
evant NFC technology. This could be the signal 
that merchants need to prompt them to spend 
money on modifying point of sale terminals to 
include the contactless payment function. 
Moreover, the savings banks are planning to 
take advantage of the new cards to offer Apps 
for smartphones which can be used for further 
payment functions. One such function consists 
in using the mobile phone as a point of sale 
instrument or equipping it with a card function. Limited

of the banking

Monthly Report

For this to be achieved, however, the mobile 
phones also need to have an NFC chip. In add -
ition to the savings banks initiative, Germany’s 
big mobile phone operators are also planning 
to extend their “mPass” payment service, which 
is currently available for use only on the inter -
net, by issuing NFC stickers for use in stationary 
outlets. Above and beyond this, some interna -
tional card schemes already offer users in Ger -
many cards featuring contactless technology, 
although take-up is still modest.
Outlook
Around four-fifths of all cashless transactions 
conducted in Germany, which at an annual vol -
ume of more than 17 billion represent the larg -
est payment market in the European Union, 
have to be made compatible with the SEPA 
schemes by 1  February 2014. If this is to be 
achieved, the banks and their customers will 
need to make considerable efforts in the just 
under two years that remain. Their task will be 
to make sure that proper use is made of the 
exceptions granted by EU legislators and that 
the legally prescribed migration dates are not 
undermined as a result. Parallel to this, in order 
to ensure that the imminent integration of the 
European market is customer-friendly in Ger -
many, it will be necessary to intensify commu -
nications with enterprises and consumers. 
There is also a need to deepen the cross-sector 
dialogue between parties on both the supply 
and demand side.
More generally, the impending discontinuation 
of national credit transfer and direct debit 
schemes will lead to a re-arrangement of clas -
sic payments operations in Europe. Overall, us -
ers of payment services in Europe should 
quickly notice the benefits arising from in -
creased competition. Germany will also be 
strongly affected by these developments. Not -
withstanding the strong price competition that 
already exists in the area of retail payments, the 
pressure placed on earnings will continue to in -
crease.Continued strong growth may be expected in 
the area of card payments. However, on ac -
count of the hitherto inadequate level of Euro -
pean harmonisation, this market segment also 
harbours the greatest uncertainties. One con -
tributory factor here is the continued lack of 
clarity in terms of how competition law views 
multilateral interchange fees. From the German 
perspective, the Girocard scheme has proved 
its worth in recent years. New opportunities 
may arise, principally on account of the increas -
ing use of contactless technology. However, 
new technical innovations are no guarantee of 
commercial success. Innovations will only gain 
acceptance if they offer the provider and the 
user benefits compared with existing products 
in terms of their speed, user friendliness, price 
and level of security. The same holds true for 
the uptake of mobile phone-based payment 
procedures. Nor will it be possible to speak of 
success until the user has access to a suffi -
ciently wide range of applications, subject to 
the achievement of a critical mass.
With regard to the direction in which payment-
related innovations are headed, special note 
should be taken of the increasing importance 
of non-banks in this market segment. On the 
one hand, there are the mobile phone provid -
ers who develop payment services. On the 
other, there are the internet service providers 
who focus on enhancing stationary outlet serv -
ices. However, since users place much greater 
trust in the banking industry as an established 
provider of secure payment services, many of 
the non-banks now extending their reach into 
the market might find it worthwhile to enter 
into cooperative ventures. At the same time, 
due account should be taken of the fact that 
technological progress is likely to bring about a 
significant convergence of card, mobile phone 
and online payment solutions.
A consistent and balanced regulatory frame -
work is crucial to developments here. For one 
thing, it is necessary to ensure a level playing 
field for banks and non-banks alike, whereby 
the requirements regarding the security of pay -Deutsche Bundesbank

ment systems have to be sufficiently strict to 
retain the confidence of the general public in 
the payment instruments used. For another, 
whatever balance is struck between coopera -
tion and competition among the various par -ties involved needs to guarantee that economic 
incentives and the chances of a successful up -
grade of European payment systems are main -
tained and, if possible, enhanced.Deutsche Bundesbank
