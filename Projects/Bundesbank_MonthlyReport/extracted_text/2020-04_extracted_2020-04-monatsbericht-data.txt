Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The coronavirus pandemic and the measures 
taken to contain it have plunged the German 
economy into a severe recession. Especially in 
some consumption-  related services, the pan -
demic led to a widespread cessation of eco -
nomic activity from mid- March onwards. Other 
sectors of the economy, such as the automo -
tive sector, also experienced significant declines 
in output in the second half of March. This 
means that the first quarter of 2020 is likely to 
have seen a broad- based and steep decline in 
aggregate output. Moreover, the economic 
constraints must be expected to have a consid -
erably greater impact in the second quarter. At 
present, it is all but impossible to tell with any 
degree of certainty how large the decline in 
overall economic activity will eventually be. The 
severity of the recession will depend crucially 
on the timing and scope available for a further 
relaxation of the containment measures put in 
place to combat the pandemic and on when 
and to what extent they can be replaced by in -
struments that place less of a strain on the 
economy.
An initial tentative easing of the containment 
measures has already been announced. Until a 
clinical solution (such as vaccination) is avail -
able, it is likely that substantial restrictions will 
still have to remain in place, however. For that 
reason, a rapid and robust recovery appears 
fairly unlikely at present. Another factor in this 
context is how quickly consumers’ and busi -
nesses’ behaviour returns to normal after the 
restrictions are relaxed. That applies not just to 
Germany itself but also to countries with which 
Germany has close economic ties. However, 
there is no danger of the German economy 
sliding into a self- reinforcing downward spiral. 
This will be prevented by Germany’s compre -
hensive social security system, the Eurosystem’s extensive monetary policy measures, and also 
the Federal Government’s fiscal stimulus meas -
ures. The German economy’s production cap -
acity will be quite substantially underutilised at 
first but these monetary and fiscal policy meas -
ures will create the necessary conditions for the 
German economy’s ability to make a sustained 
recovery as soon as the health risks posed by 
COVID-19 recede.
The unparalleled speed with which the German 
economy was paralysed by the pandemic and 
the adopted containment measures is causing 
considerable uncertainty in terms of assessing 
the development of the economy. Many of the 
economic indicators based on hard data, i.e. 
not obtained from surveys, are available so far 
only for January and February. They therefore 
do not yet reflect the economic costs of the 
pandemic or of combating it. Rather, they 
show that the German economy appeared at 
the start of the year to have overcome its pro -
tracted sluggishness. Production in export-  
oriented industry was experiencing strong 
growth for the first time since the middle of 
2018 and industrial firms’ order books were 
also showing a noticeable improvement. The 
already robust domestically oriented sectors are 
likely to have undergone further expansion 
during this period. Output in the main con -
struction sector rose strongly, with the weather 
as a contributory cause, and retail sales and 
turnover in the hotel and restaurant sector 
were likewise higher on the back of sustained 
positive developments in the labour market.1
In March, the measures needed to contain the 
epidemic then hit the economy with great 
force, however. The official order to close busi -
nesses and other protective measures to re -
duce the danger of contagion led to a wide -German econ -

spread loss of sales and activity in the sectors 
directly affected. This is likely to have had a 
particular impact on restaurants and the cater -
ing trade, travel service providers, other leisure 
and culture- related services, and textile retail -
ers, as well as passenger transportation by air, 
ship, rail and bus. Rough estimates reveal that 
foregone consumption expenditure in these 
areas in the second half of March alone prob -
ably reduced gross domestic product in the first 
quarter by somewhat more than 1%. More -
over, a massive decline in activity is also becom -
ing evident across the German economy as a 
whole. According to the Ifo Institute, the Busi -
ness Climate Index for Germany, which is avail -
able towards the end of the respective current 
month, crashed dramatically in March.2 This 
was due to an unprecedented collapse in busi -
ness expectations within the space of one 
month. The assessment of the business situ -
ation also deteriorated quite considerably, 
however. Short- term production expectations 
in industry were also scaled back very strongly. 
Moreover, in its April forecast the survey- based 
GfK consumer confidence index became sig -
nificantly gloomier. This picture is confirmed by 
the first “hard” economic indicators that are al -
ready available for March. For example, accord -
ing to the German Association of the Automo -
tive Industry (VDA), in seasonally adjusted 
terms there was a sudden drop in the numbers 
of manufactured passenger cars. Furthermore, 
the mileage of heavy goods vehicles on Ger -
man motorways subject to toll charges, which 
is closely linked to industrial output, was down 
considerably after seasonal adjustment. This 
was due to a very strong decline in the volume 
of road traffic in the second half of March.3 
Electricity consumption was also down percep -
tibly in the second half of March according to 
seasonally adjusted data from the Federal Net -
work Agency. Other timely data likewise sug -

tracting strongly only from mid- March, i.e. to -
wards the end of the first quarter. As the meas -
ures adopted in mid- March remained in force 
during April and are to be eased only very grad -
ually, a further massive decline in economic 
output is expected for the average of the 
second quarter.
Industry
The data on industrial output for February con -
firm the picture that industry was on a path of 
recovery prior to the collapse due to the cor -
ona pandemic. This is revealed by a marked 
½% increase on the month in seasonally ad -
justed terms. On an average of January and 
February, industrial output was in fact consider -
ably up on its level in the fourth quarter of last 
year (+2%). Looking at the individual sectors, 
the increase was fairly broad- based. Motor ve -
hicle production, which had previously under -
gone a disproportionate decline, also expanded 
strongly. Output of capital goods increased 
substantially overall (+1½%), and growth in 
production of intermediate goods was even 
more pronounced (+3¼%). By contrast, manu -
facturers of consumer goods reported a smaller 
increase in output (+¾%). From March, the im -
pact of the corona crisis on German industry 
will become very obvious. The numbers of 
manufactured passenger cars, for which VDA 
data are already available for March, were 
down by just over one- third in seasonally ad -
justed terms. In German motor vehicle produc -
tion, even larger declines in percentage terms 
within the space of one month were seen only 
during the strike in the metal- working industry 
in support of the introduction of the 35- hour 
week, which lasted for several weeks in the 
spring of 1984. Although the current sudden 
slump in the manufacturing of new passenger 
cars is unlikely to be representative of industrial 
production as a whole, it reinforces the bleak 
picture painted by surveys and other indicators 
already available for March.Demand for German industrial products also 
remained buoyant in February. After seasonal 
adjustment, German industrial orders were 
down considerably compared with their very 
strong showing in the previous month (-1½%). 
Looking at January and February in aggregate, 
however, they were still well (+2¾%) above 
their level in the previous quarter. The order 
books of industrial firms improved on a broad 
front. New orders rose to a similar extent even 
without including large- scale orders received 
on an irregular basis. In regional terms, the 
largest increase in orders (+5½%) came from 
non- euro area countries, followed by domestic 
demand, which also saw a steep rise (+2%). By Industrial output

contrast, new orders from the euro area were 
somewhat down on the quarter (-½%). This 
was due chiefly to weakness in large- scale 
orders, however. Excluding these, the volume 
of orders from euro area countries also saw a 
strong rise. Broken down by sector, new orders 
in the intermediate goods industry showed a 
particularly strong increase, although produ -
cers of capital goods and consumer goods like -
wise reported considerable growth. Industrial 
enterprises’ orders situation might have held 
up fairly well in March in spite of the corona -
virus pandemic. At all events, the stock of 
orders still being processed in manufacturing 
has remained fairly stable so far according to 
the survey results of the Ifo Institute. It should 
be noted, however, that, in some cases, these 
results were collected prior to the tightening of 
the measures to contain the pandemic. Fur -
thermore, it remains unclear whether some of 
these orders have been or will be cancelled as 
a result of the ensuing rapidly escalating crisis. 
It is also conceivable that the disruption to sup -
ply chains will mean that some orders have an 
impact on output only with a major time lag.
Nominal industrial sales in February 2020 fol -
lowed industrial output on a reduced scale and 
showed a slight increase on the month after 
seasonal adjustment (+¼%). On an average of 
January and February, they were up signifi -
cantly on the final quarter of 2019 (+¾%). 
Looking at individual sectors, manufacturers of 
intermediate and consumer goods reported 
significantly higher sales figures. By contrast, 
sales of capital goods remained at the level of 
the previous quarter. In this respect, there was 
a dampening impact stemming from a decline 
in both mechanical engineering turnover and 
– probably on account of emissions regulations 
being tightened at the start of the year – auto -
motive sales. In a regional breakdown, the in -
crease in sales was attributable to significant 
growth in Germany and in the euro area. By 
contrast, sales to non- euro area countries were 
down slightly. In line with this, nominal exports 
of goods increased perceptibly in February 
2020 after seasonal adjustment (+1¼%). On an average of January and February, total exports 
in both nominal and real terms were only 
slightly (+¼%) above the average of the final 
three months of 2019. In particular, there was 
a dampening impact from exports to China, 
whose economy was the first to suffer under 
the pandemic on a massive scale. Seasonally 
adjusted nominal imports of goods declined 
substantially in February 2020 (-1½%). Here 
too, the decline in trade with China had a 
major impact. Taking January and February to -
gether, the decrease in imports, at ¾%, was 
somewhat lower overall compared with the 
previous quarter. After adjustment for price ef -
fects, however, imports of goods remained un -
changed on the quarter. This discrepancy is due 
to the strong decline in energy prices towards 
the end of the period under review.
Construction
Construction output in February 2020 showed a 
marked decline on the very strong previous 
month (-1%). Taking the average of the first two 
months of the current year, this still resulted in 
a sharp (+4¾%) increase compared with the 
previous quarter. The warmer- than- average 
weather during the first quarter also played a 
part in this, with a particularly strong increase in 
construction activity in the main construction 
sector. Growth in the finishing trades was some -
what more moderate. Orders received in the 
main construction sector in January – statistical 
data are available up to then  – rose sharply 
compared with the final quarter of 2019, in 
which they had already shown a quite substan -
tial increase. Looking at this in isolation would 
suggest that the construction boom in Germany 
is continuing. The coronavirus crisis is also likely 
to have an adverse effect on construction activ -
ity, however. According to the Ifo Institute, the 
business climate in the main construction sector 
in March underwent a significant, albeit some -
what weaker deterioration than in the other 
economic sectors. This suggests that construc -
tion activity might not be so drastically affected Industrial turn -

by the current recession as the German econ -
omy overall.
Labour market
Labour market data essentially reflect the situ -
ation prior to the expansion of measures to 
contain COVID-  19 from mid- March onwards. 
The slightly positive development in employ -
ment continued at the beginning of the year. 
As in January, employment in February rose 
moderately by a seasonally adjusted 18,000 
persons. According to the initial estimate of the 
Federal Employment Agency, January saw a 
strong increase in employment subject to social 
security contributions. The number of regis -
tered unemployed in March remained stable 
compared with the previous month – the cut- 
off date fell on 12 March, which was still prior 
to the introduction of across- the- board contact 
restrictions. There were 2.27 million persons 
registered as unemployed with the Federal Em -
ployment Agency, corresponding to an un -
employment rate of 5.0%.
In early March, with the escalation of the 
coronavirus crisis, policymakers extended ac -
cess to short- time working for employees sub -
ject to social security contributions in order to 
avoid redundancies. In the period from 1 to 
25 March, however, the Federal Employment 
Office examined notifications of short- time 
working for 1.04 million employees subject to 
social security contributions, compared with 
0.04 million in February. These notifications are 
a prerequisite for being able to make use of the 
instrument.4 Furthermore, between 1  March 
and 13 April, 0.72 million firms notifying short- 
time work had been counted in a special survey 
conducted by the Federal Employment Office.5 
Although not all notifications necessarily result 
in actual use, this means that the number of 
short- time workers is already likely to far ex -
ceed 1 million in April. During the 2009 eco -
nomic crisis, the number peaked at 1.44 million 
short- time workers, most of whom were in the 
manufacturing sector. The number of employ -ees subject to social security contributions and 
potentially entitled to payments is now 6 mil -
lion higher than it was then, and more sectors 
are being affected by the economic downturn. 
Similarly, given the expected severity of the re -
cession, short- time working will tend to have a 
bigger role than was the case 11 years ago.
Prices
Against the backdrop of travel restrictions and 
a negative outlook for the global economy due 
to the pandemic as well as expansions in pro -
duction, oil prices plummeted in March. They 
were down by two- fifths on the month and by 
more than one- half on the year. Oil prices sta -
bilised in the first weeks of April, with agree -
ment among major oil- producing countries on 
further cutbacks in production arguably playing 
a part in this. As this report went to press, the 
price of a barrel of Brent crude oil stood at 
US$23. Crude oil futures were trading at sig -
nificant premiums at US$9 for deliveries six 
months ahead and US$11 for deliveries 12 
months ahead.
In February, import prices were down distinctly 
on the month, mainly due to lower energy 
prices. By contrast, prices of other imported 
goods rose slightly. In domestic industrial sales, 
the fall in energy prices and thus prices overall 
was less marked. Excluding energy, however, 
the ongoing rise in prices up to that point came 
to a standstill. While industrial producer prices 
more or less maintained their level of the previ -
ous year, import prices were 2% lower.
For the first time in roughly a year, March saw 
a month- on- month seasonally adjusted fall in Data on

4 However, this does not mean that these notifications al -

5 This figure includes notifications which have been sub -
mitted by firms and have not yet been examined. Many 
notifications can be processed by the Federal Employment 
Office only with some delay at present. The number of em -
ployees affected by short- time working cannot be easily 
identified from this special survey. See Federal Employment 
Agency (2020).Deutsche Bundesbank

consumer price inflation as measured by the 
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). 
This was mainly attributable to a marked de -
cline in energy prices, although this was not as 
pronounced as the slump in crude oil prices 
might suggest. There was little change overall 
in the prices of food, non- energy industrial 
goods and services, although the volatile prices 
for clothing and package holidays were going 
down. Year- on- year HICP inflation fell overall 
from 1.7% to 1.3%.6 Excluding energy and 
food, the figure was the same at 1.3%, up 
from 1.4%. In this connection, prices were still 
showing hardly any impact from the corona -
virus pandemic, as they were surveyed largely 
before the introduction of the containment 
measures. However, the closure of numerous 
businesses and travel restrictions on many 
goods and services has meant that it has not 
been possible to collect any price information 
in the current month. For this reason, the in -
formative value of the April figures, especially 
for core inflation, is likely to have been consid -
erably diminished. All things considered, there 
is likely to be a sharp fall in the rate of inflation 
over the coming months, as lower crude oil 
prices are successively passed through to con -
sumers.
Public finances
Local government finances
The surplus in the local government core 
budgets and off- budget entities stood at just 
over €5½ billion in 2019, €4 billion below the 
high result of the previous year. At 4½%, 
growth in revenue was considerable overall. 
Tax growth of 3% was driven, in particular, by 
shares of income tax. Turnover tax also contrib -
uted perceptibly to the increase in revenue as a 
result of funds received from central govern -
ment. On balance, local business tax revenue 
– a particularly large revenue item – went up 
slightly. Gross revenue declined somewhat, 
whereas transfer payments to central and state 
government were down by a greater amount. Receipts from fees and transfers from state 
government increased significantly (by 6% and 
6½%, respectively).
At 6½%, expenditure rose at a more substan -
tial pace than revenue, with spending on per -
sonnel and other operating expenditure (up by 
5½% and 7%, respectively) making a major 
contribution. The former was driven by signifi -
cantly higher negotiated pay rates as well as 
the new employer’s share of supplementary 
contributions to health insurance institutions. 
In addition, the number of staff is likely to have 
gone up further. Investment in fixed assets in -
creased by 14½%, with the governments of all 
federal states reporting strong growth. By con -
trast, spending on social benefits increased 
only moderately (+2%). While payments of so -
cial assistance rose significantly, expenditure 
both on benefits for asylum seekers and ac -
commodation costs for recipients of unemploy -
ment benefit II declined. Interest expenditure 
fell substantially again.
At the end of 2019, local government debt was 
€1 billion higher than in the previous year and 
totalled €136 billion. The increase is due to 
investment- related credit market debt, which 
can only be taken out if local government can 
demonstrate sufficient financial capacity. This 
item rose significantly by €3½ billion to just 
under €98 billion, in particular in North Rhine- 
Westphalia, Hesse and Rhineland- Palatinate. By 
contrast, cash advances declined – especially in 
North Rhine-  Westphalia – by €2½ billion over -
all and amounted to €35 billion.
The coronavirus pandemic is also affecting 
local government budgets. Tax revenue, par -
ticularly from local business tax, is likely to de -

ment should stabilise revenue as they are still 
expected to increase as planned in the current 
year.7 Some state governments are also con -
tributing to measures to ease burdens that can 
be assigned relatively easily. This applies, for ex -
ample, to non- payments of fees for childcare 
facilities that have been closed following a de -
cision by state government. Pressure on spend -
ing caused by the pandemic is likely to be felt 
predominantly by central government, state 
government and the social security funds. 
However, local governments, too, are likely to 
face greater demands. For example, the tem -
porary relaxing of the means- tested assessment 
of basic allowance is likely to have an impact, 
not least, on spending on social benefits. Local 
governments bear roughly half of the costs of 
accommodation for persons receiving un -
employment benefit II; central government is 
responsible for the other expenses associated 
with the basic allowance.
Local government finances are therefore likely 
to come under considerable pressure, at least 
this year. The financial situation varies widely 
among local governments. Some have built up 
reserves, whereas others still have high cash 
advances. Local government budget law leaves 
little room to cushion such extraordinary 
shocks. Those local governments without re -
serves may therefore be expected to take far-  
reaching consolidation measures in the short 
term. However, this would be just as unsuitable 
a response to the problem as a renewed struc -
tural recourse to cash advances.8 A conceivable 
option would instead be to have state govern -
ments limit the financial burden on their local 
governments as a result of the pandemic in 
such a way that investment, among other 
things, can be stabilised.
Ideally, such ad hoc support would be paired 
with a fundamental change in the financing of 
local government budgets. At present, local 
business tax – the main source of local govern -
ment tax revenue – is proving problematic once 
again. It is very volatile, which makes it difficult 
to maintain a stable budgetary policy. The budgetary situation of many local governments 
is closely linked to the success of individual 
medium-  sized to large local enterprises. As a 
result, financial developments, too, can diverge 
considerably among local governments. All in 
all, there is much to suggest that local govern -
ment financing should undergo a fundamental 
reform. Local business tax could be replaced by 
a more stable source of revenue while preserv -Without sup -

financing7 The unexpected decline in tax revenue in the current year 
will be reflected in most states’ local government financial 
equalisation schemes only with a time lag.
8 Cash advances are actually intended only to ensure li -
quidity over the course of the year. Some states have just 
tightened their budgetary rules so that high multi- year cash 
advances do not again hamstring local governments. If 
such credit were nevertheless to be used more intensively 
again, it would be appropriate to hold the states charged 
with budgetary supervision directly responsible. For ex -
ample, arrangements could be put in place stipulating that 
multi- year cash advances can only be taken out via the cor -
responding state. For more information, see Deutsche Bun -
desbank (2016), p.  29. If local governments struggle to 
absorb the strains arising from the pandemic in the me -
dium term, state governments could then waive debt in 
order to give their local governments the necessary leeway 
to take action.Deutsche Bundesbank

also help to simplify Germany’s very complex 
system of corporate taxation. Last but not 
least, this would enable Germany to play its 
part in achieving a more uniform European cor -
porate tax assessment base.
Securities markets
Bond market
The spread of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in -
fluenced developments in the financial markets 
in February 2020. It also had some effect on 
the German capital market, although no highly 
atypical issuance patterns were observed in the 
reporting month.
At €128.1 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in February 2020 was significantly 
down on the previous month’s figure (€154.9 
billion). However, issuance had been unusually high in January. After deducting redemptions, 
which were down on the previous month, and 
taking account of changes in issuers’ holdings 
of their own debt securities, the outstanding 
volume of domestic bonds grew by €34.9 bil -
lion. Foreign debt securities worth €7.7 billion 
net were placed in the German market. The 
outstanding volume of debt securities in Ger -
many therefore rose by €42.6 billion on bal -
ance.
In the month under review, the public sector 
increased its bond market liabilities by €19.4 
billion net, compared with €15.6 billion one 
month earlier. Central government mainly is -
sued five- year Federal notes (Bobls: €4.4 billion) 
and ten- year and 30- year Federal bonds 
(Bunds: €4.2 billion and €2.3 billion respect -
ively), in addition to two- year Federal Treasury 
notes (Schätze: €5.7 billion). This contrasted 
with net redemptions of Treasury discount 
paper (Bubills: €2.5 billion). State and local gov -
ernments issued securities with a net value of 
€5.7 billion.
In February, credit institutions issued debt se -
curities worth €13.8 billion net, compared with 
€5.1 billion one month earlier. On balance, 
these mostly took the form of debt securities 
issued by specialised credit institutions, the out -
standing volume of which rose by €10.1 billion. 
Moreover, a net €2.4 billion worth of mortgage 
Pfandbriefe and a net €1.5 billion worth of 
other bank debt securities were also placed in 
the market.
Domestic enterprises augmented their capital 
market debt by €1.6 billion in February, com -
pared with €9.2 billion in the previous month. 
Here, too, issuance had been unusually high in 
January. On balance, the vast majority of the 
securities issued had a maturity of more than 
one year. The bulk of the issues was attribut -
able to other financial intermediaries.
Domestic non- banks were the main purchasers 
in February, adding debt securities with a net 
value of €17.9 billion to their portfolios. These High net

were almost exclusively domestic securities on 
balance. Foreign investors acquired German 
bonds amounting to €11.5 billion net. Demand 
focused on securities issued by the public sec -
tor. Domestic credit institutions added debt se -
curities worth €9.0 billion net to their port -
folios, mainly acquiring foreign paper. The Bun -
desbank increased its securities holdings 
– mainly in the context of the Eurosystem’s re -
newed asset purchase programmes – by €4.2 
billion net.
Equity market
In the month under review, new shares worth 
€0.4 billion were issued in the German equity 
market. Over the same period, the outstanding 
volume of foreign shares in Germany increased 
by €2.6 billion.
Foreign investors and domestic non- banks 
were the main purchasers of shares in February 
(€2.1 billion and €1.8 billion respectively), while 
domestic credit institutions reduced their equity 
holdings by €0.9 billion net.
Mutual funds
In February, the inflows recorded by domestic 
mutual funds were somewhat smaller than in 
the previous month (€13.2 billion compared 
with €14.3 billion). The fresh funds benefited 
mainly specialised funds reserved for institu -
tional investors (€12.0 billion). Among the asset 
classes, mixed securities- based funds attracted 
the most inflows (€6.7 billion), though they 
were also recorded by bond funds (€3.1 billion), 
open- end real estate funds (€2.4 billion) and 
equity funds (€1.0 billion). The volume of for -
eign investment fund shares in the German 
market rose by €3.2 billion in February. German 
non- banks were almost the sole net buyers of 
investment fund shares (€15.6 billion). Domestic 
credit institutions acquired shares worth €0.8 
billion net, while foreign investors were barely 
active in the German mutual fund market.Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus of €23.7 billion in February 2020, up €6.9 
billion on the previous month’s level. The result 
was chiefly driven by an increased goods ac -
count surplus and was also attributable to a 
slightly higher surplus in invisible current trans -
actions, which comprise services as well as pri -
mary and secondary income.
In the reporting month, the surplus in the 
goods account widened by €6.2 billion on the 
month to €20.7 billion. In this context, exports 
of goods rose while imports fell.
The surplus in invisible current transactions rose 
by €0.7 billion to €3.0 billion in February, with 
the increase in the secondary income balance 
more than offsetting the decline in the primary 
income balance. Net receipts on primary in -
come fell by €2.7 billion to €7.4 billion, mainly 
on account of higher dividend payments for 
portfolio investment to non- residents. The def -
icit in the secondary income account decreased 
by €2.9 billion to €4.2 billion, with a significant 
contribution coming from lower general gov -
ernment payments to the EU budget, which 
were connected to financing related to gross 
national income. In addition, the deficit in ser -
vices declined slightly by €0.5 billion to €0.2 
billion.
Over the course of February 2020, the acceler -
ating spread of the coronavirus (SARS-  CoV-  2) 
–  including in Europe  – and the associated 
heightened uncertainty increasingly influenced 
developments in the financial markets. This had 
an impact on some capital flows to and from 
Germany, too; although the typical safe haven 
flows remained moderate in the reporting 
month. Germany’s cross- border portfolio in -
vestment generated net capital imports of €1.3 
billion (January: €7.5 billion). Foreign investors 
acquired German securities worth €13.4 billion 
net. They mainly purchased bonds (€13.3 bil -
lion), of which the vast majority was particu -
larly safe paper issued by the public sector. To a Weak net

lesser extent, they also acquired German shares 
(€1.9 billion). Mutual fund shares were pur -
chased and sold in equal measure; while, on 
balance, non- resident investors sold domestic 
money market paper (€1.8 billion). Overall, do -
mestic investors added €12.1 billion worth of 
securities issued by non- residents to their port -
folios. They also chiefly acquired bonds (€8.1 
billion), mutual fund shares (€3.2 billion) and 
shares (€1.2 billion). By contrast, in the case of 
money market paper, sales and redemptions 
predominated slightly on balance (€0.4 billion).
Direct investment generated net capital exports 
of €10.7 billion in February, following €3.3 bil -
lion in January. Domestic enterprises increased 
their foreign direct investment by €23.7 billion. 
They boosted their equity capital by €12.3 bil -
lion, with just over half of this figure taking the 
form of reinvested earnings. Cross- border intra- 
group credit transactions also saw outflows of 
funds (€11.4 billion), with additional financial 
loans being the main focus. Foreign enter -
prises, on balance, likewise stepped up their 
direct investment in Germany (€13.0 billion). 
They granted additional loans of €10.3 billion 
to affiliated enterprises in Germany and 
boosted their equity capital by €2.7 billion, al -
most exclusively through reinvesting earnings.
Other statistically recorded investment – which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments – registered net 
capital imports of €7.6 billion in February, fol -
lowing €6.5 billion in January. Here, net claims 
of monetary financial institutions (excluding the 
Bundesbank) on non- residents fell by €10.4 bil -
lion. By contrast, the Bundesbank recorded net 
capital exports (€10.0 billion). This was broadly 
in line with the €10.1 billion increase in 
TARGET2 claims on the ECB. Activities of enter -
prises and households (€5.1 billion) and of gen -
eral government (€2.0 billion) led, on balance, 
to net capital imports.
The Bundesbank’s reserve assets rose –  at 
transaction values – by €0.7 billion in February.Direct invest -

New concept and advanced options for using the 
Bundesbank’s  online statistical publications
Making data available via the internet is be-
coming increasingly important. Unveiled in 
mid- April 2020, a modernised range of stat-
istical publications is now available on the 
Bundesbank’s website.1 It features more 
fl  exible download options, an expanded se-
lection of products in English and a revised 
publication structure.
As per the Bundesbank’s new publication 
concept, Statistical Supplements will, going 
forward, be replaced by Statistical Series, 
with amended content in some cases. From 
now on, the Statistical Series will comprise 
all regularly available statistical publications, 
with data presented in tables. The publica-
tions that will be continued in the form of 
Statistical Series are all previous monthly 
Statistical Supplements as well as some 
Special Statistical Publications, most of 
which are released annually (see the over-
view on p. 17). A number of individual pub-
lications will become more focused on spe-
cifi  c subject areas.2 In addition, the statistics 
on payments and securities trading will ap-
pear as a dedicated Statistical Series. From 
this point forward, the Special Statistical 
Publications will solely feature methodo-
logical, legal or reporting- related content. 
English- language versions of all series will 
also gradually be made available. Moreover, 
all statistics newsletters will now be sent 
out in both German and English.
Similarly to the former table- based publica-
tions, the Statistical Series will be made 
available on the Bundesbank’s web pages 
at monthly, semi- annual or annual intervals 
under Publications/Statistics.3 Newsletter 
subscribers will continue to be notifi  ed of 
regular publications.The new concept is designed to make the 
process for updating individual tables more 
fl  exible with the implementation of a modu-
lar publication structure. Where there are 
individual tables that have been updated at 
different times, this concept makes it pos-
sible to view the most up- to- date version of 
the entire series.4 The updated issue is ac-
cessible on the overview page of the re-
spective Statistical Series as an additional 
statistical resource.5 There, you will fi  nd 
various download options for the whole 
issue or for selected tables, which are avail-
able for download individually or as table 
sets.
Downloads are available in various formats. 
Aside from fi  les in PDF format (and, occa-
sionally, tables in XLS format), CSV fi  les can 
also be selected for ZIP download. In this 
way, time series belonging to a table, for 
example, can be called up directly in the 
form of a CSV fi  le. Previously, it was only 
possible to do this by manually adding the

which replace Statistical Supplement 3, Balance of

the same lines, Statistical Supplement 2, Capital mar-

Sectoral portfolio adjustments in the euro 
area during the low interest rate period
Since the outbreak of the global financial and economic crisis, the general level of interest rates 
in the euro area and in virtually all other advanced economies has declined significantly. All other 
things being equal, this low interest rate period creates incentives for investors to shift their port -
folios towards riskier assets. Previous analyses focused primarily on shifts within a narrowly 
defined asset class. These revealed that, in the euro area, credit institutions stepped up their lend -
ing to higher- risk debtors and financial intermediaries purchased riskier securities. The present 
article expands on this observation. First, it analyses whether the allocation of private and finan -
cial investors’ total financial assets shifted towards riskier instruments during the low interest rate 
period. Second, it explores the extent to which monetary policy contributed to these shifts.
The analysis finds that changes in the composition of portfolios varied from sector to sector over 
the past decade. A shift towards riskier instruments can be identified for insurance corporations 
and pension funds as well as for other financial intermediaries. In the portfolios of both sectors, 
the weight shifted from low- risk bank deposits to securities. By contrast, the portfolios of credit 
institutions and, in particular, households moved more strongly towards lower- risk instruments. 
The importance of debt securities diminished in both sectors. Conversely, the weight of compara -
tively low- risk claims on insurance corporations and pension funds rose within the household 
portfolio. Among credit institutions, risk-  free deposits with the Eurosystem grew in significance. 
The changes in the portfolio composition of investment funds and non- financial corporations 
were roughly risk- neutral. One reason why developments are opposing in some instances is that 
buying and selling meant that assets were exchanged between sectors.
Empirical estimates show that expansionary monetary policy shocks generally cause a shift in 
sectoral portfolios towards riskier forms of investment such as equity. However, comparing the 
portfolio adjustments made during the low interest period triggered by these monetary policy 
shocks with total actual portfolio changes reveals that the role played by monetary policy factors 
was merely minor.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Since the outbreak of the global financial and 
economic crisis, the general level of interest 
rates in the euro area has declined significantly. 
This is true of both short- term money market 
rates and long- term capital market rates, in real 
and nominal terms alike. The decline in the 
interest rate level had already commenced back 
in the 1980s and gained substantial renewed 
momentum as the crisis began. This develop -
ment is a broad trend that can be observed in 
virtually all advanced economies.1
The decline in the level of interest rates is most 
likely attributable primarily to changes in struc -
tural (real economic) determinants.2 The first is 
a decrease in potential output, which is associ -
ated with reduced investment in physical cap -
ital. This caused the demand for financing to 
fall. Second, demographic factors such as rising 
life expectancy and shifts in income and wealth 
distribution contributed to increased saving, 
with rising life expectancy encouraging higher 
precautionary saving with a view to maintain -
ing a certain level of consumption over a pro -
longed pension- drawing period. By the same 
token, a shift in income and wealth distribution 
to higher- income and wealthier households 
–  as observed in the United States, for in -
stance – makes for higher aggregate savings, 
as these households have a higher marginal 
propensity to save. Increased saving tended to 
be accompanied by a rise in the supply of fi -
nancing. The interaction between decreased 
demand for and increased supply of financing 
produces a trend decline in the equilibrium 
“natural” rate of interest.3 This rate is charac -
terised by a goods market equilibrium and price 
stability.4
The natural interest rate is an important indica -
tor for a monetary policy focused on price sta -
bility. Given a structural decline in the level of 
interest rates, monetary policy measures track 
the decrease in the natural interest rate to a 
certain extent.All other things being equal, the low interest 
rate level creates incentives for investors to 
shift their portfolios towards riskier assets. In 
the academic literature, this is referred to as the 
“search for yield”.5 Various reasons are cited 
for this, particularly with regard to financial in -
vestors. First, financial intermediaries might 
have made promises of fixed returns on their 
liabilities. Second, asset managers’ compensa -
tion might be linked to nominal targeted rates 
of return. These two factors create a situation 
in which low (nominal) interest rates on safe 
investments are balanced out by incurring 
greater risk. Furthermore, low interest rates in -
crease asset prices and, in doing so, improve 
financial intermediaries’ solvency. This makes it 
possible to take on additional risk.
Previous analyses on the search for yield fo -
cused mostly on shifts within a particular in -
vestment instrument.6 For example, one area 
of research was whether banks are lending to 
higher-  risk debtors or investors are buying 
bonds with poorer ratings. Furthermore, risk 
premium compression, i.e. a narrowing of the 
gap between the interest rates on risky and 
safe investments, was seen as a sign of a 
greater inclination to search for yield. The 
present article expands on this approach. It 
analyses the allocation of total financial assets 
between different investment instruments such 
as deposits, loans, debt securities or shares.

mediaries are considered in this context. This 
article seeks to answer two questions. First, did 
sectoral portfolio composition in the euro area 
shift towards riskier investment instruments 
during the low interest period that began in 
around 2010? And second, to what extent did 
monetary policy contribute to this develop -
ment?
In the following, shifts in sectoral portfolios in 
the euro area’s private sector are first identified 
using data from the financial accounts. The in -
fluence of monetary policy on sectoral portfolio 
composition is then quantified by means of an 
econometric analysis. To conclude, the results 
are placed in the context of findings in the 
existing literature.
Changes in sectoral portfolio 
composition during the low 
interest rate period
As a general rule, investors can put their money 
into a variety of instruments. These differ in 
terms of their potential returns and the risk as -
sociated with the investment. Most of the time, 
higher-  risk instruments will also generate 
higher returns. This provides compensation for 
the higher risk of investing in a particular in -
strument. Weighing up the two factors across 
all available investment instruments, each indi -
vidual investor determines their optimal port -
folio based on their preferences.7 The portfolios 
aggregated across all individual investors within 
a sector produce the sectoral portfolio.
This article begins by describing the changes in 
the composition of portfolios at the sectoral 
level during the low interest rate period. This is 
based on data taken from the financial ac -
counts. These statistics capture financial assets 
across all available financial instruments for all 
sectors within an economy.8 This makes it pos -
sible to obtain a comprehensive and consistent 
overview of sectoral portfolio composition and 
its evolution over time.Domestic holders are broken down based on 
the definitions used in the European System of 
Accounts (ESA) 20109 into the following insti -
tutional sectors: non- financial corporations, 
credit institutions (including money market 
funds), investment funds, other financial inter -
mediaries (e.g. financial vehicle corporations 
engaged in securitisation transactions and se -
curities and derivatives dealers), insurance cor -
porations and pension funds, and households 
(including non- profit institutions serving house -
holds).10 At the instrument level, financial assets 
are broken down into the following compon -
ents: deposits (including cash), debt securities, 
loans, equity (shares and other equity), invest -
ment fund shares, insurance claims and re -
maining assets (comprising financial derivatives, 
employee stock options and other accounts re -
ceivable).11
Conceptual considerations 
regarding  risk classification
The various instruments can be classified by 
their level of risk. For the sake of simplicity, the 
analysis distinguishes between three (key) risks:Optimal port -

versus return

7 Markowitz (1952) and Tobin (1958) pioneered the frame -
work for optimising the composition of an asset portfolio 
– known as portfolio theory. The capital asset pricing 
model (CAPM), developed by J.  Treynor, W. F.  Sharpe, 
J. Lintner and J. Mossin independently of one another in 
the 1960s, took portfolio theory one step further.
8 Non- financial assets, which include real estate assets and 
physical capital, are therefore not taken into account in this 
article.

economic and macrofinancial statistics in Europe are pre -
pared. See https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/

10 Credit institutions correspond to the sector “deposit-  
taking corporations”. The general government sector is not 
included in the analysis as its financial asset holdings are 
comparatively small and volatile. Also excluded from the 
analysis is the Eurosystem, as its investment decisions are 
motivated primarily by monetary policy. Credit institutions 
were not recorded separately in the financial accounts until 
the first quarter of 2015. Values up to the start of 1999 are 
estimated using data from the monthly balance sheet stat -
istics (Balance Sheet Items – BSI) to allow for a long- term 
perspective.
11 Here, too, definitions are based on ESA 2010. Insurance 
claims correspond to the instrument “insurance, pension 
and standardised guaranteed schemes”.Deutsche Bundesbank

– Default risk: The risk of an investor losing the 
money they have invested (in some cases 
forever), e.g. if the borrower becomes in -
solvent.
– Liquidity risk: The risk of being unable to 
convert an asset into cash or transferable 
deposits quickly and/ or without incurring 
high costs.
– Market risk: The risk of the investment’s 
market value falling (temporarily) due to 
market price volatility. For this reason, it also 
comprises interest rate risk.
Taking these risks as an evaluation benchmark 
and leaving aside the differences in the risk 
level of individual assets within the various in -
strument categories, deposits should be the 
safest of all the asset classes under analysis. 
Default risk is very low due to deposit protec -
tion and deposits’ high ranking in the order of 
creditors. Additionally, deposits are subject to 
only low liquidity risk on account of their 
(mostly) short maturities. Finally, deposits are 
generally not exposed to market risk. Insurance 
claims should also entail very low default risk 
on account of the regulatory provisions in place 
for insurance corporations and pension funds. 
At the same time, this instrument is subject to 
medium market risk. While insurance claims are 
generally easy to liquidate, most of the time 
policyholders are forced to take a huge mark -
down. Liquidity risk should therefore be re -
garded as medium.
Debt instruments, i.e. assets in the form of 
debt securities and loans, are in the medium-  
risk category. As instruments with generally 
equal status in the order of creditors, they 
should both involve medium default risk. Given 
that debt securities are tradable, their liquidity 
risk is rather low. However, they are exposed to 
high market risk. By contrast, loans are not sub -
ject to market price volatility but do entail high 
liquidity risk.Equity is junior in the creditor pecking order. As 
a result, it has the highest default risk of all the 
instruments considered here. In addition, divi -
dend payments made to equity holders are 
variable and can also be cancelled altogether if 
profits are low. While the liquidity risk of listed 
shares tends to be on the low side, their valu -
ation is exposed to market risk. By contrast, un -
listed shares and other equity (unlisted equity) 
are subject to only limited market price volatil -
ity12 but entail high liquidity risk. With regard to 
their risk profile, investment fund shares should 
rank somewhere between debt instruments 
and equity. The reason for this is that, on ag -
gregate, investment funds invest primarily in 
these two asset classes.
In view of the mixed composition of the re -
maining assets category, it is not possible to 
clearly determine its risk profile. Changes in 
their significance will be assessed below as risk- 
neutral. All in all, the risk level increases if an 
asset portfolio’s composition shifts from de -
posits and insurance claims to debt instru -
ments, investment fund shares and/ or equity 
(see the chart on p. 23).
It should be noted at this point that the follow -
ing analysis examines only some of the possible 
changes in the risk level of the sectoral port -
folio. First, the analysis addresses only those 
changes in the risk level of the portfolios that 
can be attributed to shifts between different in -
struments. However, the risk content of the 
total portfolio can also change in the event of 
adjustments at the individual investment instru -
ment level. This would be the case if, for in -
stance, bonds or equity issued by lower- risk 
debtors were replaced by instruments issued by 
higher- risk debtors (for more information, see 
the remarks on pp. 28 ff.). Second, portfolios’ 
risk content can shift if there is a change in the 
creditworthiness of the parties issuing the in -Deposits and

markets, they have de facto no market price and cannot be 
subject to volatility. However, their valuation is supposed to

vestment instruments. This would be the case 
if, for instance, debtors became less solvent 
owing to an economic downturn. As neither of 
these factors can be captured using financial 
accounts data, they are not the main focus of 
this analysis.
Portfolio shifts in the low 
interest rate period
Changes in the portfolio composition of the in -
dividual sectors during the low interest rate 
period act as an indicator of changes in the risk 
inherent in the sectoral portfolios in the euro 
area. For the purposes of the following ana -
lyses, this period is defined as lasting from the 
beginning of 2010 to the third quarter of 2019 
(latest available data). The portfolio shares dis -
cussed below represent the ratio of the instru -
ment in question, valued at market prices, to 
total financial assets. The sum of all portfolio 
shares adds up to 100%.
Changes in the portfolio shares are additionally 
further subdivided into two components. 
Transaction- related portfolio shifts are the re -
sult of buying and selling and/ or redemptions 
of investment instruments. This means that, for 
the most part, investors influence these 
changes directly. Valuation- related portfolio shifts are the result of instruments’ market 
price volatility. These changes occur because 
the market prices of individual instruments de -
velop differently, and are largely outside of indi -
vidual investors’ control.13
The chart on p. 24 shows the changes in the 
sectoral portfolio shares for the individual in -
struments in market prices (“Total”) and the 
contributions of transaction- related (“Transac -
tions”) and valuation- related (“Valuation ef -
fects”) portfolio shifts. Looking at households, 
the portfolio shifted away from debt securities 
towards insurance claims over the period under 
observation. The changes were primarily driven 
by transactions. Deposits as a percentage of 
total portfolio assets remained virtually un -
changed, with the noticeable drop in weight as 
a result of relative market price losses roughly 
balanced out by transaction- related portfolio 
rebalancing. Overall, households’ portfolio Change in the

13 The transaction- related portfolio shifts are calculated as 
changes in portfolio share relative to book value. The latter 
is approximated by extrapolating initial stocks to include 
transactions. Valuation- related portfolio shifts are then de -
fined as the difference between the change in portfolio 
shares (at market prices) and the changes in portfolio 
shares at book values (transaction- related portfolio shifts). 
Besides market price volatility, other factors, such as statis -
tical reclassifications or write- downs, can also result in 
valuation- related portfolio shifts. However, these are usu -
ally so small that the simplifying assumption is made that 
valuation- related portfolio shifts are the result of market 
price volatility alone.Deutsche Bundesbank

composition thus shifted towards lower- risk in -
struments.
Equity has become a lot more prominent in the 
portfolio of non- financial corporations. This de -
velopment was driven, first and foremost, by 
valuation- related portfolio shifts as a result of 
relative changes in market prices. By contrast, 
there was a drop, especially in the percentage 
of remaining assets, which, for the corporate 
sector, comprise mainly trade credits and ad -
vances. There was likewise a decline in the 
portfolio share of loans, in particular, loans to 
other non- financial corporations. This was the 
result of relative valuation losses, which more 
than offset the positive effect of transaction-  
related rebalancing. Given that the rise in the 
significance of equity is likely attributable espe -
cially to strategic equity investments, which are 
matched by valuation gains on net worth on 
the liabilities side, the portfolio shifts are likely 
to be risk- neutral overall.
As regards insurance corporations and pension 
funds, investment fund shares as a percentage 
of the portfolio rose markedly. In addition, the 
weight of debt securities increased slightly. The 
significance of deposits, meanwhile, fell sharply. 
Equity lost some weight. Looking at the big pic -
ture, it is therefore clear that portfolio compos -
ition has shifted towards riskier instruments, 
with the changes virtually exclusively the result 
of transaction- related portfolio rebalancing. 
There were noteworthy valuation gains only for 
investment fund shares.
Among credit institutions, portfolio compos -
ition shifted away from debt securities towards 
deposits with other monetary financial institu -
tions and loans. This was almost entirely the 
result of transaction- related portfolio rebalan -
cing. The drop in the significance of debt secur -
ities can be explained, in particular, by sales of 
government securities to the Eurosystem under 
the expanded asset purchase programme 
(APP). Acting in the opposite direction, there 
was a clear rise in the weight of loans to the

Eurosystem asset purchases and euro area portfolio 
 duration by investor group
One key transmission channel of the Euro-
system’s expanded asset purchase pro-
gramme (APP) is the portfolio rebalancing 
channel.1 The way it works is that Eurosys-
tem asset purchases induce portfolio rebal-
ancing by market participants, which in 
turn impacts on asset prices and yields. Two 
factors are cited in the literature as deter-
minants for price movements: the scarcity 
effect and the duration effect.
Scarcity effects occur when the central bank 
purchases a specifi  c bond and market par-
ticipants’ demand for this specifi  c bond 
does not decrease in equal measure owing 
to preferences or regulatory provisions. This 
raises the bond’s price and reduces its yield. 
Empirical studies indicate that these scarcity 
effects tend to be temporary because cer-
tain market participants offset these relative 
price effects over time using arbitrage activ-
ities.2
Duration effects are quantitatively more im-
portant for the impact of monetary policy 
asset purchases.3 Duration generally de-
scribes the length of time for which capital is 
tied up in a fi  xed income asset. The longer 
the capital is tied up, the more sensitive the 
price of a bond is to a change in market 
interest rates. Duration is therefore a meas-
ure of a bond’s market risk as a result of a 
change in interest rates. By buying bonds 
from the other investors, the central bank ex-
tracts duration from the market, as it pur-
chases longer- term instruments using short- term central bank money. This reduces the 
amount of duration and thus the aggregate 
duration risk held by non- central bank invest-
ors. Investors are then usually willing to ac-
cept a yield discount in terms of a falling 
term premium. This effect is evident across 
the entire term structure, i.e. for bonds of all 
residual maturities. However, it intensifi  es at 
the long end of the curve since the prices of 
longer- dated bonds are more sensitive to 
changes in market interest rates, owing to

the longer capital tie- up period, which means 
that interest rate risk is typically greater.
The analysis below quantifi  es the impact of 
the Eurosystem’s monetary policy asset pur-
chases on the trend path of the aggregate 
duration risk held by non- Eurosystem in-
vestors. The study focuses on the public 
sector purchase programme (PSPP).4 The 
calculations are based on the granular Euro-
pean Securities Holdings Statistics by Sector 
(SHSS) and on information on the Eurosys-
tem’s securities holdings. Holder sectors are 
defi  ned as follows: Eurosystem and non- 
Eurosystem investors, i.e. credit institutions 
(which correspond to deposit- taking cor-
porations and include money market funds), 
other fi  nancial intermediaries (including in-
vestment funds), insurance corporations 
and pension funds, other domestic sectors 
and non- residents.
The chart on p. 25 shows developments in 
overall aggregate duration from the fi  rst 
quarter of 2015 (when the PSPP began) to 
the third quarter of 2019. The adjacent 
table shows the respective shares held by 
the various groups of investors.5 Domestic insurance corporations and pension funds, 
along with non- residents, each accounting 
for just over 30%, were the two largest 
holders of outstanding aggregate duration 
risk immediately prior to the launch of PSPP 
net purchases. With the launch of PSPP net 
purchases, the Eurosystem continuously ex-
panded its share of the amount of duration. 
This was mirrored by reductions in shares of 
outstanding aggregate duration by all other 
investors, particularly domestic credit insti-
tutions and, above all, non- residents up to 
end- 2017.6
Across the observation period, insurance 
corporations and pension funds continued 
to increase their amount of duration, pos-
sibly to meet regulatory provisions. How-
ever, their share of total outstanding aggre-
gate duration risk dropped by 3.5 percent-
age points by end- 2019. The rise of dur-
ation risk in this sector’s portfolio thus failed 
to match the increase in the aggregate out-
standing amount of duration, which rose 
continuously owing, above all, to net new 
issuance by euro area governments. On the 
whole, the Eurosystem has raised its share 
of aggregate duration risk by around 
20 percentage points since 2015.7
4 Just over 83% of all net APP purchases were con-
ducted under the PSPP by end- 2019. In order to re-
duce computational complexity, this analysis ignores 
the other programmes (ABSPP , CSPP , CBPP3). In add-
ition, for simplicity the broadest possible defi  nition of 
securities potentially eligible for the PSPP is used. What 
this specifi  cally means is that all euro- denominated 
bonds of current PSPP issuers with a residual maturity 
of between 1 and 31 years is taken into account. This 
factors out, for instance, structural breaks caused by 
changes in the PSPP parameters over time.
5 On a security- by- security basis, duration is approxi-
mated in the form of what are known as ten- year 
equivalents by multiplying the bond’s nominal value by 
its residual maturity (in years) and scaling it by a factor 
of 1/ 10. For more on this, see Eser et al. (2019).

What is the relationship between the Euro-
system’s duration extraction and the decline 
in yields of different residual maturities in 
the euro area? To answer this question, 
changes in term premiums derived from a 
term structure model are regressed on 
changes in a measure of duration held by 
non- Eurosystem investors. In this way, the 
decline in term premiums that is explained 
by duration extraction can be determined. 
The duration measure comprises not only 
ongoing aggregate duration risk but also 
projected duration risk held by non- 
Eurosystem investors. Theoretically, the en-
tire projected trend path of duration risk 
across the maturity of a bond is relevant to 
the pricing of assets.8
The above chart shows how strongly the 
APP asset purchases have contributed to 
compressing term premiums and thus euro 
area interest rates over time.9 The impact is 
clearly larger for interest rates with longer 
maturities than that for interest rates with 
shorter maturities. The estimates indicate 
that the ten- year (two- year) OIS interest 
rate as at end- 2019 was around 60 (10) 
basis points lower compared to a scenario 
in which the Eurosystem had not bought 
bonds under the APP . These fi  ndings are 
consistent with other studies which use al-
ternative methods to quantify the effect of 
the APP on the euro area yield curve.10
In closing, it must be noted that the results 
presented here are subject to considerable 
uncertainty. In addition to the assumptions 
that had to be made for calculating the pro-
jected duration measure, the statistical esti-
mation uncertainty of the impact on the 
decline in interest rates is quite high. Fur-
thermore, the results can vary depending 
on the choice of the underlying yield curve. 
Consequently, the effects on OIS interest 
rates calculated here are likely to be smaller 
compared to the effects on government bond yields, amongst other things because 
the APP causes additional scarcity effects 
in  relation to high- quality government 
bonds.11

data and making assumptions about the projected 
duration pattern, the estimates follow Eser et al. (2019) 
closely. These authors analyse the effects within a dy-
namic term structure model into which the duration 
measure feeds directly. In this box, on the other hand, 
the change in the duration measure is regressed dir-
ectly on term premiums calculated from the zero lower 
bound model developed by Geiger and Schupp (2018).

swap (OIS) interest rates. For more on the arguments 
in favour of recourse to OIS interest rates as part of 
monetary policy analyses, see Deutsche Bundesbank

and excess liquidity held with the Eurosystem 
increased. Overall, portfolio composition has 
consequently shifted slightly towards less risky 
instruments (for more on risk reduction, see 
also the box on pp. 25 to 27).
The portfolio of investment funds shifted from 
(directly held) equity and debt securities to -
wards investment fund shares. The latter, in 
turn, represent indirect claims on a portfolio 
which consists, in particular, of debt securities 
and equity, as well as real estate. Looking at 
debt securities and equity, transaction-  related 
and valuation- related portfolio shifts acted in 
opposite directions. The weight of equity rose 
very sharply as a result of changes in relative 
market prices. However, transaction- related 
changes reduced this instrument’s portfolio 
share by an even greater margin. All other 
things being equal, transactions expanded debt 
securities’ portfolio share. Nonetheless, their 
portfolio share fell, as this asset class lost a lot 
of weight owing to relative market price 
changes. By contrast, the change in the signifi -
cance of investment fund shares was almost 
entirely the result of transaction- related port -
folio rebalancing. Overall, the risk inherent in 
portfolio composition is probably roughly un -
changed.
Looking at other financial intermediaries, the 
portfolio shifted from deposits and loans to -
wards equity. As a result, portfolio composition 
has moved perceptibly towards more risky in -
struments. Unlike for investment funds, 
transaction- related and valuation- related port -
folio shifts pointed in the same direction, in 
most cases. For instance, the percentage of 
equity rose, not only as a result of marked valu -
ation gains, but also due to transaction- related 
portfolio rebalancing. The significance of de -
posits fell, as their relative market value de -
clined, and they were, furthermore, offloaded 
as a result of transaction- related portfolio 
shifts. Regarding loans, valuation- related port -
folio shifts had virtually no impact, whereas 
transaction- related restructuring reduced their 
portfolio weight.All in all, developments in portfolio compos -
ition were mixed across the sectors under ob -
servation. A shift towards more risky instru -
ments is evident for insurance corporations and 
pension funds as well as for other financial 
intermediaries. In both sectors, the focus 
shifted from low- risk bank deposits to secur -
ities. By contrast, the portfolios of credit institu -
tions and, in particular, households moved to -
wards less risky instruments. Both sectors saw a 
drop in the importance of debt securities. 
Within the household portfolio, the weight of 
comparatively low- risk claims on insurance cor -
porations and pension funds rose considerably. 
Among credit institutions, the significance of 
risk- free deposits with the Eurosystem rose. The 
changes in the portfolio composition of invest -
ment funds and non- financial corporations are 
roughly risk- neutral. One reason why develop -
ments are working in opposite directions, in 
some instances, is that buying and selling 
meant that assets were exchanged between 
sectors.
Shifts within the securities 
portfolio
As indicated above, the shifts between the vari -
ous investment instruments cover only one as -
pect of portfolios’ risk content. In order to sup -
plement the above analysis and existing work,14 
shifts within selected categories of the instru -
ments under observation will be described 
below. More granular data are needed to 
document such changes than those provided 
by the financial accounts. However, such data 
are available only for a small number of instru -
ments. One suitable source of data for this an -
alysis purpose is the Securities Holdings Statis -
tics by Sector (SHSS). The SHSS list, for every 
sector and on a security- by- security basis, infor -

the statistics cover listed shares – a fraction of 
equity – and debt securities.15
The following analyses are limited to compar -
ing the portfolios as at the fourth quarter of 
2014 with those as at the third quarter of 2019 
(latest available data). The first point in time is 
the point as of which reliable data are available 
in the SHSS. It is also the last data point before 
the APP was announced. The calculations are 
always based on the volume- weighted aggre -
gation of individual securities at market prices. 
As a result, transaction- related and valuation-  
related portfolio changes are shown as a 
whole. The sectoral securities portfolios are 
examined in relation to two dimensions:
– Issue currency: a distinction is made be -
tween securities denominated in euro, US 
dollars, the currencies of the other advanced 
economies16 and the currencies of emerging 
and developing economies (rest of the 
world). A shift away from euro- denominated 
securities towards shares and debt securities 
denominated in foreign currency, especially 
the currencies of emerging and developing 
economies, generates exchange rate risk 
and consequently raises the riskiness of the 
securities portfolio, all other things being 
equal.
– Average maturity of the portfolio of debt se -
curities:17 If the portfolio has a longer matur -
ity, interest rate risk is higher, which also 
means that the portfolio of debt securities 
involves greater risk.
The above chart summarises the results broken 
down by issue currency. Developments in the 
portfolio composition of listed shares were 
fairly mixed across all sectors. The percentage 
of shares denominated in euro fell slightly for 
investment funds; it came down perceptibly for 
households and very sharply for insurance cor -
porations and pension funds. For investment 
funds, the significance of shares denominated 
in the currencies of the other advanced econ -
omies and emerging and developing econ -omies also fell noticeably. Conversely, the port -

15 In principle, the SHSS also include information on the 
investment fund shares or units held by institutional sec -
tors. As these are almost exclusively issued by euro area 
issuers and denominated in euro, an analysis provides little 
information. In addition, investment fund shares are ultim -
ately indirect investments in a securities portfolio which is 
observed in the form of the assets side of the investment 
fund. There is currently no euro area- wide database avail -
able for credit institutions’ lending.

rose for these sectors. Among credit institu -
tions and other financial intermediaries, by 
contrast, euro- denominated securities gained 
weight significantly. Looking at other financial 
intermediaries, US dollar- denominated shares 
also saw perceptible growth. Meanwhile, the 
significance of paper denominated in the cur -
rencies of the other advanced economies fell 
distinctly. Among credit institutions, in return, 
the weight of shares from the three other cur -
rency blocs rose by roughly the same volume. 
There were no major shifts in the portfolios of 
non- financial corporations.
Looking at debt securities, a shift in portfolio 
shares away from euro- denominated bonds to -
wards paper issued in US dollars or in the cur -
rencies of the other advanced economies is in 
evidence across virtually all sectors. Other fi -
nancial intermediaries are the sole exception. 
Here, the significance of euro- denominated 
debt securities rose perceptibly, while the port -
folio share of US dollar bonds fell noticeably. At the same time, the percentage of bonds by 
euro area issuers fell, while the significance of 
debtors from the United States and other ad -
vanced economies rose. These developments 
suggest that debtors resident in the United 
States and the other advanced economies is -
sued large volumes of euro- denominated 
bonds. Among households and investment 
funds, a fairly significant percentage of the 
growth in US dollar-  denominated bonds can 
be attributed to debtors in emerging and de -
veloping economies.
The average maturity of the portfolio of debt 
securities rose markedly for investment funds 
and households (see the adjacent chart). 
Among non- financial corporations and insur -
ance corporations and pension funds, the rise 
was only small. By contrast, average maturity 
fell for credit institutions and other financial 
intermediaries.
All in all, the risk content of the securities port -
folios held by insurance corporations and pen -
sion funds as well as those of investment funds 
is likely to have risen somewhat (see the box on 
pp. 31 to 33 for a detailed analysis of invest -
ment funds’ investment patterns).18 This is sug -
gested mainly by the higher average maturity 
of debt securities and the associated interest 
rate risk.19 Another factor that may have in -
creased the riskiness of the portfolio is the 
greater focus on shares denominated in foreign 
currency and debt securities issued by debtors 
outside of the euro area. However, the result -
ing exchange rate risk can, in principle, be 
hedged. In addition, the higher borrower risk 
as a result of a greater weight of bonds issued 
by emerging markets and developing countries 
has to be weighed up against the advantages Shift from euro-

18 The European Central Bank’s Financial Stability Review

shift in the portfolios of investment funds as well as insur -
ance corporations and pension funds towards less liquid 
bonds with worse ratings. See European Central Bank 
(2019a), Chapter 4.

Procyclical behaviour of institutional investment funds1
Institutional funds manage the assets of a 
small number of institutional investors, usu-
ally smaller banks and insurers, but also 
pension funds, foundations and churches. 
In Germany, institutional funds are set up as 
specialised funds. These differ from retail 
funds in that they are only open to experi-
enced (institutional) investors, often have 
more fl  exible investment mandates and pre-
scribe longer redemption notice periods for 
fund shares. Institutional funds account for 
the bulk of German investment funds and, 
in February 2020, managed 78% of their 
total investment volume.
Institutional funds’ search for yield
An evaluation of German institutional bond 
funds and mixed funds with investments in 
euro- denominated bonds shows that these 
funds signifi  cantly increased the level of risk 
in their bond portfolios between November 
2009 and June 2017, the period under ob-
servation.2 The average bond credit rating 
went down by two rating grades, from AA+ 
to AA- (S&P scale). At the same time, aver-
age duration as a measure of interest rate 
risk increased by just under one year. The 
period under observation was shaped by falling and negative interest rates as well as 
declining risk premia. It is therefore reason-
able to assume that the rise in risk- taking 
was driven by a search for yield in the con-
text of falling interest rates.
In order to separate the intentional increase 
in portfolio risk from pure valuation effects, 
the search for yield is measured by the 
change in the total portfolio return as a re-
sult of active portfolio reallocations from 
one month to the next. Using this measure, 
a transaction- related increase in the total 
portfolio return is equated with an intensi-
fi  ed search for yield. According to this 
measure, the search for yield was especially 
pronounced in the period from 2012 to 
2015, during which the majority of funds 
increased the level of risk in their portfolios 
(see the adjacent chart).
Regression analyses show that this measure 
of the search for yield increases when the 
interest rate level decreases.3 If the interest 
rate on bonds held for interest rate risk in-
curred falls by 1 percentage point, institu-
tional funds purchase bonds in the follow-
1 Findings are based on the research paper by Barbu, 
Fricke and Mönch (2020).
2 This evaluation is based on data on specialised funds 
from the Bundesbank’s investment funds statistics for 
the period from November 2009 to June 2017. The 
study focuses on bond funds and mixed funds with 
investments in bonds in order to be able to make rep-
resentative statements about institutional funds’ 
search for yield in the bond market. Funds with differ-
ent investment priorities, such as equity funds or real 
estate funds, whose primary focus is not on bonds, are 
explicitly excluded from this analysis. For more details, 
see Barbu, Fricke and Mönch (2020).
3 The interest rate level and bond prices have an in-
verse relationship. Procyclicality is based on price de-
velopments, meaning that there is also an inverse rela-
tionship between the search for yield and the interest 
rate level.Search for yield*

ing month with yields that are, on average, 
42 basis points higher. Following an equiva-
lent change in credit risk, funds invest in 
bonds with yields that are 16 basis points 
higher.
The investment behaviour of the funds 
under observation is therefore procyclical. 
On average, the funds increase their share 
of riskier bonds when their prices rise and 
reduce their share of riskier bonds when 
their prices fall.Interest rate volatility attributable to the 
search for yield
Such procyclical behaviour can theoretically 
lead to increased interest rate volatility.4 For 
an empirical analysis of this effect, excess 
returns in the bond market are analysed. 
Excess returns are defi  ned here as the dif-
ference between the percentage change of 
a bond price over one month and the one- 
month risk- free interest rate.
Using granular data on securities from the 
securities holdings statistics, this effect can 
be examined empirically. To this end, the 
monthly excess returns of all European cor-
porate and government bonds are re-
gressed on the net purchases of these 
bonds by German institutional funds in the 
previous month. This involves controlling 
for the corresponding net purchases by 
other sectors, such as credit institutions, in-
surers and pension funds. The regression 
analysis shows that institutional funds have 
a strong infl  uence on the excess returns of 
bonds, particularly those bonds with lower 
ratings or longer maturities that are in 
higher demand among funds. The effect is 
stronger and more persistent for bonds that 
are sought after by funds with particularly 
aggressive portfolio adjustments. For funds 
in the top quantile of the distribution of the 
search for yield over the past six months, 
the impact on the excess return declines 
slowly over a period of 12 months (see the 
chart above, upper panel). By contrast, for 
funds in the bottom quantile, in which se-
curities sales are the dominant force, there 
is no demonstrable effect after three to four 
months (see the chart above, lower panel).

Incentives in the fund sector promote 
the search for yield
Given their stable liabilities compared with 
retail funds, the procyclicality of institutional 
funds’ investment behaviour initially seems 
puzzling. This behaviour can, however, be 
empirically attributed to implicit incentives 
for fund managers and explicit yield targets.
Implicit incentives for a risky investment 
strategy arise when investors penalise a less 
risky investment strategy.5 Institutional 
funds with a comparatively low search for 
yield within the sector, are, at 0.84% per 
month, three times as likely to have their 
mandate terminated by investors than 
funds which search the most aggressively 
for yield (0.27%) (see the chart above). This 
effect reverses, however, in times of in-
creased fi  nancial market stress and corres-
pondingly higher risk aversion among fund 
investors, who then increasingly terminate 
their investment mandates with the funds 
which were previously operating compara-
tively aggressively.
Explicit yield targets for fund managers also 
fuel the search for yield, particularly in a 
negative interest rate environment. Such 
targets are in place, inter alia, for funds 
which offer a guaranteed return on the 
capital supplied by investors. Correspond-
ingly, the portfolios of guarantee funds are 
less risky compared with the portfolios of 
other specialised funds, since guarantee 
funds try to use their investments to elimin-
ate losses for their investors. However, 
negative interest rates pose a challenge for 
guarantee funds in terms of being able to 
honour their guarantees. Investment strat-
egies therefore have to be adjusted in some 
cases to be able to ensure value retention 
or asset appreciation. It can be demon-
strated empirically that guarantee funds, in 
comparison with specialised funds, are much more inclined to search for yield as 
the share of negative- yield bonds in their 
portfolios increases.

afforded by greater risk diversification. For 
households and non- financial corporations, 
this development is visible in slightly weaker 
form. However, securities make up only a small 
percentage of total financial assets in these 
two sectors. As a result, the changes have little 
impact on the riskiness of the portfolio as a 
whole. The risk content of the securities port -
folio as a whole is likely to have remained 
roughly constant for credit institutions and 
other financial intermediaries.
The influence of monetary 
policy on sectoral portfolio 
composition
One hypothesis repeatedly expressed in public 
discourse is that it is monetary policy that is pri -
marily responsible for low interest rates, thereby 
forcing investors to take on greater risks. Build -
ing on the descriptive overview in the previous 
chapter, this section will analyse that hypoth -
esis on the basis of two questions: first, how 
does an exogenous change in the monetary 
policy stance (monetary policy shock) influence 
sectoral portfolio composition in the euro area 
in general? Second, to what extent has monet -
ary policy contributed to the changes in invest -
ment portfolios documented above? For the 
following assessment, it should be noted that 
the estimates analyse solely the extent to which 
unexpected changes in the monetary policy 
stance influence portfolio composition. By con -
trast, if the Eurosystem implements measures 
to respond to economic developments or to a 
structural decline in the interest rate level, then 
these effects are not attributed to monetary 
policy. The box on pp. 35 to 37 provides a de -
tailed description of the econometric approach 
used to derive the results.

Empirical approach for quantifying the effects of monetary 
policy shocks on sectoral portfolio composition
Measuring the causal infl  uence of monetary 
policy on portfolio composition requires 
identifi  cation of exogenous changes in the 
monetary policy stance. These are defi  ned 
as changes in the monetary policy stance 
that market participants were not expect-
ing, referred to as monetary policy shocks. 
These are distinct from changes in the mon-
etary policy stance in response to past, 
present or expected developments that 
market participants were already anticipat-
ing. Only in the fi  rst case would monetary 
policy actually be at the root of any corres-
ponding portfolio responses. In the second 
case, the cause would instead lie in the 
changing economic setting, to which mon-
etary policy systematically responds within 
the framework of its monetary policy reac-
tion function.
In keeping with the literature, our identifi  -
cation of monetary policy shocks is based 
on high- frequency fi  nancial market data.1 
This involves measuring changes in market 
rates surrounding what is known as an 
event window.2 Specifi  cally, we are looking 
at the period from shortly before publica-
tion of the press release on monetary policy 
decisions to just after the press conference 
following the meetings of the ECB Govern-
ing Council. This is in line with the bounds 
defi  ned in the approach taken by Altavilla et 
al. (2019). The underlying identifi  cation as-
sumption is that all interest rate changes 
occurring within this selected event win-
dow are attributable to unexpected monet-
ary policy- related announcements. These 
rate changes are then used as external in-
strumental variables in the econometric es-
timations. This enables us to identify 
changes in the monetary policy stance as a 
result of an exogenous monetary policy 
shock. The short- term shadow rate of Gei-ger and Schupp (2018) serves as a compos-
ite indicator for the monetary policy stance. 
Since the shadow rate combines informa-
tion on short- term and long- term interest 
rate movements, it responds to both stand-
ard and non- standard monetary policy 
measures, provided these are refl  ected in 
the yield curve. This allows, for example, for 
account to be taken of the fact that the 
non- standard monetary policy measures im-
plemented in recent years impacted the 
long end of the yield curve in particular.
In concrete terms, we estimate the infl  u-
ence of monetary policy on portfolio alloca-
tion using local projections as propounded 
by Jordà (2005) with instrumental variables 
(LP- IV).3 In the fi  rst step, the shadow rate is 
regressed on the previously identifi  ed mon-
etary policy shocks.4 The estimation results 
are then used to calculate predicted values 
for the shadow rate.5 These forecasts depict 
the changes in the shadow rate that can be 
ascribed purely to monetary policy shocks. 
The second step uses these forecasts to 
1 See Gürkaynak et al. (2005) and Gertler and Karadi 
(2015).
2 The Euro Area Monetary Policy Event Database 
serves as our data basis here. For more information, 
see Altavilla et al. (2019).
3 Current analyses that apply this method include, for 
example, Ramey and Zubairy (2018) and Jordà et al. 
(2019).
4 The shock time series is identifi  ed analogously to the 
split- sample method of Swanson (2017). Up to the end 
of 2013, unexpected changes in the one- year OIS rate 
around the time of monetary policy meetings are de-
fi  ned as monetary policy shocks. From 2014 onwards, 
however, reference is made to unexpected changes in 
the ten- year OIS rate. This accounts for the non- 
standard monetary policy measures, which affect the 
long end of the yield curve in particular. For a similar 
approach, see, for example, Tillmann (2019). The inter-
est rate changes are drawn from the database of Al-
tavilla et al. (2019).
5 Applying the test of Olea and Pfl  ueger (2013), the 
effective F- statistics of the estimations in the fi  rst step 
all exceed their critical value. The null hypothesis re-
garding weak instruments can thus be rejected in each 
case.Deutsche Bundesbank

volves estimating a series of equations in 
which the changes in the sectoral portfolio 
shares of the various specifi  c fi  nancial in-
struments are regressed on the estimated 
shadow rate values. These equations are 
calculated for different lags in the shadow 
rate in comparison with the dependent vari-
ables. The function of the shadow rate’s re-
gression coeffi   cients for each lag calculated 
in this way then corresponds to the re-
sponse of the particular sectoral portfolio 
share to the monetary policy shock for the 
response horizon in question. It can be in-
terpreted as the impulse- response function 
of the dependent variables in reaction to 
the monetary policy shock. Data taken from 
the fi  nancial accounts serve as the basis 
here. As a general rule, monthly data is 
used. Where these are unavailable, quar-
terly values are linearly interpolated. Separ-
ate estimations are carried out for each of 
the following sectors and instruments:6
– sectors: non- financial corporations, 
credit institutions (including money mar-
ket funds), investment funds, other fi  -
nancial intermediaries, insurance corpor-
ations and pension funds, households 
(including non- profi  t institutions serving 
households);7
– instruments: deposits, debt securities, 
loans, equity, investment fund shares, in-
surance claims.8
As in the approach to the descriptive docu-
mentation of developments, a distinction is 
drawn between portfolio shares at market 
prices and portfolio shares at book values. 
Changes in the portfolio shares at market 
prices trace back to both valuation- related 
and transaction- related portfolio shifts. The 
portfolio shares at book values, on the other hand, change only through 
transaction- related portfolio shifts. The dif-
ference between the calculated changes in 
the portfolio shares at market prices and at 
book values approximates the infl  uence of 
valuation- driven portfolio allocation. Com-
bined, this results in the following estima-
tion equations:
First regression step: estimation of instru-
mental variables
ssr t=µ+'inst t+!qX
s=1Xts+⌘t
where ssrt is the short- term shadow rate, µ 
is a constant, instt is the high- frequency 
change in the market interest rate, Xt is a 
vector with control variables,9 ηt is an error 
term and t is the time index. This estimation 
equation is used to generate predicted val-
ues for cssr t, which are then input into the 
estimation equations of the second regres-
sion step.

residuals in each case.
7 Sector groupings are based on the defi  nitions used 
in ESA 2010.
8 Again, classifi  cations are based on the defi  nitions 
used in ESA 2010. Deposits correspond to the instru-
ment “cash and deposits” and insurance claims to the 
instrument “insurance, pension and standardised guar-
anteed schemes”.
9 Specifi  cally, the following control variables are in-
cluded: real GDP growth, infl  ation rate, growth in real 
house prices and the real oil price as well as lagged 
values for the dependent variables. The lag length is 
q = 5 .
10 So that the estimation uncertainty of the fi  rst step 
is accounted for in the second step, the sum of the 
squared error terms is corrected accordingly.Deutsche Bundesbank

monetary policy shock.20 According to the 
chart, the portfolio share of equity at market 
prices (sum of transaction- related and 
valuation- related changes: “Total”) experiences 
a statistically significant rise in all sectors – with 
the exception of other financial intermediar -
ies – in response to an expansionary monetary 
policy shock. Amongst insurance corporations 
and pension funds, the proportion of invest -
ment fund shares also rises. In addition, there is 
a significant increase in the portfolio share of 
deposits of investment funds and credit institu -
tions. For the latter, this should be particularly 
attributable to the fact that the non-  standard 
monetary policy measures (targeted longer-  
term refinancing operations and asset pur -
chases) are usually associated with an expan -
sion of (risk- free) excess liquidity held as de -
posits.21 Although these measures have only 
been implemented since 2014/ 15, their impact 
appears to dominate the entire estimation 
period.22 By contrast, the portfolio share of 
debt securities generally sees a statistically sig -nificant decline. In this case, too, other finan -
cial intermediaries are the sole exception. Fur -
thermore, there is a statistically significant de -
crease in the share of deposits amongst insur -
ance corporations and pension funds as well as 
households. By contrast, the portfolio share of 
loans falls among credit institutions.23for sector j, αh is a constant, cssr t is the ad-
justed values for the shadow rate from the 
fi  rst regression step, Xt is the vector with 
control variables used previously, εt is an 
error term and t is the time index. The vari-
able h can take a value between 0 and 12. 
This yields a local projection spanning a 
period of 12 months. As the error terms can 
be auto- correlated due to the nature of the 
design, Newey- West standard errors are 
used. The estimation period extends from 
the beginning of 1999 to mid- 2019. The 
estimations  are calculated separately for 
both valuation methods. The local projec-
tions illustrate responses to an expansionary 
monetary policy shock across all sectors and 
fi  nancial instruments. The shock is stand-
ardised to an unexpected reduction in the 
shadow rate of 25 basis points. Six sectors, 
six instruments and two valuation methods thus yield a total of 72 stylised impulse- 
response functions.
20 For reasons of clarity, the impulse-  response functions 
are not shown individually, but are consolidated in the 
form of the chart. As this concerns adjustments within 
each sectoral portfolio, the portfolio shifts of the individual 
financial instruments must necessarily balance each other 
out overall. In line with this, statistical tests show that the 
sum of the sectoral portfolio shifts is not significantly differ -
ent from zero for any of the observed sectors.
21 Consistent with this, Andrade et al. (2016) show that 
the APP reduced risk for credit institutions domiciled in the 
euro area.
22 In line with this explanation, deposits lose their statis -
tical significance if the estimation period is restricted to the 
years 1999 to 2010.
23 It should be noted here that this development is not 
synonymous with a reduction in lending. Instead, the ab -
solute inflows to deposits exceed the respective inflows to 
credit claims (and debt securities). This results in a corres -
ponding rise or fall in the portfolio share.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
April 2020  
37

Furthermore, the estimations suggest that 
valuation- related changes to the portfolio struc -
ture triggered by market price volatility gener -
ally account for a large part of the overall ef -
fect.24 At the same time, the valuation-  related 
shifts are often counteracted by transaction-  
related changes. This relationship is especially 
pronounced amongst institutional investors 
such as investment funds and other financial 
intermediaries. In this way, as a result of an ex -
pansionary monetary policy shock, the propor -
tion of equity in investment funds’ portfolios 
rises considerably due to relative market price 
changes. In turn, they counteract this through a 
transaction- related reduction of the portfolio 
share. This behaviour is indicative of active port -
folio rebalancing, which is carried out to com -
pensate for market price- related disturbances in 
the balance of the portfolio.25 Amongst other 
financial intermediaries, the portfolio share of 
loans falls considerably due to relative market 
price fluctuations. By contrast, all other things 
being equal, transaction- related portfolio shifts 
increase their significance in the portfolio. As a 
result, there is no significant change in the share 
of loans. These opposing developments could 
be linked to the securitisation of credit claims.
Overall, the results suggest that the portfolio 
composition shifts towards equity in response 
to an expansionary monetary policy shock. As 
this form of investment is comparatively risky, 
the results can be seen as evidence of monet -
ary policy being transmitted via the risk- taking 
channel.26 Through this transmission channel, 
monetary policy measures influence investors’ 
risk perception and risk tolerance.27 In turn, this Valuation- 
related portfolio 
shifts are quanti -
tatively more 
significant and 
are partially off -
set by opposing 
transactions

changes their investment behaviour and ultim -
ately the composition of their portfolios, too. In 
the event of expansionary monetary policy 
measures, this leads to a rise in risk appetite 
and causes portfolios to be reallocated to 
higher- yielding forms of investment.28
The results described above show, in stylised 
form, how a standardised monetary policy 
shock would affect portfolio composition. 
However, they do not provide any information 
on the extent to which monetary policy shocks 
have affected the portfolio shifts that have ac -
tually been observed during the period of low 
interest rates. To assess this impact, two scen -
arios were compared for each sector and each 
instrument.29 In the first scenario, the monetary 
policy shocks are explicitly taken into account.30 
In the second scenario, it is instead assumed 
that no monetary policy shock occurred. The 
difference between the two scenarios is then 
interpreted as the stylised impact of monetary 
policy. All of the sectoral portfolio shifts in the 
period from the first quarter of 2010 to the 
third quarter of 2019, as well as the stylised im -
pact of monetary policy shocks, are depicted in 
the chart on p.  38. The figures suggest that 
monetary policy shocks are generally respon -
sible for just a small proportion of the portfolio 
changes. Only in isolated cases – such as that 
of equity in the portfolios of investment funds 
and households – is the impact of monetary 
policy shocks the predominant factor. Overall, 
it seems that monetary policy shocks have a ra -
ther limited effect on the change in the com -
position of the portfolios of institutional invest -
ors in the euro area during the low interest 
period.
Summary and integration 
of the results
A low interest rate level, all other things being 
equal, creates an incentive for investors to shift 
their portfolios towards riskier forms of invest -
ment. In this context, investors essentially have 
two options for taking on greater risk. The first option is to increase their risk within a given 
instrument category. Various analyses show 
that, in recent years, non- bank financial inter -
mediaries in particular increasingly purchased 
securities from riskier issuers.31 A shift in lend -
ing towards riskier borrowers during periods of 
low interest rates has also been widely docu -
mented among credit institutions.32 The second 
option is for investors to rebalance their entire 
portfolios towards riskier instruments. For ex -
ample, this would be the case if investors re -
place safe bank deposits with riskier shares.
To expand upon the existing findings, this art -
icle analysed the extent to which the overall 
portfolios of the institutional sectors in the 
euro area have changed during the low interest 
rate period, which has been ongoing since 
around 2010. This revealed that the portfolios 
have not developed uniformly across sectors. A 
shift towards riskier instruments is evident for 
insurance corporations and pension funds as 
well as for other financial intermediaries. Both 
of these sectors reduced the share of safe de -
posits in their overall portfolios. In return, insur -
ance corporations and pension funds increased 
the proportion of investment fund shares. 
Among the other financial intermediaries, it 
was chiefly the proportion of equity that saw Monetary policy

28 Likewise in keeping with these theoretical consider -
ations, Boneva et al. (2019) show that, since the beginning 
of the APP , investors have shifted their securities portfolios 
towards riskier bonds. Furthermore, they conclude that in -
vestors rebalance their portfolios in response to interest 
rate changes to a greater extent than before.
29 When interpreting the figures, it should be noted that 
this is only an approximate estimation of the contribution 
of an unexpected monetary policy shock and that interde -
pendencies could not be taken fully into account. To this 
extent, these figures are subject to a certain degree of un -
certainty.
30 In order to obtain as complete a picture of monetary 
policy communication as possible, unexpected interest rate 
changes on days on which all ECB presidents to date gave 
a speech were also taken into consideration alongside un -
expected interest rate changes in the periods surrounding 
monetary policy meetings. This helps to assess the impact 
of monetary policy more precisely, as, especially in recent 
years, a large number of unexpected changes in monetary 
policy occurred in close proximity to speeches held by the 
ECB president.

an increase. By contrast, the portfolios of credit 
institutions and, in particular, households 
moved towards less risky instruments. Both of 
these sectors reduced the share of debt secur -
ities holdings. On the other hand, low- risk in -
surance claims in particular gained significance 
among households. Credit institutions in -
creased the weighting of risk- free deposits held 
as excess liquidity with the Eurosystem. The 
shifts in the portfolio composition of invest -
ment funds and non- financial corporations 
were largely risk- neutral.
In conjunction with the findings from the exist -
ing literature, it is possible to obtain a compre -
hensive picture of the changes in riskiness in 
the sectoral portfolios. In this vein, as shown 
above, insurance corporations and pension 
funds as well as other financial intermediaries 
rebalanced their overall portfolios towards risk -
ier instruments. In addition, as previously docu -
mented in a variety of studies, securities port -
folios have shifted towards riskier paper. On 
the whole, this reinforces the indications of in -
creased risk- taking in both of these sectors. 
Amongst insurance corporations and pension 
funds, high nominal interest rate guarantees 
are likely to be chiefly responsible for this.33 In 
this way, the lower interest rate level causes the 
duration of liabilities to increase to a greater 
extent than the duration of claims, which 
widens what is known as the duration gap. In 
order to close this gap, insurance corporations 
and pension funds can purchase bonds with 
longer maturities. However, the documented 
substitution of short- term deposits by invest -
ment fund shares in this sector can, in a broader 
sense, also be interpreted as an increase in the duration of the overall portfolio. By contrast, 
among the less heavily regulated other finan -
cial intermediaries, there are many indications 
that their increased risk- taking represents a 
search for yield in the narrower sense. Among 
credit institutions, the studies cited above sug -
gest a positive relationship between low inter -
est rates and the granting of risky loans. Con -
trary to this, the analysis of the changes to 
credit institutions’ overall portfolios conducted 
here provides no indication of a shift towards 
riskier instruments. This also holds true for 
households, investment funds and non-  
financial corporations.
This report also analysed the impact of monet -
ary policy on shifts in sectoral portfolio com -
position. The empirical estimates showed, in 
the form of impulse- response functions, that 
expansionary monetary policy shocks shift the 
sectoral portfolios towards riskier forms of in -
vestment, such as equity. However, if the total 
portfolio changes are compared with the port -
folio adjustments that have been triggered by 
monetary policy shocks since 2010, then these 
reactions seem modest. Nevertheless, the ob -
served portfolio adjustments could be funda -
mentally attributable to the persistently low 
interest rate level. However, the latter is more 
likely a result of structural changes. In this con -
text, these include, in particular, demographic 
trends, changes in income distribution, declin -
ing trend growth, and growing demand for 
safe forms of investment.Increased search

The EU budget and its financing:  
looking back and ahead
The EU budget is the joint budget of the European Union (EU) Member States. It has so far 
amounted to roughly 1% of the gross national income of the EU. The budget is financed by con -
tributions from the Member States (own resources). There is no provision for extensive debt finan -
cing. The Member States’ returns reflect the EU’s policy priorities. By far the largest part of the 
budget is allocated to agricultural and cohesion policy. Agricultural policy focuses on bolstering 
the income of farmers. The aim of cohesion policy is to promote economic convergence within 
the EU. Funds are therefore channelled primarily into economically weaker Member States. A 
smaller amount of spending is dedicated to areas with a more pronounced pan- European focus. 
These areas include internal and external security, international cooperation and development 
aid, the environment and research.
The multiannual financial framework for 2021 to 2027 is currently being prepared. Negotiations 
are proving difficult. Amongst other things, the funding gap created by Brexit has to be plugged. 
Moreover, the EU budget is expected to help meet the European climate targets. On top of this, 
there is the recent coronavirus pandemic, which is posing an exceptional challenge for the Mem -
ber States and the EU. In relation to the EU budget, the pandemic has mainly led to stabilisation 
measures which are simply a temporary addition to the regular framework. This article discusses 
the measures that have already been agreed. However, it focuses on the structure of the EU 
budget to date and the reform debate, leaving aside more recent events.
On the revenue side of the EU budget, the Member States’ contributions are largely based on 
economic size. Its financing is fairly complex and opaque, however. In order to change this, the 
rebate system could be made much simpler and the VAT- based own resource, which is subject to 
complicated rules, could be replaced by resources linked to gross national income. At least some 
of the revenue from common European instruments which target EU- wide environmental impacts, 
such as the EU Emissions Trading System, could flow to the EU budget.
The EU budget is used mainly on the expenditure side to redistribute funds between the Member 
States. This hinges on the varying returns from agricultural and cohesion policy. On the whole, the 
negotiation process is cumbersome and is often dominated by the Member States’ consideration 
of their own net contribution. This tends to be to the detriment of expenditure with a stronger 
European focus. One option worth considering might be to separate the aspects of redistribution 
and support for economically weaker regions more distinctly from the programme areas of the 
EU budget. This could potentially lead to a more targeted debate about what spending should 
occur at the European level.
The negotiations to date have indicated that the “Brexit gap” is likely to be closed on both the 
revenue and expenditure side. Germany has signalled that, as a strong economic performer, it is 
willing to make higher net contributions. One particular issue that remains unresolved at present 
is the extent to which measures to contain the coronavirus crisis should be taken via the EU 
budget.Deutsche Bundesbank

The multiannual financial 
framework of the EU 
budget: an overview
This article describes the EU budget and its fi -
nancing, both looking back over past planning 
periods and looking ahead to its future design. 
At present, the coronavirus pandemic is con -
fronting the EU and its Member States with 
huge challenges. The health of the general 
population is the central concern, and exten -
sive measures to contain and manage the pan -
demic are being taken to protect it. This is oc -
curring primarily at the national level, but EU-  
wide cooperation is also increasingly taking 
shape. Furthermore, there is intense debate as 
to how the Member States and the EU as a 
whole should respond to the economic impact 
of the pandemic. The EU budget will also be 
involved in crisis resolution. So far, the meas -
ures adopted are mainly a temporary addition 
to the regular framework. The outcome of the 
debate remains to be seen. This article de -
scribes measures adopted thus far in connec -
tion with the coronavirus pandemic (see pp. 47 
to 49). However, it does not discuss the eco -
nomic implications of the pandemic and pos -
sible measures to manage them in future plans. 
It focuses on the current structure of the EU 
budget and on reforms that are under discus -
sion, leaving aside recent events.
The EU budget is the joint budget of the EU 
Member States. The multiannual financial 
framework (MFF) specifies its spending struc -
ture, maximum size and type of financing. It 
usually spans a period of seven years and forms 
the framework for the annual budget plans 
during that time. The Council of the European 
Union adopts the MFF on the basis of a Euro -
pean Commission proposal, after obtaining the 
consent of the European Parliament. The cur -
rent MFF is for 2014 to 2020.
The EU budget’s revenue is almost exclusively 
contributed by the Member States in the form 
of “own resources”. There is no provision for 
extensive debt financing.1 The types of own re -sources and the ceiling are first agreed at the 
EU level and then ratified by the national parlia -
ments. The ceiling is defined in relation to the 
gross national income (GNI2) of the EU Mem -
ber States3 and is currently set at 1.20%. The 
own resources ceiling is normally much higher 
than the annual expenditure ceilings. This 
allows the EU to meet its payment commit -
ments, even in the event of an unexpected 
economic downturn, say. In addition, there is a 
certain amount of scope to mobilise additional 
expenditure over and above the annual ex -
penditure ceilings in the face of unforeseen cir -
cumstances, without impinging on the own 
resources ceiling.4 Finally, this is a way to make 
provision for risks in connection with the EU’s 
lending.
On the expenditure side, the MFF lays down 
commitment appropriations and payment ap -
propriations.5 Commitment appropriations in -
dicate the maximum amount of the legal com -
mitments that may be made each year. In the 
current MFF, they are limited to an average of 
1.02% of EU GNI per year. Payment appropri -
ations represent the expected actual payments 
that the EU makes in a year. These payments, in 
turn, stem from legal commitments (commit -
ment appropriations) from the current and pre -Preliminary

1 The EU can, on a limited scale and for specific purposes, 
raise funds on the capital market and pass them on to indi -

lishes an annual overview of borrowing and lending activ -
ities as an annex to its Financial Report. For the latest fig -
ures, see European Commission (2019a), pp. 79-82.
2 GNI was defined as the reference variable for the EU 
budget. It differs from gross domestic product (GDP) by 
including the balance of primary income payable and re -
ceivable by residents. GNI thus encompasses the entire in -
come of all residents, regardless of whether it was gener -
ated domestically or abroad. The difference between a 
country’s GNI and GDP is generally small, but in Ireland and 
Luxembourg GDP is much higher than GNI.
3 The United Kingdom is still counted as an EU Member 
State in this article, unless otherwise stated.
4 In the current MFF, the “margin for unforeseen expend -
iture” instrument can be used for this.
5 The ceilings for commitment and payment appropri -
ations are fixed in absolute euro amounts. They increase in 
a given year by the unused funds from the previous year. If 
GNI developments are not as expected, the ceiling in billion 
euro continues to apply. This results in a changed ceiling as 
a percentage of GNI. The European Commission reports 
these technical adjustments in the annex to its annual 
Financial  Report.Deutsche Bundesbank

Measures in the EU budget in connection 
with the coronavirus pandemic
The coronavirus pandemic is having a major 
impact on the Member States of the EU, 
prompting European bodies to adopt deci-
sions and measures in an array of areas – 
some of them designed to mitigate the 
economic repercussions. These steps in-
clude extraordinary measures relating to the 
EU budget, which this report is focusing on. 
In addition to the resolutions already 
adopted in April 2020, further decisions 
have been mooted but are yet to be fi  rmed 
up. There is a high degree of uncertainty 
surrounding the precise extent to which the 
pandemic will impair economic develop-
ment. It is also unclear how the effects will 
be distributed over time and from a regional 
perspective.
Measures as part of the current budget
In March 2020, the European Commission 
launched the Coronavirus Response Invest-
ment Initiative (CRII). Its centrepiece is to 
allow Member States to retain unspent co-
hesion policy pre- fi  nancing, which repre-
sents a departure from the normal rules and 
gives the countries concerned access to 
additional liquidity totalling €8 billion.1 Fur-
thermore, fund resources can now be pro-
vided more swiftly. Available resources from 
the structural and investment funds can be 
used to respond to the coronavirus crisis in 
many different ways. One of the new as-
pects is the ability to provide small and 
medium- sized enterprises with working 
capital support. The European Commission 
anticipates that a total of €37 billion from 
these funds will be used under the initiative. 
In addition, the European Commission has 
made arrangements to expand the Solidar-
ity Fund to encompass public health emer-
gencies. This unlocks up to €800 million in 
the current year for Member States particu-larly hard hit by the pandemic. Other 
changes allow fi  nancial resources from the 
European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to 
be used for coronavirus- specifi  c purposes. 
The intention is for these resources to be 
used to support individuals who have lost 
their job and self- employed people who 
fi  nd themselves in fi  nancial diffi   culties.
At the beginning of April, the European 
Commission launched further concrete pro-
grammes for the current fi  scal year and 
made amendments, for example, to the 
European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. It 
also increased the liquidity and fl  exibility of 
cohesion policy and further reduced the ap-
plicable administrative constraints (CRII+). 
These modifi  cations enable crisis- related 
measures under the cohesion policy frame-
work to be 100% EU- funded, meaning that 
no national co- fi  nancing is necessary. It will 
also be possible to transfer resources be-
tween the different cohesion policy funds, 
i.e. the structure of the EU budget can devi-
ate from the original plan. In addition, re-
sources destined for specifi  c regions of one 
country can be redirected to other regions 
within that country, and expenditure can be 
focused on a small number of regions. This 
is to account for the fact that measures to 
tackle the coronavirus pandemic are not ne-
cessarily most urgently needed in the eco-
nomically weakest regions.
A further coronavirus- specifi  c measure will 
see €1 billion from the EU budget being 
provided as a guarantee to the European 
Investment Fund, with the aim of increasing 
incentives for banks to grant credit to busi-
1 This measure concerns the following four funds: the 
European Regional Development Fund, the European 
Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the European 
Maritime and Fisheries Fund.Deutsche Bundesbank

nesses. The European Commission antici-
pates that the guarantee will mobilise some 
€8 billion in fi  nancing for at least 100,000 
small and medium- sized enterprises in the 
EU. The EU budget is able to unlock the 
guarantee by deferring longer- term projects 
of the European Fund for Strategic Invest-
ment (EFSI).
Using a variety of budgetary operations, all 
funds still available under the current fi  nan-
cial framework are being reallocated, ultim-
ately unlocking an additional €3 billion in 
the current budget for fi  nancing coronavirus- 
related expenditure. For example, the Emer-
gency Support Instrument is being reacti-
vated and its scope of application broad-
ened. This is to be funded by mobilising the 
Flexibility Instrument and exhausting the 
Global Margin for Commitments. In add-
ition, more of the Contingency Margin is to 
be used than had previously been planned.
All in all, tackling the coronavirus pandemic 
represents the top priority in the fi  nal year 
of the current fi  nancial framework (2020). 
As things currently stand, the upper limits 
of the current fi  nancial framework remain 
unchanged, but a far greater portion of the 
planned resources will likely be called on 
than without these measures (entailing 
commensurately higher national contribu-
tions).
Measures concerning future planning 
periods
The fi  nancial framework for 2021 to 2027 is 
currently under discussion. It is not affected 
by the measures described above. However, 
the European Commission has announced 
that it will earmark considerable funds in 
the next framework for the purposes of 
curbing the economic repercussions of the 
pandemic.Also related to the EU budget, the Euro-
pean Commission has proposed the tem-
porary aid instrument SURE, which the 
Euro group has endorsed. The idea behind 
SURE is to swiftly provide EU countries with 
fi  nancial assistance of up to €100 billion in 
the form of low interest loans. These can be 
used to fi  nance actual or expected expenses 
related to maintaining employment during 
the coronavirus crisis (e.g. short- time work 
schemes). Countries making use of this bor-
rowing facility will not be required to com-
ply with any additional conditions; they will 
simply be expected –  like all Member 
States – to respect the recommendations of 
the European Semester. In order to fi  nance 
the loans, the European Commission will 
borrow on the capital market in the name 
of the EU. The EU countries are backing 
these loans by providing guarantees for 
25% of the total credit amount (i.e. up to 
€25 billion). The size of a Member State’s 
guarantee contribution is to be decided on 
the basis of the proportion of EU GDP that 
it accounts for. This would see Germany 
committing around €6 billion for interest 
and principal payments. In addition, the 
loans are to be backed by future EU 
budgets, again underpinned by each Mem-
ber State with its respective funding share. 
These guarantees mean that highly favour-
able interest conditions are to be expected. 
These will be passed on to the countries re-
ceiving the loans.
SURE is a new borrowing option at Euro-
pean level. It is limited in both duration and 
scope. Should any country be unable to ser-
vice its assistance loans and the guarantees 
of the EU countries prove insuffi   cient to 
cover this, future EU budgets would be 
placed under a fi  scal burden. For this rea-
son, buffers would need to be built into fu-
ture EU budgets. These will consist of an 
appropriately large margin between the 
own resources ceiling and the payment ap-Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
April 2020  
48

propriations ceiling. This buffer would en-
able interest and principal payments on 
bonds to be met without the need for re-
allocation of EU budgetary resources. SURE 
is to be constructed such that the annual 
interest and principal payments do not ex-
ceed €10 billion.
Besides this, the buffer would have to be 
large enough to cover the risks arising from 
the EU’s other borrowing options as well as 
the guarantees from the EU budget. In add-
ition to SURE, the existing balance of pay-
ments assistance facility for non- euro area 
countries is also to be used as a way of pro-
viding those countries with loans to assist 
them in dealing with the coronavirus crisis. 
Like SURE, this coronavirus- related support 
will probably also be granted without the 
imposition of additional conditions, 
whereas, in the past, use of the facility has 
always involved economic and fi  scal policy 
agreements.2
How the EU level should respond to the 
coronavirus pandemic in the various policy 
areas is currently the subject of intensive 
discussions. One possibility is for resources 
for crisis management to be planned into 
the EU budget in the next fi  nancial frame-
work. This could involve reducing other ex-
penses or (temporarily) scaling up Member 
States’ contributions to the EU budget. 
However, ideas for taking on mutualised 
debt at the European level on a very com-
prehensive scale and, in some cases, also 
on a more permanent basis in future – po-
tentially through recourse to an innovative 
new fi  nancing instrument – have also been 
put forward. This would entail substantive 
change for the fi  nancial relationships within 
the EU, though. In the EU and the euro 
area, responsibility for fi  scal and economic 
policy still lies, in large part, at the national 
level. A crucial point would be for the same 
set of shoulders to bear responsibility for fi  scal and economic policy and the liability 
for any risk arising therefrom. Should a fun-
damental shift at the European level prove 
desirable or be considered indispensable, 
this should consequently be transparently 
and legally anchored in a major step to-
wards further integration.
2 Euro area countries can apply for ESM credit lines. 
These are also fi  nanced through mutualised debt. 
However, since the ESM rests on an intergovernmental 
agreement, it does not give rise to a contingent liability 
for the EU budget.Deutsche Bundesbank

vious years. In the current MFF, payment ap -
propriations are budgeted at an average of 
0.96% of EU GNI per year, and are therefore 
lower than commitment appropriations, as is 
normally the case. One reason for this is that 
some of the commitments made are only paid 
out in subsequent years, when GNI has gener -
ally risen. Thus, for this expenditure, the 
budgeted payment appropriations as a per -
centage of GNI can be lower than the commit -
ment appropriations that were originally 
budgeted. Additionally, the scope for commit -
ment appropriations normally is not fully ex -
hausted.
The EU budget has so far amounted to around 
1% of EU GNI annually (around €160 billion). 
By contrast, government spending at the level 
of the Member States is considerably higher, at 
around 45% of EU GNI. This reflects the heavily 
decentralised fiscal policy approach in the EU.
Negotiations on the MFF for 2021 to 2027 have 
already been ongoing for some time.6 It is being 
prepared for just 27 countries now, as the 
United Kingdom withdrew from the EU on 
31 January 2020. The United Kingdom was a 
net contributor, meaning that it contributed 
more to financing the EU budget than it re -
ceived in return (for more on the implications of 
Brexit for the EU budget, see the box on pp. 51 
and 52).7 This has to be factored into the new 
MFF – by way of higher revenue from the re -
maining Member States or lower spending.
The European Commission originally proposed 
an average annual commitment ceiling of 
1.11% of EU27 GNI for the next MFF.8 Of this, 
0.03 percentage point is allocated to the Euro -
pean Development Fund, which is to form part 
of the EU budget under this proposal. Adjusted 
for the Fund, the proposed commitment ceiling 
is 1.08%. The potential payments to the EU27 
would thus be slightly lower than those envis -
aged for the EU27 in the current MFF (around 
1.13% of EU27 GNI). The loss of the United 
Kingdom’s net contributions would therefore 
be compensated for on both the expenditure and revenue side. The negotiations to date 
have featured countervailing calls for a larger 
EU budget and calls for a stronger limit. It re -
mains to be seen how the current coronavirus 
pandemic will affect the continuing negoti -
ations. The European Commission has an -
nounced a new proposal on the next MFF, 
which is to contain measures to overcome the 
economic impact of the pandemic. The “Euro -
pean Green Deal” announced by the Commis -
sion is also likely to be reflected in it. The Deal 
calls for at least 25% of budget funds to con -
tribute to climate objectives.
EU budget revenue
Status quo
The EU budget has just a few of its own rev -
enue sources and is funded primarily by contri -
butions from the Member States. The planned 
annual revenue has to cover the planned ex -
penditure. Differences that arise during imple -
mentation of the budget are carried over to the 
budget plan for the next year in an amending 
budget.
The EU budget draws its revenue predomin -
antly from traditional own resources, the value 
added tax (VAT)-based own resource and the 
GNI- based own resource.9 Their relative weight 
remained broadly unchanged between 2007 
and 2018 (see the chart on p. 53). Traditional EU budget much

6 The European Commission presented a first draft of the 
next MFF in May 2018. Since then, two revised drafts have 
followed, first from the Finnish Presidency of the Council in 
December 2019 and then from European Council President 
Michel in February 2020. The Commission announced a 
new proposal in response to the coronavirus pandemic, 
which was not yet available as this report went to press. 
This article discusses the original Commission proposal.
7 The United Kingdom’s net contribution (incl. customs du -
ties and administrative expenditure) on average between 
2014 and 2018 was just under €10 billion per year or 
0.08% of the EU27’s GNI.

9 Of relatively minor importance is revenue from the Euro -
pean competition authorities, e.g. from anti- trust penalties 
or fines for Member States which failed to meet the dead -
line for transposing EU law into national law. The same is 
true of contributions agreed with non- EU Member States.Deutsche Bundesbank

Rules governing the EU budget in the Withdrawal 
 Agreement with the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom left the European 
Union (EU) on 31 January 2020. The With-
drawal Agreement provides a transition 
period until 31 December 2020. Union law 
still predominantly applies in the United 
Kingdom during this period. In addition, it is 
agreed that both the United Kingdom and 
the EU will honour all fi  nancial obligations 
undertaken while the United Kingdom was 
a member of the EU.
Thus, the United Kingdom will continue to 
participate in the EU budget until the end of 
the current multiannual fi  nancial framework 
(end of 2020), as previously arranged. By 
contrast, the next fi  nancial framework for 
2021 to 2027 will be drawn up for the re-
maining 27 EU Member States. The United 
Kingdom will be able to participate in EU 
programmes in future just like other non- EU 
countries.1 In this case, the United Kingdom 
would have to make a fi  nancial contribu-
tion to the EU budget. The contribution 
amount and the scope of the cooperation 
would be negotiated separately.
The Withdrawal Agreement sets out in de-
tail how mutual obligations shall be fulfi  lled 
following the end of the transition period. 
The bulk of these obligations stem from 
“RAL” (from the French “reste à liquider”). 
RAL are appropriations committed that 
have not yet been paid. They are created 
when multi- annual projects are fi  nanced, 
such as the building of a bridge. According 
to the European Commission’s projections, 
RAL will stand at around €300 billion at the 
end of 2020.2 Usually these funds would be 
almost fully paid out over the course of the 
next fi  nancial framework and only a small 
proportion de- committed.3 The Withdrawal 
Agreement stipulates that the United King-
dom shall be liable for its share of RAL and further commitments in the amount of its 
fi  nancing share in the current fi  nancial 
framework that is still ongoing. Its share 
would be around 12%.4 In line with this, 
the United Kingdom would still have to 
make a gross payment of approximately 
€35 billion for RAL by the end of 2027. This 
corresponds to an annual average of 
roughly 0.2% of its gross national income 
(GNI) in 2019, with the largest share likely 
to be due within the fi  rst few years.5 Fur-
thermore, the United Kingdom contributes 
to payments in connection with pension 
entitlements of EU employees and contin-
gent liabilities that were entered into during 
its time as a Member State.6 In return, the 
United Kingdom receives retroactive EU 
budget revenue proportional to its fi  nan-
cing share (e.g. from fi  nes which were le-
gally imposed before 2021 or for the en-
forcement of which legal proceedings were 
opened before 2021). Since the “UK rebate” 
is paid out in the year after it is calculated, 
1 In particular, the other members of the European 
Economic Area (EEA) – Iceland, Norway and Liechten-
stein – and Switzerland have thus far made use of this 
option. For instance, Norway is involved in the EU’s 
cohesion policy and in selected EU programmes such 
as Erasmus, Galileo and Horizon 2020.
2 See European Commission (2019b).
3 In the current fi  nancial framework, 50% of RAL from 
the previous fi  nancial framework was called on in the 
fi  rst two years and over 80% in the fi  rst three years. 
The European Commission expected an almost com-
plete reduction by the end of 2019. See European 
Commission (2019b), p. 2.
4 This was the United Kingdom’s average own re-
sources share between 2014 and 2018.
5 The European Commission expects that only €6 
billion  of RAL will be de- committed by 2024. See 
European  Commission (2019b), p. 3. Part of the RAL 
(roughly 4%) is likely to result from projects in the 
United Kingdom, meaning that EU payments also fl  ow 
back there. Thus, in net terms, the United Kingdom’s 
average annual RAL spending would come to roughly 
0.14% of its 2019 GNI.
6 While no details are known, payment burdens from 
pension obligations are considerably lower than those 
from RAL. Darvas (2019) estimates that they will total 
€4 billion for the United Kingdom up until 2027.Deutsche Bundesbank

own resources had a share of roughly one-  
seventh in total revenue. They mainly consist of 
uniform EU- wide customs duties on imports to 
the single market. The Member States collect -
ing the customs duties retain a portion, which 
serves as flat- rate compensation for the costs 
of collection.10 Only traditional own resources 
stem from an original EU policy field, the EU 
Customs Union. The other types of resources, 
on the other hand, are financing contributions 
which the Member States make from their re -
spective budgets. The VAT- based own resource 
is based on a harmonised VAT tax base. It like -
wise made up around one- seventh of EU rev -
enue in the aforementioned period. The most 
important revenue item, accounting for five-  
sevenths, is based on the GNI of each Member 
State. The annual financing needs determine 
the contribution rate for the GNI- based own 
resource, meaning that the EU budget is bal -
anced at the planning stage and the specified 
ceilings are adhered to.On the revenue side, a complex system of re -
bates limits the financial burden on individual 
Member States which receive relatively low re -
turns from the EU budget. On balance, this is 
currently providing relief for the United King -
dom, the Netherlands, Sweden and Germany.11 
The “UK rebate” is the most well- known and, 
at just over 0.2% of UK GNI, also the largest 
rebate. The flat- rate reimbursement of customs 
collection costs is relatively large for the Neth -
erlands and Belgium because of their sizeable 
ports.12 However, the administrative expense is 
likely to be less significant given higher customs Correction 
mechanisms aim 
to prevent 
excessive bur -
dens on individ -
ual countriesthe United Kingdom will also receive around 
€5 billion in 2021 (0.2% of UK GNI in 2019). 
In particular, the burdens from contingent 
liabilities and the revenue shares from fi  nes 
cannot be reliably estimated. This is one 
reason why the exact level of payments be-
tween the United Kingdom and the EU is 
still unknown.
Under the terms of the Withdrawal Agree-
ment, the transition period can be extended 
once by up to two years. The United King-
dom would have to apply for an extension 
before 1 July 2020. In addition, the exten-
sion would have to be decided by common 
accord between the EU and the United 
Kingdom. In this case, the United King-
dom’s access to the EU single market would 
also be extended. It is envisaged that the 
United Kingdom would then pay contribu-
tions to the EU budget to compensate for 
this.7 The amount of these contributions would have to be negotiated with the ex-
tension. The next fi  nancial framework for 
the EU would be drawn up without the 
United Kingdom regardless of a potential 
extension.
7 Currently, there is also such a rule for non- EU coun-
tries which belong to the EEA. Their contributions to 
the EU budget are set out in the EEA agreement of 
1994.
10 In the current MFF, the flat- rate percentage of collection 
costs retained is 20% of customs revenue. In the previous 
MFF it was 25%.
11 All other things being equal, rebates for individual 
Member States increase the general GNI- based own re -
source, which all countries contribute on a pro rata basis. 
Denmark and Austria are also receiving rebates under the 
current MFF, but these are smaller than the payments to 
finance the rebates for the other countries.
12 In 2018 the flat- rate compensation for collection costs 
in Belgium and the Netherlands amounted to 0.11% and 
0.08% of national GNI, respectively, compared with an EU 
average of 0.03% of EU GNI.Deutsche Bundesbank

revenue. Therefore, the global compensation 
for collection costs is sometimes also seen as a 
hidden rebate for these countries.13
Reform debate
In its proposal for the next MFF, the European 
Commission suggests changing the system of 
own resources. It proposes a simpler method 
of calculating the VAT- based own resource. At 
present, this own resource is based on a special 
tax base which harmonises the various national 
definitions.14 The calculations are complex, and 
collection is an administrative burden. In fu -
ture, the European Commission wishes to use a 
simpler method of deriving the VAT- based own 
resource from national tax revenue and stand -
ard tax rates.15 For the sake of simplicity, it as -
sumes that the tax bases and tax rates have a 
similar structure in the individual countries. Fur -
thermore, the European Commission proposes 
tapping new revenue sources making up a total 
of 12% of the EU budget. To do so, it is bring -
ing two environmental taxes into play: 20% of 
national revenue from the EU Emissions Trading 
System and a new joint tax on non- recycled 
plastic. It also cites the financial transactions 
tax and the digital services tax as two other 
new European taxes which could be contrib -
uted (in part) to the EU budget in future. In 
addition, the Commission is proposing an EU 
corporate tax coming to 3% of a common con -
solidated corporate tax base.16 However, this 
would require the EU Member States to first 
harmonise the national tax bases for corporate 
tax. Additional revenue sources such as these 
would mean that less GNI- based own resources 
would be required.
In addition, the European Commission is pro -
posing that all rebates be eliminated and that 
the flat- rate compensation for collection costs 
for traditional own resources be halved to 10%. 
The UK rebate ends with the withdrawal of the 
United Kingdom from the EU in any case. The 
European Commission wishes to phase out the 
remaining rebates over a five- year period, to ensure that the net burden on the affected 
countries increases only gradually.
GNI- based contributions are based directly on 
an indicator of Member States’ economic per -
formance. This makes them a suitable revenue 
source for the EU budget where financing is to 
factor in the Member States’ varying levels of 
economic strength. One option that could be 
considered in order to simplify the system of 
own resources is replacing the VAT- based own 
resource entirely with GNI- based own re -
sources. The European Commission proposal to 
reform the VAT- based own resource would 
simplify the present calculation method, but 
the level of the VAT- based own resource would 
then depend on the structure of national tax 
rates and tax bases. It would thus be less 
geared towards economic strength. This would 
also give Member States opportunities to de -Discussion of

15 See European Commission (2018b), pp. 20 ff.
16 The proposed new types of own resources are not 
“real” EU taxes that are decided and levied by the EU. This 
would require a Treaty change, and the necessary unanim -
ity currently does not appear to exist. The High- Level Group 
on Own Resources established by the European Commis -
sion considers this kind of EU tax desirable, but is not pro -
posing such a tax under the present conditions. See High-

sign their VAT in a way that reduces their con -
tribution.17
Other proposed types of own resource that are 
less dependent on GNI have a weaker link to 
Member States’ economic strength. They should 
therefore have a clear European connection 
where possible. Customs duties are an ideal ex -
ample. EU customs duties are levied on imports 
into the EU Customs Union and cannot be allo -
cated to individual countries within the single 
market. One option that could be considered is 
to move away from deriving collection costs as 
a fixed percentage of customs revenue. Instead, 
the costs could be gauged and reimbursed 
more specifically where possible. This would 
eliminate potentially hidden rebates, and would 
boost the transparency of the EU budget.
Common European environmental levies can 
also have a European aspect to them. This is 
the case, in particular, if the environmental pol -
lution has an EU- wide impact and is not merely 
of regional or local importance. This applies to 
the EU Emissions Trading System, for example. 
It would thus be fairly plausible to transfer the 
revenue from this, at least on a pro rata basis, 
to the EU budget.
Finally, the system of rebates is currently very 
complex and makes the financing of the EU 
budget opaque. However, rebates could still be 
necessary in future to achieve political agree -
ment, for example to avoid high net contribu -
tions by individual countries. In this case, mak -
ing the rebate system simpler and more trans -
parent would be a welcome move. Harmon -
ised and generally applicable criteria for rebates 
would help here.18
EU budget expenditure
Status quo
In the current MFF, the EU budget comprises 
six overarching areas of expenditure (for the 
names and composition over time, see the table on p. 55). Agricultural policy accounts for 
the largest share, at 39% (see the chart on 
p.  56). The vast majority of this expenditure 
(just under three- quarters) serves primarily to 
safeguard farmers’ income. It constitutes direct 
payments based on area size, and measures to 
support agricultural markets (for the sake of 
simplicity, both will be referred to together as 
direct payments in the remainder of this text). 
The remaining portion of agricultural expend -
iture goes towards agricultural policy environ -
mental and research payments. These funds 
promote regional environmental policy meas -
ures as well as research, development and 
competitiveness in the agricultural sector.
The second largest expenditure item is cohe -
sion policy (34%), which aims to promote eco -
nomic, social and territorial cohesion in the EU. 
To this end, support is given to a wide range of 
project- based measures.19 In most cases, the 
Member States must also make a financial con -
tribution to the projects. The largest portion of 
cohesion funds flows to countries and regions 
whose economic performance is much lower 
than the EU average (see the chart on p. 57).20 Customs duties

17 For example, Member States could reduce their VAT-  
based own resource without decreasing national tax rev -
enue. To do this, they would have to raise the standard tax 
rate while reducing the associated tax base. The higher 
standard tax rate would lower the common tax base calcu -
lated according to the Commission’s new method. This is 
because the Commission’s method assumes a uniform 
share of the tax revenue resulting from the standard tax 
rate.
18 In a 2004 report, the European Commission discussed 
ceilings on the net amount relative to GNI and per capita 
GNI, for instance. See European Commission (2004), 
pp. 28 ff.
19 In the current MFF, the cohesion funds are being used 
to pursue 11 defined objectives to promote growth. These 
include: 1) objectives to enhance competitiveness, e.g. sup -
port for small and medium- sized enterprises; 2) environ -
mental objectives such as promoting sustainable mobil -
ity;  3) social objectives such as combatting poverty and 
discrimination.
20 Cohesion funds are largely disbursed via three funds: 
the European Regional Development Fund, the European 
Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund. The criteria for the 
granting of cohesion funds are defined in the MFF. Re -
sources from the first two funds are currently linked to the 
regions’ GDP per inhabitant (measured in purchasing 
power standards). By contrast, Cohesion Fund resources 
are granted based on the Member States’ GNI per inhabit -
ant (in purchasing power standards). This must be lower 
than 90% of the EU average.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
April 2020  
54

However, 15% of the cohesion funds are ear -
marked for regions whose per capita GDP is 
above the EU average.
Additionally, expenditure on research and infra -
structure projects of pan- European importance 
plays a role (13%). This includes support for re -
search and innovation as well as spending on 
the expansion of European transportation, en -
ergy and digital networks. This is followed by 
the categories of administration and external 
action (6% each). External action includes 
spending on humanitarian aid or development 
aid, for example. The remaining expenditure 
(2%) is allocated to security and citizenship 
measures, which includes spending on border 
control, immigration, asylum policy, healthcare 
and consumer protection, amongst other 
things.
Compared with the previous MFF (2007 to 
2013), the spending structure of the current EU 
budget is not radically different (see the chart on p.  56). However, there has been a shift 
away from agricultural and cohesion policy (-4 
and -2 percentage points, respectively) and to -
wards research and infrastructure (+5 percent -
age points).
Reform debate
The EU has a decentralised design and is based 
on the principle of subsidiarity. This prescribes 
that government tasks and the associated ex -
penditure are decentralised wherever possible. 
In this way, differing preferences in the provi -
sion of public goods, say, can be better taken 
into account. However, there are benefits to 
undertaking some spending jointly. This is 
sometimes referred to as European added value 
to spending.21 It can arise because a public ser -
vice can be rendered more cheaply when it is 
provided jointly. This kind of added value can Other expend -

also be created, in particular, when spending 
has a cross- border impact. It can (ideally) have 
positive effects across Europe (e.g. reducing 
environmental damage). In addition, a com -
mon budget can be used to support catching- 
up processes or for redistribution among Mem -
ber States.
It is not always possible to clearly determine 
the areas in which it is beneficial for spending 
to be undertaken jointly, and the division of re -
sponsibilities is ultimately a political decision. A 
number of factors tend to speak in favour of 
joint funding in the following areas of respon -
sibility:
– The administrative activities of the European 
Union serve all Member States, meaning 
that it is not only the Member States in re -
ceipt of the spending which reap the bene -
fits. This is an argument that supports joint 
financing. Administrative expenditure mainly 
comprises the staffing and operating costs 
of the various EU authorities.
– Development aid, asylum and immigration 
policy are other areas in which the EU might 
benefit from pursuing a joint strategy. Citi -
zens generally have a right to freedom of 
movement within the EU. It therefore seems important to optimise coordination in these 
areas.
– Defence policy and super- regional environ -
mental measures (such as those aimed at 
C02 emissions reduction or water conserva -
tion) can also be considered European tasks, 
as the benefits of such measures extend far 
beyond the Member State that adopts them. 
However, this is not the case for environ -
mental policy measures per se. Measures to 
reduce local fine particle pollution, say, 
should therefore be taken at the regional or 
local level instead – possibly on the basis of 
a common regulation with minimum stand -
ards.
– Basic research projects can benefit people 
throughout the whole of Europe. Besides 
this, cost advantages can arise when efforts 
are pooled. At the same time, this is bound 
to be of most benefit to countries in which 
the funds are spent, because expenditure on 
research can significantly enhance a region’s 
reputation and have positive repercussions 
for the surrounding areas.
– Cross- border infrastructure networks are 
also likely to benefit all the Member States 
involved. It may therefore be worth taking a 
coordinated approach to expanding them Areas of respon -
sibility with a

and, depending on the scope of the action, 
financing them jointly.
The examples listed above show that joint tasks 
generally make sense in areas that have an im -
pact far beyond the national borders of the 
countries involved. However, in some cases, a 
binding EU framework may also be enough to 
coordinate the efforts of the Member States. 
Examples of this are the limits on levels of ni -
trates in drinking water or of nitrogen oxide in 
the air. In other cases, a suitable alternative 
would be for individual countries to cooperate 
if, for instance, they were the countries most 
strongly impacted by external effects.
In the two major spending blocks of agricul -
tural and cohesion policy, the focus is likely to 
be less on the joint provision of a European 
public good in the above sense. On the whole, 
agricultural policy consists of direct payments 
which are mainly used to safeguard farmers’ in -
come.22 The EU’s agricultural policy is a contro -
versial topic overall.23 Only around one- quarter 
of agricultural spending is allocated to agricul -
tural policy environmental and research pay -
ments.
The aim of cohesion policy is to even out eco -
nomic disparities within the EU. To this end, 
funding is given to projects that aim to pro -
mote growth. Most of the funding flows to re -
gions which are economically weaker in terms 
of per capita income. As a result, cohesion pol -
icy displays elements of redistribution between 
Member States of differing economic strengths. 
At the same time, the funding is specifically in -
tended to help the economic catching-up pro -
cess. The scope of the redistribution is ultim -
ately a political decision. In this context, eco -
nomic convergence between Member States is 
a shared European objective.
However, empirical studies reach very different 
conclusions regarding the growth- enhancing 
effects of the EU’s cohesion policy.24 A small 
number of studies identify positive long- term 
growth effects. Others find only a short- term positive effect. But a large number of studies 
conclude that there is no (or even negative) 
correlation between the incentive measures 
and growth in the recipient Member States. 
The results vary depending on factors such as 
region, type of investment, and institutional 
conditions in the individual Member States.25 
Most studies agree that cohesion policy con -
tributes rather little to economic convergence.

22 Although direct payments are conditional on compli -
ance with environmental restrictions (cross- compliance), 
compliance with these legal requirements is mandatory in 
any event. They are therefore flat- rate payments rather 
than compensation for additional environmental efforts. 
See, inter alia, Heinemann and Weiss (2018).
23 For example, the European Court of Auditors is critical 
of the European Commission’s proposals to reform the 
common agricultural policy after 2020. One particular 
point of criticism is that direct payments will not help 
achieve the desired environmental and climate goals. See 
European Court of Auditors (2018).

policy areas with greater European added 
value. The European Commission has also for -
mulated this objective.26 To achieve it whilst 
keeping the size of the EU budget the same, 
spending on agricultural and cohesion policies 
would have to be reduced. Although the cur -
rent proposals envisage fairly sizeable shifts in 
this regard, they do not amount to a funda -
mental reorientation. In the Commission’s pro -
posal, the share of the two spending categor -
ies of direct payments and cohesion policy27 is 
down by just under 7 percentage points (see 
the chart on p. 56). The largest part of this cut 
is to direct payments, amounting to 6 percent -
age points. Nonetheless, at 56%, these two 
largest spending categories still clearly domin -
ate. The area of research and infrastructure is 
intended to receive the strongest boost. In 
addition, the share of spending on security and 
citizenship is set to rise from 2% to 5%.
Within the spending area of cohesion policy, 
the European Commission is proposing, for the 
first time, a separate budget instrument specif -
ically for the euro area countries. It would 
amount to around €17 billion, or 1.3% of the 
total budget of the next MFF. The Eurogroup 
agreed on the key points in December 2019. 
The new Budgetary Instrument for Conver -
gence and Competitiveness (BICC) is aimed at 
supporting the reforms and investment in the 
euro area that have been recommended within 
the framework of the European Semester. The 
Council of Ministers emphasises that the BICC 
will be a flexible instrument and that this is 
what primarily differentiates it from other EU 
budget programmes, whose objectives are set 
for seven years. Countries that do not partici -
pate in the BICC28 are to receive return flows 
from the Convergence and Reform Instrument 
(CRI) as compensation. However, the exact 
structure of the new instruments has not yet 
been determined.Financial links with the 
Member States
Development of payment 
flows with Germany
In the first five years of the current MFF (2014 
to 2018), Germany’s payments to the EU 
budget averaged 0.85% of Germany’s GNI, or 
€27 billion per year (see the chart on p. 59).29 
As a percentage of GNI, they were thus as high 
as in the first five years of the previous MFF. 
Over the previous budget period as a whole, 
however, the payments amounted to 0.89% of 
GNI per year because they had risen sharply in 
the last two years of the period. The reason for 
this rise was that expenditure on longer- term 
projects within the framework of cohesion pol -
icy is usually called on towards the end of the 
MFF period, in particular.30 Payments by the 
Member States to the EU budget then rise in 
line with this expenditure. A perceptible in -
crease such as this would also have been ex -
pected in 2019. However, Germany’s payments 
to the EU budget indicate that the volume of 
cohesion funding collected last year did not in -
crease.31 Nonetheless, significantly higher pay -
ments to the EU budget are to be expected in New MFF:

27 For better comparability with the current MFF, the EU 
programme Erasmus+ has been assigned to the category 
“Research and infrastructure” in this analysis. In the Euro -
pean Commission’s proposal for the next MFF, however, it 
is assigned to the category “Cohesion and values”, which 
also comprises traditional cohesion policy.
28 Countries that participate in the current exchange rate 
mechanism (ERM II) may decide to join the BICC.
29 In this section, traditional own resources and adminis -
trative expenditure, which are excluded from the European 
comparison of payment flows in this report, are also fac -
tored in.
30 Funding that is not collected during a budget year can 
be carried over to the next year. However, as a rule, it must 
be called on by the end of the third year for which it was 
intended, at the latest. Otherwise, the funds expire auto -
matically (N+3 rule). In the previous MFF, by contrast, the 
funds had to be called on after two years at the latest (N+2 
rule). For the next MFF, the European Commission is aiming 
to return to the N+2 rule. It is also possible to carry unused 
funds over to the first years of a new MFF. As a result, pay -
ments are also sometimes slightly higher in the first few 
years of an MFF.
31 The European Commission has not yet published the 
figures for 2019. However, at just under €30 billion, pay -
ments to the EU budget are also likely to have amounted 
to around 0.85% of Germany’s GNI.Deutsche Bundesbank

2020, mainly owing to the coronavirus pan -
demic (see the box on pp. 47 to 49).
The share of traditional own resources in Ger -
many’s payments to the EU budget, at 14%, 
corresponds to the average across all EU coun -
tries (2007 to 2018). However, the two other 
types of own resources that make up Germa -
ny’s financial contribution display special fea -
tures. This is primarily due to the fact that the 
VAT call rate applicable to Germany is just half 
the usual rate.32 This means that the share of 
the VAT- based own resource (7%) is signifi -
cantly lower than the EU- wide figure (12%). 
The weighting of the GNI- based own resource 
(including the UK rebate) is correspondingly 
higher (79% as opposed to 73%).
Within a multiannual financial framework, re -
turn flows from the EU budget to Germany 
fluctuate less strongly than payments to the EU 
budget. Compared to the last MFF, they have 
fallen. Having previously stood at 0.45% of GNI per year (both on average over the first five 
years as well as over the period as a whole), 
they have so far averaged 0.35% (€11 billion) 
per year in the current MFF. The decline was 
particularly pronounced for direct payments 
and cohesion policy (see the chart on p. 60). In 
the case of cohesion policy, the relatively good 
economic performance of Germany’s eastern 
federal states played a role.33
On balance, Germany’s net payments rose 
slightly in the current MFF. Having amounted to 
0.44% of GNI in the previous MFF, they aver -
aged 0.50% of GNI (€16 billion) per year in the 
first five years. They are likely to have reached 
this level in 2019, too. A significant increase is 
expected in 2020, given the additional spending 
in connection with the coronavirus pandemic.Specific struc -

32 Instead of the usual call rate of 0.30%, a rate of 0.15% 
applies to Germany. This is one of two rebates granted to 
Germany, the other being that Germany only pays 25% of 
its actual funding share of the UK rebate. It is therefore 
referred to as the “rebate on the UK rebate”.

Europe- wide payment flows
In the overview of the financial links of all 
Member States to the EU budget, both pay -
ments and return flows are adjusted in order to 
improve comparability.34 In the following, trad -
itional own resources are thus excluded from 
the payments to the EU budget. Owing to their 
large ports, the Netherlands and Belgium re -
cord particularly high customs revenue (known 
as the “Rotterdam effect” and the “Antwerp 
effect”), which they transfer to the EU budget. 
However, as a result of the single market and 
tariff- free trade within the EU, this revenue is 
mainly attributable to products that are des -
tined for other Member States. With that in 
mind, customs duties transfers to the EU 
budget should not be attributed to individual 
countries.35 Excluding customs duties, pay -
ments to the EU budget in 2018 stood at 
around 0.8% of national GNI (see the chart on 
p. 61). Owing to the UK rebate, payments by 
the United Kingdom were the lowest, at just 
under 0.6% of the country’s GNI. The Nether -
lands, Sweden and Germany also received re -
bates, meaning that their financing contribu -
tions were comparatively low in relation to 
their GNI.36 Payments by the other Member 
States deviated less from the average across all 
other EU countries.When comparing return flows from the EU 
budget to the Member States, only the operat -
ing expenditure is taken into account. This 
means that administrative expenditure is not 
factored in. The latter is incurred in Belgium 
and Luxembourg, in particular, because the 
European institutions have their headquarters 
there. When the return flows from the EU 
budget are adjusted in this manner, the differ -
ences between the Member States are larger 
than for payments to the EU budget (see the 
chart on p. 62). As an (unweighted) average 
across all countries, the return flows amounted 
to 1.8% of national GNI in 2018. The United 
Kingdom received the smallest return flows, at 
less than 0.3% of its GNI, while Hungary re -
ceived the largest at 5%. The countries with a 
rebate listed above generally record rather 
small return flows. Large return flows are re -
ceived in particular by countries that only joined 
the EU later on. This is partly because the larg -
est differences stem from the return flows from 
cohesion policy and these countries are under -
going an economic catching- up process. As a 
share of GNI, return flows from cohesion policy 
ranged from 0.02% in the Netherlands and 
Denmark to 3.5% in Hungary. However, this 
difference was also considerable for direct pay -
ments under agricultural policy, at 1.45  per -
centage point (0.05% in Malta and 1.5% in 
Bulgaria). Owing to far lower expenditure over -
all, differences in the return flows for agricul -
tural policy environmental and research pay -
ments and the remaining expenditure are much 
smaller (0.7 and 0.5 percentage point).Only moderate

34 The figures presented for Germany in the section above 
are altered slightly by these adjustments. Traditional own 
resources averaged 0.13% of GNI per year for the period 
2014 to 2018, while administrative expenditure amounted 
to 0.01% of GNI per year in the same period. In this analy -
sis, Germany’s net contribution is therefore just over 
0.1 percentage point lower on average over the years 2014 
to 2018, amounting to 0.4% of GNI per year.
35 The flat- rate reimbursement of the collection costs is 
also excluded. This means that the effect sometimes de -
scribed as the hidden rebate to the Netherlands and Bel -
gium is not reflected in the payment flows considered here.
36 The order is different for per- capita payments to the EU. 
In this case, Germany’s payments were higher than the EU- 
wide average, at €305 per capita compared with €238 per 
capita.Deutsche Bundesbank

The European Commission reports operating 
budgetary balances for the individual Member 
States. These indicate whether countries re -
ceive net payments from the EU budget (net 
recipients) or make net payments to the EU 
budget (net contributors).37 On average over 
the first 5 years of the current MFF, 10 of the 
28 EU Member States were net contributors 
(see the chart on p. 63). At 0.4% of its GNI, 
Germany’s net payments were the highest, fol -
lowed by the net payments made by Sweden 
and the Netherlands. 18 countries were net re -
cipients. Net return flows to Hungary, Bulgaria 
and Lithuania amounted to over 3% of these 
countries’ respective GNI.European Com -

Sweden only contribute ¼ of their actual financing share of the UK rebate. The VAT call rate is also halved for these three countries, 
meaning that their contributions to the value added tax-based own resources are half as large as usual. This rebate is funded by all 
countries through higher GNI-based own resources and is not presented separately.

37 A number of conversions are made in order to calculate 
the operating budgetary balances. For instance, the VAT 
and GNI- based own resources of a Member State are ad -
justed so that, firstly, the funding shares of the Member 
States remains the same and, secondly, the sum of the na -
tional contributions (VAT and GNI- based own resources) 
corresponds to the sum of the operating expenditure. After 
that, the respective VAT and GNI- based own resources are 
deducted from the operating expenditure. This allows the 
balance of customs duties and administrative expenditure 
to be attributed to the Member States in proportion to 
their GNI. As a result, the operating budgetary balances of 
all EU countries add up to zero. In terms of amount, they 
differ slightly from the net contribution derived by calculat -
ing the difference between operating expenditure and own 
resources excluding customs duties. However, the net con -
tribution positions of the Member States are the same. See 
European Commission (2019a), pp. 73 ff.Deutsche Bundesbank

The reporting of net contributions to the EU 
budget or operating budgetary balances is a 
controversial topic. Some rightly note that the 
net contributions should not be equated with 
the advantages or disadvantages of EU mem -
bership.38 Certain calculation steps are likewise 
contentious. Nonetheless, the net contribu -
tions illustrate the financial links to the EU 
budget and provide a rough idea of the redis -
tribution between the Member States that 
takes place within it. This is certainly a relevant 
aspect in terms of analysing the EU budget, 
which appears to justify the reporting of these 
figures.
Looking at redistribution, it is clear that there is 
a link between the net contribution of a coun -
try and the strength of its economy. In the 
period under review, weaker economic per -
formance tended to go hand in hand with a 
smaller net contribution. This becomes clear if 
the per capita net contributions of the coun -
tries are viewed in relation to their economic strength – as measured by per capita GNI, for 
example (see the chart on p.  64). However, 
there were also some individual deviations, at 
least when viewed from this perspective. For 
instance, the return flows for Bulgaria and Ro -
mania were small given their economic per -
formance. On the other hand, there were 
countries whose net payments (per capita) 
were smaller than those of countries with a 
lower GNI per capita (such as Ireland or Luxem -
bourg).
The net contribution plays a role in negoti -
ations on the EU budget because issues relat -
ing to the allocation of funds have a high polit -
ical weight. Governments therefore regularly 
push for expenditure that flows to their re -
spective country in disproportionately large 
measure compared to their respective funding 
share (especially agricultural policy and cohe -
sion policy funding). These elements tend to 
push spending on matters with a stronger 
European focus into the background. To over -
come this, some propose a stronger separation 
between the decision about redistribution in 
the EU budget and the debate regarding the 
content of the budget.39 It might therefore be 
worth considering whether redistribution issues 
should be negotiated separately, for example. 
Whether this would increase the Member 
States’ willingness to finance more joint Euro -
pean public goods remains to be seen. Agree -
ing on how redistribution between the Mem -
ber States should take place is probably no easy 
task, either. But it could potentially help make 
the debate about the spending structure more 
focused.

what in relation to GNI. The European Commis -
sion’s new proposal in response to the corona -
virus pandemic will probably exceed this by 
quite some way. It is to contain additional 
funding to help cushion the economic impact 
of the pandemic. Climate action could also be 
made a higher priority. At the same time, the 
United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU 
means the loss of a large net contributor. To 
close the funding gap this will leave, the re -
maining EU countries need to make higher 
payments or reduce the level of spending in the 
EU budget. Germany’s annual net contribution 
is expected to rise in comparison to the last 
few years. Even before the outbreak of the 
coronavirus pandemic, the Federal Government 
announced that Germany, with its strong econ -
omy, would be prepared to pay a higher contri -
bution.
GNI- based own resources are likely to consti -
tute the majority of the payments to the EU 
budget in future. The EU budget will thus con -
tinue to be funded largely in proportion to the 
economic strength of the individual Member 
States. Any new types of own resources should 
be well justified and have Europe-  wide rele -
vance, as is the case for receipts from European 
emissions trading, for instance. Regardless of 
this, the own resources system could be simpli -
fied, for example by replacing the complex 
VAT- based own resources with GNI- based own 
resources. Any rebates should be more trans -
parent and easier to understand.
The European Commission is aiming to boost 
expenditure in areas with high European added 
value. It recently reaffirmed its intention to 
focus in particular on promoting climate action 
in the EU budget by announcing the European 
Green Deal. If the overall size of the EU budget 
is to remain the same, a significant increase in 
these expenditure items is only possible if cuts 
are made in other areas of spending. The Euro -
pean Commission’s original proposal certainly 
outlines a perceptible shift in this regard. How -
ever, more than half of the expenditure is still 
earmarked for direct payments to farmers and cohesion policy. The debate on how to fund 
the additional spending in relation to man -
aging the coronavirus crisis has only just begun 
(see the box on pp. 47 to 49).
The EU budget is used to redistribute funds be -
tween the Member States. This tends to involve 
the flow of funds from stronger economies to 
weaker ones. The net contributions to the EU 
budget roughly reflect this. Redistribution is 
based mainly on the spending structure of the 
EU budget – especially the differences in return 
flows in the context of agricultural and cohe -
sion policy. The latter, in particular, is intended 
to facilitate economic convergence. However, 
according to empirical studies, it is uncertain 
whether this aim is achieved.
On the whole, the EU budget negotiation pro -
cess is cumbersome and is often dominated by 
the Member States’ consideration of their own 
net contribution. One option worth exploring 
might be to negotiate redistribution issues sep -Funding to

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).
