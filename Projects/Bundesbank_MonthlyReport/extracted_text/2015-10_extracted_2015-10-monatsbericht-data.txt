Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The upturn in economic activity in Germany 
continued in the third quarter of 2015, though 
it may have temporarily lost some steam. The 
underlying economic trend remained quite 
strong, however, driven chiefly by the ongoing 
positive consumption activity. Employment 
growth picked up momentum and real house -
hold income is additionally benefiting from 
higher wages and lower energy prices. The fact 
that consumers are taking advantage of this 
favourable  setting to increase their spending 
is  reflected in the rising turnover in some 
consumption- related service sectors, such as in 
the retail, automotive, and hotel and restaurant 
sectors. By contrast, having benefited from the 
favourable weather conditions in the winter 
months, construction activity has since slowed 
down, and activity in the industrial sector has 
still not taken off. Industrial output largely 
moved sideways, export business failed to 
maintain its previous very high level, and new 
industrial orders faltered. This therefore dashed 
any hopes of a revival of industrial activity, al -
though the situation is not expected to deteri -
orate further. This is suggested by the recently 
improved business expectations  of manufactur -
ing firms according to the Ifo Institute’s survey 
results. In particular, many enterprises were 
again perceptibly more optimistic about their 
production plans.
Industry
Industrial output in August fell short of the per -
ceptibly upwardly revised level of the previous 
month (-1%) in seasonally adjusted terms, 
which was due to the comparatively late start 
of the school holidays. On an average of July 
and August, industrial output was therefore 
down slightly on the level of the second quar -ter (-¼%). The increase in the output of capital 
goods (+½%), which was driven largely by the 
automotive industry, was not quite enough to 
compensate for the decline in intermediate 
goods (-1%). Consumer goods output remained 
at its second- quarter level. One reason is that 
the revised data now make the July figure look 
considerably more favourable.
New orders in the industrial sector in August 
went down again quite steeply on the previous 
month in seasonally adjusted terms (-1¾%), 
and taking the average of July and August they 
were down considerably on the level of the 
second quarter (-2%). The fact that the mo -
mentum of the second quarter could not be 
maintained was due first and foremost to a sig -
nificant decline in orders from non-  euro-  area 
countries (-8%). By contrast, domestic orders 
posted a marked increase (+¾%) and orders 
received from other euro-  area countries main -
tained their upward trajectory, rising strongly 
by 2¾%. It should, however, be borne in mind 
in this context that manufacturers of aircraft 
and spacecraft benefited from a surge in new 
orders, the primary demand for which was also 
partly attributable to non-  euro-  area countries. 
Capital goods producers recorded a 2% decline 
on the whole, however. The impact of the con -
traction in orders for motor vehicles and motor 
vehicle parts from countries outside the euro 
area was particularly noticeable. The drop in 
the overall intake of new orders was somewhat 
smaller in the case of intermediate goods pro -
ducers (-1½%), and much stronger in the con -
sumer goods industry (-4%).
Industrial sales in August declined considerably 
on the month after seasonal adjustment 
(-1½%). Taking the average of July and August, 
they were down slightly on the level of the 
second quarter, for domestic and export sales 
alike. This, however, masks the fact that busi -
ness with other euro- area countries stayed on 
an upward trajectory (+¼%), while this was not Economic

the case for non- euro- area countries (-¼%). 
Nominal exports of goods also failed to main -
tain the previous very high level. They were 
down in August by a very sharp 5¼% (season -
ally adjusted) from the previous month. The 
average level of July and August was therefore 
down ½% on the average of the second quar -
ter (in price- adjusted terms also -½%). Nominal 
imports of goods in August also contracted 
considerably on the month after adjustment for 
seasonal variations (-3¼%), with the declining 
prices for energy imports also playing a role in 
this development. Taking the average of the 
two summer months, there was a perceptible 
increase in import figures vis-  à- vis the average 
of the second quarter (+½%), with the increase 
being significantly higher in price- adjusted 
terms (+2%).
Construction
Construction output in August declined again 
on the month after adjustment for seasonal 
variations (-1¼%); its July-  August average was 
therefore down slightly on the level of the 
second quarter (-½%). This was mainly attribut -
able to a marked decline in output in the main 
construction sector (-1½%), whereas the finish -
ing trades recorded a marked increase com -
pared with the depressed level of the second 
quarter (+¾%). Following the favourable win -
ter months, which had benefited from the mild 
weather conditions, construction output is 
now, as in the previous year, undergoing quite 
an extended period of weakness which, last 
year, had persisted into the third quarter. Taking  
the average of July and August, new orders in 
the main construction sector showed a percep -
tible decrease on the level of the second quar -
ter. This was due to a decline in industrial and 
commercial construction orders and also orders 
from the public sector. By contrast, there was a 
very sharp rise in the demand for housing con -
struction.Construction

Labour market
Employment showed quite a sharp increase in 
August. The seasonally adjusted number of 
persons in work in Germany increased by 
49,000 on the month, which is just over three 
times higher than the average for this year so 
far. A major contributory factor in this was that 
the growth in employment was no longer 
being dampened by a sharp decline in exclu -
sively low- paid part- time employment, as was 
the case in the first few months of the year. 
The year- on- year increase in total employment 
came to 230,000 persons, or 0.5%. The num -
ber of self- employed persons is continuing to 
decline. According to initial estimates provided 
by the Federal Employment Agency, the num -
ber of employees subject to social security con -
tributions increased at a more modest pace in 
July than it did in the second quarter. Neverthe -
less, there was a very strong year- on- year in -
crease of 608,000 persons, or 2.0%. The lead -
ing labour market indicators of the Ifo Institute 
and the Federal Employment Agency suggest 
that employment will continue to grow 
strongly.
Registered unemployment has been fluctuating 
only marginally since the beginning of the 
second quarter, and in September it was still 
holding steady at just under 2.80 million per -
sons in seasonally adjusted terms. The un -
employment rate remained unchanged at 
6.4%. There were 100,000 fewer unemployed 
persons than one year earlier, with the un -
employment rate down by 0.3 percentage 
point. Total underemployment (excluding 
short- time work) went down again slightly on 
the month as fewer persons were taking part in 
labour market policy measures. The labour 
market barometer of the Institute for Employ -
ment Research (IAB) dropped slightly in Sep -
tember, although unemployment will probably 
remain stable over the coming months.Prices
The significant decline in crude oil prices that 
has been observed since the second quarter is 
over, and prices were largely moving sideways 
over the course of September. On average, 
crude oil prices were marginally higher than in 
August (+1¾%), but were still down by one-  
half on the year. Crude oil prices rose percep -
tibly in the first two weeks of October, but then 
went back down markedly. As this report went 
to press, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil 
stood at US$47½. The premium on crude oil 
futures was US$3¾ for purchases six months 
ahead and US$6½ for deliveries 12 months 
ahead.
Import prices in August declined perceptibly on 
the month after adjustment for seasonal vari -
ations. This was largely attributable to a sharp 
drop in energy prices. Imported industrial 
goods were also noticeably cheaper. Domestic 
producer prices were also lower in August and 
September. Energy prices declined significantly, 
whereas industrial goods prices were only mar -
ginally lower on the month. On the whole, the 
annual decline in both import and producer 
prices widened significantly of late to 3.1% and 
2.1% respectively.
Seasonally adjusted consumer prices in Sep -
tember remained unchanged on the month. 
Whereas energy prices declined again sharply, 
consumer prices excluding energy went up 
slightly. Food prices rose significantly. The prices 
of industrial products and services showed a 
moderate increase, and housing rents con -
tinued their subdued upward trend. The annual 
inflation rate went down to 0.0% on the whole 
as measured by the national consumer price 
index (CPI) and turned slightly negative (-0.2%) 
according to the Harmonised Index of Con -
sumer Prices (HICP). Both the CPI and the HICP 
are, however, likely to return to positive terri -
tory in the coming months. Excluding energy, 
annual CPI and HICP inflation both held steady 
at just over 1%.Further

Public finances1
Local government finances
Local government (including off- budget en -
tities) recorded a budget surplus of almost 
€4½  billion in the second quarter of 2015, 
which amounted to a year- on- year increase of 
€1½ billion. Revenue saw a substantial rise of 
5½% (€3 billion). Tax revenue grew by 7% 
(€1½ billion), driven in particular by higher 
receipts  from local business tax and shares of 
income tax. General- purpose grants from state 
government only slightly exceeded the corres -
ponding prior- year figure (+½%); however, 
other payments from state government 
– which are partly financed from central gov -
ernment funds  – continued to rise steeply 
(+€1  billion). Expenditure surged by 3% 
(€1½ billion) overall. The largest individual cost 
driver was spending on social benefits, which 
climbed by 8% (€1 billion). Payments under the 
Act on Benefits Granted to Persons Seeking 
Asylum (Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz) soared 
again by 75% (just under €½ billion). In add -
ition, personnel and other operating expend -
iture were up by 3% and 4% (€½ billion in 
both cases) on their prior- year figures. By con -
trast, as in the first quarter of 2015, fixed asset 
formation suffered a significant decline (-6½%, 
or -€½ billion).
If the favourable developments observed in the 
second quarter were to continue for the rest of 
the year, this – taken in isolation – would result 
in local government posting a distinct budget 
surplus. However, the rise in expenditure is 
expected  to pick up speed again. The increase 
in personnel expenditure in the second quarter 
was probably contained, not least due to the 
retroactive implementation of the pay agree -
ment in the previous year. Further strains will 
be felt as a result of the recent collectively 
agreed pay rises in the area of childcare. More -
over, additional staff may be required on 
account  of the soaring number of immigrating 
refugees since the middle of the year. In this 
context, it is inevitable that growth in spending on social benefits will also accelerate further. 
However, this could be largely offset by cost 
assumptions on the part of state government 
(which, in turn, will receive a higher share of 
turnover tax from central government). The 
revenue side is also expected to be put under 
marked strain. For example, following a ruling 
by the Federal Fiscal Court last year, consider -
able local business tax repayments are due.2 
Against this backdrop, the financial balance is 
only likely to improve moderately on the previ -
ous year (deficit of €½ billion). As spending in 
connection with benefits for asylum seekers 
(which local government will still have to partly 
finance from its own funds), in particular, is 
expected  to continue to climb rapidly, at least 
in 2016, local government finances are not yet 
set to improve greatly overall. In the years 
thereafter, however, those relief measures that 
central government has either already adopted 
or has pledged to adopt in the light of the 
growing influx of refugees are likely to render 
the outturn more favourable.
As against the end of the first quarter of 2015, 
debt attributable to local government core 
budgets and off- budget entities (including spe -
cial- purpose associations) fell by €½ billion to 
€150½ billion by the end of June. This decline 
is almost completely attributable to the drop in 
cash advances. These liabilities, which are actu -
ally only intended for bridging short- term fund -
ing squeezes, continued to account for a sig -
nificant share (€51 billion) of overall local gov -
ernment debt. It is noteworthy that, of the 
relatively high total budget surplus, only a small 
share has been used directly to cut debt. This 
may have something to do with the overall 
extremely   low interest costs, which make Higher surplus

1 In the short commentaries on public finances, the 
emphasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of 
the Monthly Report (published in February, May, August 
and November), by contrast, contain a detailed description 
of public finance developments during the preceding 
quarter. For detailed data on budgetary developments and 
public debt, see the statistical section of this report.
2 The impact of some of these strains will probably be felt 
in coming years, too. In total, Federal Government expects 
local business tax repayments of €2½ billion; see

repayments  seem less urgent, but it could also 
be due to an ever- growing divergence in the 
budgetary situations of individual local govern -
ments.
Securities markets
Bond market
In August 2015, gross issuance in the German 
bond market stood at €94.9 billion, down on 
the previous month’s figure of €117.7 billion. 
After deducting redemptions, which were con -
siderably lower, and taking account of changes 
in issuers’ holdings of their own debt securities, 
the outstanding volume of domestic bonds 
rose by €14.8 billion, compared with a drop of 
€3.0 billion in July. The outstanding volume of 
foreign debt securities in the German bond 
market changed only marginally in August 
overall.
In the reporting month, the public sector raised 
€11.3 billion net in the capital market. This was 
attributable primarily to the activities of central 
government (€9.3 billion), which for the most 
part issued two- year Federal Treasury notes 
(Schätze) (€5.0  billion) and five- year Federal 
notes (Bobls) (€4.6 billion) on balance, but also, 
to a lesser extent, ten- year and 30-year Federal 
bonds (Bunds) (€2.5 billion and €0.3 billion 
respectively ). By contrast, it principally redeemed 
Treasury discount paper (Bubills) (€1.5 billion) 
on balance. In the month under review, state 
and local governments tapped the capital mar -
ket for €2.0 billion net.
Domestic enterprises issued own bonds with a 
net value of €1.9 billion in the reporting month, 
compared with net issuance of €1.7 billion in 
July. These were chiefly long- term securities, 
the vast majority of which were issued by other 
financial intermediaries (€1.6 billion).
German credit institutions increased their cap -
ital market debt by €1.6 billion on balance in 
August. In the main, debt securities issued by specialised credit institutions (€1.4 billion) and 
mortgage Pfandbriefe (€1.0 billion) were placed 
in the market, while the outstanding volume of 
other bank debt securities which can be struc -
tured flexibly declined by €0.9 billion.
In August, the Deutsche Bundesbank was the 
predominant buyer in the German bond mar -
ket on balance, purchasing debt securities for 
€9.9 billion net under the Eurosystem’s asset 
purchase programmes. Domestic non- banks 
and foreign investors acquired bonds worth 
€4.3 billion and €1.4 billion net respectively. 
Conversely, German credit institutions sold 
bonds in the amount of €0.8 billion on bal -
ance.

which emanated from non- listed companies. 
At the same time, the outstanding volume of 
foreign shares in the German market rose by 
€1.1 billion. On balance, equities were acquired 
exclusively by domestic non- banks (€8.2 bil -
lion). By contrast, German credit institutions 
and foreign investors disposed of shares worth 
€6.7 billion and €0.3 billion respectively, in net 
terms.
Mutual funds
Domestic mutual funds recorded a net inflow 
of €10.0 billion in August (compared with 
€2.2 billion in July). This benefited specialised 
funds reserved for institutional investors in par -
ticular (€7.7 billion). Among the various asset 
classes, mixed securities- based funds proved 
the most active in issuing new shares (€6.1 bil -
lion), but share- based funds (€2.3 billion) and 
open- end real estate funds (€1.1 billion) were 
also engaged in the market. During the month under review, foreign mutual funds operating 
in the German market parted with shares to 
the tune of €1.3 billion on balance. German 
non- banks were virtually the sole net buyers of 
mutual fund shares (€10.9 billion). Non- resident 
investors acquired mutual fund shares worth 
€1.0 billion on balance, while domestic credit 
institutions disposed of mutual fund shares 
totalling  €0.6 billion net.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus of €12.3 billion in August 2015, down by 
€12.4 billion on the level of the previous month. 
This was mainly due to a decrease in the for -
eign trade surplus and the widening deficit on 
invisible current transactions.
In August, the surplus in the goods account 
decreased  markedly by €9.5 billion on the 
month to €16.2 billion, with exports of goods 
falling significantly more sharply than imports 
of goods.
In August, the deficit on invisible current trans -
actions went up by €2.9 billion on the month 
to €3.9 billion, largely due to a deterioration in 
the balances of both the primary income and 
the services accounts. Net primary income 
receipts  contracted by €1.4 billion to €5.6 bil -
lion, not least on account of a fall in earnings 
from direct investment, much of which was 
caused by dwindling dividends and other dis -
tributed profits. This decline was, however, 
tempered by a strong upturn in profits from 
reinvested  earnings. The deficit on the services 
sub- account expanded by €1.0 billion to €6.7 
billion, thanks in large part to the seasonally in -
duced increase in expenditure on travel. This 
was compounded by reduced revenue, not just 
from other business services but also from the 
financial services sector. Meanwhile, the deficit 
on secondary income increased slightly by 
€0.4 billion to €2.8 billion.German mutual

In August, the international financial markets 
were coloured by growing uncertainty and, at 
times, turmoil in the face of a depreciated ren -
minbi and sharp price slides in the Chinese 
stock market. Against this backdrop, German 
cross- border portfolio investment generated 
slim net capital exports amounting to €0.1 bil -
lion. Domestic investors exhibited considerably 
less interest in foreign shares than in previous 
months, purchasing foreign securities worth 
€2.3 billion net, mainly in the form of mutual 
fund shares (€1.3 billion) and long- term debt 
securities (€1.2 billion) as well as small quan -
tities of shares (€0.9 billion). At the same time, 
they parted with money market paper issued 
abroad (€1.2 billion). Foreign investors’ net 
demand  for German instruments was similarly 
modest; their purchases of German securities 
totalled €2.1 billion net. Here, the key focus 
was on money market paper (€2.9 billion), 
corporate  bonds (€1.3 billion) and mutual fund 
shares (€1.0 billion). Parallel to this, they 
disposed  of German public sector bonds to the 
tune of €1.4 billion net as well as a minor 
volume  of German shares (€0.3 billion).
In August, direct investment generated net 
capital imports in the amount of €2.4 billion. 
German enterprises slightly reduced their 
investment  abroad by €0.4 billion net on the 
back of opposing developments in terms of 
cross-  border investment in capital formation 
(up by €5.3 billion) and intra- group lending 
(down by €5.7 billion). Net funds flowing into 
Germany in the shape of direct investment 
came to €2.0 billion. Non- resident investors 
augmented their equity capital in Germany by 
€3.0 billion but scaled back their net intra-  
group lending (€1.0 billion).
Other statistically recorded investment, com -
prising financial and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment) as well as 
bank deposits and other assets, generated net 
capital exports of €20.8 billion in August. While 
claims on non- residents rose by €18.5 billion, 
cross- border liabilities dropped by €2.3 billion 
over the same period. Monetary financial insti -Portfolio

German households’ saving and investment 
behaviour in light of the low- interest- rate 
environment
Since the outbreak of the financial and economic crisis, nominal interest rates have fallen to 
historical  lows, particularly for bank deposits. This has notably affected German households, 
which traditionally hold a significant portion of their financial assets in the form of these deposits. 
Some are therefore publicly questioning whether it is worth saving in the first place. In actual fact, 
however, bank deposits are not the only form of investment in households’ portfolios, with insur -
ance claims and securities also making up a substantial share of their financial assets. Limiting 
the debate to deposit interest rates therefore oversimplifies the issue. Furthermore, nominal inter -
est rates are of limited value in adequately gauging the level of property income. Indeed, in this 
context it is more appropriate to look at real returns, which besides taking into account the 
inflation- related erosion of purchasing power also factor in other income components such as 
valuation effects and dividends.
If all the major investment forms in households’ financial portfolios are taken into consideration, 
real returns in recent years have been higher than deposit interest rates would suggest. One 
reason  is that financial assets also include other, higher- yielding forms of investment. What is 
more, households’ real total return has also been low at other times in the past, sometimes even 
far lower than in recent years.
However, these real returns have at best only marginally influenced the saving and investment 
behaviour of German households since the beginning of the 1990s. Factors relating to income 
and wealth, as well as demographics and the institutional framework, are likely to have been far 
more important determinants. Furthermore, household preferences concerning the liquidity and 
riskiness of financial assets also seem to influence their behaviour. The low- interest- rate environ -
ment is unlikely to have changed this in any substantial way. In reality, the persistent strong risk 
aversion has been further diminishing the significance of returns as a determinant of investment 
behaviour.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Since the outbreak of the financial and eco -
nomic crisis, nominal interest rates in Germany 
have fallen to historically low levels. This is par -
ticularly apparent  in the case of bank deposits, 
where returns on investment are now at zero in 
some cases or even in negative territory. The 
upshot of this for households, which tradition -
ally hold a significant proportion of their finan -
cial assets in the form of bank deposits, is that 
the property income they earn on a substantial 
part of their portfolios has shrunk to unpreced -
ented lows in recent years.
These developments are stirring a debate 
whether households should even save in the 
first place, the concern being that people might 
abandon longer- term saving objectives, par -
ticularly private old- age provisioning. This 
debate  sometimes over- generalises the low 
interest rate level for bank deposits and does 
not always give other financial assets and the 
income they generate the attention they 
deserve . The prospect of reduced saving efforts 
potentially having undesirable knock- on effects 
has even prompted calls in some quarters for 
the state to do more in the way of bonuses and 
other subsidies to make saving a more attract -
ive proposition.
Against this backdrop, this article essentially 
explores  three questions. First, how does the 
current return on German households’ financial 
assets stack up historically, taking the various 
investment forms into account?1 Second, how 
did German households’ saving and investment 
behaviour develop over the past few decades 
and in the more recent past? And third, to 
what extent do returns influence this behav -
iour? Are there any indications that the low-  
interest- rate environment has caused these 
patterns to change? These questions will be 
answered  primarily from a macroeconomic per -
spective – that is to say, distribution aspects 
within the household sector will not be dis -
cussed. The data set is largely extracted from 
the financial accounts.Real returns – theory and 
development  in Germany
Theoretical reasoning
For private savers, the nominal rate of interest 
on their deposits is a particularly easy notion to 
grasp. It is often quoted directly in the terms 
and conditions of a given financial investment, 
such as banks’ saving agreements, making it 
frequently one of the main factors considered 
in investment decisions. The nominal interest 
rate denotes the income from a financial   
investment  in the form of interest payments in 
relation to the nominal value of the investment. 
What this view of things neglects, however, is 
that inflation varies the purchasing power of 
nominal interest rates.2 Indeed, if the inflation 
rate exceeds the nominal interest rate, the 
interest income may have increased the 
financial  assets nominally, but effectively those 
financial assets will buy less goods and services 
than before.
A more appropriate indicator for the rate of 
return  on households’ assets, then, is the real 
interest rate rt, which approximates the differ -
ence between the nominal interest rate it and 
the rate of inflation expected over the period in Nominal interest

able indicator
1 Non- financial assets, which notably consist of real estate, 
are disregarded in this debate on two grounds. First, invest -
ments in non- financial assets are often not made with a 
view to making a return. In the case of real estate in par -
ticular, the main motivating factor is often the desire to 
own property, regardless of potential returns on invest -
ment. Second, constraints on the availability and compar -
ability of data –  which for non- financial assets are only 
published annually and at replacement costs rather than 
market prices – would considerably hamper the analysis.
2 From the vantage point of the real economy, interest is 
defined by the time preference theory as a measure of the 
reward for forgoing current consumption in favour of 
future  consumption. The liquidity preference theory, on the 
other hand, describes interest as compensation for tempor -
arily parting with liquidity (means of payment).Deutsche Bundesbank

the following equation.3

However, interest payments are just one form 
of income from a financial investment. De -
pending on the financial asset in question, 
other income components can come into play 
as well. While interest payments are ultimately 
the only source of income from bank deposits, 
income from securities (ie shares, debt secur -
ities and investment fund shares) is driven to a 
large extent by changes in the price of a given 
security. Shares and certain investment funds, 
meanwhile, usually accrue dividends, too. The 
sum of these components represents the total 
income from a given financial investment. Total 
income as a percentage of the amount invested 
is the return on that investment. The real return 
on that investment is then calculated by adjust -
ing the nominal return for the expected infla -
tion rate.
In practice, however, using inflation expect -
ations to calculate real returns is a difficult 
undertaking, especially because information is 
lacking on the intended investment horizon4 
and the expected nominal returns. The use of 
inflation expectations therefore requires add -
itional assumptions to be made, rendering it a 
highly uncertain approach. For consistency 
reasons , the actual inflation rate is used 
throughout the remainder of this article.5
Real returns by financial asset
The chart on page 16 shows how real annual 
returns on the main financial assets held by 
households in Germany have developed since 
1991 (see the box on pages 17 to 19 for a de -
scription of how returns were calculated). 
Many of the returns were seen to vary widely 
over time and follow very different paths in 
some cases. However, selected financial assets, 
such as shares and investment fund shares on 
the one hand and deposits6 and insurance claims on the other, can be seen to exhibit simi -
lar return patterns.
The real return on bank deposits saw compara -
tively little fluctuation over the period under re -
view. From the 1990s onwards, it was usually 
less than 1% and even dipped into negative 
territory on occasion, though never to such a 
great extent or as persistently as in the current 
setting of low nominal interest rates. There was 
once a spell in the early 1990s, for instance, 
when high nominal interest rates coincided 
with the comparatively high inflation rates 
caused by the reunification boom, meaning 
that the real return was low overall. However, 
towards the end of this boom phase and with 
inflation starting to recede in 1994, real returns 
began to climb again. A similar pattern was 
also in evidence in the late 1990s before the 
New Economy bubble burst and also in the 
years running up to the global financial and 
economic crisis. But since the end of 2010, real 
returns on bank deposits (particularly transfer -
able deposits) have been negative, essentially 
eroding the purchasing power of the assets 
held as deposits. The dwindling rate of inflation Returns encom-

3 The definition of real interest also makes it possible to 
formulate the condition for a portfolio equilibrium. If one 
assumes that, through arbitrage, the income from a finan -
cial investment matches that from a real economic invest-
 ment, the following equation holds. (1 + it) = (1 + rt) Pe
t+1
Pt,
 with it denoting the nominal interest rate of the financial 
investment, rt the real interest rate on the real economic 
investment and Pt the price level at point in time t in each 
case. Pe
t+1 stands for the expected price level in t +1. With 
the aid of the definition for the expected inflation rate
(πe
t+1 = Pe
t+1
Pt -1), one arrives at the Fisher equation
(1 + it) = (1 + rt) (1 + πe
t+1). After expanding the right-  
hand side of the equation and disregarding the cross-  
product, which is very minor in the case of low inflation 
and nominal interest rates, the above equation is trans -
formed into a condition for equilibrium. This relationship 
was formally derived for the first time in I Fisher (1896), 
Appreciation and Interest, Publications of the American 
Economic Association, pp 23-29 and pp 88-92, and can 
nowadays be found in nearly all introductory books on 
macroeconomics.
4 A distinction is made here only between short- term and 
long- term maturities; a more nuanced approach capturing 
individual maturities and notice periods is not used.
5 Similar calculations were carried out using inflation 
expectations  from the Consensus Forecast and various 
assumptions  regarding the investment horizon, with the 
overall picture essentially remaining intact.

since 2012 sent the return on deposits slightly 
higher again to a level close to 0% at the end 
of 2014.
The return on insurance claims followed a simi -
lar path to that of bank deposits in the period 
under review, but always at a level a few per -
centage points higher.7 Although the maximum 
technical interest rate for life insurance policies8 
(also known as the guaranteed interest rate) 
has been successively lowered in recent years, 
the real return has remained consistently in 
positive territory, even managing to climb since 
2012 as a notable consequence of the lower 
inflation rate. As a result, the real return was 
usually above 2% even in the low- interest- rate 
environment. This may be down on the long-  
term average, but it has returned to the level 
seen in the early 1990s and the mid-2000s, 
especially  of late. Hence it cannot be said that 
the return environment for claims on insurance 
corporations is exceptionally poor at the cur -rent juncture, particularly when measured 
against bank deposits.
In contrast to bank deposits and insurance 
claims, the return on shares held by households 
exhibited very strong volatility indeed over the 
period under review. Extended periods marked 
by high returns, such as during the New Econ -
omy boom and in the run- up to the financial 
crisis, gave way to slumps that were nearly as 
pronounced. That being said, shares came in 
with a real annual return of just over 8% on 
average between 1991 and the end of the 
period under review, making them the highest- 
yielding asset type in the portfolio. The same 
can be said for the last few years, their lack -
lustre performance of late notwithstanding.Real return on

Calculating the real returns on key fi  nancial assets 
in households’ portfolio
Existing statistical sources can be used only 
to a limited degree to calculate returns on 
the main types of investment held by house-
holds. While interest rate statistics deliver a major part of the information necessary for determining the nominal rate of interest on 
bank deposits, returns for claims on insur-
ance corporations, shares, mutual fund 
shares and debt securities, which are based 
on ex post observations, can only be esti-
mated on the basis of assumptions. This 
box illustrates how the nominal returns pre-
sented in the main article are calculated 
and converted into real variables.1
Bank deposits (including currency)
The interest rate fi  gures for bank deposits 
held by households before 2003 are based on the Bundesbank’s interest rate statistics, 
which were discontinued in the same year 
(survey of lending and deposit rates on selected  products, which shows the un-
weighted average interest rates in nominal 
terms), and subsequently on the harmon-ised MFI interest rate statistics (volume- 
weighted average interest rates and effect-ive interest rates). The comparability of the 
data prior to and after 2003 is impaired 
owing to the different data sources.2
The ex ante return on transferable deposits 
is calculated based on the interest rate for 
overnight deposits. Since these data only started being collected in 2003, internal estimates  based on the Bundesbank’s old 
interest rate statistics are used for the previ-ous period. From 2003 onwards, returns on time deposits are based on interest rates for 
deposits with an agreed maturity of up to 
two years as well as more than two years; 
before this time, internal Bundesbank esti-
mates are used. For savings deposits, inter-
est rates on deposits redeemable at notice 
of up to three months as well as more than three months are used from 2003 onwards, 
and before this a combination of savings deposits with minimum, base and higher 
rates of return from the Bundesbank’s inter-est rate statistics is used. Together with cur-
rency, for which a nominal return of 0% is 
assumed, the return series for the individual 
types of deposits are weighted with their time- varying portfolio shares derived from the fi  nancial accounts and shown as the 
weighted interest rate on deposits (includ-
ing currency). The resulting time series rep-
resents a measure of the average interest 
rate on deposit holdings.
Claims on insurance corporationsThe return earned by households from their 
claims on insurance corporations is primar-ily calculated using the current return on life 
insurance policies determined by Asseku-
rata.3 Life insurance and private pension in-
surance schemes make up a signifi  cant share of households’ claims on insurance 
corporations, meaning that the current return  on these contracts should approximate the rate of return for the total claims on insur-ance corporations. As these fi  gures are only 
available from 1999 onwards, the series 
before  then is back- estimated using, amongst 
other things, data from the German Insur-
ance Association (Gesamtverband der 
Deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft) on the 
net annual return on insurers’ investments.
1 Conceptually, the calculation of returns on securities 
and claims on insurance corporations differs from that 
of deposit returns. While the former primarily refl  ect 
the income generated over a fi  xed period in the past, 
the latter are also partly forward- looking and mostly 
correspond to an interest rate agreed for a set period.

rate statistics – methodology for collecting the German data, Monthly Report, January 2004, pp 45-59.3 For a detailed account of the various types of return

Shares
Established domestic and foreign indices 
are used to calculate the average return on 
shares owned by households. Since divi-
dend payments also need to be factored into the calculation of an ex post  total 
return , performance or total return indices 
are used. For the period prior to 2006, a 
total return is derived from the CDAX share 
price index because a weighting according 
to securities issuers is not possible for this timeframe for data availability reasons. From 2006 onwards, sub- indices of the Prime All Share Index for banks, fi  nancial service providers and insurers are used, 
while the return on shares of non- fi  nancial 
corporations (RNFC,t-1 ,t) is calculated as a 
residual . Thus, the following applies to the 
quarterly ex post rate of return of the Prime 
All Share Index:

Market capitalisationPrime All Share,t  
denotes the weight of this sector relative to the overall index. w
NFC,t indicates the weight 
of shares of non- fi  nancial corporations. Shares of foreign issuers are calculated based on the MSCI World Index for de-veloped markets. The resulting returns are then weighted based on the fi  nancial accounts  according to domestic and for-eign issuers and aggregated to form a 
single  time series. Finally, the time series is 
annualised.
Mutual fund sharesThe average rate of return on investment in 
mutual funds is approximated based on 
changes in the prices of all publicly offered 
funds subject to reporting requirements in 
Germany. The following measure of monthly return can be determined for individual 
funds from monthly price data and balance 
sheet information at the fund level:
ri,t−1,t=Pi,t
P⇤
i,t−1+Distribution i,t−1,t
FA i,t−11
where Pi,t denotes the current redemption 
value and P*
i,t-1 the modifi  ed redemption 
value. The modifi  ed redemption value P*
i,t-1 
is equal to the redemption value in the pre-
ceding period plus past distributions. By taking past distributions into account, it is 
possible to compare distribution funds with 
reinvestment funds. Therefore, the return r
i,t-1,t of fund i  comprises the ratio of the 
current redemption value to the modifi  ed redemption value in the previous month 
plus the fund’s distribution ratio in the cur-rent month, where the latter is expressed in 
relation to the fund’s assets in the preced-
ing period, FAi,t-1. These individual fund 
returns  are then consolidated into an aver-age return R
k,t at the fund category level4 k. 
In this context, each fund return is weighted with the relevant fund assets FA
i,t. The fol-
lowing applies to the average return Rk,t of 
the fund category k.
Rk,t1,t=P
iFA i,k,t ·ri,t1,tP
iFA i,k,t8i2k
The necessary data are taken from the Bundes bank’s investment fund statistics from 1993 onwards. Finally, an average return  across all fund categories is deter-mined based on the asset holdings X
k, of 
the individual fund categories in the domes-tic fund portfolio of households at the end of year τ. To this end, data from the secur-
ities holdings statistics are combined with the investment fund statistics. The follow-
ing time- varying weight applies to the unit 
share held by fund category k.
4 The fund categories considered are equity funds, 
bond funds, mixed securities funds, open- end real 
estate  funds, money market funds, funds of funds, 
mixed funds, pension investment funds, hedge funds, derivatives funds and other funds.Deutsche Bundesbank

For the years prior to 2006, weights from 
2006 are used. However, these are also 
progressively adjusted to refl  ect the grow-
ing number of fund categories since 1993. 
The overall return for households can then 
be expressed as follows.
Rt1,t=X

For foreign mutual fund shares owned by households, the simplifying assumption is 
made that these achieve the same return as domestic mutual fund units. The returns on 
domestic and foreign funds are likely to show fewer fundamental differences the 
more domestic funds are invested abroad. 
The annual rate of change of the aggregate time series is determined in a similar way to the annualisation of the return on shares.
Debt securities
Similarly to the return on shares, the aver-
age ex post  return on debt securities is 
determined  by subdividing the bonds 
owned by households according to issuer sectors. In addition to fi  nancial and non- 
fi  nancial corporations, government is classi-fi  ed as a separate issuer. The following per-
formance indices are used. For the period 
up to 2005, the calculation is based on the 
German bond performance index REXP , which measures the investment perform-
ance of German one- year to ten- year public sector bonds.
5 This is likely to represent the 
lower bound for households’ return from debt securities  for this period. From 2006 onwards, a combination of Merrill Lynch’s German Government Index, J. P . Morgan’s EMU Index for Germany and Citigroup’s World Government Bond Index for Ger-many is used for public- sector issuers. For 
domestic credit institutions, FTSE’s German 
Pfandbrief Index is used as an approxima-
tion. For insurers, mutual investment funds 
and other fi  nancial intermediaries, Merrill Lynch’s Euro Financial Index is used, while the fi  gures for non- fi  nancial corporations are based on Bundesbank calculations on the basis of corporate bonds with a BBB 
rating (source: Merrill Lynch). The returns 
on bonds of foreign issuers are calculated 
using Citigroup’s World Government Bond 
Index and Merrill Lynch’s Global Broad Mar-
ket Index and Global Non- Sovereign Index 
as an average of public and private debt securities . From 2006 onwards, an aggre-
gate rate of return can be determined from 
these sectoral bond returns, whereby a 
weighting with the sectoral bond holdings 
of households is based on the fi  nancial accounts . The annual rate of change can 
then be determined.
Calculating real returns
In order to convert the respective nominal 
returns into real returns, the individual time 
series are adjusted for infl  ation using the 
realised consumer price index for Germany. 
In the context of households’ investment 
decisions, a more precise calculation of the 
real returns would require more specifi  c in-formation on the intended investment hori-zon, the expected future returns as well as infl  ation expectations corresponding to this 
time horizon. However, this kind of infor-
mation is not available in a suitable form or 
in the required volume. Only infl  ation ex-
pectations can be obtained from the Con-
sensus Forecast for different time periods in 
the future; however, taking these into ac-
count does not have a major impact on the overall picture. Because of the lack of infor-mation on the intended investment horizon, in particular, this approach is not superior to 
calculating ex post returns. For reasons of 
consistency, the ex post realised values are 
therefore used for calculating both the 
nominal returns and the infl  ation rate.
5 The German bond performance index REXP (like the 
German bond index REX) is based on weighted aver-
age prices of bonds with maturities ranging from one 
year to ten years. It comprises fi  xed- rate bonds, notes and treasury notes issued by the Federal Government, 
the German Unity Fund and the former Treuhand 
agency. Only bonds with a minimum nominal volume of €500 million are taken into account. See Deutsche Börse AG (2014), Guide to the REX Indices.Deutsche Bundesbank

The return on investment fund shares held by 
households broadly followed the same path, 
which is not surprising, seeing as a large share 
of the retail funds they hold are equity funds. 
That said, it followed a much less volatile path 
than the return on shares. Overall, the real 
return  since records began in 1995 has been 
just under 5% on average, which is substan -
tially less than the return on shares.
The return on debt securities deviated substan -
tially from the return on other financial invest -
ments throughout the period under review.9 In 
particular, it proved to be largely immune to 
crises and similar events. Furthermore, it was 
less volatile and also slightly lower, in terms of 
long- term averages, than the returns on other 
types of security, though significantly higher 
than for bank deposits. Latterly, however, debt 
securities have seen their returns climbing 
strongly on the back of higher market prices.
How the total return  
on financial assets has fared
A glance at the real returns on the various asset 
classes makes it clear that households, besides 
holding bank deposits that currently yield par -
ticularly low returns, also hold higher- yielding 
financial assets in their portfolio. Any investiga -
tion into the impact of the current setting of 
low nominal interest rates on the real income 
from households’ financial assets therefore 
needs to look at the total return on the entire 
portfolio. This is calculated by weighting the 
returns   on the various asset classes according 
to their share of the total portfolio – a step 
which logically means that the structure of 
households’ financial assets is also a determin -
ant of the total return. The portfolio structure 
has itself  seen some changes over the period 
under review (see the chart on page 21), which 
will be addressed  in detail later on.
The chart on page 22 shows how the real total 
portfolio return has developed since 1991, 
together  with the contributions made by the individual types of financial asset. Claims on 
insurance  corporations made a positive contri -
bution – even a material one in crisis periods – 
to the total return throughout virtually the 
entire  period. The communication and infor -
mation technology boom which sent equity 
prices skyrocketing meant that shares took 
over as the main driver of the total portfolio 
return for a while in the late 1990s. The story 
was similar, albeit on a slightly smaller scale, for 
investment fund shares, which started to 
emerge in significant numbers in the 1980s.10 
Thus, in the second half of the 1990s and, to a 
lesser extent, in the mid-2000s as well, the real 
total return climbed to sizeable levels on the 
back of the strong contributions made by share 
investments held either direct or indirectly (in 
the form of investment fund shares). Between 
1991 and 2007, the real total return stood at 
3.5% on average.
By contrast, the real portfolio return in the 
years since the outbreak of the financial and 
economic crisis has been substantially lower, 
standing on average at just over 1.5% between 
2008 and the start of 2015. One factor in this 
inferior performance was undoubtedly the 
crisis , which caused the average real returns on 
some securities to dwindle in recent years. 
Another  , far more significant development, 
however, was the change in the structure of 
households’ financial assets, which saw assets 
being shifted out of time and savings deposits 
and into transferable deposits with lower or 
even negative interest rates.Return on 
investment  fund shares follows a similar pattern, but less volatile than for shares

Significance of returns 
and other determinants 
for households’ saving 
and investment  behaviour
Theoretical reasoning
Economic theory posits that interest rates and 
returns can influence both the level and the 
structure of saving. Typically, the influence of 
interest rates on the amount of saving is for -
mally described using a multi- period life- cycle 
model. In this standard model, the relationship 
between saving and the interest rate level is 
essentially  shaped by three effects.11 A drop in 
interest rates will, all other things being equal, 
initially result in savers receiving less income 
from their savings than previously expected 
(a phenomenon known as the income effect), 
forcing them to save more and consume less 
today if they wish to maintain future consump -
tion at the previously targeted level.At the same time, an interest rate reduction 
can drive up current consumption at the ex -
pense of future consumption (substitution 
effect ). That is because the lower income from 
saving makes current consumption less expen -
sive, relatively speaking, since households are 
effectively forgoing less income than before. 
Consequently, current income is increasingly 
channelled into current consumption, pushing 
saving down.
Depending on how much wealth a household 
has, a wealth effect comes into play, too. A 
reduction   in interest rates lifts the prices of a 
household’s securities holdings, theoretically Correlation

improving that household’s consumption 
options  . At least this is the case as long as 
these valuation gains are unexpected and 
thought to be permanent. The substitution and 
wealth effects therefore counteract the income 
effect. At the end of the day, the interest rate 
elasticity and return elasticity of saving thus de -
pend on which of these effects is predominant.
The structure of saving, ie investment behav -
iour, is another factor which economic theory 
says is influenced by interest rates. For example, 
the theory of money demand in conjunction 
with the mechanisms posited in portfolio the -
ory reveals that the decision to hold certain 
types of financial asset always entails a com -
parison of the anticipated returns.12 This deci -
sion is founded on the microeconomic reason -
ing that returns affect the utility that a house -
hold can derive from a given financial asset.13 A 
household looking to construct an efficient 
financial  portfolio that maximises overall utility will thus allocate its assets so as to derive an 
optimal portfolio structure.
But returns are just one of several determinants 
that can influence households’ behaviour. Eco -
nomic theory also takes other factors into 
account . The aforementioned life cycle model, 
for instance, makes saving patterns dependent 
on a household’s disposable income and time

preferences as well. A household’s attitude to 
risk can be another determinant, particularly 
for investment behaviour, the theoretical rea -
soning being, for instance, that a household’s 
attitude to risk is influenced by its wealth.14 
Factors such as a lack of foresight, negative 
experiences  from earlier investment decisions, 
and general or financial literacy levels might 
also come into play.15 On top of these individ -
ual factors, the institutional framework, not -
ably the tax and social security systems, can 
also sway saving and investment behaviour in 
as far as they impact on (expected future) dis -
posable income.16
These determinants play a crucial role for the 
relevance of the different types of saving 
motive , ie the reasons why households save 
and invest money in the first place. Major sav -
ing motives include saving for a rainy day (pre -
cautionary saving), private old- age provisioning 
(retirement saving) and inheritance consider -
ations.17 The importance of retirement saving, 
in particular, can vary from one phase of life to 
another, as assets are for the most part built up 
during one’s working life and then used to 
finance  consumption during later phases when 
income is lower. Bearing this in mind, the age 
structure of a population is a major factor 
determining  the saving and investment behav -
iour of households overall.
Saving and investment 
behaviour  over time
The chart on page 24 shows how the saving 
ratio of German households has evolved over 
recent  decades. German households have con -
sistently saved at least 9% of their disposable 
income since 1991, sometimes significantly 
more. Fluctuations in the saving ratio have 
been relatively modest during this time, with 
abrupt changes being few and far between 
and adjustments usually occurring gradually.
As a case in point, the 1990s saw the saving 
ratio following an almost uninterrupted down -ward path over many years, while the total 
return  trended upwards.18 This decline reflected 
two factors. First, it was a step back from the 
perceptibly higher saving levels that had been 
brought about by a tax reform in the second 
half of the 1980s. Second, the cyclical lull that 
followed in the wake of the reunification boom 
and the emergence of structural deficits, par -
ticularly in eastern Germany, also took their toll 
– social security benefits increasingly took the 
place of earned income, while the latter was 
saddled with mounting taxes and social contri -
butions, constraining households’ capacity to 
save.
The years after the New Economy bubble burst, 
meanwhile, saw a gradual recovery in the sav -
ing ratio. This increase – a relatively untypical 
phenomenon in a spell of lacklustre economic 
activity  – was largely fuelled by the growing 
significance of precautionary and retirement 
saving.19 Several years of subdued macroeco -

19 The saving ratio mostly followed procyclical patterns in 
earlier economic cycles. Households would save a smaller 
proportion of their disposable income during subdued eco -
nomic spells as a way of stabilising their consumption, but 
would increase their saving ratios again when incomes 
began to rise. See Deutsche Bundesbank, Private consump -

certainty over the effects of the labour market 
reforms implemented during that period 
prompted households to forgo current con -
sumption in favour of precautionary saving.20 
What is more, the debate over the long- term 
sustainability of the statutory pension insurance 
scheme and the reforms made to this system 
increasingly thrust the need for private old- age 
provisioning into the public eye.21
The upward trajectory of the saving ratio stalled 
with the onset of the financial and economic 
crisis. The downturn in macroeconomic activity 
eroded households’ disposable income, leaving 
them with no option but to draw on their sav -
ings to stabilise their consumer spending. This, 
in turn, sent the saving ratio into retreat. The 
subsequent economic recovery saw an improv -
ing labour market situation slowly restoring dis -
posable income levels, heralding a brief spell of 
stability in the saving ratio. There then followed 
a period marked by further income growth, a 
continued stable employment situation and a correspondingly upbeat consumer climate in 
which the saving ratio fell back further as an 
environment of subdued returns took hold. 
More recently, additional social security trans -
fers and the dramatic fall in the price of oil in 
particular lent additional impetus to real house -
hold income. These increases in real income 
were used only in part for consumption pur -
poses, however, which would suggest that 
their magnitude took households by surprise, 
and they therefore contributed to the latest 
recovery  in the saving ratio.
Households’ investment behaviour, much like 
their saving behaviour, was characterised by 
gradual changes between the beginning of the 
1990s and the end of the period under review. 
Barring a few exceptions, claims on insurance 
corporations and bank deposits were the main 
drivers of financial asset growth (see the chart 
on page 25). One of households’ key motives  for 
acquiring  insurance claims, besides safeguard -
ing against existential risks, was to build up pri -
vate provisions for old age (see above).22 Rising 
returns on insurance claims meant that there 
were times in the 1990s when this investment 
vehicle alone accounted for roughly half of all 
the financial assets acquired . Unsurprisingly, 
insurance  claims accounted  for a substantial 
share of existing financial  assets at the end of 
the 1990s – standing  at just under 30% – a 
level that was pipped only by bank deposits 
throughout the entire period under review. But 
weak inflows into bank deposits, particularly 
transferable deposits , meant that their import -
ance dwindled  over the course of the 1990s.

growth in this period, gained a fair bit of Onset of crisis

ground. This can be attributed to what were 
sometimes strong inflows of funds, especially 
to investment fund shares.23 There was, at 
times, also buying of debt securities. Direct 
holdings of equities did not become significant 
until the New Economy boom and against the 
backdrop of the deregulation of the stock mar -
ket, which started at around this time.24 This 
rising stock market exposure, coupled with 
valuation gains on existing securities holdings, 
caused a clear increase, from around 20% to 
30%, in the percentage that securities made up 
of German households’ financial assets in the 
1990s.
These patterns changed fundamentally when 
the New Economy bubble burst. Price losses 
and extensive net selling, especially of equities, 
caused the percentage of securities in financial 
assets to shrink in the early 2000s. Only debt 
securities continued to attract significant buy -
ing. Instead, there were strong inflows into 
transferable deposits, which can be attributed, 
amongst other things, to the heightened un -
certainty brought about by the cyclical lull and 
the turmoil on the capital markets as well as 
the associated greater preference for liquid and 
safe investments. Since then, and unlike in the 
1990s, other forms of deposit have no longer 
played a significant role. Looking at insurance 
claims, where yields had gradually dwindled 
since the year 2000, both the acquisition of 
financial   assets and their portfolio share 
remained  high.
The financial and economic crisis did nothing 
to change this. On the contrary, the percentage 
of claims on insurance corporations in financial 
assets has risen further since 2008 to stand at 
just shy of 38% in mid-2015. The significance 
of securities, by contrast, continued to decline 
in an environment of moderate, yet positive 
returns ; at around 19% at the beginning of 
2015, the percentage was even lower than in 
the early 1990s. That share fell especially 
sharply in 2008 when the stock markets suf -
fered large- scale losses as the financial crisis 
worsened. Although share prices rose, in some cases sharply, in subsequent years, direct share 
purchases have remained muted ever since.

Only investment fund shares recorded percep -
tible inflows again from 2013 after earlier bouts 
of selling. Households were buyers in particular 
of equity funds, making them the most import -
ant fund type in the portfolio over the past 
years (see the above chart). These funds, in turn, 
invested the bulk of their cash inflows in enter -
prises abroad. This contrasts with households’ 
direct share purchases, which concentrate on 
German issuers’ paper, and suggests that 
households prefer to leave investments into 
what they see as potentially riskier assets to 
typically better informed professional invest -
ors.25 This, coupled with the fact that they 
have, as a result of the financial crisis, cut back 
their direct capital market exposure significantly 
in favour of an indirect form of exposure sug -
gests that there is pronounced and persistent 
risk aversion among households.
A look at transferable deposits, which are con -
sidered a safe asset, spells out the low appetite 
for risk even more clearly; since 2009, in an en -vironment of historically low returns, they have 
represented the most important form of finan -
cial asset acquisition. Households have also 
shifted funds out of less liquid deposits into 
transferable deposits. This is likely to reflect not 
only households’ risk aversion but also their 
very pronounced preference for liquidity right 
up to the current end, which was driven by the 
currently historically low opportunity costs for 
holding transferable deposits as well as, at 
times, heightened uncertainty in connection 
with the European sovereign debt crisis.
Possible determinants 
of saving  and investment 
behaviour 
Earlier empirical studies have already examined 
the question of the extent to which the saving 
and investment behaviour outlined above was 
influenced by real returns. Their results suggest 
that the relationship between interest rates and 
the level of saving tends to be fairly weak in 
Germany when other relevant determinants are 
taken into consideration. Depending on model

25 The tendency to invest primarily in the domestic market 
is called “home bias” in the literature. See, for example, 
K French and J Poterba (1991), Investor Diversification and 
International Equity Markets, American Economic Review 
81, pp 222-226. This behaviour can be explained, amongst 
other things, by the existence of transaction costs and in -
formation asymmetries. In this context, it appears plausible 
that those fund managers in particular who are in charge 
of managing large portfolios should have better informa -
tion and consequently make more investments abroad. See

ation whatsoever is identified.26 Overall, factors 
with opposite effects – income effect on the 
one hand and substitution and wealth effects 
on the other  – therefore appear to roughly 
cancel each other out. Other determinants are 
of greater relevance, including in particular dis -
posable income as well as the age structure of 
the population and the social security system, 
primarily the pension system. It becomes ap -
parent, for instance, that the level of pension 
benefits expected in the future has a key im -
pact on precautionary saving behaviour today.27
Against this backdrop, the direct influence of 
the low interest rate level on the saving ratio 
has probably been at best small in recent years 
as well. Patterns are likely to have been deter -
mined much more strongly by the recent sharp 
rise in real incomes, the upbeat labour market 
situation and the associated improvement in 
income  prospects. Private consumption re -
sponded to this by shrugging off its long-  
standing lethargy and making a perceptible 
contribution to overall economic growth – with 
the consequent negative impact on the saving 
ratio.
A similar pattern emerges when looking at the 
significance of real returns for the structure of 
saving, ie investment behaviour. We carried out 
our own econometric estimates and modelled 
the various forms of investment as a percent -
age of financial assets in a multivariate system 
of demand equations. Against the backdrop of 
the theoretical considerations, the portfolio 
structure depended on real financial assets, real 
asset yields and additional exogenous variables 
such as demographic variables.28
Such econometric studies at the macroeco -
nomic level are associated with methodological 
problems, meaning that their results should be 
interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, the 
results  suggest that while real returns do have 
an influence on the portfolio structure of 
households in Germany, this influence is not 
clear- cut and therefore fairly negligible over -
all – much like it is for saving patterns. Other factors therefore appear to be more important 
when determining how savings are distributed 
across various financial assets. Indeed, the re -
sults suggest that the age structure of the 
population, for instance, or the level of wealth 
exert a comparatively clear influence on port -
folio structure – and one that is consistent with 
the theoretical reasoning. For instance, the per -
centage of shares and investment fund shares, 
ie forms of investment typically perceived as 
being risky, declines at the macroeconomic 
level as the overall population gets older. By 
contrast, all other things being equal, rising 
wealth causes an increase in this percentage.
The current environment of low nominal inter -
est rates does not appear to have brought 
about any significant changes in these relation -
ships. In fact, the results of the estimates even 
suggest that real returns continue to play a … which is 
probably also the case in the current environ-ment of low nominal interest rates

Demand System. To obtain a consistent demand system, a 
number of restrictions are imposed on the coefficients 
(adding- up, symmetry, homogeneity). The estimated coeffi -
cients allow wealth elasticities and own- rate and 
alternative - rate elasticities to be calculated. However, the 
approach has some limitations. For instance, estimates of 
the partial effects are inaccurate as yields have a high 
degree  of multicollinearity despite various model specifica -
tions. In addition, changes in the variability of the yields 
and/or in risk aversion overall are not modelled here. This

Results from the PHF household survey on the impact of 
low interest rates on households’ savings and investment behaviour  in Germany
Analysing households’ savings and invest-
ment behaviour at the macroeconomic level 
does not allow an examination of the sav-
ings behaviour of different categories of 
households. To do that, micro data are 
needed, such as those from household sur-
veys like the Bundesbank’s “Panel on Household Finances (PHF)” study.
1 Besides 
sociodemographic features of the surveyed 
households (eg age, education, employ-
ment), the PHF study also contains informa-
tion on households’ planned activities and 
expectations. In 2014, for example, ques-tions were asked not only about interest and infl  ation expectations but also about whether households were changing their 
savings behaviour in response to low inter-est rates.
The results of the PHF study confi  rm the 
 aggregate results in the main text.2 Only a 
small number of households stated in 2014 that they had adjusted their savings behav-iour because of low interest rates.
To the question “Have you adjusted your savings behaviour because of low interest 
rates?”,3 more than three- quarters of those 
surveyed (77%) answered “no”. Only about 
15% of households have reduced the 
amount they save, and roughly 7% are now 
investing differently than before. The fact that many households have not changed their savings and investment behaviour is 
surprising given that, in mid-2014, 75% of 
households were expecting negative real rates of interest for the coming year. The percentage of households with positive expectations  about real interest rates that are not adjusting their savings and invest-
ment behaviour differs only marginally from the relevant percentage of households with 
negative expectations. There were hardly any differences with regard to expected nominal rates of interest. The only house-holds that stand out are those which, in 
mid-2014, were expecting nominal interest 
rates to rise sharply. In this group, 97% state that they had not changed their in-
vestment and savings behaviour.
In the aggregate, the results indicate that 
households’ savings and investment behav-
iour in the current environment of low nominal interest rates are infl  uenced only 
marginally by interest rates and households’ 
interest rate expectations. Nevertheless, there are some categories of households 
that respond more strongly to low interest 
rates than others do. For example, the per-centage of households that adjust their sav-
ings behaviour goes up with increasing 
wealth.4
Looking at those households that change their savings and investment behaviour in response to low interest rates, the results correspond to the relevant considerations 
of economic theory. Households with more 
strongly diversifi  ed portfolios and greater 
appetite for risk state more frequently that

Finances  (PHF)” study may be found in “Household 
wealth and fi  nances in Germany: results of the Bun-desbank survey”, Monthly Report, June 2013, pages  23-49, and at https://www.bundesbank.de/
Navigation/EN/Bundesbank/Research/Panel_on_ household _fi  nances/panel_on_household_fi  nances.html2 The data used here are to be regarded as provisional; 
among other things, missing data have not yet been 
imputed. Households that did not provide any infor-
mation on certain questions cannot therefore be con-sidered in the analysis. All values are weighted.3 The concept of “savings behaviour” is not defi  ned in 
greater detail in the question itself. The set response 
options do cover both the amount of savings and in-
vestment behaviour, however.4 The processing of data from the second wave of the 
survey has not yet been completely fi  nalised. For this 
analysis, it was therefore not possible to use a net wealth computed from individual asset components. 
Instead, use was made of the responses to the ques-
tion “How high do you estimate your net wealth/ the 
net wealth of your household/the net wealth of the 
household to be? Net wealth is the value of everything belonging to household members minus all liabilities ”. 
Experience from the fi  rst wave of the survey shows that self- estimated net wealth is indicative of wealth 
computed from individual components; above all, the allocation of households to individual quantiles is com-parable.Deutsche Bundesbank

their savings behaviour is now different as a 
result of the low interest rates. This is re-
vealed clearly by the very wealthy house-holds, for example, which typically hold a 
large percentage of securities in their asset 
portfolio. In this group, the percentage of 
households stating that they now save dif-
ferently than before is highest, at almost 14%, although it is at a low level overall. Independently of wealth, it is evident that households possessing securities deposit 
accounts have adjusted their savings behav-
iour more to the low interest rate environ-
ment than households without such ac-
counts. The difference between households 
with and without a securities deposit ac-counts in this respect is 10 percentage points (15% with securities deposits ac-
counts compared with 5%). Holding secur-
ities is an indication that households are 
more prepared to take risks in their invest-
ments in order to achieve higher returns. This aspect can be investigated in greater 
detail because the PHF study also contains 
direct questions on households’ risk appe-
tite in investment and savings decisions. It is here that the structures found for securities holders are confi  rmed: households not pre-
pared to take risks in order to achieve higher returns state much less often that 
they are now investing differently than be-
fore (5% compared with 14%).
Alongside wealth and securities holdings, 
households can also be classifi  ed according to sociodemographic features. Grouping 
households by their total gross income pro-
duces a picture that is very similar to the breakdown by wealth. Comparing various households with regard to the age of the main income earner, it is noticeable that 
older savers (55 years of age and over) state 
more frequently than younger savers that 
they are now saving less on account of the low interest rates. In relation to savings be-
haviour, it is apparent that younger savers state more often than older households 
that they are now choosing other forms of 
investment. It is known from the literature 
that older households are less prepared to 
take high risks in their investments and tend 
to possess more traditional portfolios.5 In 
this respect, it is thus also true that house-
holds adjust their savings behaviour in line 
with the theory.
Taken altogether, the currently available re-
sults of the PHF study suggest that low 
nominal rates of interest have so far led to 
hardly any signifi  cant adjustments in the 
savings and investment behaviour of house-
holds in Germany, thus confi  rming the pic-ture found at the macroeconomic level.

rather  opaque and relatively insignificant role in 
the portfolio structure. This view is backed up 
by the stronger household investment in 
deposits , notably so in recent years, even 
though the real return on deposits was nega -
tive for an extended period, unlike that on 
every other form of investment. Similarly, the 
latest results of the Bundesbank’s Panel on 
Household Finances  (PHF) survey, which sug -
gest that low nominal interest rates have, to 
date, had virtually no impact at all on the sav -
ing and investment behaviour of the respond -
ent households, point in the same direction 
(see the box on pages 28 and 29).
It would therefore appear that other factors are 
key to investment behaviour, even in times of 
historically low nominal interest rates. Besides 
the age structure of the population mentioned 
earlier in this article and wealth levels, these 
include  the uncertainty to which households 
were repeatedly exposed during the financial 
and sovereign debt crisis – for instance, in the 
form of increased volatility on the capital mar -
kets. For example, the above- mentioned invest -
ments in deposits consisted primarily of inflows 
into transferable deposits, which suggests that 
households have developed a stronger prefer -
ence for highly liquid forms of investment 
which can be accessed at short notice for con -
sumption purposes, if need be. However, this 
does not rule out the possibility that the nar -
rower interest rate differential between trans -
ferable and longer- term deposits was some -
times a factor driving these strong inflows into 
transferable deposits.
Analyses at the individual household level yield 
additional clues to other factors. Recent studies 
for Germany suggest, for instance, that invest -
ment behaviour is significantly shaped by the 
personal experiences that a household has 
made with certain forms of investment in the 
past.29 Events such as heavy financial losses 
during a financial crisis can have a long- term 
impact on risk tolerance and consequently the 
willingness to add riskier assets to a house -
hold’s portfolio. The large capital market losses after the New Economy bubble burst and in 
the wake of the financial crisis are thus likely to 
have further increased German households’ 
already  comparatively high risk aversion. That, 
in turn, was probably a key reason why their 
securities exposure has declined since the New 
Economy bubble burst and has been weak 
overall, especially since the onset of the finan -
cial and sovereign debt crisis, as outlined 
above  – notwithstanding comparatively high 
returns.30
Conclusions
Nominal interest rates in Germany have been 
exceptionally low for some time now. As a 
result  , interest rates on bank deposits espe -
cially, which make up a large percentage of 
households’ financial assets, have been at un -
precedented lows in recent years. This, in turn, 
has led to concerns that saving might no longer 
be worthwhile and that households could 
reduce  their saving efforts.
However, the explanation outlined above 
shows that there are various reasons why such 
fears are largely unfounded. It is clear, first, that 
Other factors 
such as risk aversion of greater significance 29 For instance, Bucher-  Koenen and Ziegelmeyer (2013) 
demonstrate for Germany that individuals that have had 
negative experiences with capital market products are 
sceptical about such products and are correspondingly less 
likely to invest in such products again. This relationship ap -
pears to be more pronounced the lower the respective 
households’ financial literacy levels. Ampudia and Ehrmann 
(2014) confirm these results for the euro area. These stud -
ies were based on a study by Malmendier and Nagel 
(2011), which made similar observations for the United 
States. See M Ampudia and M Ehrmann (2014), Macroeco -
nomic Experiences and Risk taking of Euro Area House -
holds, ECB Working Paper, No  1652; T Bucher- Koenen 
and M Ziegelmeyer (2013), Once Burned, Twice Shy? Finan -

and S Nagel (2011), Depression Babies: Do Macroeconomic 
Experiences Affect Risk Taking?, The Quarterly Journal of 
Economics 126, pp 373-416.
30 Analyses based on Germany’s Socio- Economic Panel 
(SOEP) confirm the influence of the household’s attitude to 
risk on its portfolio structure. They show that high risk aver -
sion is associated with portfolio underdiversification with 
typically no or very few securities. See N Barasinska, 
D Schäfer and A Stephan (2012), Individual risk attitudes 
and the composition of financial portfolios: Evidence from 
German household portfolios, Quarterly Review of Eco -
nomics and Finance 52, pp 1-14.Deutsche Bundesbank

the return on households’ financial assets 
– measured in real terms and taking into con -
sideration all the major financial assets in the 
portfolio – is not as meagre as the low nominal 
interest rates on bank deposits would initially 
suggest. Alongside the currently low rate of in -
flation, this can be attributed in large part to 
the fact that households hold not only com -
paratively low- yielding bank deposits but also 
financial assets that generate strong returns. 
The total return since the outbreak of the 
financial  and economic crisis may be down on 
average compared to pre- crisis levels, but since 
the early 1990s there have been repeated spells 
in which the real total portfolio return has been 
far lower still.
Second, there is quite some evidence to sug -
gest that real returns are not a major driver of 
the saving and investment behaviour of house -
holds in Germany. In actual fact, this behaviour 
has probably, in recent decades, been shaped 
chiefly by developments in (expected) dispos -
able income, changes in the institutional frame -
work (especially the tax and social security sys -
tem), demographics, wealth levels and house -holds’ preferences and (risk) attitudes. It ap -
pears unlikely that the – clearly volatile – real 
return(s) should be a dominant factor influen -
cing saving and investment behaviour given 
that the latter has displayed constant patterns 
over time and been subject to only gradual 
changes.
Third, this is unlikely to have changed signifi -
cantly to date, notwithstanding the environ -
ment of low nominal interest rates. Households 
continue to save more than 9% of their dispos -
able income – roughly as much as they did in 
the early 2000s when not just nominal interest 
rates but inflation rates, too, were perceptibly 
higher. These funds, in turn, are primarily in -
vested in liquid bank deposits, even though this 
form of investment sometimes generated 
negative real returns. This can be explained, 
amongst other things, by a pronounced risk 
aversion among households, which has risen 
more perceptibly still in the recent past as a 
result  of the capital market turmoil following 
the crisis and has (further) diminished the im -
portance of return considerations.Looking at the 
portfolio as a whole, returns are not excep-tionally low in the low- interest- rate environment

Government personnel expenditure:  
development and outlook
The German government currently employs around 4½ million staff. These employees provide 
public services, particularly in the areas of education, childcare, internal and external security, 
justice, and general administration. Annual personnel expenditure recently amounted to over 
€250 billion, thus accounting for roughly one- fifth of government expenditure. Growth in spend -
ing on current staff has distinctly trailed that of economic output since German reunification, 
chiefly as a result of staff reductions. However, this trend has tailed off in the past few years on 
account of somewhat stronger pay increases and recruitment of new staff, especially in the areas 
of education and childcare. By contrast, spending on recipients of civil servant pensions expanded 
substantially over the entire period owing to growth in their numbers.
Government staff numbers ultimately depend on the desired scale and the quality of the services 
that the government provides. The indications are of a slight increasing trend in the coming years 
– not least in connection with the large influx of refugees. Wage and salary developments in the 
public sector can probably be expected to more or less track the private sector, as in the past few 
years. Government pension payments will increase more steeply owing to the current age struc -
ture of civil servants, even if benefit cuts and a rising retirement age have a dampening effect. The 
broad base of civil servant pension reserves and funds formed are, in principle, a welcome devel -
opment. In general, it appears desirable to already comprehensively include retirement provisions 
for civil servants in the budgets in order to reflect the full costs of current staff. Future budget 
relief would only be achieved, however, in the absence of any additional borrowing for this pur -
pose. Going forward, a review of the pension rules and regulations for civil servants – including 
looking at raising the standard retirement age above 67, as for the statutory pension insurance 
scheme – is likely to remain on the agenda.
Of the various levels of government, state government is seeing the most significant staff costs, 
especially including the prospective increase in civil servant pension payments. In 2020, the debt 
brake, which requires a (structurally) balanced budget, will have fully entered into force for the 
federal states. Should any consolidation still be necessary before that date, spending on current 
staff and civil servant pension benefits, given their major weight, would represent a prime starting 
point. There is the option here of differentiating in greater measure between the federal states 
with respect to civil servant pay rates and potentially also negotiated wages, for example. Here, 
differences in pay could be justified by differences between states with regard to price levels.Deutsche Bundesbank

Overall development  
of personnel expenditure: 
an overview1
Government personnel expenditure in Ger -
many amounted to €255 billion last year (just 
over 8½% of gross domestic product (GDP)) 
according to the cash statistics. It thus consti -
tutes the second largest spending category in 
the government budgets – recently accounting 
for around one- fifth of spending – after social 
transfers. Personnel expenditure in this context 
includes both spending on current staff and on 
pension benefits for retired civil servants as well 
as their surviving dependants (for information on the statistical base, see the box on pages 35 
and 36).
Following German reunification, the expend -
iture on current staff recorded in the national 
accounts still made up nearly one- fifth of total 
government spending. After having been on 
the decline up until the end of the last decade, 
a certain resurgence in this share has been seen 
in recent years. Overall, at an annual average of 
just over 2%, growth in the compensation of 
employees recorded in the national accounts 
was weaker than that of (nominal) economic 
output, which rose by just over 2½%. This 
meant that the ratio to GDP , starting from its 
highest point of 9% in 1993, declined to just 
over 7% by 2007, and since then has risen 
slightly on balance to just over 7½% of late 
(see the adjacent chart and the table on 
page 38).2
By contrast, civil servant pension benefits have 
increased substantially over time. Given aver -
age annual growth of 5%, they rose in several 
waves from just over 1% of GDP in 1991 to 2% 
by 1999, and have remained in this range since 
then. It should be borne in mind that this 
increase  was driven, in large part, by institu -
tional shifts in the course of the restructuring 
and partial privatisation of the German railways 
and postal service (including Deutsche Tele -
kom) in the 1990s. Central government took 
on the pension obligations for civil servants in 
this process.3 But developments at the level of

Various statistics on personnel expenditure
Government expenditure on personnel is 
reported  differently in the government fi  nance  
statistics and the national accounts. In the 
government fi  nance statistics, the analysis of 
developments is fundamentally made more 
diffi   cult by the fact that, over time, the data 
were affected by a raft of privatisations and 
outsourcing of entities from government core 
budgets. The compensating changes in the 
reporting population were performed en bloc 
in the past, thus causing further breaks in the series. By contrast, the national accounts have been using a uniform defi  nition of the govern-
ment sector, including all off- budget entities, 
even over longer time periods. At the current 
end, however, the national accounts defi  n-ition of general government fundamentally 
matches the reporting population of the gov-
ernment fi  nance statistics. In this report, the description of developments is therefore 
based as a general rule on national accounts 
data, supplemented with more detailed infor-mation from the government fi  nance statistics and the associated statistics on public service personnel.
The government fi  nance statistics are based on standard single- entry fi  scal budgets and 
build on the classifi  cation in the government 
budgetary planning system. The relevant main 
budget category 4 comprises not only the 
wages of salaried staff and pay of permanent civil servants (including all allowances depend-ing on, for instance, the specifi  c position and 
marital status) but also spending on old- age and surviving dependents’ pensions of civil 
servants and soldiers (group 43) and fi  nancial 
assistance granted in the event of illness (reported  separately for current and retired staff; group 44). Salaried employees’ retire-ment pensions, by contrast, are covered by the statutory pension insurance scheme and 
supplementary pension funds. Contributions 
to these are part of the salaried employee 
remuneration  reported in the general govern-
ment budgets. The subsequent pension pay-
ments are then transfers by (general govern-
ment) social security funds and the supple-mentary pension funds (not recorded in the 
government sector). Transfers to the pension 
reserves for current and retired civil servants, 
established nationwide in 1999, are also 
typically  classifi  ed in the budgets as personnel 
expenditure . The reserves, however, are counted in the government sector as off- budget entities. If this sector is presented as 
a (consolidated) whole, the fi  nancial relation-
ships between core budgets and reserves, reported  as personnel expenditure, are deducted , and only the civil servant pension payments are counted fully as pension ex-
penditure (irrespective of whether reserves are tapped).
The national accounts, by contrast, are in-
tended primarily to depict the circular fl  ow of 
money. They not only record employee com-
pensation from current employment (salaried 
employees and civil servants),1 but also pen-
sion benefi  ts, including healthcare payments 
for civil servants, as (monetary) social benefi  ts. 
Since no contributions to the social security 
funds are paid for current civil servants while 
the national accounts are also designed to 
make the treatment of civil servants compar-
able with the statistical treatment of salaried 
staff, including with regard to value added, imputed (notional) social security contribu-
tions are added to the equation. This means 
that, for each respective  level of government, 
imputed social contributions2 are added to 
staff costs on the expenditure side; at the 
1 Remuneration, a measure of the value created, is 
added to GDP in the “production without concluded 
transactions at signifi  cant remuneration” item in the

vants, also reveal a pronounced increase in 
financial  burdens.
Overall, therefore, personnel- related expenses 
as a percentage of GDP have decreased only 
slightly since 1991 (by 0.3 percentage point), 
recently amounting to just over 8½%. The 
share of civil servant pension benefits in this 
expenditure  item has risen by 10 percentage 
points to almost one- quarter.
The distribution of the compensation of em -
ployees recorded in the national accounts 
across the various functions of government is 
very heterogeneous. Education involves a par -
ticularly high number of staff, and accounts for 
nearly one- third of this spending (see the chart 
on page 37). Primary and secondary education 
make up the largest portion of the costs. Other 
functions with a major weight are public order 
and safety (just under 14%) and, increasingly, 
general public services (just over 19%). Social 
protection accounts for 10%, with the area of families and children recording a considerable 
increase since 2007 as a result of the expanded 
provision of childcare. The distinct decrease in 
the area of defence (to just over 6%) is ultim -
ately due to the downsizing of the Federal 
Armed Forces.
The division of functions in the German federal 
system is reflected in the distribution of ex -
penditure across the levels of government. 
State government is responsible for especially 
staff- intensive areas: education, public order 
and safety, and a good portion of general pub -
lic services. It incurs just over half of the 
expenses  for current staff, despite a slight 
reduction  in its share since the middle of the 
last decade. For local government, which 
accounts  for a share of one- quarter, a marked 
decline up until the turn of the millennium was 
followed by a countermovement, resulting in 
just a slight decrease compared with 1991.

With regard to spending on current staff, this addition accounts  for the major difference, in 
terms of fi  gures, to the government fi  nance 
statistics described above.
On the whole, compensation of employees in 
the national accounts is still generally lower 
than personnel expenditure reported in the government fi  nance statistics as the latter include  pension and healthcare payments to 
civil servants for the affected reporting popu-lation.
3 The government fi  nance statistics thus 
cover all payments occurring in a fi  scal year 
caused by general government staff. In order 
to draw a comparable picture under the national  accounts defi  nition, too, this article 
will also present, alongside compensation of 
employees, the civil servant pension benefi  ts 
(including the relevant healthcare payments) 
posted there as social transfers. To avoid over-stating the actual total burden on government 
coffers, the imputed social contributions for current civil servants are deducted when mer-
ging spending on current staff with pension 
payments.4
3 These actual pension payments exceeded the im-
puted government social contributions by a signifi  cant 
amount owing, not least, to the assumption of the 
burden of civil servant pensions from the corporate 
sector (railway and postal services).4 To this extent, the procedure differs from the national accounts treatment, in which imputed social contribu-
tions increase total central government revenue and expenditure (similarly to employer contributions for 
salaried government staff).Deutsche Bundesbank

tion period, recently amounting to one- eighth. 
By contrast, the weight of the social security 
funds (especially the statutory health insurance 
scheme and the statutory unemployment insur -
ance scheme) rose to just under one- tenth.
By international standards, the German govern -
ment’s spending on current staff is below-  
average. In relation to GDP , it is considerably 
lower than the comparable figures for the 
European Union and the United States, but on 
a similar level to Switzerland and higher than in 
Japan.4 These figures largely reflect differences 
in how the provision of public services is div -
ided between the government and the private 
sector.5 The scale of public services provided 
therefore cannot be inferred from personnel 
expenditure alone, nor is it the subject of this 
article.Determinants of spending on 
current staff
Government spending on current staff is influ -
enced by the level of wages and salaries on the 
one hand, and by the scale and structure of the 
workforce on the other. Personnel expenditure 
is less affected by short- term cyclical factors 
than by structural developments. These include 
decisions on the scope of the services provided 
by government, but also factors that are not 
directly influenced by the government, such as 
demographic change, which can have reper -
cussions for the range of education offered, for 
example.Spending on 
current staff fairly low by international standards, but comparability is limitedBasic determinants Government compensation of employees by function* in 2013

Development of pay rates
Adjustments to the remuneration of both salar -
ied employees and civil servants were standard -
ised across Germany until after the year 2000. 
Nonetheless, there was a catching-  up process 
in the east German states after reunification, 
which was already virtually completed in the 
last decade with the full harmonisation of cur -
rent pay rates.6 While civil servants’ pay rates 
are adjusted through legislation, the increases 
in earnings of salaried employees are negoti -
ated in collective wage agreements. Since the 
middle of the last decade, a new public sector 
wage agreement ( Tarifvertrag für den öffent -lichen Dienst  or TVöD) has applied to central 
government employees and, with minor modi -
fications, to local government employees, too. 
The federal states concluded their own collect -
ive wage agreement ( Tarifvertrag für den Öffent -
lichen Dienst der Länder,  or TV- L) in parallel. 
However, there is no legal obligation for nego -
tiated rates of pay to be uniformly regulated 
across the federal states. Hesse has different 
rules, for example, and Berlin also withdrew 
from the wage agreement temporarily. As a Negotiated pay 
rates largely standardised across GermanyGovernment personnel expenditure by level of government and type of spending (national accounts)

result , the main differences in negotiated rates 
of pay exist, in principle, between central and 
local government on the one hand, and the 
state governments on the other. A comparison 
for 2015 reveals, almost consistently, a certain 
pay advantage (of up to 4% in central govern -
ment) for employees subject to the TVöD.7
The setting of civil servant pay rates was made 
flexible in 2003. For instance, because of con -
siderable budget difficulties in some cases, it 
was decided that special payments (such as 
holiday pay and Christmas bonuses) should be 
set by individual state governments. Since the 
2006 federal structure reform, the remuner -
ation of civil servants at central government 
level has developed entirely separately from 
that of civil servants in individual state govern -
ments (including their local authorities).8 For 
the individual state governments, in particular, 
the weight of these payments thus provides 
opportunities to markedly influence their 
respective  budgetary situations. In doing so, 
however, the provisions of the German Basic 
Law (Article 33 (5)) must be upheld. In particu -
lar, this includes the principle of appropriate 
support for civil servants (Alimentationsprinzip) , 
which requires civil servant pay to be commen -
surate with the typical scope of responsibilities, 
taking into account general economic and 
financial   developments. Attempts to achieve 
greater budget consolidation by making signifi -
cantly lower adjustments to higher salary 
grades were, in some cases, legally overruled.9 
The Federal Constitutional Court has mean -
while stipulated a catalogue of criteria for 
reviewing  rules and regulations on civil servant 
pay in a ruling on judges’ remuneration10 (see 
the box on pages 40 to 43). The German legis -
lators nonetheless largely retain extensive dis -
cretionary scope.
Overall, the income reported in the wage and 
salary statistics for civil servants and salaried 
employees in the public sector has risen since 
1991 – amid major fluctuations at times – by 
an annual average of 2½% on an hourly basis.11 
The corresponding increases in the private sec -tor were higher, at just under 3% (see the chart 
above).12 In the 1990s, the annual average 
increases  in the public sector were still almost 
4%. They then amounted to 1% until the end 
of 2007, which, however, also reflected in -
creases in weekly working hours for many state 
governments and central government. The Considerable

11 Structural shifts not captured here (between the pay 
grades) additionally have an impact on the development of 
the average negotiated rates of pay, which are a determin -
ing factor in personnel expenditure.
12 Besides negotiated rates of pay, the private sector 
makes greater use of performance- related bonus payments 
as well as individual additional rates (for shift work, public 
holiday work, etc) that are not recorded in the wage and 
salary statistics. Adjustments to these are reflected in actual 
earnings. The difference between the rates of change in 
negotiated rates of pay and actual earnings – known as 
wage drift – is presented in percentage points. Wage drift 
increased distinctly in individual years, but in the observa -
tion period as a whole it had only a moderate (dampening) 
influence on the development of actual earnings. In add -
ition, collective wage agreements can contain supplemen -
tary agreements on occupational pension schemes, for ex -
ample, which are not reflected here.Deutsche Bundesbank

Personnel expenditure in the individual federal states
A breakdown of personnel expenditure by 
individual federal state has to be based on 
government fi  nance statistics because the 
national accounts do not contain this type 
of data. In this box, potential differences in 
the distribution of functions between state 
government (which already includes the 
local authority level for the city states) and 
local authorities are taken into account by 
including local government data. Over time, 
outsourcing of government entities to off- 
budget entities has also taken place on a 
large scale. However, at the current end, in 
the cash statistics published by the Federal 
Statistical Offi   ce, these entities are included 
in the general government sector as soon as the relevant criteria are fulfi  lled, which 
means that government personnel expend-
iture for 2014 should be captured in full.1 
Nonetheless, it must be borne in mind that 
the volume of services procured from the 
private sector rather than performed by the 
public sector’s own staff can vary. For in-stance, the proportion of children’s day 
care centres run by private providers varies 
between the federal states, meaning that 
similar services can be provided with lower 
personnel expenditure (but with higher grants to the private providers). However, this is less likely to be the case for educa-
tion, internal security and general public ad-
ministration – areas which are particularly important for state government, which 
means that considering total personnel ex-
penditure by federal state is indeed  justi-
fi  ed.
According to the data for 2014, consoli-dated personnel expenditure (at state and local government level) in Germany as a 
whole amounted to just under €2,400 per 
inhabitant, of which 77% was spent on cur-rent staff, 18½% on pensions
2 and 4½% on healthcare payments. At around €3,000, 
the highest spending was recorded by the 
city states of Hamburg and Bremen, fol-lowed by Berlin, Hesse and the Saarland, while fi  gures for the east German states 
apart from Saxony were slightly below aver-
age and spending levels for Schleswig- 
Holstein were as much as one- tenth lower 
than the average.3 However, reducing 
above- average spending, for example in 
Bremen, is hampered by the fact that almost  
half the additional expenditure takes place 
in the less fl  exible area of pensions. Ham-burg and the Saarland also recorded par-
ticularly high expenditure in this area, while 
the average fi  gures for the east German 
states (even factoring in reimbursements for former employees with entitlements to spe-
cial pension provisions or supplementary pension schemes) were one- third lower than the national average. Personnel ex-penditure (as defi  ned here) as a share of overall expenditure  amounted to 40% on average, which makes it clear that staff costs are particularly important where 
budget consolidation is required.
Differences in personnel expenditure are mainly due to the number of current staff and recipients of civil servant pensions as 
well as variations in the pay rates. A com-

cause the reporting sample for the cash statistics 
changed from reporting year to reporting year.
2 Including the reimbursements of the east German 
states and Berlin for pension payments to their former 
employees with entitlements to special pension provi-sions or supplementary pension schemes.
3 The signifi  cance of above- average personnel ex-
penditure becomes clearer if the cost savings that 
could be achieved if spending was at an average level are compared with the “consolidation gap” (the fi  scal 
defi  cit adjusted for fi  nancial transactions and consoli-
dation assistance) in 2014. This gap would almost be 
fully closed in Hesse; even in Bremen, it would still be closed by four- fi  fths.Deutsche Bundesbank

parison of public- sector staff in the individ-
ual federal states is distorted by differences in the weight of part- time employment
4. It 
therefore seems more appropriate to use 
full- time equivalents (FTEs) from the statis-
tics on public service personnel in order to 
assess labour input.5 If state and local gov-
ernment fi  gures are grouped together, re-
sulting in a total value of 41 FTEs per 1,000 
inhabitants for Germany as a whole, the highest staffi   ng levels are found in Berlin (51), followed quite some way behind by 
Hamburg and Saxony- Anhalt (44). By con-
trast, the lowest level is found in Schleswig- Holstein (36). In terms of staffi   ng structure, it is clear that in western Germany, particu-larly in the city states of Bremen and Ham-
burg, the proportion of civil servants to total salaried staff is over 40%, while in 
eastern Germany, the ratios are much lower 
(just one- quarter in Saxony and Mecklen-
burg- West Pomerania).For salaried employees, the fact that col-lective wage agreements are mostly uni-
form throughout Germany (except for state 
employees  in Hesse and limitations con-
cerning Berlin) means that there are hardly 
any differences between the federal states. 
By contrast, adjustments of civil servants’ 
pay rates, and therefore ultimately  also the 
remuneration levels of civil servants em-
ployed in state and local government, have 
varied considerably since the 2006 federal structure reform. The standard working 
week for most civil servants is 40 hours. It is only longer in Hesse (42 hours) as well as in Baden- Württemberg, North Rhine- Westphalia, 
4 Staffi   ng fi  gures for the state and local government 
levels as a whole overstate the total number of hours 
worked adjusted for part- time employment by just 
over 15%. Even so, the values range from 10-11% in 
Berlin and the east German states to just over 19% in 
Baden- Württemberg.
5 The differences in the number of standard weekly 
working hours in the individual federal states only 
slightly impair the informative value of the FTEs.Personnel expenditure by federal state in 2014*)

Schleswig- Holstein and for central govern-
ment (41 hours).
Depending on the pay grade, gross annual 
pay rates of civil servants (not adjusted for 
different standard weekly working hours) in 
Bavaria and Berlin, the federal states with 
the highest and lowest values respectively, 
varied by 10 to 15% in 2015.6 Recently, 
however, given the improvement in the 
budgetary situation, there have again been 
sharper pay adjustments in Berlin, while 
other federal states have planned certain 
reductions vis- à- vis their standard collective 
wage agreements for state government 
employees. In addition to Bavaria, civil ser-
vants’ pay levels in Baden- Württemberg and Hesse are also much higher than the 
federal state average, but this result would be reversed if the signifi  cantly longer stand-ard working hours were taken into account. 
A zero- pay round was announced in these 
federal states for 2015, too. A correction for standard working hours of this type would 
also result in a consistently higher than 
average level in Mecklenburg- West Pomer-
ania and Thuringia. As well as in Berlin, with 
a few limitations especially for low pay 
grades, remuneration is lower than average 
in Brandenburg, the Saarland, Rhineland- 
Palatinate and Bremen, in particular.7
In its ruling of May 2015 on the remuner-ation of judges, the Federal Constitutional Court established the legal boundaries for differences in civil servant pay rates be-
tween the federal states and for a potential decoupling of these rates from other signifi  -
cant factors in this context.8 Five param-
eters and critical threshold values for each 
parameter were established. As a general rule, for the principle of appropriate sup-
port for civil servants (Alimentationsprinzip) 
to be violated, the thresholds of at least the majority of these criteria must be ex-
ceeded.9 All things considered, against this

2015. Figures are based on the basic salary of the fi  nal 
level of the pay grade, including the general job- based 
allowance or structural allowance and special pay-
ments, but excluding the family allowance. Pay adjust-
ments agreed at the time for 2015 are taken into account  in Berlin, Mecklenburg- West Pomerania, 
Lower Saxony and Rhineland- Palatinate.7 Of course, when making such comparisons, it must be remembered that similar activities may be assigned to a different average pay grade for individual federal states.

9 The criteria take into account developments in the 
civil servants’ pay rates over the last 15 years in relation 
to increases in public- sector collective pay rates for salaried  employees, nominal wage developments in the relevant geographic area and consumer price in-creases. If the index value of the benchmark did not fall 5% short of its fi  nal level during this period, the threshold values are not deemed to have been ex-ceeded. In addition, over a period of ten years, the difference between the pay grade in question and other pay grades offered by the same public sector 
employer should not have shrunk by more than 10%. There is only considered to be a signifi  cant difference 
vis- à- vis other public sector employers in Germany if 
the average reference value for central government or other federal states in terms of gross annual pay rates of civil servants is undershot by more than 10%.Public sector staff *

backdrop, there is usually still likely to be 
room for manoeuvre if consolidation is 
required .
When comparing civil servants’ pay rates 
across the individual federal states, it must 
also be remembered that there are some-times considerable differences in regional price levels. Factoring in such differences changes the order in which the federal 
states are ranked in terms of remuneration of civil servants.
10 In this case, the approxi-
mated real pay rates are highest in the east 
German states of Mecklenburg- West Pom-
erania, Saxony- Anhalt and Thuringia and 
lowest in Hamburg, followed by Berlin. In a 
ruling from 2007, in view of the circum-stances at the time, the Federal Constitu-
tional Court found that there was no obli-
gation to grant supplementary allowances 
to compensate for the higher cost of living 
in urban centres, pointing out that life in such areas was particularly attractive.
11 
However, this does not mean that there cannot be differences in remuneration. In fact, such differences could be especially appropriate where regional prices vary. 
Given the growing disparity between hous-
ing costs, particularly in rural and urban areas, it would seem logical to consider providing for certain nominal differences, 
and perhaps ultimately also mirroring devel-
opments in the relevant regional private- sector wage levels more closely, even if there is no constitutional obligation to do 
so. With regard to the need to comply with 
the debt brake in 2020, most of the east 
German states, in particular, are likely to 
have to make considerable further efforts 
to reduce spending in the face of the grad-
ual abolition of the special supplementary 
central government grants.12 Owing to the 
differences in purchasing power, in this 
context, the remuneration levels of civil ser-
vants, just like those of salaried employees, seem to be an appropriate starting point.10 See J Zimmer (2016), The German Fiscal Equalisation 
System: Taking Account of Differences in Governmental 
Purchasing Powers, Mimeo, based on data from R Kawka, 
S Beißwenger, G Costa, H Kemmerling, S Müller, T Pütz, H Schmidt, S Schmidt and M Trimborn (2009), Regionaler Preisindex, Berichte, Volume 30, Bundesinstitut für Bau-, Stadt- und Raumforschung. More recent price indices for the years after 2008 are not available. Because these data 
were collected on a disaggregated basis for individual 
local governments, in the study, price indices specifi  c to 
each federal state were calculated as population- 
weighted average price indices of the local governments and set in relation to the mean value of the federal states.11 See press release No 25/ 2007 of the Federal Consti-

adjustments  were subsequently somewhat 
steeper again, at an annual average of 2½%. 
The lower increases, especially in times of high 
unemployment, must be viewed in connection 
with budget strains, which are also stronger at 
such times. In recent years, some of the adjust -
ments in the public sector contained absolute 
increases (in euro) for all pay grades, and there 
were also delayed adjustments for higher pay 
grades. As a result, the spread between pay 
rates has narrowed.
Besides gross earnings, the contribution rates 
to the social security funds constitute another 
significant factor  in the development of ex -
penditure on salaried employees, as employer 
contributions are added to the total wage bill 
when calculating the compensation of employ -
ees. Until 1998, these contribution rates rose 
by just over 2½ percentage points, with the 
public long- term care insurance scheme – estab-
lished in 1995 – alone accounting for roughly 
one- third of this. Since 1998, the contribution 
rates to the statutory pension insurance scheme 
have been lowered – initially not least by in -
creasing central government grants financed by 
tax funds. By contrast, the contribution rates to 
the statutory health insurance scheme con -
tinued to place a growing burden on employ -
ers, even though an additional contribution 
rate of 0.9% to be paid solely by employees 
was introduced in 2005. In particular, however, 
the relief provided by falling unemployment in -
surance contributions ultimately resulted in an 
overall decline   in the employer contribution 
rates of almost 2 percentage points on balance 
compared with the 1998 figures. All in all, 
therefore, the direct impact of changes in social  
contributions on the development of personnel 
expenditure since reunification was very limited. 
In addition, however, contributions to supple -
mentary pension schemes for salaried employ -
ees in the public sector also have an impact; 
although  these have risen distinctly overall, no 
sufficiently differentiated data on them is pub -
lished as yet.13 Imputed social contributions for 
civil servants have pushed up the growth rate 
of total government compensation of employ -ees since 1991 by just under ¼ percentage 
point on an annual average.14
Development of staffing levels
The number of government staff decreased in 
the period between reunification and 2013 by 
13½% on balance (or just over ½% on an 
annual  average), shrinking from just over 5 mil -
lion staff to 4½ million of late (see the chart on 
page  45 and the table on page on 46). The 
reduction in staff numbers is even more marked 
if the increasing level of part- time employment 
in the public sector is also factored in; this 
recently  stood at almost one- third.15 The over -… given some-
what higher social  contribu-tion rates on balanceMarked decline overall in government  workforce
13 For the years 2002 to 2014, under the west German 
pay scale, employers participating in the supplementary 
pension scheme of central and state government ( Versor -
gungsanstalt des Bundes und der Länder,  or VBL) had to 
transfer 6.45% of eligible pay to the pay- as- you- go 
scheme. Under the east German pay scale, by contrast, this 
figure was recently only 1%, plus the 2% contribution col -
lected here under the capital-  funded pension scheme. An 
agreement was also made to levy restructuring charges. 
These amounted to an average of 2% under the west Ger -
man pay scale (based on a benchmark payment carried for -
ward from 2001) – with significant differences between 
employers – and 1% under the east German pay scale. VBL 
is not included in the government sector in the national 
accounts and is not bound by the relevant obligation to 
supply data for the government finance statistics. Greater 
transparency would be desirable in this area. In principle, 
the reforms implemented in this area over the last decade 
are likely to have averted the severe additional burden that 
was impending for government budgets. However, the 
rules and regulations now in place also imply considerably 
increasing burdens for public sector employers.
14 The capital- funded pension funds that have been widely 
set up over the last few years, and which, in principle, are 
to be built up from contributions calculated using actuarial 
methods while civil servants are actively employed, have no 
impact here. Transfers to these funds are consolidated as 
transactions between the government sector’s core 
budgets and off- budget entities.
15 The data on the overall development since 1991 are 
based on the definition of the government sector used in 
the national accounts. By comparison, the statistics on 
public service personnel (which, besides the core budgets, 
notably include institutions established under public law 
– such as an ever large number of hospitals – but thus do 
not precisely align with the definition of the government 
sector as per the national accounts) provide more detailed 
data, which are only available in this form from the 2000 
reporting year, however. According to these statistics, the 
4.6 million public sector employees corresponded to 4 mil -
lion full- time equivalents (FTEs) around mid-2014. This fig -
ure factors in part- time employees only using the ratio of 
their agreed working hours to the regular full- time hours. 
Compared with the 2000 reporting year, the reduction in 
the number of public sector employees was 4½%, but 
7½% for FTEs.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
October 2015

all development in the government sector was 
attributable, in good part, to the reduction of 
relatively high staffing levels in the east German 
states, but also to the downsizing of the Fed -
eral Armed Forces.16 Developments have been 
stabilising since 2005, however, and staff levels 
have been seen to increase again to a certain 
degree, adjusted for the effects of suspending 
compulsory military service in 2011. This trend 
reversal is attributable, on the one hand, to 
additional jobs in primary, secondary and 
higher education as well as in childcare since 
2007.17 On the other hand, staff reduction pro -
cesses also gradually weakened in the east Ger -
man states and in other areas.
Changes in the employment structure can also 
influence average wages and salaries.18 For 
example , when civil servants are employed 
rather  than salaried employees in comparable 
pay grades, government budgets may make 
initial savings, as there are no social contribu -
tions to impact on the financial balance and 
expenditure on healthcare payments for cur -
rent staff is relatively low. In the long term, at 
the latest, expenditure on civil servant pensions 
and healthcare payments will have an impact, 
however.19 For salaried employees, on the 
other hand, contributions have to be made to 
the social security funds and supplementary 
pension schemes. Pensions and health services 
are then paid for by these entities. At present, 
civil servants (including the soldiers on fixed-  
term and permanent contracts and judges 
counted here) constitute just under 40% of 
public sector employees (1.8 million persons). 
Over two- thirds of central government staff 
and over half of state government staff are civil 
servants, with school teachers and the police 
service being of particular significance for state 
government. The proportions of civil servants 
to total staff remain significantly lower in the 
east German states and Berlin (37% altogether) 
than in western Germany (59%). For local gov -
ernment and the social security funds, by con -
trast, salaried employees predominate, making 
up around nine-  tenths (see the chart on 
page 47). Over time, the proportion of civil ser -vants in the public sector has risen somewhat, 
as the decline in the number of salaried em -
ployees –  despite reductions in the Federal 
Armed Forces, for example – has been offset 
by a slight increase in the number of civil ser -
vants overall.
Taken in isolation, shifting staff between career 
classes in the public sector led to a rise in 
wages and salaries. In particular, the Higher 
and Upper Intermediate Service classes ex -
panded perceptibly as shares of overall public Structural shifts:

16 This is reflected far more sharply in the national 
accounts  data – unlike in the statistics on public service 
personnel – because persons liable for military service are 
also included, besides soldiers on fixed- term and perman -
ent contracts.
17 The underlying staffing level from the Federal Statistical 
Office’s personnel statistics (the data of which draw on the 
reporting population of the government finance statistics 
for the respective  reporting year) is likely to fall short of the 
actual level of staff- related spending, since privately run in -
stitutions or independently operated social institutions are 
increasingly  taking on tasks in the areas of childcare, 
schools and higher education. Government grants ultim -
ately cover the bulk of their staff costs.
18 The increase in part- time employment is not taken into 
account here. Although it formally decreases average 
wages and salaries, its actual impact is by way of the 
reduction  in FTEs.
19 If adequate payments to pension funds are counted 
towards  the budgetary leeway, this effect is immediately 
visible. With this in mind, the state of Hesse recognises sig -
nificantly higher amounts to reflect the full costs incurred 
by state government when calculating cost rates for the 
working hours of civil servants, for example, than it does 
for salaried employees in comparable pay grades. See

sector staff, whereas the reverse was observed 
in the pay grades with lower wages and salar -
ies (see the chart on page 48).20 The average 
age has risen markedly overall.21 One reason 
for this is that cases of early retirement due to 
incapacity for work have fallen. As there is a 
positive correlation between wage and salary 
levels and the average age owing to seniority- 
based pay scales, this is also likely to have 
resulted   in higher spending on current staff in 
and of itself.Public sector staff by type of employment*

20 Several federal states revised the career classes follow -
ing the 2006 federal structure reform, meaning that 
changes can only be tracked up to 2010. Statistical evi -
dence of the outlined tendency can be provided at central 
government level for the years thereafter. The sharp decline 
in other types of employment is attributable to the fact 
that the workers assigned to this category in 2000 were 
assigned to specific career classes (mainly to the Lower Ser -
vice) in 2010.

Financial burdens resulting 
from spending on pensions
Spending on civil servant pensions has placed a 
growing strain on public finances over the past 
few years. Rising at an average annual rate of 
5%, it has been increasing twice as sharply as 
overall government expenditure since 1991 
and recently amounted to 2% of GDP accord -
ing to the national accounts figures. Spending 
on pensions is linked to the number of persons 
entitled to pension benefits and the average 
level of pension payments (including healthcare 
payments). The former is determined by the 
previous staffing level and the age structure of 
current civil servants, in particular. Other fac -
tors that play a significant role are life expect -
ancy, practices relating to recruitment and the 
awarding of civil servant status, and changes in 
the legal framework: these include changes to 
the standard retirement age and, owing to be -
havioural adjustments arising as a result of such 
changes, to the pension deductions in the case 
of early retirement. When determining average 
pension payments, the statutory ratio of pen -
sion per year of service to final pensionable in -
come, the periods of service to be factored into 
the ratio, the career class and pay structure of 
former current staff and the scale of future pay 
adjustments are relevant.
In the light of foreseeable higher burdens, vari -
ous adjustments to federal legislation were 
adopted in recent years to curb pension ex -
penditure; these were chiefly intended to trans -
fer benefit cuts in the statutory pension insur -
ance scheme to persons with civil servant pen -
sion entitlements.22 For example, cuts were 
made, inter alia,  to surviving dependants’ pen -
sions (chiefly widows’ and widowers’ pen -
sions).23 Starting in 2003 and in line with the 
“Riester reform steps”, the maximum pension 
level for persons with civil servant status was 
gradually cut by a total of 3¼ percentage 
points in eight stages.24 In addition, pension 
deductions of up to 10.8% were also intro -
duced for retirement due to incapacity for work 
(these were already standard in the case of Determinants

22 Individual federal states have also been able to inde -
pendently set civil servant pensions since the 2006 federal 
structure reform. However, a great deal of state govern -
ment legislation is still closely based on central government 
legislation.
23 Surviving dependants of civil servants are entitled to the 
following pensions pursuant to the 2001 Civil Servant Pen -
sion Amendment Act now that transitional provisions have 
been phased out: 55% of the deceased person’s benefits 
for widows’ and widowers’ pensions, 20% for full- orphans’ 
pensions and 12% for half- orphans’ pensions.
24 Pension payments are calculated pursuant to the total 
old- age pension rate linked to pensionable remuneration 
achieved over a civil servant’s period of service. Since 2011, 
the old- age pension rate for each year of service in central 
government has been 1.79375% of civil servants’ pension -
able pay (previously 1.875%), and the maximum pension 
rate of 71.75% (previously 75%) is still reached after 40 
years of service. Up until the early 1990s, there were higher 
factors for the early years of service, and the maximum 
level of 75% was reached after only 35 years.Deutsche Bundesbank

early retirement for other reasons). On the 
other hand, in parallel with raising the statutory 
retirement age to 67 by 2029, the standard 
retirement  age for central government civil ser -
vants has been increasing by an initial period of 
one month a year since 2012. At the same 
time, the periods taken into account for higher 
education courses were reduced.25 As a result, 
the average old- age pension rate was 67.2% in 
2013 compared with 72.8% in 1994.26 Further -
more, the pension reserves that were unani -
mously adopted at central and state govern -
ment level in 1998 (see the box on pages 49 
to 51) continued to have a dampening impact 
on pension expenditure. The uniform adjust -
ment cut of 0.2 percentage point made to the 
remuneration of central government civil ser -
vants, both current and retired, in spring 2015 
was thus already the ninth of its kind.
On the one hand, developments in the number 
of recipients of civil servant pensions in the 
public sector reflect longer life expectancy and 
an increase in the number of staff close to 
retirement  age. On the other hand, legislative 
changes that have tended to narrow retirement 
options have also played a role. All in all, the 
number of recipients has climbed by one-  
quarter since 1993 to just over 1½ million in 
2014 (annual average rise of just over 1%).27Developments at central government level 
were strongly influenced by the German rail -
way and postal services and their successor 
enterprises . Just over two- thirds of the total 
number of recipients of civil servant pensions at 
central government level (640,000 at last 
count) are part of this group. In the 1990s, the 
overall number of recipients initially rose sharply 
owing to a wide range of early retirement 
schemes as well as cases of retirement due to 
incapacity for work. However, the number of 
railway service pensioners has fallen perceptibly 
again in the meantime. The number of pen -
sions financed by central government arising 
from employment contracts concluded before

to 75%, while the proportion of surviving dependants’

Reserves for fi  nancing future civil servant pensions
In the 1990s, government decision- makers 
became more acutely aware of the steeply 
growing burden of public old- age provision 
facing both the pay- as- you- go statutory 
pension insurance scheme and central, state and local governments funding the pension payments of their employees 
awarded civil servant status. Civil servants’ 
non- contributory pensions are likewise fi  nanced  on a pay- as- you- go basis in that pension obligations from the past are ser-viced from current budgets, while the cumulating  pension entitlements of cur-rently working civil servants will weigh on 
future budgets. The related public funding 
requirements may increase if, for example, 
the recruitment of new staff with civil ser-
vant status leads to a later spike in the num-ber of recipients of civil servant pensions or 
if the relative burden of civil servant pen-
sions rises as a result of a shrinking popula-tion (and a declining number of taxpayers). 
As state governments, in particular, in-
creased their headcount signifi  cantly in the 1970s, a large pension burden has accumu-lated in the meantime.
This prompted government entities to set 
up dedicated pension reserves and pension funds for their civil servants from the second 
half of the 1990s. Whereas the pension reserves  are generally intended to cushion temporary fi  nancial burdens, the pension funds basically aim to fi  nance all pension benefi  ts of new civil servants appointed after the fund’s establishment in an 
insurance- like fashion. The pension reserves 
and funds receive transfers from the core budgets with a view to their investment and subsequent withdrawal to relieve the core budgets. The transfers are mostly based on current civil servants’ earnings. Ideally, a fair system of intergenerational burden- sharing would require those who benefi  t from the services supplied by civil servants to concurrently fi  nance the associ-
ated pension liabilities via higher taxes or 
charges. However, it must also be remem-
bered that the changeover to a funded sys-tem imposes a dual burden on the change-
over generation, which has to bear the 
costs of both former civil servants’ pension 
payments and (at least partly) transfers for 
future pension funding of currently serving 
staff. Yet, this is the prerequisite for easing 
the future burden on government budgets. 
By contrast, if the pension reserves are 
funded through higher borrowing (leading 
to increased interest payments), the associ-
ated fi  nancial burdens are not frontloaded 
but merely change their formal defi  nition.1
In 1998, uniform pension reserves were 
agreed for central government and all state 
governments to cushion the expected fu-
ture peaks in fi  nancial burdens. The reserves 
were to be fi  lled between 1999 and 2013. 
The annually envisaged pay increases for 
civil servants were to be reduced by around 0.2 percentage point during this period and 
the cumulative amount thus saved trans-
ferred to the pension reserves.
1 Under national budgetary rules, which are geared to 
new borrowing, government expenditures could con-
ceivably be increased by the setting- up of pension 
reserves  and later decreased by their release. But the 
European budgetary rules are pegged to the system of 
national accounts. Hence the structural general gov-
ernment defi  cit, which is the key benchmark, is not 
affected by the accumulation or release of reserves as these, too, are recorded in the government sector (and payments between core budgets and reserves consoli-
dated). A different accounting scenario would arise if 
civil servants’ pension entitlements vis- à- vis their public 
employer were subsequently to be recorded outside 
the government sector, eg by paying contributions to an insurance corporation – insofar as this is compatible 
with the principle of permanent appropriate support 
for civil servants (Alimentationsprinzip).Deutsche Bundesbank

Following some years of underfunding2 and 
against the backdrop of an increase in the 
life expectancy of retired civil servants, cen-
tral government decided to extend the 
build- up phase up to and including 2017. At 
the end of 2014, the central government 
pension reserve totalled €8½ billion. In March 2015, the level of central govern-ment civil servants’ pay was correspond-
ingly 1.8% lower overall than it would have 
been without the pay rise haircuts that began in 1999. The cumulated haircuts have both lowered current civil servants’ pensionable pay and led to a permanent 
decrease (over and above the additional cut 
in the pension rate) in the volume of their 
pension entitlements.3 From 2018, the cen-
tral government civil servant pension re-serve is to be used to relieve the central 
government budget over a 15-year period. 
Withdrawals could amount to just over €½  billion per year. The annual relief for 
future  budgets would be well below 5% in relation to civil servant pension payments of 
just over €21 billion envisaged for 2018 in 
the fi  nancial plan drawn up in summer 
2015.
In addition, central government set up a dedicated civil servant pension fund in 
2007. It was intended as a changeover to a 
kind of funded pension system for all new 
civil servants. Since its creation, the dedi-
cated civil servant pension fund has received  transfers calculated on an actuarial basis in 
order to permanently fi  nance  all pension payments due for this category of staff from 2020 onwards.
4 At the end of 2014, 
the fund contained just over €1½ billion. In 2014, the transfers amounted to just under €½ billion.
Central government currently thus has total 
provisions for civil servant pensions of €10½ 
billion. According to central government’s integrated wealth accounts, provisions in 
the order of €530 billion would be required 
to fully cover all civil servant pension and healthcare entitlements. The transfers to 
the two pension facilities in the past year 
covered around half of the €3 billion in 
newly arisen obligations from currently 
serving civil servants and predominantly fl  owed into the pension reserve. In add-ition, future obligations were revised up-
wards by around €25 billion as a 0.35 per-centage point lower discount factor (of just 
over 3%) was applied in view of the low 
interest rate level. This clearly illustrates the major importance of discount rates for long time- horizons.
Since the federalism reform in 2006, each state government has been free to decide whether it wished to continue its pension 
reserves. For a time, most states carried on 
with the system that had been established 
by federal law. First adjustments were made 
in view of budgetary strains caused by the 
fi  nancial and economic crisis in 2009. Lower Saxony, for example, discontinued its trans-
fers at the end of the last decade with a view to limiting its net borrowing. Lower Saxony’s budget plans in recent years had already envisaged withdrawals of funds, but implementation was waived due to better- than- expected budget develop-ments. The federal state of Bremen, too, decided to discontinue its transfers to its civil servant pension reserve. Parts of the 
2 To reduce the maximum civil servant pension rate 
(ie old- age pension in relation to pensionable civil ser-
vant pay) eight pension increases between 2003 and 
2011 were lowered by ½ percentage point each. Half 
the savings from these haircuts were channelled into 
the civil servants’ pension reserves. The above- 
mentioned general haircuts and the originally envis-aged additional allocations to the pension reserve 
were suspended during this time.3 This measure was planned alongside the cuts in the 
statutory pension insurance scheme, which were, 
however, put on hold following the change in the cen-
tral government in 1998 until the sustainability factor 
was introduced in 2005.4 Allocation rates are set to be reviewed at three- year 
intervals. The initial rates (prescribed for staff with no 
particular age limit) of around 29% for civil servants in 
the Higher Service and close to 25% for those in the 
Upper Intermediate Service were increased perceptibly 
from 2012 to just under 37% and just over 29% 
respectively .Deutsche Bundesbank

reserve  are now being used to fi  nance add-
itional fi  nancial strains resulting from court 
rulings relating to civil servant pension 
payments . While the state of Rhineland- 
Palatinate continues to transfer money to 
the reserve, it also withdraws amounts so 
as to fi  nance its current budget, although it 
does not offset these amounts against its 
structural fi  scal balance in the context of 
the debt brake.
Well before central government, the state government of Rhineland- Palatinate intro-duced a fully funded system for its newly appointed civil servants in 1996, not least 
to increase transparency regarding all costs for employees with civil servant status. The state’s contributions, calculated on an actu-arial basis, considerably exceeded the trans-
fers to the pension reserve in view of the larger number of employees with this sta-tus.
5 Most other state governments – like 
central government – did not set up funded 
pension schemes for their staff with civil servant status until around a decade later. The regulations governing the different schemes vary notably, however. North 
Rhine- Westphalia, for example, transfers a 
fl  at monthly amount for each new civil ser-
vant, which is, however, likely to be lower 
than the amount calculated in actuarial 
terms.
According to a survey conducted by the 
fi  nance  ministry of North Rhine- Westphalia6, 
the capitalised assets of all civil servant pen-sion reserves and funds of the federal states 
amounted to around €30 billion overall at 
the end of 2014 – while expenditure on civil 
servant pensions and related healthcare 
payments of the core budgets alone came 
to €31 billion in that year. Of those funds, 
€5 billion alone (ie around €1,300 per in-habitant) were attributable to Rhineland- Palatinate. According to the survey, the total volume of reserve assets for Bavaria 
stood at merely €2 billion (around €200 per 
inhabitant). Bavaria has signifi  cantly re-duced its transfers in the last few years to 
avoid net borrowing and achieve the goal 
of fully repaying its debts in the decade to 
come. By contrast, according to a draft law adopted by the government of North Rhine- Westphalia, the state’s outstanding amount 
of close to €8 billion (around €500 per in-
habitant) is to be further topped up by 2016 
in line with the current rules (by an overall 
amount of just over €1 billion at that time). The two pension facilities are to be merged in 2017. Total transfers are subsequently to 
be reduced to €200 million. As no with-drawals are currently envisaged from the old pension reserve, which would be pos-
sible from 2018, the reduction in transfers 
overstates the actual budgetary relief from 
the changeover. But as transfers have been counted so far towards the new borrowing 
limit, the burden on the state budget will nevertheless be somewhat lower initially. 
Conversely, this will further limit the scope 
for future net withdrawals and the associ-
ated later fi  nancial leeway for complying 
with the debt brake.
In general, it is important for state govern-
ments to rigorously continue to consolidate their budgets so as to ensure that they are able to comply with the debt brake in 2020. 
Besides achieving structurally balanced 
budgets, they would also be well advised to make supplementary provisions for civil ser-
vant pensions so as to ease the strain of 
foreseeable high burdens on future budgets. 
Looking ahead, it would make sense to 
switch over to a pre- fi  nanced system, above all to obtain a clear and continuous picture of the full costs of employing staff with civil servant status.
5 However, these contributions were made in the form 
of loans. In this way, it was possible to fully fi  nance 
them through borrowing in the context of both the 
old debt ceiling and the debt brake. Correspondingly, 
the withdrawal of funds does not relieve the structural 
balance (which in both cases is consistent with the 
European defi  cit rules).6 See Press release of 21 August 2015 at http://www.fm.nrw.deDeutsche Bundesbank

the Federal Republic of Germany28 was founded 
also recorded a sharp decline. On balance, 
both of these factors slightly outweighed the 
pick- up in pensions for those who worked in 
the primary public service at central govern -
ment level (+45%) and in the postal service’s 
successor enterprises. Overall, the number of 
central government pensioners has therefore 
shrunk by 4% since 1993.
By contrast, the number of pension recipients 
at state government level jumped substantially 
(by 74½% to approximately 795,000). A large- 
scale recruitment drive took place up to the 
early 1980s – this focused primarily on hiring 
teaching staff in response to the baby boom, 
which persisted until the mid-1960s, and the 
trend to acquire higher education qualifica -
tions, which entails a longer period of compul -
sory schooling. The sharp rise in civil servant 
pension recipients in the west German states 
since the turn of the millennium is primarily due 
to a wave of these teachers entering retirement . Overall, civil servant pension recipients in the 
east German states remain far fewer in num -
ber, which is because public sector employees 
were not awarded civil servant status until after 
German reunification.29 The number of civil ser -
vant pension recipients in local government 
and the social security funds rose at a consider -
ably weaker pace – most recently coming to 
115,000 and 20,000 respectively  – meaning 
that civil servant pension obligations play a far 
less important role for them.
While rising life expectancy also contributed to 
the general surge in the number of civil servant 
pension recipients, this effect was counter -
acted by the increase in the average retirement 
age. This was edging upwards even before the 
statutory retirement age was raised in 2012 on 
the back of previous reform measures (pension 
deductions in the event of early retirement, 
phasing out early retirement schemes, cutting 
the old- age pension rate).30 Another key elem -
ent in this was clearly the significant decrease 
in incapacity for work being cited as a reason 
for retirement, particularly for teaching staff at 
state and local government level. Prior to the 
new legislation on pension deductions coming 
into force in 2001, the share of retirement

This covers civil servants, soldiers on permanent contracts 
who served in the armed forces of the Third Reich, officers 
from the Reich Labour Service (Reichsarbeitsdienst)  and

their positions after the Second World War, together with 
surviving dependents. See Federal Statistical Office, Ver-
sorgungsempfänger des öffentlichen Dienstes, Fach -
serie 14, Reihe 6.1.
29 Furthermore, the east German states and Berlin are still 
incurring expenditure in connection with former GDR state 
officials. While these former employees do not receive civil 
servant pensions, they do receive pensions from the statu -
tory pension insurance scheme. Central government and 
the aforementioned federal states reimburse the scheme 
for these payments. These are classified in the budgets as 
transfers rather than personnel expenditure. The overall 
volume, approximately half of which is borne by central 
government, has continued to grow moderately in recent 
years and stood at €5 billion in 2014.
30 Phased retirement schemes could also have played a 
role here. These schemes ultimately mean that participat -
ing staff who enter the work- free period of phased retire -
ment continue to be recorded as current staff. If phased 
retirement were being used as an alternative to early retire -
ment, it would cause the average retirement age to rise.Deutsche Bundesbank

cases due to incapacity for work had soared to 
over 60%. This share subsequently plunged 
back to only around one- sixth of new pension 
recipients in 2013. The share of public sector 
staff entering early retirement climbed to 
around one- quarter by the end of the 1990s 
before tumbling to a mere 4% of late. As a 
result , reaching the retirement age was by far 
the main reason for retiring (78%) in recent 
times. The gradual raising of the retirement age 
will therefore further postpone the point of 
retirement  and thus have a dampening effect 
on the number of recipients of civil servant 
pensions.
In addition to the pension level at the start of 
retirement and the number of recipients of civil 
servant pensions, the regular adjustments to 
pension payments are a key parameter for pen -
sion expenditure patterns. In the past, these 
adjustments were regularly undertaken in con -
junction with those made to civil servants’ pay; 
however, for a number of years they have been 
substantially lower, which is primarily attribut -
able to the gradual reduction in the civil servant 
pension level from 2003 onwards. The pension- 
curbing legislative measures outlined above 
were accompanied by expenditure- boosting 
structural effects. In particular, the waning sig -
nificance of surviving dependents (with lower 
entitlements) and eligible railway service staff 
(who, on average, receive low pension pay -
ments in relative terms) exacerbated the bur -
den. All in all, average monthly gross pension 
payments have risen by just under 2½% per 
year since the mid-1990s.31
Outlook and  
concluding remarks 
The current trend towards a moderate increase 
in public sector staff levels is likely to continue 
over the next few years – not least in view of 
the budgetary situation, which is relatively 
favourable   on the whole. The need for add -
itional staff could continue to rise in the area of 
childcare, in particular. Furthermore, long- term staff reduction processes could come to an end 
in central government and be gradually phased 
out in the east German states. Opportunities 
for increasing efficiency – for instance, in con -
nection with making the management of 
resources  more results- based  – and the pro -
jected fall in pupil numbers32 could lower staff -
ing requirements in and of themselves.33 How -
ever, opposing structural changes are occurring 
in the education sector. These include the per -
ceptible hike in the number of higher educa -
tion qualifications, for which numerous calls 
have been made, as well as changes possibly Pension adjust -

instances arises, this could be partly met in future – even

arising as a result of the measures laid down by 
law to integrate disabled persons into main -
stream education. Staffing requirements, par -
ticularly in the education sector, could also 
increase  markedly (at least temporarily) in re -
sponse to the currently high influx of refugees. 
To a certain extent, this could also apply to the 
area of public administration.
It is important – particularly prior to expanding 
the scope of government services – to carefully 
examine whether shifts between functions and 
increases in efficiency are possible when allo -
cating resources. If staffing levels are expanded, 
a decision must be made regarding the requis -
ite funding (possibly fee- based). Even in individ -
ual cases, it would be necessary to calculate 
whether it would make more economic sense 
for services to be provided by the private sec -
tor. This is all the more the case given that a 
decision in favour of additional public sector 
staff is typically accompanied by a long-  term 
financial commitment. That being said, there 
seems to have been a certain degree of flexibil -
ity in this regard in recent years, which is 
reflected , in particular, in the growing promin -
ence – for new staff, at least – of fixed- term 
employment contracts.34 As a general rule, 
fixed- term contracts can also reasonably cover 
only temporary staffing needs.35
In the near future, general wage and salary 
growth in the public sector is expected to be 
broadly in line with that in the private sector – 
as it has been in recent years. Given the favour -
able labour market situation and general gov -
ernment’s sound overall budgetary position, it 
is currently unlikely that the negative gap 
between  public and private sector wages and 
salaries will become greater, at least. Moreover, 
general government will have to try hard in its 
capacity as an employer to continue to attract 
highly qualified, motivated staff against the 
backdrop of demographic change. This will 
also need to be taken into account in the pay 
developments of individual wage and salary 
grades as well as in any other public sector 
reforms .Overall, civil servant pension expenditure will 
place a considerably greater strain on public 
finances  in the coming years. However, devel -
opments will be highly divergent at central, 
state and local government levels. Up until the 
2006 federal structure reform, the Federal Gov -
ernment’s Civil Servant Pension Reports out -
lined expected developments in general gov -
ernment pension recipient figures and costs. By 
contrast, the 2013 projections relate solely to 
central government. They reveal a marked 
decline  of more than two- fifths up to 2050 in 
the number of civil servant pension recipients 
attributable to the railway and postal services. 
The reduction in the number of soldiers on per -
manent contracts and general job shedding to 
date are also providing relief. Based on the 
report’s  assumption that civil servant pension 
payments will be adjusted by an annual rate of 
2.6% from 2014, and thus in line with the 
macroeconomic developments assumed in said 
report, the ratio of central government’s civil 
servant pension expenditure (excluding railway 
and postal services) to GDP will remain con -
stant at 0.2% until 2050. Including these items, 
the civil servant pension expenditure ratio will 
even shrink considerably (from 0.6% in 2013 to 
0.3% in 2050). Central government will there -
fore not be affected by demographic change in 
the form of rising civil servant pension benefits. 
However, funding requirements, particularly for 
grants to the statutory pension insurance 
scheme, will climb significantly.
The fact that there are no longer any official 
consolidated projections of civil servant pen -
sion obligations for the federal states makes it 
more difficult to analyse the situation and com -
promises the transparency of public finances. 
To address this, it would be beneficial for the

stitutes an increase of almost 10% since 2011.

jections and overviews. In the context of 
budgetary surveillance, this would make it eas -
ier to determine the potential need for action 
at an early stage and work towards any cor -
rective action.36 Information is available in the 
Civil Servant Pension Reports of individual fed -
eral states on state- specific developments. 
These indicate that the particularly personnel-  
intensive state government budgets in western 
Germany will continue to be perceptibly 
affected  by the increase in civil servant pension 
obligations over the next few years.37
All things considered, the federal states’ cur -
rent pension reserves will be easily outstripped 
by growing civil servant pension obligations 
over the next decade. Although capital- funded 
pension funds have existed at central govern -
ment level and in numerous federal states for 
several years, their inflows are, in any case, only 
intended to cover the pensions of employees 
who have been awarded civil servant status in 
recent years and will therefore normally still 
have a large part of their working life ahead of 
them. In this respect, frequent checks will 
have to be carried out to determine whether 
adjustments need to be made to civil servant 
pension benefits – in addition to regular adjust -
ments to limit the generally rapid rise in 
 healthcare- related expenses (civil servant 
healthcare payments) – as budgetary pressure 
increases. The requirements set out in the 
German  Basic Law are to be observed. In any 
event, it is likely that extending working life 
and increasing the retirement age will continue 
to play a significant role, just as they do in the 
case of the statutory pension insurance scheme. 
Against the backdrop of demographic change 
caused by rising life expectancy coupled with 
relatively low birth rates, which are unlikely to 
be fundamentally offset by any additional wave 
of migration, the statutory retirement age will 
probably need to be further raised above the 
age of 67 in future. If the greatest possible level 
of planning certainty is to be ensured in this 
regard, it would be advisable to have a timely 
discussion about any further adjustments that may become necessary  in the wake of demo -
graphic change. One possible target could be 
for the average length of time for which an 
old- age pension is drawn and the average 
working life to move in parallel with each other.
In terms of spending on current staff and civil 
servant pensions, differences in the financial 
situation of individual federal states are of 
major significance. The unfavourable financial 
situation in several federal states, which are 
suffering from restricted flexibility, particularly 
on the revenue side, indicates that personnel 
expenditure should be limited as much as pos -
sible. One particular avenue to pursue in this 
respect is to examine whether staff numbers 
can be cut. In principle, the differences in staff 
deployment between federal states – which are 
considerable on the whole – point to scope for 
action. Furthermore, greater focus could be 
placed on the standard working week or 
adjusting  civil servant pay rates. The limits set 
by the Federal Constitutional Court should, for 
the most part, still provide some leeway. From 
an economic perspective, it would, in particu -
lar, be reasonable when determining the pay of 
not only civil servants but potentially also salar -
ied employees in individual federal states to 
take into account differences relating to aver -
age living costs and thus purchasing power. 
This could be supplemented by taking into con -
sideration further regional gradations. The dif -
ferent price levels are likely to be reflected in 
the respective levels of private sector pay, too, 
which are also of particular importance with 
respect  to the tax revenue collected in each 
federal state.Growing pension 
obligations can-not be fully met using reserves  aloneStronger divergence  in pay levels of individual  federal  states appropriate

Baden-  Württemberg  expects pension recipient figures to 
climb significantly by one- third up to the middle of the next 
decade and – subject to estimates regarding the number of 
vacant positions that will be refilled – essentially stabilise at 
this level until 2050. In its 2012 report, North Rhine-  
Westphalia assumes a somewhat lower increase of just 
over one-  quarter up to the mid-2020s, which is expected 
to be followed by a slight fall up to 2040.Deutsche Bundesbank
