Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Uncertainty about future cyclical developments 
in Germany has increased noticeably in recent 
weeks. Business sentiment in May was charac -
terised by a less optimistic assessment of the 
current economic situation. Moreover, expect -
ations of future growth have been lowered 
perceptibly. Both indicators were still at a rela -
tively high level, however. Nevertheless, it re -
mains to be seen to what extent the recent es -
calation of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro 
area and the signs of a slowdown in the global 
economy will further weaken the outlook for 
the German economy. The rise in industrial 
orders from non-euro-area countries in the first 
four months of 2012 largely offset the decline 
in euro-area demand. The fact that enterprises’ 
short-term plans are characterised by a greater 
degree of caution is suggested, in particular, by 
the marked decline in imports in April. Enter -
prises did, however, continue to hire additional 
staff on a considerable scale in April, too, on 
balance, and willingness to recruit new staff re -
mained at a high level.
On the whole, current indicators are consistent 
with the expectation that overall economic 
momentum could gradually pick up again in 
the second half of the year following weaker 
growth in the second quarter.
Industry
Industrial output fell by a seasonally adjusted 
2¼% in April compared with March, when the 
figures had been strongly overstated due to 
late reports, primarily in the mechanical engin -
eering sector. The bridging day on 30 April and 
the warning strikes in the metal-working indus -
try also played a part in this decline. If these 
special factors are excluded, the level of the first quarter is likely to have been largely main -
tained. The fall in the output of intermediate 
goods, at -½%, was comparatively small, 
whereas the decline in capital goods (-3½%) 
– also on account of the special factors – was 
relatively pronounced. The manufacture of 
consumer goods was likewise scaled back con -
siderably (-3¾%).
The volume of new orders received by German 
industry fell strongly in April by almost 2% on 
the month. This was due, first and foremost, to 
a decline in the volume of large orders. Never -
theless, new orders were still up slightly (+¼%) 
on the average of the first quarter. There was a 
slight increase in orders of capital goods, in 
particular (+¾%). A greater number of orders 
were also received both from Germany (+1¼%) 
and non-euro-area countries (+1%), whereas 
the volume of orders from other euro-area 
countries continued to decline (-2¼%). There 
was a decline mainly in the demand for passen -
ger cars, although machinery was also affected.
Industrial sales were 1¼% down on the month 
in April and ½% down on the average of the 
first quarter. Intermediate goods increased by 
1% on the month, whereas capital goods were 
still lagging behind by 3¼%. Domestic sales fell 
by just ½% and export sales were down by as 
much as 2¼%. The value of goods exports de -
clined by 1¾% on the March figure and im -
ports by almost 5%, although a fall in energy 
prices played a part in this.
Construction
Construction activity returned to normal again 
in April following exceptionally strong catching- 
up effects in March. Output still held up at the 
average level of 2011, despite declining by 6% 
on the month. In particular, the underlying 
trend in building construction was expansion -
ary, whereas civil engineering was slowly ad -Economic out -

justing to the lower level of orders. Construc -
tion orders in March –  more recent data are 
unavailable at present – were down 1½% on 
the month. There was a sharp 5¼% increase in 
building construction, whereas civil engineer -
ing contracted by 8½% after posting a steep 
increase in the previous month.
Labour market
The growth in employment continued in April. 
The number of persons in work in Germany 
rose perceptibly by a seasonally adjusted 
29,000 on the month. The year-on-year figure 
showed an increase of 572,000, or 1.4%. Ac -
cording to an initial estimate, the seasonally 
adjusted number of persons in employment 
subject to social security contributions con -
tinued to rise sharply in March. The year-on-
year increase was 675,000, or 2.4%. By con -
trast, there was a further decline in the number 
of persons working exclusively in low-paid 
part-time jobs. According to both the Ifo em -
ployment barometer – despite showing a fur -
ther perceptible decline – and the Federal Em -
ployment Agency’s BA-X index for job vacan -
cies, the willingness of enterprises to recruit 
new staff remained at a very high level.
The seasonally adjusted number of persons 
registered as unemployed remained unchanged 
in May. The unemployment rate (using the Fed -
eral Employment Agency’s definition) did, how -
ever, fall slightly to 6.7% since the unemploy -
ment rate in May was being calculated for the 
first time using a somewhat higher figure for 
the labour force. Labour market policy meas -
ures were scaled back further owing to the im -
proved employment situation. The year-on-year 
decrease in total underemployment as recorded 
by the Federal Employment Agency (303,000) 
was therefore much stronger than the decline 
in registered unemployment (105,000).Continued

Prices
The price for a barrel of Brent crude oil declined 
sharply in May owing to the subdued global 
economic outlook and was down 8¼% on the 
average level of April in US dollar terms. As this 
report went to press, the price stood at just 
US$97. Prices for future deliveries of crude oil 
six months ahead were almost equally as high 
and 12-month deliveries were being traded 
with only a slight discount of just over US$½.
Energy import prices fell sharply in April by a 
seasonally adjusted 4.4% on the month. Prices 
for other goods fell by 0.2%. Domestic sales 
prices remained broadly unchanged. The year-
on-year rate of increase in import prices slowed 
to 2.3% and producer prices went down 
to 2.4%.
Consumer prices fell by a seasonally adjusted 
0.1% in May compared with April. Fuel prices 
decreased considerably owing to the decline in 
crude oil prices. There was a rise in the price of 
food, except in the case of dairy products. In -
dustrial goods (excluding energy) also became 
more expensive. The prices of services re -
mained unchanged on average. Annual infla -
tion declined from 2.1% to 1.9% as measured 
by the national CPI and held steady at 2.2% 
according to the HICP .
Public finances1
Public long-term care 
 insurance scheme
The public long-term care insurance scheme re -
corded a deficit of €¼ billion in the first quarter 
of 2012, which was somewhat higher than the 
figure posted one year previously. Revenue 
grew rather sharply, by 3½%. This was chiefly 
due to a 4½% increase in employee contribu -
tions. By contrast, contributions for recipients 
of unemployment benefits fell again (-6%) and 
pensioner contributions rose at only a below-
average  rate (just under 1%). However, expend -iture recorded even stronger growth (4½%), 
which was due, in particular, to the scheduled 
rise in benefit rates (by just under 2% on aver -
age) on 1 January 2012. Liquid reserves fell to 
€5¼ billion but were still far above the statu -
tory minimum requirement (currently just under 
€1 billion).
During the remainder of 2012, the slight finan -
cial deterioration in year-on-year terms is ex -
pected to continue. This is because, despite the 
favourable pay and employment trends, ex -
penditure is likely to increase at a faster pace 
than revenue in the following quarters, too. In 
the long term, if the contribution rate were to 
remain unchanged, a structural deficit would 
be likely given the indexation of benefit rates 
and the ageing population. Although the 
 expansion of benefits (particularly for persons 
suffering from dementia) envisaged in the 
draft  of the “Act on Realigning Long-Term 
Care” ( Pflege-Neuausrichtungsgesetz ) can be 
financed in the short term, it will only add to 
the existing financial pressure on the public 
long-term care insurance scheme in the 
 medium and long term. Additional revenue of 
just over €1 billion as a result of a one-off in -
crease in the contribution rate from 1.95% 
to 2.05% (or 2.3% for the childless) on 1 Janu -
ary 2013 will not be enough to cover the add -
itional expenditure on a long-term basis. Fur -
thermore, the planned subsidising of private 
long-term care provision using central govern -
ment funds entails additional fiscal costs which 
will only be offset by lower government ex -
penditure in the future insofar as the resulting 
payouts reduce the need for means-tested 
benefits, such as social assistance. Yet it is pre -
cisely the possibility of including this in the cal -
culation of benefits that makes this arrange -
ment less attractive – in spite of government 
subsidies  – for those persons potentially af -Sharp decline

Joint liability for sovereign debt and the proposed debt 
 redemption fund
The sovereign debt crisis has, at times, sent 
the cost of capital market funding soaring 
for some euro-area member states. As a 
 result, Greece, Ireland and Portugal have 
 already received assistance loans from the 
other euro-area countries, the IMF or via 
the new rescue packages, and Spain has 
announced its intention to request special-
purpose assistance loans for its banks. As 
the fi  nancial stability of the euro area as a 
whole appeared to be at risk, the three pro-
gramme countries were granted aid follow-
ing the conclusion of detailed reform and 
consolidation agreements; concrete agree-
ments are not yet in place for Spain.
All in all, the basic principle enshrined in the 
treaties establishing monetary union that 
no euro-area country can assume liability for another’s debts has already been 
stretched a very long way. In addition, the 
interest rate payable on assistance loans 
has since been cut to almost the same level as the funding costs of the rescue packages and is thus much lower than for a number of those countries providing the assistance. 
More or less abolishing interest rate pre-
miums has clearly reduced the incentives to 
independently maintain or achieve sound 
public fi  nances. However, national fi  scal re-
sponsibility is still one of the fundamental 
components of European monetary union. 
As long as the euro-area member states are not also prepared – in the interests of safe-
guarding a union committed to stability – to hand over fi  scal policy decision-making powers and thus transfer national sover-eignty to a supranational body, at least 
when budgetary rules have been violated, a 
communitisation of sovereign debt cannot 
be justifi  ed. Removing the link between 
 liability and control would eliminate import-ant incentives for sound fi  scal policy in the monetary union, harming monetary stabil-
ity.
Nevertheless, there have been repeated 
calls from various quarters for an extensive 
communitisation of liability for sovereign 
debt in order to ease the fi  nancial pressure on individual states caused by higher inter-est rates on new bond issues. For the most 
part, these proposals include elements to 
limit  liability risk or ideas on how to agree 
the conditions to impose on participating 
countries, for instance with regard to future 
budgetary policy. For example, a broad 
spectrum of proposals can be found in the 
green paper published by the European Commission in November 2011.
1 These 
range from joint and several liability for all 
euro-area states’ debt obligations to a par-
tial substitution of national issuance and limited liability (on a pro-rata basis) for all 
euro-area states. The Commission believes 
that the more extensively sovereign debt is 
to be communitised, the further the euro 
area needs to move towards a common fi  s-cal policy.
The “debt redemption pact for Europe” put 
forward by the German Council of Eco-
nomic Experts has recently found increasing 
resonance in the political debate, both in 
Germany and abroad.2 Under this proposal, 
the portion of the euro-area member states’ 
sovereign debt that exceeds 60% of gross 
domestic product (GDP) would be gradually 
transferred to a “debt redemption fund”.

New bond issues by individual states would 
be jointly guaranteed until the amount of 
the respective state’s debt exceeding 60% 
of GDP (in the starting year) has been trans-
ferred to a joint redemption fund. The 
higher the debt ratio at the start (the greater 
the amount by which it exceeds 60%), the larger the country’s share of jointly guaran-
teed debt. As a rule, this debt would have 
to be served by the issuing state and repaid in full over a period of 20 to 25 years. Dur-ing this time, the euro-area member states 
as a whole would be jointly and severally 
liable for the debt in the redemption fund.
At the same time, all participating countries 
would enter into a pact committing to the 
application of a national debt brake to keep 
the liabilities remaining in their individual 
portfolio below 60% of GDP under normal 
circumstances. Furthermore, the proposal 
contains additional elements designed to 
partially safeguard joint liability and to en-
sure repayment of the debt in the redemp-
tion fund. These include introducing a medium-term consolidation and growth 
strategy, the options of halting communiti-
sation should commitments not be met or 
imposing a premium on a national tax and using that revenue for direct debt redemp-
tion as well as pledging national gold and 
foreign currency reserves in return for the 
assumption of liability.
In contrast to the versions presented by the 
European Commission, the debt redemp-
tion pact proposed by the German Council 
of Economic Experts is intended, in prin-
ciple, to be temporary and does not cover 
all debt. However, at the end of 2011, the 
share of the euro-area countries’ debt that 
exceeded 60% of their national GDP (ex-
cluding Greece, Ireland and Portugal, for which assistance programmes had already been adopted and temporary joint liability 
(albeit in a different form) had already been 
agreed for new issues) still amounted to just over €2.3 trillion, or 90% of German GDP (although just under one-quarter of 
this was attributable to Germany itself). The 
debt redemption pact would thus entail a very extensive implementation of joint li-ability on top of those assistance pro-
grammes already in place.
For the debt redemption pact to be imple-
mented successfully, each country would have to resolutely adhere to both the re-demption plan drawn up for it and to the 
rule stipulating that the debt under national responsibility must not exceed 60% of GDP – irrespective of the governing majorities in 
that country over a period of 20 to 25 
years. It would also be necessary to ensure, 
among other factors, that any periods of weakness initially classed as cyclically in-
duced which are later discovered to be the result of structural growth problems are not used to justify higher debts and allowed to 
push up the debt ratio on a lasting basis. Measures would also have to be put in 
place to rule out the possibility of ultimately 
extending the redemption plan or waiving 
redemption entirely so that joint liability is not just temporary. However, given how 
countries have dealt with European budget-ary rules in the past, it is doubtful whether a tight structure and stringent implementa-tion can be assured over time. Furthermore, 
for those countries that currently have to pay above-average interest rates on their government bonds, the assumption of li-ability by partner countries would initially 
remove the pressure coming from the cap-
ital markets and thus the key incentive to 
pursue a sound fi  scal policy.
As with all forms of joint liability, the debt 
redemption fund would involve a substan-
tial redistribution from countries with a high credit rating to those with a low one. Coun-
tries (such as Germany) that can currently obtain capital market funding at below-average cost would have to pay higher 
rates of interest not only on jointly guaran-
teed loans above the 60% threshold but Deutsche Bundesbank

also on the rest of their own liabilities. The 
current credit rating, in particular, would 
probably be called into question if a consid-
erable risk from assuming liability were fac-tored into the assessment. This effect could be countered by the market for jointly guar-anteed government bonds becoming more liquid as a whole. However, given the asso-
ciated risks, one should not overestimate 
the quantitative effect of the more advanta-
geous liquidity premium. Furthermore, the planned redemption of the jointly guaran-teed euro bonds would cause liquidity to 
dry up again over time.
This extensive joint liability would throw 
 liability and control considerably out of bal-
ance. The impact of the debt redemption fund on the euro area’s fundamental eco-nomic policy framework envisaging na-tional responsibility for fi  scal policy would 
be negligible because the proposal would, 
on the whole, be implemented within the 
framework of the existing constitutions and 
treaties. Even if the rules were broken, no rights of sovereignty would be transferred to European level under the proposal; in 
other words, there would be no powers to intervene in national budgets. There would 
be barely any more actual possibilities for intervention than there are now and the 
suggested amount of collateral appears to 
be far from suffi   cient.
All in all, the debt redemption pact does not require a fundamentally more ambi-tious fi  scal policy stance than the agree-
ments to date and the name “redemption 
pact”, which appears to suggest a particu-
larly determined stance or even surpluses, is therefore misleading. At the current end, a 
number of countries still have a consider-able need for consolidation amid diffi   cult 
macroeconomic conditions. The main prob-lem here is not so much the starting level of 
the debt ratio as the rise it is expected to 
experience in the short term. The lower the 
debt ratio in the starting year, the smaller the share of liabilities to be communitised. 
Initially, the conditions put forward in the 
debt redemption pact proposal could actu-
ally be weaker than the current require-ments for a close-to-balance budget, and 
the reduction of the debt ratio would prob-
ably even be postponed signifi  cantly in 
some cases.
In general, the proposed debt redemption pact envisages an extensive communitisa-
tion of debt over the next few years with-
out obliging member countries to relinquish enough of their national sovereign rights. It is very doubtful whether this can actually be 
implemented under the existing European 
treaties and the German constitution. Given 
the current regulatory framework, the as-
sistance mechanisms of the EFSF or ESM are 
therefore much more appropriate. The aid 
provided under these mechanisms, which is 
tied to strict conditions, is envisaged as a last resort and should entail interest rate 
premiums wherever possible. These mech-
anisms also limit the timeframe for assist-ance and joint liability, and stipulate a re-duction of joint debt. The safeguarding measures put forward in connection with the debt redemption pact could also be 
called for under the EFSF/ESM mechanisms, which likewise contain the option of halting 
assistance payments if conditions are not met. A future decline in the debt ratio is 
also an integral part of the existing frame-
work, which, in principle, requires that 
member states achieve a balanced budget. 
More comprehensive joint liability like that 
envisioned in the debt redemption pact 
could only be justifi  ed if there were an ex-
tensive reform of the euro-area regulatory 
framework in the direction of a fi  scal union 
– and this would need to happen before 
debt is communitised.Deutsche Bundesbank

fected (ie usually those with below-average in -
comes). If the supplementary insurance is not 
made compulsory, government subsidies are 
predominantly likely to protect private wealth 
that would otherwise have been used primarily 
as funding for long-term care costs over and 
above what is covered by the benefits of the 
public long-term care insurance scheme.
Securities markets
Bond market
With gross sales of €103.0 billion in April 2012, 
issuance in the German bond market fell sig -
nificantly on the previous month (€123.5 bil -
lion). After deducting redemptions, which like -
wise declined (€108.2 billion), and taking ac -
count of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own bonds, domestic debt securities worth 
€1.1 billion were withdrawn from the market in 
net terms. The outstanding volume of foreign 
debt securities in Germany decreased by €2.9 
billion during the reporting month, with the re -
sult that the volume of debt instruments in cir -
culation in the German market as a whole was 
down €3.9 billion.
Domestic credit institutions reduced their cap -
ital market debt by €5.7 billion net in the month 
under review. Other bank debt securities in par -
ticular were redeemed for €5.6 billion net, as 
were, to a lesser extent, debt securities issued 
by specialised credit institutions, which include 
public promotional banks, for example, for

In April, the public sector issued debt securities 
worth €4.1 billion net, of which €2.7 billion 
was issued by central government. While the 
outstanding volume of two-year Federal Treas -
ury notes (Schätze) and of ten and thirty-year 
Federal bonds (Bunds) rose by €4.3 billion, €8.2 
billion and €3.9 billion respectively, there were net redemptions in particular of five-year Fed -
eral notes (Bobls) in the amount of €12.9 bil -

the capital market for €1.4 billion.
Domestic enterprises issued €0.5 billion worth 
of corporate bonds in net terms in the report -

billion the previous month. On balance, these 
were all paper with a maturity of less than one

while non-bank financial enterprises redeemed 
bonds and notes in net terms.
Domestic non-banks were the sole buyers of 
bonds in April (€8.6 billion net). By contrast, 
domestic credit institutions in particular sold

Equity market
During the month under review, at €0.1 billion, 
domestic enterprises issued hardly any new 
shares on the German equity market. In the 
same period, the volume of foreign equities in 
the German market dropped by €1.2 billion. 
Only domestic investors purchased equities in 
April. Domestic credit institutions in particular 
added €10.6 billion worth of equities to their 
portfolios, all of which were German shares on 
balance. Non-banks acquired stocks worth 
€0.5 billion net. However, non-resident invest -
ors sold domestic shares worth €12.2 billion 
net – as they had previously done ahead of 
dividend payment dates.
Mutual funds
In April, domestic mutual funds recorded mod -
est net inflows of €0.3 billion. Only specialised funds reserved for institutional investors bene -
fited from this on balance (€3.6 billion). Among 
mutual funds open to the general public, shares 
totalling €4.2 billion were redeemed almost ex -
clusively by equity funds. By contrast, mixed 
funds and open-end real estate funds placed 
new share units on the market (€0.6 billion and 
€0.1 billion respectively). The outstanding vol -
ume of foreign funds traded in Germany de -
creased by €1.7 billion in the reporting month. 
In April, mutual fund shares were purchased 
mainly by resident credit institutions (€3.7 bil -
lion) but also by domestic non-banks (€1.7 bil -
lion). Both groups solely bought domestic cer -
tificates on balance. By contrast, foreign invest -
ors sold German mutual fund shares in the 
amount of €6.8 billion net.
Balance of payments
The German current account posted a surplus 
– in unadjusted terms – of €11.2 billion in April 
2012. The result was thus €8.7 billion lower 
than in the previous month. This was attribut -
able to a narrower trade surplus and to the fact 
that invisible current transactions, which com -
prise services, income and current transfers, re -
verted to a deficit.
According to provisional calculations by the 
Federal Statistical Office, in April the foreign 
trade surplus was down by €3.0 billion on the 
month to €14.4 billion. However, after adjust -
ment for seasonal and calendar variations, it 
rose by €2.2 billion to €16.1 billion. At -4.8%, 
the value of imports fell by a much larger mar -
gin than the value of exports (-1.7%). Com -
pared with the average of the first quarter of 
2012, nominal imports decreased by 3.3% after 
seasonal adjustment. This decline was only to a 
small extent attributable to a drop in import 
prices. Price effects did not play any role in the 
0.7% fall in exports.
Invisible current transactions posted a deficit of 
€1.3 billion in April, compared with a surplus of 
€3.7 billion in March. This was chiefly attibuta -Virtually no

ble to the reduced surplus in cross-border in -
come, which was down on the month from 
€5.9 billion to €0.9 billion. As in previous years, 
the fall was due to the high dividend payments 
that are made to non-residents at this time of 
the year. Moreover, the services account sur -
plus contracted from €1.4 billion to €0.7 bil -
lion. By contrast, the deficit in current transfers 
decreased by €0.7 billion to a total of €2.8 bil -
lion.
Cross-border portfolio investment again re -
sulted in net capital exports (€13.7 billion) in 
the month of April. These were mainly gener -
ated by sales of German shares on the part of 
non-residents (€12.2 billion), which typically 
occur prior to the dividend season; in addition, 
these investors disposed of domestic mutual 
fund shares (€6.8 billion) and German debt se -
curities (€1.2 billion). All in all, foreign portfolio 
investors withdrew funds from Germany in the 
amount of €20.2 billion during April. By con -
trast, transactions by German investors resulted 
in inflows of funds (€6.5 billion). They were 
likewise strongly inclined to sell, parting with 
foreign debt securities (€2.9 billion), shares 
(€2.0 billion) and mutual fund shares (€1.7 bil -
lion).
Direct investment also resulted in net capital 
outflows in April (€7.4 billion). German firms 
supplied their foreign subsidiaries with funds 
amounting to €7.3 billion, primarily via intra-
group loan transactions. The level of direct in -
vestment in Germany by foreign proprietors 
remained virtually unchanged.
Other statistically recorded investment com -
prising financial and trade credits (where these

largely generated by transactions of enterprises 
and households (€18.2 billion). By contrast, the

Following a temporary weak phase, economic activity has picked up again in Germany. Although 
the adjustment recession in some euro-area countries and the loss of confidence caused by the 
sovereign debt crisis have left their mark, the good structural position of the German economy 
and robust global economic developments have kept the upper hand. A high employment rate 
and strong wage increases combined with the essentially sound outlook for the future are not 
only supporting domestic economic activity; they are also making Germany more attractive to 
immigrants. Unusually favourable financing conditions, reflecting both the Eurosystem’s expan -
sionary monetary policy stance and safe haven effects, are boosting the driving forces of growth. 
While the importance of euro-area countries as importers of German products is continuing to 
wane and that of non-euro-area countries to rise, imports from within the euro area are likely to 
increase more rapidly. This is due not only to direct supply and demand effects but also, in part, 
to shifts in relative prices.
This year, growth in gross domestic product (GDP), at 1.0% (or 1.2% after calendar adjustment), 
will probably almost match the estimated potential rate of 1¼%. Provided that the world econ -
omy continues to recover and the financial and sovereign debt crisis does not escalate, real 
growth could increase to 1.6% (1.7% after calendar adjustment) in 2013. Assuming that crude oil 
prices decline moderately, consumer prices look likely to ease. The overall cost of living will prob -
ably increase by 2.1% this year and by 1.6% in 2013; excluding energy, it appears likely to rise 
from 1.6% to 1.8%.
The risks to this scenario are mostly external. If the weaker activity in the euro area – which is 
already included in the estimate – were to be compounded by a perceptible dampening of eco -
nomic activity in non-euro-area countries, this would have a severe impact on the German econ -
omy because it is so open. In view of the political situation in Greece and the problems in the 
Spanish banking sector, further developments in the euro-area sovereign debt crisis are another 
source of uncertainty. Should the resulting renewed tensions in the financial markets prove not to 
be temporary and economic activity in the hardest hit euro-area countries turn out to be weaker 
than already assumed in the baseline scenario, this would place a noticeable strain on Germany. 
However, domestic growth could prove to be even stronger given the exceptionally favourable 
financing conditions.
All in all, this projection is therefore subject to exceptionally high uncertainty and risk.Outlook for the German economy –

and 2013Deutsche Bundesbank

Current situation
At present, there are three main factors influen -
cing the German economy. Demand for Ger -
man products from within the euro area has 
fallen discernibly as a result of the adjustment 
recession in some euro-area countries. By con -
trast, the world economy has regained its foot -
ing after tensions eased in the second half of 
2011. This has led to a corresponding increase 
in demand from non-euro-area countries. Fi -
nally, the positive labour market situation and 
very favourable financing conditions are gener -
ating important stimuli for domestic demand. 
Whereas downward influences predominated 
in the final quarter of 2011, expansionary forces 
regained the upper hand in early 2012 – sooner 
than many expected. All in all, developments in 
the German economy were somewhat better 
in the 2011-12 winter half-year than anticipated 
in the December projection, with a slight de -
cline of 0.2% in real GDP in the fourth quarter 
of 2011 and a clear increase of 0.5% in the first 
quarter of 2012 (after seasonal and calendar 
adjustment in both cases).1 At the same time, 
the heightened uncertainty has left its mark. 
While residential investment increased substan -
tially, investment in machinery and equipment 
fell below the level recorded in summer 2011. 
Despite the favourable underlying conditions, 
private consumption saw only very tentative 
growth, partly because of energy price rises, 
which undermined purchasing power.
One reason why the German economy has not 
so far been hit harder by the crisis in some of 
the euro-area countries is that it has diversified 
sales markets. Twenty years ago, more than 
half of Germany’s goods exports went to 
today’s euro-area countries, compared with 
just under two-fifths in 2011.2 Notably, the 
countries most affected by the crisis (Greece, 
Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy) receive only 
11% of Germany’s exports (compared with 
16% in 1991). Another reason is that the Ger -
man economy is benefiting from the Eurosys -
tem’s very expansionary monetary policy. In 
addition, Germany is experiencing pronounced short-term safe haven effects, which are add -
itionally driving down interest rates for the 
public and private sectors alike. Above all, con -
fidence in the German economy’s adaptability 
and resilience to crises remains high; the way in 
which it overcame the severe economic slump 
in 2008-09 has also left a lasting impression on 
sentiment in this regard.
Employment growth in the final quarter of 
2011 and the first quarter of 2012, at a season -
ally adjusted 318,000 (or 0.8% on the third 
quarter of 2011), not only far outdid expect -
ations – it was also much stronger than the de -
cline in registered unemployment, which came 
to a mere 80,000. The fall in unemployment 
appears to have largely ground to a halt, par -
ticularly within the insurance system, which in -
cludes most of the more short-term un -
employed. Although the long-term unemployed 
are now benefiting more from the improved la -
bour market situation, mobilising this potential 
is apparently still proving a difficult task. In -
stead, those who were not previously regis -
tered as job seekers are now taking up new job 
opportunities. In addition, more labour force 
members are coming to Germany from abroad. 
For 2011 as a whole, net migration rose to 
around 280,000 persons because of increased 
immigration, mainly from other EU countries. 
Most of the additional jobs are subject to social 
security contributions. In line with the German 
economy’s growing domestic focus, employ -
ment increased mainly in the services sectors, 
which tend to be dominated by the private sec -
tor.
In view of enterprises’ outstanding profitability 
and the low rate of unemployment, trade un -
ions have been making higher wage demands.

met given the adequate, albeit far from spec -
tacular, business outlook. This is particularly 
true of the metalworking industry, where basic 
rates of pay will be raised by 4.3% for a period 
of 13 months, but also of Deutsche Telekom, 
which will increase them by a cumulated 6.6% 
over 24 months. The public sector (with a cu -
mulated rise of 6.4% over two years for central 
and local government) and hotels and catering 
(with a cumulated increase of 6.4% over two 
years in North Rhine-Westphalia) have likewise 
been affected by this development. Collective 
wage agreements have generally been much 
higher than in recent years. The resulting in -
crease in wage costs will probably generate ad -
ditional price rises in certain areas, though 
without jeopardising the objective of price sta -
bility overall.
At 2.5%, annual HICP inflation in the fourth 
quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012 
matched the level expected in the December 
projection. While the rate increased somewhat 
for food and other goods, energy price infla -
tion fell only slightly from its previous high 
level. The rate of inflation for services was 
somewhat lower because of special factors 
(notably in financial services).
Major assumptions
This projection is based on assumptions made 
by the Eurosystem’s experts concerning global 
trade, exchange rates, commodity prices and 
interest rates. The assumptions are based on 
information available up to 16 May 2012. Re -
cent developments such as the continued de -
preciation of the euro and the further decline in 
yields on German government bonds were not 
therefore included in the projection. The as -
sumptions regarding sales markets in the euro 
area are derived from projections for the other 
euro-area countries.
Following the strong economic recovery in 
2010, growth in the world economy slowed 
perceptibly in 2011. This should be regarded, in part, as a return to normal following a catch-up 
period, although one-off effects from the 
earthquake in Japan and flood damage in Thai -
land also played a role. The sharp rise in com -
modity prices and growing uncertainty in the 
financial markets likewise had a dampening ef -
fect, however. The rebound in global economic 
activity in the first quarter of 2012 was mainly 
driven by the emerging economies and, to a 
lesser extent, the industrial countries. The 
emerging economies were influenced not only 
by an easing of the aforementioned one-off ef -
fects but also, among other factors, by looser 
monetary policy; several emerging economies 
had previously tightened their monetary policy 
stance to combat overheating. Economic 
growth in the industrial countries is likely to in -
crease again gradually but remain subdued 
overall. The impact of expansionary monetary 
policy will contrast with opposite effects arising 
from indispensable fiscal consolidation, corpo -
rate restructuring and a retrenchment of pri -
vate debt in a number of countries. Overall glo -Inflation strong

bal growth, at just over 3% in 2012 and just 
under 4% in 2013, should therefore be much 
weaker than in 2010 or in the period immedi -
ately preceding the global financial and eco -
nomic crisis.
Despite euro-area countries accounting for 
lower shares in Germany’s exports in recent 
years, developments in their economies remain 
particularly important for Germany. The need 
for adjustment in the countries most affected 
by the sovereign debt crisis has proved to be 
greater than initially expected and is com -
pounded by difficult conditions in some of 
these countries’ banking sectors. However, in 
the course of 2012 – or in 2013 at the latest – 
economic activity should at least stabilise pro -
vided that these countries succeed in imple -
menting a credible fiscal consolidation strategy 
and, where necessary, in restructuring and re -
capitalising their banking sectors in order to 
build confidence.
In line with the expected global economic de -
velopments, world trade should regain mo -
mentum in the course of 2012, although the 
expansion expected for this year (4½%) and 
the next (6½%) is likely to be smaller than be -
fore the financial and economic crisis. The ra -
ther weak economic activity in the euro area 
will probably affect the entire forecast horizon. This will be partly offset by the fact that import 
demand from outside the euro area is likely to 
be rather brisk. The Asian emerging economies 
in particular are increasingly bolstering growth 
in sales markets, which could be confined 
to 2% in 2012, not least because of the weak 
start to the year, but may reach 5% in 2013. 
Even so, this is much lower than assumed in 
the December projection.
Compared with last autumn’s projection, the 
euro depreciated a further 4½% against the US 
dollar up to the closing date for this projec -
tion’s assumptions. It was trading at US$1.30 
in the relevant period for deriving the exchange 
rate assumption. The euro’s effective exchange 
rate, which is relevant to foreign trade, also 
saw a considerable decline. The euro has since 
continued to weaken substantially.
Up to the beginning of 2012, crude oil prices 
were below the assumptions in the December 
projection (derived from forward prices ob -
served in the first two weeks of November), 
whereas they significantly exceeded these as -
sumptions in the first quarter of 2012 because 
of temporary supply disruptions and the escal -
ating conflict in the Persian Gulf. However, for -
ward prices pointed noticeably downwards 
across the whole maturity spectrum. This pro -
jection predicts a price per barrel of Brent crude 
oil of US$114½ for 2012 and US$108 for 
2013 – nearly 5% and just over 3½% higher, 
respectively, than in the December projection. 
The crude oil price has since fallen to less than 
US$100. At the same time, the forward price 
curve has flattened out. Developments in other 
commodity prices in the fourth quarter of 2011 
and the first quarter of 2012 largely met the 
expectations in the last projection. Even so, the 
rise in prices for agricultural commodities was 
somewhat sharper than anticipated in Decem -
ber. In line with the rather weak global growth, 
other commodity prices could experience a 
year-on-year decline of 8% in 2012. A rise of 
just over 1½% is expected for 2013.Adjustment

In the second half of 2011, euro-area activity 
cooled off noticeably and the sovereign debt 
crisis intensified, which led the Eurosystem to 
cut its key lending rates in mid-December to an 
all-time low and to conduct very long-term re -
financing operations in order to ensure that the 
banking system was supplied with adequate li -
quidity. These measures, along with renewed 
tension in the financial markets, considerably 
lowered expectations regarding short-term 
 interest rates. Using market data, the projec -
tion derives a three-month rate for unsecured 
interbank lending of 0.8% for 2012 (40 basis 
points below the December projection) and 
0.7% for 2013 (-70 basis points).
Yields on German government bonds are being 
pushed down by the strong demand for safe, 
liquid instruments. Up to April, the yield on 
bonds with a residual maturity of nine to ten 
years fell to a mere 1.6%, well below the as -
sumptions in the December projection. Al -
though it will rebound according to the tech -
nical assumptions, it will average 1.8% for 2012 
as a whole and 2.1% in 2013, 60 basis points 
below the assumption in the December projec -
tion for each of those years. The yield has since 
gone down to 1.1%, however.
In the first quarter of 2012, German banks’ 
lending rates, too, dropped below their already-
low level of the second half of 2011. Although 
banks tightened their credit standards for loans 
to enterprises in the first quarter, according to 
survey results an easing is already likely for the 
second quarter. The ifo Credit Constraint Indi -
cator accordingly hit a new all-time low in 
April. Financing conditions are expected to re -
main very favourable throughout the forecast 
horizon.
For public finances, the projections incorporate 
all measures which have  either been approved 
by parliament or have already been defined in 
detail and are likely to pass the legislative proc -
ess.3 The included measures will initially reduce 
the fiscal deficit slightly in 2012 before then im -
posing a somewhat heavier burden on govern -ment budgets in 2013. With regard to social 
security contributions, rule-based reductions in 
the contribution rate to the statutory pension 
insurance scheme in 2012 and 2013 will cause 
shortfalls, whereas the financial effects of vari -
ous tax-related measures (particularly surpluses 
caused by the expiry of depreciation allow -
ances and shortfalls caused by the income tax 
cuts planned for 2013) will nearly cancel each 
other out. The expenditure side, by contrast, is 
dominated by the relief created, in particular, 
by the expiry of the homebuyers grant and the 
investment programmes to cushion the impact 
of the 2008-09 crisis. Various government 
projects will also lead to increased expenditure, 
however. For instance, the “energy U-turn” en -
visages increased spending on measures, in 
particular, to reduce energy consumption and 
to expand the use of renewables via the new 
“Energy and Climate Fund”. The Federal Gov -
ernment’s budget plans also include, not least, 
increased spending on education and research 
(notably the “education package”) and higher 
investment in infrastructure.
Cyclical outlook4
Since the adjustment crises in the euro area will 
probably persist for the time being, economic 
growth in Germany is likely to initially be 
muted, despite accelerated global economic 
growth and robust domestic activity. The GDP 
figures for the first quarter of 2012 should 
therefore not be regarded in isolation as an in -
dicator of the current cyclical trend, but rather 
seen in connection with the slight GDP decline 
in the final quarter of 2011. If both quarters are Further decline

new measures (especially the childcare supplement and an

the social security funds) which had not yet been suffi -

ready included, by contrast, is the reduction in income tax 
rates, which was adopted by the Bundestag but initially 
rejected by the Bundesrat and then sent to the mediation 
committee; this will result in a shortfall in tax receipts of 
around €2 billion in 2013.

taken together, this produces the picture of a 
perceptible slowdown in economic growth 
compared with the previous quarters. This is 
also shown by the forward-looking indicators 
in the ifo Business Survey. Although enterprises’ 
expectations have rebounded from their tem -
porary low in autumn of last year, they have 
not yet returned to their highs prior to the in -
tensification of the sovereign debt crisis; more -
over, they sagged again perceptibly in May. In -
dustrial new orders, which lead industrial out -
put by about one quarter, fell once again 
slightly on the heels of an already weak fourth 
quarter of 2011. However, growing demand for 
intermediate goods suggests that the down -
turn in the manufacturing industry will not per -
sist. In addition, there is an underlying trend 
towards strong growth in demand for con -
struction. In the short term, the construction 
industry could benefit from catch-up effects, as 
the weather-related reductions in construction 
output in February were not completely offset 
in March. Germany’s economic output could 
therefore grow over the course of 2012 at a 
rate of 1.5%, as against 2.0% over the course 
of 2011.5 This would result in annual average 
growth of 1.0% and, after adjustment for 
working-day variations, 1.2%, as against 0.6% 
and 0.8%, respectively, in the December pro -
jection. This upward revision is largely due to 
economic developments surpassing expect -ations in the first quarter of 2012, mostly be -
cause of strong demand from outside the euro 
area.
How quickly the German economy will be able 
to break with the subdued underlying cyclical 
trend will also depend on how quickly the situ -
ation in the crisis countries stabilises and ex -
pansionary forces in the euro area regain the 
upper hand. Eurosystem experts project that 
this could be the case in 2013. Consequently, 
along with a further strengthening of the 
global upswing and lively domestic activity, 
euro-area demand for imports could increase. 
Under those circumstances, the German econ -
omy, as already assumed in the December pro -
jection, could grow at a rate of 2.0% over the 
course of the year. The downward correction 
of the mean annual growth rate from 1.8% 
to 1.6% (or 1.9% to 1.7% after calendar adjust -
ment) is the outcome of a smaller statistical 
carry-over at the end of 2012, with the pattern 
over time largely unchanged.
Given the assumed cyclical pattern, overall cap -
acity utilisation is likely to be normal. Expected 
immigration and the accelerating formation of 
fixed capital over the forecast horizon are likely 
to ensure that potential output will grow at an 
annual rate of 1¼% to 1½%, leading to a slight 
overutilisation at the end of the projection pe -

The strong market share gains seen in 2011 
could continue initially but then weaken. Des -
pite the expected increase in the prices of do -
mestically produced goods and services, Ger -
man firms’ price competitiveness is likely to 
improve further in 2012, especially vis-à-vis 
non-euro-area countries, and to change little in 
2013. On the whole, exports could grow by 
3¼% this year and by 5½% in 2013 following a 
rise of 8¼% in 2011, a year which, however, 
was still characterised by catch-up effects.
Investment activity in machinery and equip -
ment lost steam in the fourth quarter of 2011 
and first quarter of 2012 despite exceedingly 
favourable financing conditions. Gloomier ex -
pectations are one likely factor. With sales pro -
spects limited, capacity extensions do not ap -
pear to be as urgent as before. In addition, 
enterprises were perceptibly nervous, which 
caused them to delay projects. Now that the 
global economy is beginning to gather mo -
mentum, the capacity extension motive could 
become more important again. Provided the 
euro-area sovereign debt crisis does not escal -
ate, the importance of the precautionary mo -
tive should diminish, and postponed projects 
should be launched. The baseline forecast 
therefore shows a pick-up in investment in 
 machinery and equipment from mid-2012 on -
wards, which means that, after stopping for a 
pause, the investment upswing is likely to con -
tinue, with the help of the very favourable 
 financing conditions.
Along with extremely favourable financing con -
ditions, the uncertainty that accompanied the 
intensification of the sovereign debt crisis is 
likely to have been one of the drivers of the 
surging demand for residential real estate. In 
the September 2011 to March 2012 period, the 
number of dwellings covered by new construc -
tion permits and the estimated costs were up 
by just over 9% from the comparable period a 
year earlier. Dwellings for three families and 
more and owner-occupied housing in urban 
areas showed particularly strong growth. This is 
consistent with observed property prices. Apartments are particularly well suited as in -
vestment vehicles, whereas owner-occupiers 
tend to be more interested in single-family 
houses, for which demand is lower. These are 
signs that not only the desire for more living 
space but also investment considerations are 
playing a substantial role. It is assumed that this 
strong demand will gradually be translated into 
construction output; significant bottlenecks are 
unlikely given unused capacity in other euro-
area countries. The market for construction 
services is already highly international today, al -
though there is also a sizeable local component 
for smaller projects.Investment in

Household consumption, having broken away 
from the previous decade’s extremely sluggish 
underlying trend in 2011, could well continue 
to rise perceptibly during the forecast period. 
The groundwork for this was laid by the fa -
vourable employment and income outlook. In 
addition, social security contributions are to be 
eased; therefore, net wages and salaries can be 
expected to rise by 4% in both 2012 and 2013. 
Because of weaker growth in other incomes 
and social benefits – under prevailing law, pen -
sion increases will be muted – disposable in -
comes could rise by just under 3% this year and 
slightly more than that next year. With the 
household saving rate more or less unchanged at 11% and falling consumer price inflation, the 
result would be an increase in real household 
consumption spending of 1.3% this year and 
1.5% next year. This assessment is supported 
by consumer climate surveys, which have been 
pointing upwards for quite some time.
The rather strong export growth and expansion 
of domestic demand will also cause imports to 
pick up considerably. It may be assumed that 
the trend over the previous years of rising im -
port intensity will continue. This is partly a 
counterweight to growing export intensity and 
reflects the increasing internationalisation and 
specialisation of the German economy. Given 
an increase of nearly 2% in overall demand, im -
ports could rise by 4% in 2012 and, if demand 
grows by 3½%, by 7¼% in 2013. Whereas 
non-euro-area countries accounted for a dis -
proportionately large share of import growth in 
the past, in the coming years euro-area part -
ners are likely to derive greater benefit from im -
port growth. Not only pressure on enterprises 
in those countries to open up new sales mar -
kets but also price effects are likely to play a 
role. The price competitiveness of the other 
euro-area countries is likely to improve vis-à-vis 
both Germany and the rest of the world. The 
contribution to GDP growth of net exports in 
an accounting sense, unadjusted for any other 
factors, is likely to be in negative territory in the 
forecast period. However, this definitely does 
not imply that foreign trade will not give any 
impetus to cyclical developments. As was 
shown by the period spanning the fourth quar -
ter of 2011 and first quarter of 2012, Germany’s 
economy remains highly dependent on the 
global economy. Germany’s current account 
surplus could fall from 5¾% in 2011 to 5¼% in 
2012 and then to 5% in 2013.

to grow, albeit at a considerably slower pace. 
Not only is the cyclical momentum weaker, but 
easily mobilised domestic labour reserves are 
probably now largely exhausted. However, the 
over-60 age cohort, in particular, holds consid -
erable potential. Given the large gap between 
labour market situations in the euro area, more 
workers are likely to make use of their freedom 
of movement than previously. Following net 
immigration of around 280,000 people in 2011 
(due also to the complete opening of labour 
markets to all central and eastern European 
 accession countries apart from Bulgaria and 
Romania), a largely job-market- oriented net in -
flux of 220,000 is projected for this year and 
180,000 for next year. Increased immigration 
and rising participation in the labour force 
should make it possible to increase employ -
ment in those years by 490,000 (1.2%) and 
270,000 (0.7%), respectively. The bulk of these 
new jobs will probably be additional positions 
subject to social security contributions. The im -
portance of temporary work, low-paid part-
time employment and employment opportun -
ities (“one-euro jobs”) is likely to diminish fur -
ther. Average hours worked could resume their 
falling longer-term trend, which is being driven 
in particular by a rising rate of part-time work. 
Hours worked would then increase by 1.2% 
this year and by 0.2% in 2013.
Given the low level already attained, the num -
ber of unemployed persons is now likely to de -
cline only slightly. The projections foresee a fall 
of 130,000 in 2012 (predominantly due to a 
statistical carry-over from 2011) and of 100,000 
in 2013. This decline will probably be focused 
on the second tier of unemployment benefits. 
A number of the long-term unemployed will 
find paid employment and others will retire. 
Furthermore, fewer short-term unemployed are 
expected to become long-term unemployed. 
The overall unemployment rate could fall from 
7.1% in 2011 to 6.7% in 2012 and 6.5% in 
2013. This would mean a reduction of 
5.2 percentage points since its last high in 
2005. The situation looks similar if the figures 
are calculated in line with the ILO’s standard -ised unemployment rates – namely a decline 
from 5.9% in 2011 to 5.4% in 2013.
Labour costs and prices
In the 2012 wage round, wage bargainers have 
so far agreed on sharp increases in rates of pay 
that, in many cases, extend into 2014. The vast 
majority agreed permanent percentage in -
creases. The one-off lump sum payments, 
which are often agreed in times of pronounced 
wage moderation, no longer featured on the 
agenda. On the basis of the agreements con -
cluded to date and the additional estimates for 
the sectors and districts where an agreement is 
still pending, negotiated pay rates are expected 
to increase by 2.6% in 2012, when wage agree -
ments from previous years are still having an 
impact. In 2013, when the full effect of the 
new agreements will be felt, the rates may in -Decline in

crease by 3.1%.7 As in 2011, high premium pay -
ments are also expected in a number of seg -
ments of the private sector in 2012, making it 
unlikely that the increase in actual earnings will 
lag behind negotiated wages. However, the 
rise in labour costs – measured in terms of 
compensation per employee – will be curbed 
by a rule-based reduction in contribution rates 
to the statutory pension insurance scheme. 
Given slower economic growth in productivity 
– employment is still expanding rapidly, whereas 
GDP growth is only moderate  – unit labour 
costs are expected to record a very clear rise 
(2.8%) in 2012. In 2013, assuming growth in 
productivity returns to normal, this increase is 
forecast to amount to 1.8%.
The particularly sharp increase in unit labour 
costs in 2012 is likely, to a considerable extent, 
to have a detrimental effect on margins. Never -
theless, this should not prevent the GDP defla -
tor from rising at a much stronger pace (1.4%) 
than in previous years. Profit margins are then expected to improve somewhat in 2013. The 
increase in the GDP deflator could then be 
even stronger (1.8%). Germany has not seen 
such a rise in the prices of domestically pro -
duced goods and services (more than 3% in 
two years) since the mid-1990s.
Consumer price inflation will ease initially, how -
ever. While energy prices are likely to persist at 
a rather high level, they will probably not rise 
any further. The technical assumptions for the 
energy component imply a rise of just over 5% 
on average in 2012; however, these calcula -
tions are based on developments in the final 
quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012. In 
2013, the rate could then fall below 1%. In 
contrast, the pace of growth for the other 
components of the consumer price index is ex -
pected to accelerate moderately from 1.6% in 
2012 to 1.8% in 2013. The effect of broad-
based wage growth, which is quite substantial 
compared with previous years, is likely to be 
felt predominantly in the price of services but 
also in the profit margins on food and other 
goods. In the case of housing rents, height -
ened demand fuelled by improved income is 
set against greater supply due, inter alia , to es -
pecially low interest rates. Rents are expected 
to rise at a faster pace – those for new lettings 
in a number of cities are already going up rap -
idly; however, the upward pressure is likely to 
remain within rather narrow bounds. By con -
trast, administrative and tax measures will 
probably play only a very minor role over the 
forecast horizon. While abolishing student tu -
ition fees in Baden-Württemberg and Hamburg 
will ease consumer price inflation somewhat, 
additional increases in tobacco tax will have 
the opposite effect. The energy U-turn is ex -
pected to place a considerable strain on the 
price situation. Overall, HICP inflation could fall 
from 2.5% in 2011 to 2.1% in 2012 and 1.6% in

Public finances
On the back of economic recovery and now 
only small strains from measures to support fi -
nancial institutions, the government deficit 
ratio in Germany declined clearly to 1% in 2011. 
Over the forecast horizon, too, conditions for 
consolidating public  finances are expected to 
be quite favourable in the baseline scenario. 
For instance, the macroeconomic aggregates 
which are of particular significance for revenue 
(gross wages and salaries as well as nominal 
private consumption) are set to expand at a 
relatively sharp pace, whereas the already ra -
ther low unemployment figures are forecast to 
decline a little further still. This situation will be 
additionally boosted by a lighter refinancing 
burden for government debt. However, the 
European sovereign debt crisis also continues 
to pose a significant threat to public finances – 
both directly (owing to new support measures) 
and indirectly (as a result of the economic out -
look).
The deficit ratio is likely to decline further in 
2012, albeit to a limited extent, and is forecast 
to fall to around ½%. The cyclical influence is 
expected to be more or less neutral.8 The rev -
enue ratio could rise again slightly. The ratio-
augmenting effect of the growth structure, 
which is favourable for government revenue, is 
greater than the strains, such as lowering the 
pension contribution rate (by 0.3 percentage 
point to 19.6%). A slight decline in the expend -
iture ratio is on the cards. This decline is due, in 
particular, to the limiting of the pension in -
crease stemming from previous reform meas -
ures, the fall in unemployment, interest cost 
savings as a result of the favourable refinancing 
conditions as well as to the complete phasing 
out of the investment programmes introduced 
during the 2008-09 crisis.The debt ratio, by contrast, could increase 
again, having fallen to 81.2% in 2011. The drop 
in the ratio due to the low deficit compared 
with nominal GDP growth and the redemp -
tions envisaged in principle in connection with 
the “bad banks” will be offset by additional 
debt for assistance provided to euro-area coun -
tries and the capital injection to the European 
Stability Mechanism (ESM). Furthermore, the 
government sector could assume further assets 
and liabilities in connection with financial mar -
ket support measures.9
As yet, there are no signs that the deficit reduc -
tion will continue in 2013. As is already the 
case this year, the cyclical influences could be 
very limited. With regard to social contribu -
tions, the further cut in the pension contribu -
tion rate to comply with the upper reserve limit 
is likely to be greater than in 2012. However, 
the resulting fall in the revenue ratio will prob -
ably be more or less offset on the expenditure 
side by a continuation of the factors that are 
reducing the ratio of social and interest ex -
penditure to GDP . Yet the debt ratio may drop 
perceptibly in 2013. In general, the situation of 
a relatively low deficit coupled with solid nom -
inal economic growth, and redemptions envis -
aged in connection with the “bad banks” is 
paving the way for a downward trend. How -
ever, this trend could be counteracted by addi -
tional debt-level-increasing measures, over and 
above those  already planned, in connection 
with the sovereign debt crisis (such as EFSF 
loans or capital injections to the ESM) or with 
additional support measures for German finan -
cial institutions.Favourable

the cyclical effect using the deviation from trend of those 
macroeconomic reference variables that are of relevance 
for public finances, and arrives at results that differ from 
those obtained under the approach applied by the German 
government when calculating the debt brake.

Risk assessment
The baseline scenario in this projection is based 
on the assumption that the adjustment reces -
sion in some euro-area countries will initially 
continue and uncertainty will persist but that 
the euro-area sovereign debt crisis will not es -
calate. Given their diversification of sales mar -
kets and favourable balance sheet structures, 
German enterprises appear to be in good shape 
on the whole. Nevertheless, if, in addition to the euro-area crises, the major non-euro-area 
countries were to suffer a more pronounced 
economic slowdown or the situation in the 
euro area were to take another substantial turn 
for the worse, this would place a considerable 
strain on German enterprises. In such an un -
favourable scenario, the expansion of Ger -
many’s domestic economy cannot simply be 
extrapolated; it is highly dependent on foreign 
trade – both directly (via income effects) and 
indirectly (via confidence effects).
Yet it is also possible that the external condi -
tions will prove to be more favourable and that 
the uncertainty stemming from the financial 
and debt crisis will ease sooner than expected. 
Given the very low interest rates and the ex -
tremely favourable financing conditions, the 
domestic economy could then also expand at a 
faster pace and build up greater intrinsic mo -
mentum. However, in some sub-sectors, this 
could also be associated with structural distor -
tions.
The inflation profile in this projection is mainly 
influenced by technical assumptions for crude 
oil prices and exchange rates. It is conceivable 
that the assumed rather sharp expansion of the 
global economy will be accompanied by higher 
crude oil prices in the medium term. If the euro 
depreciates further, this could aggravate the 
price climate, at least temporarily. With regard 
to domestically generated inflation, the wage 
agreements from the first half of 2012 seem to 
suggest a moderate rise, which could entail up -
side risks given the very low interest rates.Risks to eco-

The price of crude oil and its impact on 
 economic activity in the industrial countries
It is often pointed out that, both in historical terms and in comparison with the emerging market 
countries, the recovery in the advanced economies in recent years has been rather restrained. This 
is generally attributed to the efforts, first, of households and enterprises, and then of the public 
sector, to consolidate their finances. By contrast, the ongoing public debate about a double dip 
in the industrial countries has so far not really been seen in relation to the double peak in the 
price of crude oil. The peak level reached in summer 2008 was followed by a short but pro -
nounced recession-induced easing, but oil was back to almost the same level again in April 2011. 
This price rebound was largely driven by the steep upturn in aggregate economic activity in the 
emerging market economies. Since the turn of 2010-11, supply-side factors have also been play -
ing a major role, however.
The crises of the 1970s highlighted the economic disruptions that can stem from a cut in the oil 
supply as a result of events such as war, revolution or an embargo. Less obvious, however, are 
the dampening effects exerted by a demand-driven increase in the oil price. At the global level, 
the causal increase in economic activity outweighs possible retarding effects. At a national level, 
however, the potentially observable balance of positive and negative effects may differ consider -
ably. This is likely to depend not least on how much an economy benefits from the relative shift 
in prices through its own oil production, is directly involved in the underlying increase in eco -
nomic activity or participates in this indirectly through extensive external trade links. But irrespect -
ive of these particular constellations, a rising oil price per se – through various channels – may be 
expected to impair aggregate output in oil-importing countries.
Against this backdrop, there is much to suggest that the oil price hikes of the past years have 
perceptibly held back economic growth in the industrial countries on the whole, albeit with the 
retarding effects differing from country to country. The German economy, in particular, has prob -
ably suffered comparatively little harm owing to its relatively low consumption intensity, its exten -
sive trade links with oil-exporting countries as well as its generally stronger adaptability and 
resilience. By contrast, simulations – leaving aside the specific cause of the oil price increase – 
suggest considerable losses of output in the case of the United States, which possibly help to 
explain weak US growth, especially in the first half of 2011. Yet the recent robust recovery of the 
US economy also demonstrates the complexity of economic interlinkages and shows that a sharp 
oil price hike does not necessarily lead to a recession.Deutsche Bundesbank

Ever since the severe crises of the 1970s and 
early 1980s, if not earlier, the price of crude oil 
has been regarded as one of the key determin -
ants of fluctuations in the level of economic ac -
tivity. Since the end of World War II, almost all 
the recessions in the United States have been 
preceded by an oil price hike.1 Furthermore, 
the evidence is by no means confined to the 
United States. Apart from the Asian crisis at the 
end of 1990s, the slumps in global economic 
growth in the past decades all coincided with 
sharp increases in the price of crude oil. Admit -
tedly, the fact that the timing coincided does 
not necessarily imply causality. It is worth not -
ing in this connection that the recent oil price surge, although it was definitely on a historical 
scale, was not followed by a renewed down -
turn in the US economy. This article investigates 
the impact of crude oil prices on international 
economic activity over the past few years. It 
first describes historical price developments in 
the context of the changing interplay of forces 
in the oil market. The academic literature and 
macroeconomic model calculations are then 
used as a basis for describing possible transmis -
sion channels, and, finally, an attempt is made 
to pinpoint specific effects in the past few 
years.
The past evolution of  
crude oil prices in response 
to changing supply and 
 demand dynamics
After several supply-side shocks, in conjunction 
with rapidly rising demand in the industrial 
countries, led to sharp price hikes in the crude 
oil market in the 1970s, prices subsequently 
eased in response to the resulting slump in de -
mand in the advanced economies and the ero -
sion of the market power of the Organization 
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) 
(see the box on pages 29 and 30). In the 1990s, 
temporary price increases were repeatedly oc -
casioned by supply-side factors, such as Iraq’s 
invasion of Kuwait and the cutting of OPEC oil 
production quotas in the wake of the Asian cri -
sis. This was followed, however, by a funda -
mental shift in market dynamics on the de -
mand side. The rapid economic growth that 
now began in the emerging markets and de -
veloping countries was accompanied by a 
steeply rising demand for energy. Since the 
start of the new millennium, the contribution 
made by this group of countries to the global 
increase in the demand for oil has – sometimes 
far – outstripped that of the advanced econ -Empirical coinci-

Oil crises of the 1970s
In the 1960s, the price of crude oil was 
quite stable at a comparatively low level. While industrial nations’ demand for oil surged, mainly on account of increasing motorisation, US production in particular 
could still be expanded strongly. The Texas 
Railroad Commission, which was respon-sible for the regulation of the oil and gas industry in Texas and also set production 
quotas, played a key role in global crude oil 
prices. US oil production peaked in 1970, accompanied by an unrestrained demand. 
Over the next three years alone, consump-tion of refi  ned petroleum products shot up 
by almost one-fi  fth in the US. The Texas 
Railroad Commission set production quotas to 100% as early as 1971, ultimately losing 
its infl  uence on the oil prices. At the same 
time, the USA became increasingly depend-
ent on oil imports, especially from the Or-
ganisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
1 This association was 
founded in 1960 with members mainly 
from countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Like the Texas Railroad Commission, 
it attempts to infl  uence the price of oil by setting production quotas. The stage was 
therefore set for a fundamental revaluation of crude oil.
2
A fi  rst specifi  c occasion for this arose when 
several Arab countries imposed an oil em-
bargo against the USA in 1973 in retaliation 
for its support of Israel in the Yom Kippur war.
3 Not least the price controls, put in 
place by the US government to keep infl  a-
tion under control, subsequently probably 
led to supply shortages, however.4 As a re-
sult of these scarcities, proliferating prices 
and lower economic activity, oil consump-
tion in the USA fell sharply for a time. How-ever, in 1978 it was markedly surpassing its 1973 level again. In the meantime, 40% of the American economy’s demand for oil 
was being quenched by imports. More than 
two-thirds of these came from the OPEC countries. Events took over again in 1979 following the Iranian revolution. Although 
the expansion of production in other OPEC countries more than offset the shortages in Iranian oil production resulting from the un-
rest, oil prices surged in the course of the 
1 In 1970 no more than around one-fi  fth of the con-
sumption of refi  ned petroleum products was covered 
by net imports in the USA, whereas it was as much as 
one-third in 1973. OPEC’s share of oil imports climbed 
by 10 percentage points to just under 50%. See US Energy Information Administration (EIA), Annual En-
ergy Review 2009, pp 129 and 135.2 Barsky und Kilian (2002) und Kilian (2008) highlight the role of increased demand as preparing the ground for the fi  rst oil price surge of the 1970s. See R B Barsky

year and there were fuel shortages again in 
the USA.5 Towards the end of the year, the 
US government also decided to boycott Iranian oil. The invasion by neighbouring 
Iraq in 1980 had a major impact on crude 
oil production in both countries, but did not drive prices up beyond previous highs.
The industrial countries’ demand for oil de-
clined sharply in the wake of the price surge 
between 1980 and 1983 and, unlike the previous crisis, its recovery was sluggish. 
This may well have been one reason for the erosion of the oil price in the 1980s. In add-
ition, on the supply side the power of the 
OPEC cartel was being undermined through 
the development of oil fi  elds, for example, 
in Alaska and the North Sea, as well as 
by the expansion of production in Mexico. 
OPEC combated the decline in prices with cuts in production quotas. However, this 
led to losses of market share and revenue, 
which prompted some member states not 
to keep to their quotas. Saudi Arabia bore 
the brunt of adjustments; by 1985 it had reduced its production to just over one-
third of its 1981 level. Owing to the massive 
loss in revenue, the kingdom fi  nally liber-
ated itself from this burden in the following 
year and the price of oil slumped again to its 1978 value. It is certainly striking that the 
decline in prices barely stimulated the de-pressed oil demand, indicating an asym-metry in its price elasticity. The sharp in-crease in prices in 1979-80 led to wide-spread displacement of oil from electricity production, reduced use as heating fuel, 
energy saving measures in households and 
industry as well as the development of more effi   cient motor vehicles. However, substitution and effi   ciency improvements 
were not reversed in the wake of the price 
decline.
5 The 1979 fuel shortage is sometimes seen as being 
linked to an unusually strong accumulation of stocks, 
in which a part may have been played by economic 
incentives in connection with the gradual shedding of 
price controls along with the policy of the US Depart-ment of Energy. See P K Verleger (1979), The US Petrol-
eum Crisis of 1979, Brookings Papers on Economic 
Activity, Vol 1979:2, pp 463-476.Growth in global crude oil consumption

omies in each individual year.2 In 2011, global 
oil consumption was split nearly 50-50 be -
tween these two groups of countries; ten years 
earlier, the industrial nations had accounted for 
60%. The emerging economies’ hunger for en -
ergy is widely seen as one of the key drivers of 
the gradual but continuous oil price rise be -
tween 2003 and 2008.3 Consumption by China 
increased in this period by more than one-half. 
On the other hand, global oil production stag -
nated in 2006 and 2007 owing, among other 
things, to oil fields becoming exhausted and 
ageing installations in Mexico and the North 
Sea. It could therefore be argued that the add -
itional demand from emerging economies and 
developing countries had to be met by savings 
elsewhere, which were enforced via the market 
through price increases.4 Hence there is no 
need to attribute the observed price rises to a 
supposed major contribution made by the 
speculative activities of financial investors – an 
argument that has often been put forward – 
nor does the direct evidence suggest that 
speculation plays an important role (see the 
box on pages 32 and 33).
A second factor is that the emerging and de -
veloping countries’ demand for oil probably 
reacts even more sluggishly to price changes 
than that of the advanced economies (see box 
on pages 34 to 36). The price elasticity of the 
demand for crude oil is generally low in the in -
dustrial countries, too, especially in the short 
term. But in many emerging markets and de -
veloping countries price controls and subsidies 
additionally impede a pass-through of higher 
crude oil prices. Fuel subsidies in the OPEC 
countries are especially obvious; there, con -
sumers have, in some cases, to pay the equiva -
lent of just a few cents for a litre of petrol.5 In 
conjunction with sharp increases in income and 
high population growth, this is likely to have 
driven up the demand for oil in these countries. 
In the early 1970s, the OPEC countries ac -
counted for just 2½% of global consumption, 
compared with almost 4% by 1980 and as 
much as 10% in 2011.6 Measured by the total 
costs involved, the subsidies in China, India and Indonesia are also considerable, however.7 Ac-
cording to estimates by the International En -
ergy Agency (IEA), without reforms such assist -
ance could amount to more than US$630 bil -
lion worldwide this year. This would be roughly 
equivalent to half of the OPEC countries’ rev -
enues from oil exports.8
All things considered, the furious pace of eco -
nomic growth in the emerging markets and de -
veloping countries along with the extremely 
low price sensitivity of their demand for oil sug -
gests that, given a finite supply, the advanced 
economies took most of the strain of making 
the necessary adjustments to clear the oil mar -
ket in the past decade. In actual fact, consump -
tion of oil by the advanced economies peaked 
as long ago as 2005; six years later, it was 9% 
lower despite economic growth of 7%. By con -
trast, oil consumption by the emerging markets 
and developing countries went up 21% on the 
back of an almost 50% expansion in their 
macroeconomic activity.
In view of the renewed resurgent recovery in 
the emerging market economies, it is not sur -
prising that, following the global recession of 
2008-09, the oil market was soon very tight 
again. Furthermore, the expansion of oil pro -
duction in some regions, especially in the 
United States and Canada as a result of extrac -
tion from unconventional sources, contrasted … and very low

The impact of speculation on the price of oil
Futures are standardised, exchange-traded 
contracts for goods to be delivered at a later date. The markets for commodities  futures, in particular, perform at least two 
important economic functions. First, they 
allow producers and consumers of the rele-
vant commodities to hedge price risks. This 
reduces the uncertainty surrounding the production of commodities, for example, and can therefore help to increase their supply, which per se  tends to lower the 
price of commodities. Second, the futures markets play a key economic role in the price-setting process due to the high de-
gree of standardisation and transparency of these markets. The large, liquid futures mar-kets, in particular, perform a price-signalling 
function for the corresponding spot mar-
kets and over-the-counter derivatives mar-
kets.
Critics of futures trading and the futures markets regard this signalling function as  problematic, however, and question whether the price signals emanating from the commodities markets really refl  ect the fundamentals. For example, if speculators 
were to “gamble” on the futures markets, 
regardless of the fundamentals, and were 
to dominate the price-setting process there, 
the markets’ signalling function would in-deed be impaired. Another point of criti-
cism concerns the market power of individ-
ual speculators. The question is whether any single speculator or small group of 
speculators has the necessary market power to manipulate prices so as to profi  t from the resulting price movements. This, too, would 
constrain the ability of the relevant futures 
market to function properly –  in extreme 
cases, to such an extent that the price set 
on this market would not transmit effi   cient signals to other markets.The recent high price levels on the oil mar-
ket have reawakened debate on this topic, 
focusing on whether the price of oil ad-
equately refl  ects the fundamental supply 
and demand conditions. Particularly at 
times of sharp price fl  uctuations, fi  ngers are 
frequently pointed at the fi  nancial markets, with critics highlighting and questioning the role of speculation on the futures markets.
In this situation, it is helpful to take a closer 
look at how a futures market is structured. 
The light sweet crude oil futures contract traded on the New York Mercantile Ex-change is selected here by way of illustra-tion. According to data on open trading positions, at between 10% and 20%, the market share of speculators (or actively 
managed funds) is relatively small and con-
stant over time; it did not increase even during the fi  nancial crisis of 2007-08.
1 
These fi  gures strongly indicate that the 
volatile price developments on the crude oil 
markets are not due to corresponding changes in the market participation of 
speculators. A certain amount of caution is 
advised when interpreting these fi  gures, 
however, as they only relate to one individ-ual futures market and exclude activities on 
over-the-counter derivatives markets, for 
example.
The different groups of market participants 
usually act as both buyers and sellers, albeit 
to varying extents. Where buying/selling predominates, the trading portfolio is re-ferred to as a net long/short position. In 
1 The actively managed assets include open positions 
of hedge funds and commodity pool operators and are 
therefore considered speculative. By contrast, swap 
dealers may be banks that hedge their swap transac-
tions in the futures market. Because of their hedging 
activities, swap dealers are also referred to as “non-traditional hedgers” by the US Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission (CFTC). See the information pro-
vided by the CFTC at http://www.cftc.gov.Deutsche Bundesbank

general it may be said that the net long 
positions held by actively managed funds 
generally counterbalance the net short pos-itions held by risk managers (hedgers). This suggests that the speculators in this market 
are not “gambling” and therefore not ig-
noring the fundamentals. Instead, they per-
form an important economic function and 
help to stabilise the market by providing 
 liquidity, thus enabling hedgers to manage 
risk in the fi  rst place. This interpretation is supported by the Keynesian theory that 
speculators on the futures markets act more 
as counterparties or insurers for hedgers.2 
Similarly, the Bundesbank’s own studies on 
the relationship between open positions 
and price dynamics, carried out using caus-ality tests and regression models, do not in-
dicate that actively managed funds have a 
signifi  cant destabilising effect on price de-
velopments.3
It is also claimed that speculators have too 
much market clout and can manipulate prices. However, it is diffi   cult to fi  nd any 
fi  rm evidence of this. Instead, market data 
appear to indicate that speculators do not 
have any signifi  cant market power relative 
to the hedgers. The average size of the open positions per trader in the period 2006 to 2012 is some two to three times larger for hedgers than for speculators. In 
addition, the average sizes of the specula-
tors’ positions are constant over time. In 
light of this, the risk of price manipulation 
seems rather low.
Overall, with regard to the trade in crude oil, many factors suggest that speculators do not impair the functioning of the mar-
ket, but instead have a positive infl  uence on 
it, especially by providing liquidity for 
hedgers and therefore facilitating the price-setting process. To enable a more compre-hensive assessment to be made, it is essen-tial to collect and evaluate additional infor-mation about trading activities on over-the-
counter derivatives markets. It is therefore important to press ahead with international 
initiatives to encourage higher levels of 
transparency on these markets.

Price elasticity of demand for crude oil in the short term
In economics, elasticity is the relationship 
between the percentage change in a vari-able and the causal percentage change in 
another variable. Price elasticity of demand 
(ε) is thus a measure of how strongly the 
demanded quantity of a good (х) reacts to 
a change in its price (p):
 .
Given that demand tends to decline as 
prices rise, elasticity is generally negative. In 
the short term, demand for crude oil is re-
garded as largely inelastic since substitution on a major scale is possible only in the me-
dium to long term. If we additionally as-sume a perfectly inelastic oil supply in the 
short term, a given elasticity of demand can 
be used to determine the price reaction that occurs in the market, say, after a re-
striction of the quantity supplied.
 .
Owing to the low sensitivity of demand, 
even minor supply cuts can trigger a signifi  -
cant shift in prices. For a price elasticity of 
demand of -0.10, for example, a 2½% re-duction in the supply would drive up the 
price of oil by (-2.50%) / (-0.10) = 25%, and by as much as 50% given an elasticity of -0.05. This example also illustrates that, with a low level of elasticity, even small changes in its value are associated with 
major differences in the resulting price reac-tion.
Global oil demand consists of the demand 
of the individual regions. For the sake of simplicity, let it be assumed that the ad-
vanced economies, as one group of coun-
tries, and the emerging economies and de-veloping countries, as the other, each con-sumes one-half of the global oil production volume. Owing to economic growth, let the demand of the latter group, irrespective of the price, grow by 5%, ie 2½% of the over-
all global supply. As it is assumed that the 
global supply cannot be expanded, a price 
increase should dampen demand to the 
same extent. How this adjustment burden is distributed among the two regions depends 
on the price elasticity of their demand. If the elasticity is identical, the regions bear the burden equally. If the regional and global elasticities are both -0.10, the price 
will go up by 25%, and the consumption of 
the advanced economies will decline by 
2½%. The demand of the emerging econ-
omies and developing countries will like-
wise fall by 2½%; owing to the income-re-
lated stimulus, an increase of 2½% still re-
mains, however. This clearly shows that even with identical price elasticity of de-mand, the economic emergence of other 
economies can lead – through price surges – to a displacement of the demand for oil in the industrial countries.
If it is additionally assumed that not just the 
supply, but also the demand of the emer-
ging economies and developing countries is 
perfectly inelastic in the short term, rebal-
ancing the oil market is a matter for the de-
mand of the advanced economies alone. If 
consumption in the rest of the world rises 
again by 5% for income-related reasons, Price elasticity of oil demand in the USA

the demand of the industrial countries de-
clines by the same amount. Given an elasti-
city of -0.10, this would require a 50% price 
increase and for an elasticity of -0.05, the price would have to be doubled. Inciden-tally, a 2½% cutback in the global supply would also have the same effect on the 
price and the volume of demand of the in-
dustrial countries, even though this scen-
ario would, in fact, be completely different 
with regard to global economic growth. 
Nevertheless, it is clear that the price fl  uctu-
ations on the oil market become larger along with the growing importance of a comparatively inelastic part of global de-
mand.
Ultimately, how high the short-term price 
elasticity of demand is has to be determined 
empirically. Logarithmic variables can be used to obtain an estimate from a simple 
regression in which annual data are used as 
a basis for explaining the oil demand (per 
capita) by a constant, the real price of oil, 
real GDP (per capita) and its own prior-year value.
1 Such an approach results in a short-
term price elasticity, which, in part, is still somewhat lower than in our stylised ex-
amples.2 However, this approach works on 
the assumption that demand generally reacts symmetrically to price rises and de-
clines. In a diagram in which the real price 
of oil is plotted on the vertical axis and the demand for oil (per capita) on the horizon-
tal axis, a relatively steeply falling curve 
would have to be shown, which repeatedly shifts to the right following increases in in-
come. Especially in the case of the United 
States, marked shifts to the left can be ob-
served in the wake of sharp price surges 
(1979 to 1983 and 2007 to 2011). The price increases led to sharp cutbacks in consump-tion, which were not reversed again by sub-sequent price decreases (1984 to 1986 and in 2009). It would appear that the demand for oil is more responsive to price rises than 
to price reductions. Since this is not taken 
into consideration in the above regression estimate, only an elasticity to an average price change is obtained and the respon-siveness of demand to a price increase is 
possibly underestimated.
Following Gately and Huntington (2002), the simple symmetric regression approach can be corrected by decomposing the (logarithmic) real oil price as the explana-
tory variable into peak prices, the cumula-
tive (remaining) price rises and the cumula-
tive price declines.3 If such an asymmetric 
model is estimated for the period from 
1971 to 2011,4 a considerably higher elasti-
1 From the coeffi   cient for the lagged demand, the cor-
responding long-term elasticities can be derived in 
conjunction with the estimated coeffi   cients of price and income, ie the short-term elasticities. See J C

3 Furthermore, Gately and Huntington (2002) also 
consider asymmetries in income elasticity. See D Gately and H G Huntington (2002), The Asymmetric Effects of 
Changes in Price and Income on Energy and Oil De-
mand, Energy Journal, Volume 23, pp 19-55.4 The annual data used are from the following sources: EIA, IEA, IMF and Maddison (Historical Statistics of the World Economy). Owing to the small number of data 
points together with the imprecision of the relevant tests, the problem of non-stationarity and cointegra-
tion of the time series is disregarded here. In the equa-tions for the world as a whole and for emerging econ-
omies and developing countries, the hypothesis that the residues are free of autocorrelation is rejected in 
the Breusch-Godfrey test, which is why AR(1) models 
are estimated.Breakdown of the real oil price

city of global oil demand (-0.08) is obtained 
compared with the price surges which re-
sulted in historical peaks in the real price of 
oil. Compared with other oil price changes, however, hardly any demand responses are 
apparent. Furthermore, in the case of the advanced economies, the sensitivity to other price increases (-0.04) additionally proves to be statistically signifi  cant. In the case of the emerging economies and de-veloping countries, the demand responses to price increases appear to be generally weaker. The signifi  cance of the positive elasticity to price declines is also striking. However, it also has to be taken into ac-count that this is the aggregate of a very heterogeneous group of countries. Owing 
to the dependency of their income on price 
fl  uctuations and the high level of subsidies 
for fuel consumption, the group of oil-ex-porting countries, in particular, generally 
shows a positive price elasticity, which out-weighs the impact of the negative elasticity of other countries if the price goes up, and which is the sole factor that has an impact when the price goes down.
There was a rise especially in the frequency 
of record highs in the real price of oil at the beginning of the underlying observation period. According to the estimates, there was a very marked responsiveness of de-mand especially to these price increases, which might therefore be consistent with 
the results of some studies showing the oil 
demand to have become more inelastic 
over time.5 One key reason for this could be 
that comparatively simple substitution pos-
sibilities for crude oil, say, in electricity pro-duction, are already exhausted and, hence, 
end products with a relatively low price elasticity of demand, such as transport 
fuels, have gained in importance. With re-
gard to global demand, however, the re-gional shift in the weights towards the 
emerging economies and developing coun-
tries – and within the group itself towards 
the oil-exporting countries – is also likely to have played a part in this.
6
All in all, the price fl  uctuations on the oil market are likely to have been tending to 
increase owing to a lower sensitivity of de-
mand. What should also be highlighted in 
this connection is the imprecision of the es-timates, which opens up a matching range 
of possible elasticities and implied price 
fl  uctuations.

made of the studies of Baumeister and Peersman 
(2008, 2009), for example. Their methodology is criti-

with declining production from mature oil 
fields, say, in the North Sea. According to the 
US Energy Information Administration (EIA), 
Norwegian production last year was 18½% 
down on its 2008 level, while UK oil output 
tumbled by as much as 27%. Production levels 
were faltering in Venezuela, too. The combined 
decline in supply from these three countries 
alone compared with 2008 amounted to 
around one million barrels a day, which equates 
to 1¼% of the global supply. Besides these 
shifts with a  medium-term impact, acute con -
cerns about the stability of oil streams from 
North Africa and the Middle East emerged at 
the beginning of 2011 along with the struggle 
for political codetermination in the Arab world. 
At all events, 2011 saw Libyan production sink 
to one- quarter of its 2010 level in the wake of 
the military conflicts. Although global oil pro -
duction increased last year owing to the fact 
that some countries, notably Saudi Arabia, 
sought to raise their oil output, the figures ob -
scure the fact that the oil market is quite seg -
mented both in terms of quality and regional 
distribution. Thus, high-quality Libyan crude 
could not simply be replaced by different 
grades of oil from Saudi Arabia. A temporary 
easing was brought about by the release of 
part of the industrial countries’ strategic re -
serves. Regional imbalances were reflected 
mainly in the unusual price spread between the 
crude oils Brent und West Texas Intermediate 
(WTI).9 One indication of the role played by 
supply-side shortages in the recent oil price in -
creases might also be the persistence of the lat -
ter. Whereas industrial raw materials, for ex -
ample, became much cheaper in the second 
half of 2011 in the wake of the slowdown in 
the world economy, the price of Brent barely 
eased. On an annual average, crude oil became 
40% more expensive and was thus clearly up 
even on the previous record year of 2008.
Although Libyan production has since been 
stepped up again, there was a further hike in 
crude oil prices in the first few months of 2012. 
Against the backdrop of an escalating dispute 
with Iran concerning its nuclear capability, prices were being driven up by fears of a pos -
sible military confrontation in the Persian Gulf 
along with other factors. Existing purchasers of 
Iranian oil are likely to have been on the look -
out for new sources even before an EU em -
bargo came into force in July. It is expected 
that Iranian oil exports will ultimately be re -
duced by between ¾ and 1 million barrels per 
day. It should be noted that the expectation of 
a higher price of crude oil in the future is in it -
self a sufficient economic rationale for raising 
the price now. In addition to the smouldering 
conflict in the Persian Gulf, production losses 
occurred at the start of 2012 in the context of 
political conflicts, particularly in Yemen, Sudan 
and Syria. According to estimates, these to -
talled roughly ¾ million barrels per day.10 Com -
pared with this, the additional demand from 
Japan due to the stoppage of nuclear power 
plants which generate electricity is likely to 
… and 20129 As WTI has a slightly higher quality, Brent is usually 
traded at a small discount to it. Yet Brent started fetching a 
premium of a few US dollars per barrel in the second half 
of 2010. This premium rapidly expanded in the first few 
months of 2011 and peaked in the summer months above 
the US$20 mark. WTI is extracted within the continental 
borders of the United States, where the supply has broad -
ened in the past few years owing to the inflow of Canadian 
oil and where storage capacities were largely exhausted in 
the wake of restrained demand. On the other side of the 
Atlantic, however, the Libyan production losses were 
added to declining North Sea production and rising de -
mand from Asia. The sharp differences in the supply-
demand equation were also reflected in the respective term 
structures. While forward deliveries of WTI were still carry -
ing a premium (contango), short-term deliveries of Brent 
were dearer than longer-term forward deliveries (back -
wardation). As the available pipelines led only into the in -
terior of the USA, the lack of a convenient transportation 
option ultimately prevented an adjustment between the 
markets. The decoupling from the world market is also 
shown by the price spread between WTI and other crudes. 
Furthermore, even in the United States, petrol prices at the 
consumer level appear to have followed the pattern of 
Brent prices. Moreover, as Brent and WTI prices have 
shown little divergence historically, the Brent price is used 
throughout this article as a measure of the world market 
price for crude oil. See EIA, Market Response to the WTI-

have played no more than a minor role.11 In 
light of a larger supply, especially following 
Saudi Arabia’s expansion of production, and 
the gloomier outlook for the global economy, 
the price of oil went down again in spring.
On balance, it can be said that the economic 
rise of the emerging and developing countries 
has brought about a significant shift in the dy -
namics of the oil market. The responsiveness of 
global oil demand to price changes is likely to 
have decreased as a result and the fluctuation 
margin of oil prices to have increased in line 
with this. As the supply of oil is not very elastic, 
the market equilibrium could only be preserved 
by ultimately crowding out the advanced econ -
omies’ demand for oil through sharp price 
hikes.
Possible impacts of an  
oil price hike on the real 
economy
Economists generally assume that oil price 
hikes have an impact on both aggregate supply 
and demand.12 The impact on the supply side 
results from firms’ need to employ oil or energy 
alongside their capital and labour inputs in 
order to produce their output. A higher (rela -
tive) price then reduces the crude oil input and 
thus also output.13 The magnitude of this effect 
can be derived from simple logic. Assuming an 
optimal factor input, in which the marginal 
product of energy matches its relative price, it 
follows that the elasticity of output to the 
change in the energy input corresponds to its 
cost share. The elasticity of output to changes 
in the relative price of energy then reduces to 
the product of its cost share and the price elas -
ticity of energy consumption.14 As the latter is 
small in the short run, output response even to 
large price changes should be rather small.
Other mechanisms could further magnify the 
impact of a price surge, however. It is also pos -
sible that other factor inputs might be scaled 
back. For example, the heightened uncertainty triggered by a price rise could prompt enter -
prises to cut back their investment.15 Moreover, 
the assumption of homogeneous aggregate 
output represents a considerable simplification. 
In reality, an increase in the price of energy is 
likely to affect individual sectors to varying ex -
tents and thus bring about a reallocation of the 
production factors among the economic sec -
tors.16 Such shifts are certainly associated with 
higher costs in the form of output losses.17 
Common assumptions, such as that of perfect 
competition are, after all, not sustainable and 
price-setting by enterprises by means of cost 
surcharges likewise implies a higher output re -
sponse.18
On the demand side, a dampening effect is 
exerted through the narrowing of households’ 
(real) scope of income. Assuming that their en -
ergy consumption is unchanged, which is quite Oil demand of

11 The latest estimate by the IEA puts Japan’s additional 
demand for oil last year at no more than 145,000 barrels 
per day, roughly half as much as in earlier assessments. But 
as other consumption was tending to decline – due not 
least to price inflation – the EAI data show that Japan’s 
actual total oil consumption in the second half of 2011 was 
around 100,000 barrels per day (+2½%) higher than in 
2010. For 2012, the IEA still assumes an additional oil de -
mand of ¼ million barrels per day. See IEA, Japanese Power

13 If changes in the inputs of other production factors are 
taken into account, the demand for labour and capital rises 
accordingly. This substitution mitigates the output losses.

plausible in the very short term, consumers 
have to cover their additional costs by cutting 
their spending on other goods or by saving 
less. How far they prefer one alternative to the 
other is likely to hinge on their broader eco -
nomic environment. The maximum percentage 
share of the cutbacks needed elsewhere is, at 
all events, given by the product of the share of 
spending on energy and the percentage change 
in its relative price. The ceiling for the elasticity 
of consumers’ (real) demand to relative price 
changes is thus formed by the percentage of 
petroleum products in total expenditure.19 This 
means that the demand effect could be of a 
higher order than the simple supply-side effect, 
which depends on a reduction in oil input and 
is therefore additionally restricted by the low 
price elasticity of energy consumption.
There is a corresponding outflow of income 
also at the macroeconomic level for countries 
that are net importers of oil. It is true that in -
come may flow back into an oil-importing 
country to a certain extent since oil-exporting 
countries spend part of their extra revenues on 
higher imports of goods and services.20 The ex -
tent of this income recycling depends on 
spending behaviour in the exporting country, 
however, and on its external trade links with 
the importing country in question.
The importance of oil’s share in overall spend -
ing for the demand effect, which was estab -
lished above, already implies that the (short-
term) effect on aggregate output also depends 
on the oil price’s initial level. Thus, an increase 
of, say, 10% given an initial price of US$100 
results in a steeper fall in output than if the 
price is initially only half as high. Furthermore, 
taxation based on quantity ensures, at least at 
the consumer level, that the share of spending 
ultimately does not increase exactly in propor -
tion to the price. These interrelationships are 
also simulated in common macroeconomic 
models which are otherwise linear in construc -
tion, like NiGEM (see Annex on pages 48 
and 49). This fact alone means that common 
rules of thumb that automatically infer a given output response from a given percentage or 
absolute change in the price of oil should be 
interpreted merely as approximations.
The relationship between changes in the price 
of oil and output growth seems to have weak -
ened over time. A large part of the relevant lit -
erature has therefore been devoted to the 
question of how far this phenomenon can be 
reconciled with the earlier transmission mech -
anisms.21 For instance, one major strand of re -
search has highlighted non-linearities and 
asymmetries of the impact of oil price changes 
on the real economy. The first doubts concern -
ing the supposed stimulating effect of a fall in 
oil prices emerged in the second half of the 
1980s, when US economic growth failed to 
strengthen following the oil price collapse.22 
The fact that structural dislocations generally 
occur in the wake of oil price shifts, thus neu -
tralising the potential positive demand effects 
of a lower price, has been cited as the fore -
most cause of such an asymmetry.23 Further -
more, heightened uncertainty, which may lead 
to the deferment of investment, is probably as -
sociated with price fluctuations in the oil mar -
ket per se,  not with price changes in a particu -
lar direction.24 Finally, the asymmetric reaction 
of the demand for oil is also likely to exert a … and oil-

20 Insofar as the additional revenues are not reflected in 
higher expenditure, the exporting countries acquire assets. 
This brings about a change in asset prices, which ultimately 
likewise influences aggregate demand in the importing 
country. Income recycling via this channel takes place much 
more slowly, however.

matching one-sided impact on aggregate sup -
ply. Economists who focus primarily on the im -
pact on aggregate demand do indeed dispute 
that there is such an imbalance in the way 
higher or lower crude oil prices affect overall 
economic activity.25 Nevertheless, a non-linear 
measure of oil price changes appears to show 
a quite stable relationship with real GDP growth 
to date (see box on pages 41 to 43).
A further debate in the academic literature 
centres on how far the observed output losses 
following an oil price shock should perhaps ra -
ther be ascribed to a more restrictive monetary 
policy. In actual fact, recessions in the United 
States have been regularly preceded not only 
by oil price hikes but also by a rise in the federal 
funds rate. Using a counterfactual experiment 
in an empirical model, Bernanke et al  (1997), 
notably, have attempted to show that the US 
economy’s output losses following the oil price 
shocks in the 1970s and early 1980s would 
have been much more muted if key interest 
rates had remained unchanged.26 Such an ap -
proach is extremely problematic, however.27 
First, it is assumed that the actual interest rate 
rises were ultimately solely a monetary policy 
response to the oil price hikes. It is more likely, 
however, that the tightening of monetary pol -
icy was, at least partly, a response to the gen -
eral upward surge in prices and a reflection of 
the Fed’s striving for credibility. Second, it is im -
plicitly assumed that a neutral monetary policy 
stance in the event of an oil price shock is to 
keep the key interest rate unchanged.
The problematic nature of this assumption can 
be demonstrated by an analogous experiment 
using a macroeconomic model like NiGEM (see 
Annex on pages 48 and 49). In this case, too, it 
seems natural to model the supposedly stand-
alone effect of an oil price shock, ie excluding 
the impact of monetary policy, by linking this 
price increase in a simulation with the add -
itional assumption of constant policy rates. In 
actual fact, however, a quite different question 
is answered by an experiment of this kind. This 
is due to the fact that, in the initial situation, the monetary policy stance is neutral in terms 
of a predefined rule. But if the central bank’s 
target variable is subsequently affected by a 
change to the data, such as an oil price hike, 
the same key interest rate can no longer imply 
a neutral monetary policy stance. This is be -
cause private market players anticipate higher 
inflation following an oil price shock and an 
interest rate rise in response to it. If interest 
rates are left on hold, this is a case – measured 
by the underlying rule – of unexpected monet -
ary policy easing. The smaller losses of aggre -
gate output in the wake of unchanged key 
rates compared with a simulation in which only 
a higher oil price is assumed therefore reflect 
the impact of a monetary policy shock. In eco -
nomic reality, however, private market players’ 
ability to learn means it is unlikely that such 
surprises can be repeated an infinite number of 
times.
It is therefore very hard to isolate the effects of 
systematic monetary policy reactions from the 
impact of higher oil prices that triggered them. 
Nevertheless, model simulations show clearly 
that the macroeconomic trade-off between 
lower economic activity and a higher price level 
following a permanent increase in oil prices can 
indeed be controlled to a certain extent by a 
central bank. For example, a central bank that 
stabilises only the price level may tolerate a 
sharper decline in output in the wake of an oil 
price hike than a central bank which has an in -Have recessions

Empirical relationship between crude oil price changes and 
real GDP growth
Despite the temporal proximity of strong oil 
price surges to macroeconomic downturns, it is not easy to prove econometrically that 
changes in the price of crude oil have a negative impact on real GDP growth. An initial problem concerns the stability of a 
possible (linear) relationship.1 Studies often 
come to the conclusion that, generally, the 
impact of oil price changes has declined 
over time. Such fi  ndings are partly ascribed 
to the price declines in the 1980s, the stimulating impact of which on economic activity is being called into question.
2 Fur-
thermore, subsequent price rises have pos-
sibly been interpreted by economic agents 
as no more than a return to normal follow-ing the declines in prices and therefore have 
not led to a comparable cutback in aggre-
gate demand like price increases without a 
preceding decline in prices. A 10% rise in 
the price of oil, for example, would not dis-courage consumers from buying a car with a high fuel consumption if the oil price had 
fallen by 20% immediately beforehand. As 
an explanatory variable, Hamilton (1996) therefore proposed a non-linear measure-ment, which is based on a comparison of the (nominal) oil price in a given quarter with the peak level in the preceding four quarters. If the current price climbs to a 
new peak, the percentage increase on the 
previous peak is calculated. In all other cases, the resulting “net price increase” is 
set to zero. For this measurement, Hamilton 
shows a stable relationship with real GDP 
growth in the USA, although he extended 
the underlying time-frame from one to 
three years in later studies.3
A further problem is presented by the reci-
procity of the relationship between the oil 
price and economic activity. Given that not only supply but also demand plays a key 
role on the market, a rise in crude oil prices could also be due to sharp GDP growth in a 
major economy such as the USA. A subse-
quent recession would then not necessarily 
be the outcome of a more symptomatic oil 
price rise, but would be more likely attribut-
able to a preceding period of cyclical over-
heating. In order to be able to derive a clear-cut cause and effect relationship, a 
price change has to be used which is inde-pendent of economic growth in the country 
in question. This should be fulfi  lled given exogenous infl  uences on the price of oil 
such as those exerted historically by political 
confl  icts fl  aring up in the Middle East. Ac-cording to Hamilton, the net oil price in-
crease has accurately modelled the signifi  -
cant crisis episodes in this region in the 
past.
To highlight the relationship between the real economy and the price of oil, we use Hamilton’s regression model, where real 
GDP growth ( yt ) in quarter t on the preced-
ing period is determined by a constant ( β0 ), 
its own lags ( yt–i for i = 1, …, 4) and the 
lagged net price increase ( ot+–i ). We do,

3 With a reference period of less than three years, a 
net price increase is shown in 1999, without this re-
sulting in a weakening of the US economy in the fol-
lowing year. Furthermore, the net price rise on the 
basis of the longer reference period shows favourable 
statistical properties. See J D Hamilton (1996), This is

tionship, Journal of Monetary Economics, Vol 38,

however, deviate from his approach in 
some respects. For example, we do not consider the nominal price, but rather the 
real price adjusted using the consumer price 
index, which should ultimately be the de-cisive factor for rational economic agents. 
We calculate the net price increase in each case over a period of two years so that the 
episode in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 
the fi  rst quarter of 2011 can be considered as an autonomous shock. Given that macro-economic model calculations show the out-
put effect of a percentage increase in the price of oil as being largely dependent on 
the original level, we also use the absolute 
change in the real price of oil – measured 
against an index – as a basis for our calcu-lation. Furthermore, we also use the net oil 
price decline ( ot––i ), calculated using the 
same method, as an explanatory variable in 
order to highlight asymmetries and to pre-vent biases in the estimation. We therefore estimate the equation
over the period from 1973:1 to 2012:1 for a 
number of advanced economies and their 
aggregate.4
Owing to the rather high idiosyncratic vola-
tility of the quarterly growth rates, the ex-
planatory power of the model is sometimes 
fairly small. Nevertheless, the hypothesis 
that the lags in the net oil price rise have no collective impact on the pace of growth of 
aggregate economic output can generally

be clearly rejected.5 A net price increase 
seems to have the strongest dampening im-
pact on economic growth only after three 
to four quarters. By contrast, the collective 
infl  uence of net price declines is generally 
statistically insignifi  cant. These results prove 
to be robust across various modifi  cations, 
for instance when, instead of the absolute 
change in the real price of oil, changes in 
the nominal price or percentage price changes are used. Furthermore, these re-
sults are also in line with the literature, the focus of which is generally on the US econ-omy.

All in all, oil price rises that are not directly preceded by a corresponding price decrease have a certain predictive power for real GDP 
growth. This is probably a refl  ection, fi  rst 
and foremost, of the fact that, historically, 
economic activity in advanced economies has been perceptibly weakened following crises in the Middle East. The oil price surges in late 2010 and early 2011 as well as in the 
fi  rst quarter of 2012, which are to be seen 
in the context of the “Arab Spring” and the nuclear confl  ict with Iran, are likely to have 
dampened macroeconomic growth in in-
dustrial countries again recently.
5 The only exception to this is Japan, where GDP 
growth rates fl  uctuate particularly strongly. If contem-
porary infl  uences are also included, however, a rather close direct relationship can be seen between the net price increase and GDP growth.

flation target. The reason for this is that a mon -
etary policy geared to stabilising the general 
price level must depress the prices of other 
goods by means of a more restrictive stance, 
while inflation targeting allows the price level 
to drift upwards. Admittedly, such results are 
not independent of the underlying model.28
Recent impact of the price  
of crude oil on economic 
 activity in the industrial 
countries
One of the key issues during the past few years, 
not only in the academic debate but also in the 
terms of the practical assessment of cyclical de -
velopments, has been whether and to what ex -
tent the relationship between oil prices and 
real activity has weakened. The fact that central 
banks no longer need first to establish the 
credibility of their stability policy by strongly 
“leaning against the wind” is just one aspect of 
this. Given anchored inflation expectations, a 
central bank that was prepared to tolerate the 
direct and indirect effects of persistently higher 
energy prices on the general price level has 
been able to set its policy rates largely inde -
pendently of developments in the oil market. In 
actual fact, monetary policy in the most im -
portant advanced economies has been de -
cidedly expansionary in the past few years.
Especially in the period preceding the global 
economic downturn of 2008-09, it was often 
claimed that recessionary tendencies following 
oil price shocks would not occur if the shocks 
were caused by accelerating demand. Behind 
this lies the argument that a primary increase in 
real GDP has to be greater than the secondary 
dampening effects that it itself generates 
through an expansion in demand for crude oil 
and a resulting price increase. This does not ne -
cessarily mean that the retarding effects of an 
oil price hike on real activity themselves vary 
depending on its causes. It is possible that the 
underlying factors create additional effects 
above and beyond the rise in prices which are then conflated with the impact of the price 
shock.29 Moreover, the predominance of a 
shock-triggering rise in aggregate demand on 
aggregate output is clear only from a global 
perspective. If income growth is concentrated 
on a certain region, the positive effects on 
other economies depend on how much more is 
imported by this group of countries. Which of 
the indirect effects on an individual economy 
ultimately predominates is then likely to be de -
termined by both the extent of its external 
trade links and the share of its expenditure on 
energy. Furthermore, the relative weights of 
the opposing factors may change over time.30 
All things considered, it is striking that the di -
vergence in oil demand between the advanced 
economies, as one group of countries, and the 
emerging and developing countries, as an -
other, has been accompanied in the past few 
years by a significant growth lead on the part 
of the latter.31
Furthermore, it is often argued that the real 
economic effects of oil price hikes have de -
creased because the advanced economies’ oil 
intensity has declined sharply over the past 
decades. Indeed, to produce one unit of aggre -
gate output, the largest industrial economies 
United States, Japan and Germany needed only 
half as much oil in 2011 as they did in the early 
1980s. Compared with the early 1970s, the im -
provement in efficiency is even greater. How -Has the impact 
of oil price hikes on the real economy  decreased over 
time?

29 From the point of view of the oil producers, a cutback 
in the supply implies lower revenues than a higher demand 
that can generate the same price increase.
30 According to Kilian (2009), higher global demand 
boosts US real GDP in the short term. In time, however, the 
dampening effects of the oil price increase predominate, 
leading to the lagged appearance of recessionary effects.

ever, this intensity is only one factor determin -
ing the ultimately nominal burden on an econ -
omy. Consideration also has to be given to how 
much dearer oil has become in relation to ag -
gregate output. Last year, the (thus defined) 
real price of oil climbed to near the historical 
peaks of 2008 and the early 1980s or even 
higher. Taken together, the ratio of nominal ex -
penditure on oil to GDP (oil burden) in the 
United States and Germany in 2011, at 5% and 
2¾% respectively, matched the level of the 
mid-1970s. Only Japan performs better in his -
torical terms, at 3%, owing to the long-term 
appreciation of the yen. Even so, the record 
levels of 1979-80 were still clearly undershot. 
Nevertheless, the burden on the advanced 
economies as measured by GDP has increased 
considerably in the space of two years, ie by 
2 percentage points in the USA and by 
1 percentage point in both Japan and Ger -
many. Since the winter of 2011, US households 
have had to spend 3½% of their disposable in -
comes on fuels, compared with 2¼% at the 
beginning of 2009.
When looking at a country’s income outflows, 
it is also important to know the degree to 
which it is dependent on oil imports. Thanks to 
a considerable and expanding volume of do -
mestic oil production in the United States, the 
increase in the share of nominal oil imports in 
US GDP between 2009 and 2011, at 1 percent -
age point, was roughly the same as in Japan 
and Germany – despite the USA’s higher con -
sumption intensity. Another factor that needs 
to be considered is the backflow from abroad 
due to increased exports. In this connection, it 
has been argued that the dampening effects of 
an oil price hike on the real economy have pos -
sibly been weakened by a greater propensity to 
spend on the part of the oil-exporting coun -
tries.32 Another factor to be considered is that 
the group of sourcing countries itself has 
changed, sometimes considerably, over time. 
For example, the United States now imports a 
large part of its crude oil from Canada and 
Mexico, with which it already has close trade 
links. OPEC’s share in US oil imports has been reduced from a peak of 70% in the 1970s 
to 40% now. For Germany, it is, above all, Rus -
sia that has taken on a major role as a supplier. 
It is only Japan that is still largely dependent on 
imports from the OPEC countries. It is possible 
to verify the contribution that aggregate exter -
nal trade with the group of oil-exporting coun -
tries has made to nominal GDP growth in each 
of the largest advanced economies.33 Accord -
ing to the corresponding data, the value of US 
output growth in 2010-11 was retarded by 
¼ percentage point annually – the same as in 
the period from 2003 to 2007. In Japan, how -Dependence on

ever, the dampening effect has nearly trebled 
to ¾ percentage point, although the dip in Jap -
anese exports due to the natural disasters last 
year played a role in this. For Germany, the re -
tarding effect was no more than a moderate 
¼ percentage point, although, on an average 
of the period from 2003 to 2007, the German 
economy in fact experienced a positive stimu -
lus of almost the same size. It should be noted, 
however, that this rough calculation reflects all 
external trade with the defined group of coun -
tries and is not conditioned on an increase in 
the price of crude oil.
The global economy model NiGEM can also be 
used to estimate the aggregated macroeco -
nomic impact of the oil price hikes of the past 
few years. As the price shock occurred in sev -
eral stages rather than all at once and expect -
ations for the future also changed, the as -
sumed underlying oil price path is shifted in 
cumulative simulations from quarter to quarter, 
beginning in spring 2009. The outcome is that aggregate output in the advanced economies 
is sometimes lowered significantly. Real GDP up 
to the start of 2012 is 3% down on the original 
baseline in both the United States and Japan,34 
and still as much as 1¾% down in Germany. 
The dampening effect is considerable overall, 
especially in relation to the rather moderate 
pace of expansion – real US GDP actually accel -
erated by 6½% within these three years. Added 
to this is the fact that the impact by no means 
builds up evenly over time, but instead damp -
ens most strongly immediately after the price 
hike. Thus the simulations suggest that the 
macroeconomic growth rates in the USA and 
Japan were lowered by ½ percentage point in 
the first and second quarters of 2011. Although 
these simulations rest on a whole series of as -
sumptions (see the Annex on pages 48 and 
49), they illustrate that the oil price shocks of 
the past few years at least had the potential to 
leave a significant dent on the real economy. 
Specifically, the slowdown in US growth in the 
first half of 2011 appears to be explainable 
even without consideration of the implications 
of the natural disasters in Japan. On the other 
side, there is evidently no direct relationship 
with the recessions suffered by some European 
economies in late 2011 and early 2012.
What is striking is that the macroeconomic 
model simulations show the dampening effect 
of an oil price hike on real GDP growth peaking 
as soon as one to two quarters after the price 
increase. By contrast, empirical estimates, spe -
cifically for the US economy, suggest a time lag 
of three to four quarters (see box on pages 41 
to 43). Such an outcome is likely to be shaped 
very much by developments in 1974, 1980 and 
2008. In each of these instances, the state of 
the US economy deteriorated with a consider -
able time lag after a preceding oil price shock, 
but then did so abruptly. Uncertainty about the NiGEM simula-
tion suggests strong dampen-ing effect of 2010-11 oil price hikeSignificance of additional shocks for periods of se-vere macroeco-

persistence of the observed price increase 
might be one explanation for initially deferred 
adjustments. Moreover, the economy was 
probably still buoyed by its inherent momen -
tum and there thus had to be additional shocks 
to trigger a severe recession. Sales of automo -
biles are likely to have played a major part in 
this. Motor vehicles generally have fairly high 
acquisition costs and their purchase can easily 
be deferred. As a result, cutbacks in this area 
are often on a very large scale. On the part of 
the producers, such strong shifts in demand 
lead to matching adjustments of their invest -
ment in inventories, plant and equipment as 
well as in their employment – which pulls on 
the whole economy. Since real consumer 
spending on motor vehicles is also sensitive to 
increases in the cost of fuel, however, the oil 
price hikes may have weakened demand in ad -
vance sufficiently to make it susceptible to fur -
ther shocks, such as the sudden rise in uncer -
tainty and the drying-up of credit flows in the 
late summer and autumn of 2008.
One key reason why the US economy managed 
to buck the recessionary trends elsewhere in 
late 2011 and early 2012 is thus likely to be that 
a robust recovery had become established in 
the car market notwithstanding the fact that 
petrol was more costly. In this connection, it 
was perhaps also significant that the US gov -
ernment did not introduce extensive support 
measures for car sales in the preceding crisis.35 
Given the country’s by now very old vehicle 
fleet, the pent-up demand could not be put off 
any longer. In many European countries, by 
contrast, this reservoir had been tapped and 
exhausted by means of generous vehicle scrap -
page schemes back in 200936. Altogether, it 
was probably a combination of oil price hikes, 
more rigorous fiscal consolidation and private 
agents’ uncertainty that pushed some Euro -
pean economies into or to the edge of a fur -
ther recession. Although its direct macroeco -nomic impact is quite considerable, an oil price 
shock does not normally suffice on its own to 
bring about a cyclical downturn. However, it 
does make an economy vulnerable to add -
itional negative shocks, which then tip the bal -
ance. Such a role in paving the way to a reces -
sion would help to explain not only the ob -
served time lags but also the asymmetry that is 
often ascribed to the impact of oil price shocks 
on the real economy.
Summary
With the economic ascent of the emerging and 
developing countries, an era of cheap crude oil 
came to an end. This is likely to have damp -
ened aggregate potential output in the ad -
vanced economies. Moreover, crises in the oil 
market that open up the prospect of severe 
cyclical setbacks may have become more prob -
able. Given past changes, further shifts in oil 
market dynamics cannot be ruled out, say, 
owing to the exploitation of new deposits, a 
slowdown in economic growth in the emer -
ging market economies or a change in the de -
mand elasticities of these countries. It may be 
that, with the extraction of shale gas, such a 
major change in the oil market has already 
started. For the time being, however, house -
holds and enterprises in the advanced econ -
omies are left with no choice but to adjust their 
behaviour to the higher price of oil. While cen -
tral banks cannot – and should not – seek to

Annex
The macroeconomic impact of oil price 
hikes in NiGEM simulations
NiGEM, the macroeconomic model of the National 
Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), 
completely models the global economy in regional 
terms, but does not include a special module for the 
crude oil market. Therefore simulations can only be 
used to study the macroeconomic effects of an oil 
price change that occurs exogenously. This is similar 
to a price increase which could result from a con -
traction of the oil supply due to external events such 
as natural disasters, wars, embargoes or the exploit -
ation of monopolistic market power. However, in 
such situations the revenue and ultimately the im -
ports of oil-producing countries would be lower 
than in a NiGEM scenario with unchanged supply 
and a higher price. Consequently, only the macro -
economic impact of an oil price rise per se  can be 
derived, irrespective of its actual cause, which may 
trigger additional effects. As NiGEM is an estimated 
model, the simulations reflect the responses of econ -
omies as they occurred on average in the past. 
Hence the applicability of the results is based on the 
standard assumption that the previously observed 
interrelationships have not changed.
A key determinant of the macroeconomic impact of 
an increase in oil prices is its specified duration. A 
permanent price increase lastingly pushes aggregate 
output in oil-importing countries under the baseline. 
In the case of temporary price surges, not only is this 
long-term impact absent but the short-term damp -
ening effects are also smaller. This is probably mainly 
due to the forward-looking behaviour of players on 
the financial and labour markets who, judging the 
rise to be temporary, initially forgo making adjust -
ments. But the longer the assumed price increase 
persists, the closer the output losses come to those 
following a permanent price rise. As in economic 
reality the nature of an observed price change is 
generally likely to be unknown, and the evolution of 
oil prices can be interpreted as a sequence of persist -
ent shocks, permanent price rises are assumed 
below.
Although NiGEM has a (log-) linear construction, the 
impact of an increase in the crude oil price on the 
real economy is not solely dependent on its size. 
Owing to the importance of the share of oil or en -
ergy in total expenditure, the oil price’s initial level also determines the extent to which it depresses 
macroeconomic activity following an oil price rise. 
Thus in the eighth quarter of a simulation, in which 
the crude oil price is raised permanently by 10% 
from US$50, real US GDP falls ½% below the base -
line. However, in the case of an initial level of 
US$100 it dips by ¾%, and at a starting price of 
US$200 by as much as 1¼%. When absolute price 
rises are considered, the effect likewise varies across 
the initial level. Thus an increase in the oil price of 
US$10 reduces aggregate output in the USA in the 
eighth quarter by more than ¾% if the initial level is 
US$50. However, at an initial price level of US$200, 
the loss in output is a little more than ½%. That the 
percentage losses in macroeconomic activity decline 
in line with a rising level of the oil price is probably 
due to the fact that the fixed absolute price increase 
becomes less significant in the ratio. In this context, 
rules of thumb which assume that a given change in 
the oil price will have a given impact on GDP are to 
be viewed with caution. In addition, the clear rise in 
the share of costs of energy consumption seen in 
recent years casts doubt on the theory that the drag 
on the real economy of a (percentage) oil price hike 
has supposedly become weaker over time. With re -
gard to the direction of the assumed change in oil 
price, NiGEM posits symmetrical effects. It should be 
noted in this connection that aggregate output is 
homogeneous in the model; structural dislocations 
between sectors are not explicitly captured.
Keynesian factors mean that in NiGEM real GDP is 
determined by aggregate demand in the short term. 
In the long term, the level of macroeconomic activity 
is determined by a production function into which 
oil is directly factored as an input. If the (relative) oil 
price increases, demand for oil falls in relation to the 
other production factors. If the previously used input 
volumes were optimal, the potential output of the 
economy is reduced.37 In order to estimate the mag -
nitude of this effect, it makes sense to combine an 
oil price hike with a fixing of the economy’s oil inten -
sity and to compare the results with those of a simu -
lation excluding this additional supposition. It be -
comes clear that the losses in output resulting from 
a reduction in oil intensity are built up only slowly 
and relatively evenly, but their cumulative impact in Abstracting from

the medium to long term is of real relevance. In the 
short term, however, the negative effects predomin -
ate via the demand side. Even if energy is not expli -
citly included in the production function, an oil price 
hike would permanently reduce overall economic 
activity because the terms of trade of oil-consuming 
countries deteriorate, with corresponding negative 
repercussions for saving and investment decisions.38
If the basic theoretical structure of the individual 
country modules is the same, there are international 
discrepancies in the macroeconomic impact of an oil 
price rise on account of different manifestations of 
parameters and economic variables. A key factor in 
this connection is the economy’s oil intensity. The 
significantly higher use of fossil fuels in the USA, for 
example, could explain why an oil price increase 
squeezes US real GDP much more than, say, in Ger -
many. On the other hand, Japan also sustains per -
ceptible output losses despite its fairly low oil inten -
sity.39 In Italy and Spain the simulation indicates 
small losses in the short term which, however, rise 
considerably in the medium term. This may well owe 
something to price and wage rigidities, as well as 
further factors that have a bearing on an economy’s 
resilience.
Interest rate paths are derived endogenously in Ni -
GEM. Thus long-term interest rates are taken from 
expected future short-term rates, which are subject 
to the influence of monetary policy. This is not stipu -
lated exogenously but is determined within the 
model framework in accordance with prespecified 
rules. Forward-looking players on the financial and 
labour markets are familiar with these rules and 
align their expectations for relevant variables accord -
ingly, in particular with regard to inflation. In NiGEM 
simulations, (nominal) central bank interest rates 
generally rise in response to an oil price increase be -
cause actual and expected inflation accelerates. 
Therefore the (nominal) key interest rates must be 
raised in order to keep monetary policy neutral 
based on the customary rules. Simulations of an oil 
price increase across various rules show that the 
macroeconomic impact depends on the central 
bank’s objective. Central banks can dampen the ag -
gregate output losses if they are prepared to tolerate 
a stronger rise in the price level in return. Thus when 
applying a Taylor rule, according to which monetary 
policy reacts not only to deviations in (expected) in -
flation from a target level, the contraction in GDP is smaller than in situations in which the central bank 
solely stabilises the inflation rate or even the price 
level.International

39 One reason for this might be the comparatively small 
return flow of additional oil expenditure to Japan. This is 
suggested by an alternative simulation, in which an oil 
price hike is combined with the fixing of real domestic 
 demand in those countries and regions where domestic 
demand is otherwise raised by an oil price hike. Thus the 
dampening of Japanese GDP in this case is almost identical 
to the result of a normal simulation of an oil price increase, 
whereas US economic output is squeezed 1/10 percentage 
point more.Deutsche Bundesbank

The role of the “Basel interest rate shock” 
in the supervisory assessment of interest 
rate risks in the banking book
Interest rate risks in the banking book pose a material risk to many credit institutions. Despite their 
importance, these risks are not included in the minimum capital requirements under Pillar 1 of the 
Basel framework. According to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, this is primarily 
because of the major differences between banks in terms of the nature of the interest rate risks 
they face and their processes for measuring them.
Pillar 2 of the Basel framework specifies that appropriate processes must be established for man -
aging and monitoring interest rate risks in the banking book. Institutions must also include these 
risks in their internal capital adequacy assessments to ensure that they are backed by sufficient 
available financial resources at all times. Supervisors monitor the implementation of these require -
ments as part of the supervisory review process (SRP).
Supervisors use the “Basel interest rate shock” as an initial indicator for identifying institutions 
with comparatively high interest rate risks. This indicator is calculated for standardised scenarios 
on the basis of institutions’ internal methods and procedures, and allows supervisors to observe 
the interest rate risks taken both by individual institutions and across all institutions.
The German rules for calculating the interest rate shock were revised last year, chiefly because of 
a further harmonisation of European supervision. This article discusses the revised requirements, 
describes the pros and cons of the “Basel interest rate shock” as an indicator of interest rate risks 
in the banking book and outlines how it is used in the ongoing supervision of institutions in an 
environment of historically low interest rates and comparatively high market volatility.Deutsche Bundesbank

Sources and importance  
of interest rate risks  
in the banking book in credit 
institutions
Given the sensitivity of many types of banking 
business to interest rates, changes in market 
rates can have a strong impact on credit institu -
tions’ profitability and assets. Interest rate risks, 
particularly those in the banking book, are 
therefore an important type of risk for many 
institutions. One of their causes is the typical 
business structure of German banks and sav -
ings banks. While borrowers are often inter -
ested in loans with long interest rate lock-ins, 
depositors want access to their money at 
shorter notice. Credit institutions thus fulfil 
their economically desirable maturity trans -
formation function by converting short-term 
deposits into long-term loans.
For borrowers, long interest rate lock-ins have 
the advantage of keeping loan instalments 
constant and foreseeable regardless of any 
changes in the level of market rates. On the 
one hand, this has a positive effect on institu -
tions’ credit risk and helps to maintain the sta -
bility of the banking system. On the other, by 
taking on the maturity transformation function, 
institutions turn interest rate rises into a risk 
scenario for themselves, as the interest rate 
lock-in on loans is longer than that on deposits.
Institutions can actively manage interest rate 
risks using economic value or earnings-based 
approaches. Economic value approaches ob -
serve the effects of possible interest rate 
changes on the institution’s assets, whereas 
earnings-based approaches focus mainly on 
the effects on its earnings under commercial 
law. Where necessary, an institution can almost 
entirely eliminate interest rate risks in the bank -
ing book by using interest rate derivatives, such 
as interest rate swaps, which pass the interest 
rate risk through to the capital market. How -
ever, derivatives can also be used to synthetic -
ally build up or boost interest rate risks in order 
to make speculative gains. This is another pos -sible source of interest rate risks in the banking 
book.
Institutions use this procedure because it can 
enable them to generate proceeds from matur -
ity transformation based on the yield curve, 
which usually has a steep upward slope.1 As 
interest rates locked in for long periods are 
higher than those locked in for short ones, the 
maturity mismatch in refinancing initially makes 
a positive contribution to the institution’s earn -
ings: the interest expenditure stemming from 
short-term borrowing is lower than the interest 
income obtained after deducting the standard 
risk costs arising from the long-term invest -
ment. If the yield curve were to remain un -
changed, this would also occur in the subse -
quent periods. However, the yield curve can 
undergo various changes, such as parallel 
shifts, twists, butterflies or other movements, 
which have differing effects on an institution’s 
assets and profitability depending on the type 
and size of the movement. The danger is that 
the yield curve may undergo a lasting change 
which causes the interest rate speculation to 
generate losses. Given a maturity mismatch like 
that outlined above, interest rate increases 
have a negative impact; an upward parallel 
shift in the yield curve is therefore a relevant 
risk scenario for many institutions.
Despite the recent changes, the current yield 
curve on the German bond market is still com -
paratively steep, and it therefore appears lucra -
tive for institutions to take positive maturity 
transformation risks.2 At the same time, how -
ever, the curve shows historically low interest Tradition of long

rates across all maturities.3 Should the yield 
curve move in the direction of the average level 
of interest in the past, interest rates would rise 
across the entire curve. Given the historically 
low interest rates and the high market volatility, 
both institutions and supervisors must pay at -
tention to the risks associated with rising inter -
est rates and take appropriate steps to deal 
with them.
The supervisory framework 
for regulating interest rate 
risks in the banking book
Although the Basel Committee considers that 
interest rate risks in the banking book merit 
support from capital, they are omitted from the 
calculation of the regulatory minimum capital 
requirements under Pillar 1 of the Basel frame -
work. According to the Committee, this is be -
cause of the major differences between inter -
nationally active banks in terms of the nature 
of the interest rate risks they face and their pro -
cesses for measuring them.4 Another factor in 
this context is that positions where capital or 
interest rates are locked in for an indefinite 
period are also included in the measurement of 
interest rate risks in the banking book. These 
are positions such as sight or savings deposits 
whose legal maturity usually differs from its ac -
tual maturity. Savings deposits, for example, 
often have a notice period of three months, yet 
the money generally remains with the institu -
tion for longer than that and does not bear a 
three-month interest rate.
To be able to include these positions in risk 
measurement and management, assumptions 
have to be made about future interest rate ad -
justment behaviour. Differences in assumptions 
between institutions may be justified if interest 
adjustment behaviour is not comparable be -
cause of differences in their customer struc -
tures. The regulation of interest rate risks in the 
banking book under Pillar 2 of the Basel frame -
work opens up the possibility of applying institution-specific assumptions when calculat -
ing risk.
The risk management and monitoring pro -
cesses implemented by institutions for interest 
rate risks in the banking book must ensure that 
risks are adequately identified, measured, man -
aged, monitored and communicated. To 
achieve this, institutions must include all mater -
ial types of interest rate risk in risk measure -
ments and make suitable assumptions about 
positions where capital or interest rates are 
locked in for an indefinite period. The risk value 
must be calculated on the basis of different 
types of movements in the yield curve as, de -No minimum

pending on the composition of the institution’s 
portfolio, the size of the risk can vary according 
to the change in the yield curve assumed. If in -
stitutions carry out positive maturity transform -
ation, as they often do, the risk can reasonably 
be captured by an upward parallel shift in the 
yield curve. However, derivatives can be used 
to achieve a portfolio composition where paral -
lel shifts do not pose any risk but which leads, 
for example, to heightened sensitivity to twists 
in the yield curve.
Interest rate risks in the banking book must 
also be included in an institution’s internal cap -
ital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP), as it 
is a type of risk which can reasonably be sup -
ported by capital. The available financial re -
sources defined by the institution must cover 
the capital needs for interest rate risks in the 
banking book –  like those for other material 
risks – at all times.
Section 25a (1) of the German Banking Act 
(Kreditwesengesetz)  transposes these provi -
sions into German law. Circular 11/2010 (BA), 
entitled “Minimum requirements for risk man -
agement – MaRisk” (Mindestanforderungen an 
das Risikomanagement – MaRisk) , fleshes out 
these requirements. Each institution is permit -
ted to develop an approach that fits its own 
specific situation in order to fulfil the require -
ments, although this approach must be appro -
priate to the nature, scale, complexity and risk 
content of its business activities. Supervisors 
monitor the implementation of these require -
ments under the supervisory review process 
(SRP). The regular and ad hoc  on-site inspec -
tions at institutions are a fixed component of 
this oversight. These inspections are necessary 
to enable supervisors to assess the quality, con -
sistency and adequacy of institutions’ pro -
cesses.
Alongside the qualitative requirements, the Ba -
sel framework also stipulates the use of a 
supervisory indicator, the “Basel interest rate 
shock”, to identify institutions which take com -
paratively high interest rate risks in the banking book.5 Article 124 (5) of Directive 2006/48/EC 
(Banking Directive) enshrines this indicator in 
the EU’s supervisory requirements, which 
means that the EU member states are obliged 
to transpose it into national law. The European 
Banking Association (EBA) published a supple -
mentary paper specifying more detailed re -
quirements on calculating the indicator.6
Section 25a (1) sentence 7 of the Banking Act 
read in conjunction with section 24 (1) number 
14 of the Banking Act transpose the “Basel 
interest rate shock” into German law. They spe -
cify that institutions must report to the super -
visory authorities if the indicator exceeds a cer -
tain threshold. At the same time, the Federal 
Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt 
für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht , or BaFin) may 
stipulate the type of interest rate shock to use 
and the methodology to apply in the calcula -
tions. BaFin therefore published Circular 
11/2011 (BA), entitled “Interest rate risks in the 
banking book; calculating the impact of a sud -
den and unexpected change in interest rates 
(Zinsänderungsrisiken im Anlagebuch; Ermitt -
lung der Auswirkungen einer plötzlichen und 
unerwarteten Zinsänderung) , in November 
2011, which superseded Circular 7/2007 (BA). 
Among other provisions, the revised Circular 
envisages the use of much tougher supervisory 
interest rate scenarios in line with the pan-
European provisions and lays the foundations 
for the possibility of imposing a regulatory cap -
ital add-on for interest rate risks in the banking 
book. The following sections outline and ex -

Overview of the revised 
 provisions on the “Basel 
interest rate shock”
To obtain the “Basel interest rate shock” indica -
tor, institutions have to calculate the economic 
value effects of the two interest rate scenarios 
specified by supervisors. They must then calcu -
late the ratio of the economic value loss stem -
ming from the interest rate scenario which is 
least favourable for the institution to the insti -
tution’s regulatory own funds in order to ob -
tain the interest rate risk coefficient. This co -
efficient is the supervisory indicator for interest 
rate risk in the banking book.
Circular 11/2011 (BA) did not change the gen -
eral procedure for calculating the interest rate 
shock specified in the superseded version. 
However, it did significantly rework the specif -
ics in some areas. The table on page 56 pro -
vides an overview of the main provisions in the 
revised Circular and how they differ from the 
previous version.
The change with the greatest repercussions is 
the adjustment to the interest rate scenarios. 
The revised Circular stipulates that the interest 
rate scenarios must be conducted as parallel 
shifts of +200 basis points (corresponding to 
+2 percentage points) and -200 basis points 
(corresponding to -2 percentage points) in the 
yield curve. This change was made in light of 
the EBA’s plans to harmonise the scenarios 
across Europe and thus adapted the German 
requirements to supervisory practices in the 
other EU member states. These prescribed uni -
form scenarios have replaced the methodology 
previously applied in Germany, under which the 
supervisory authorities calculated the size of 
the parallel shift at regular intervals using a his -
torical simulation. Under this approach, the 
scenarios used in Germany from 2007 onwards 
were a parallel shift of +130 basis points (scen -
ario of rising interest rates) and a parallel shift 
of -190 basis points (scenario of falling interest 
rates) in the yield curve.Given many German credit institutions’ positive 
maturity transformation, the scenario of rising 
interest rates, which is now much more re -
strictive, is most relevant for them. However, it 
is important to bear in mind that the interest 
rate scenario used previously was dynamic. Any 
future recalculations could have entailed a sig -
nificant tightening of the scenario, and perhaps 
even a displacement of more than 200 basis 
points in the yield curve. By contrast, the inter -
est rate scenarios now prescribed by the super -
visory authorities are static.
The interest rate scenarios still involve a sudden 
and unexpected parallel shift in the yield curve, 
which means that the analysis is based on an 
immediate shift in the yield curve on the day of 
observation. This rules out including risk mitiga -
tion techniques or adjustment processes in the 
calculation of the economic value effects or in -
cluding possible effects arising from new busi -
ness. The focus on an economic value analysis 
means that the effects of interest rate changes 
under commercial law are omitted to improve 
comparability, making it a purely economical 
risk analysis.
The effects are calculated on the basis of all 
material banking book positions that carry 
interest rate risk.7 All on-balance sheet and off-
balance sheet transactions, including margin 
income, must, in principle, feed into the calcu -
lations. However, positions can be omitted for 
the sake of simplicity if they do not, in total, 
make a material contribution to interest rate 
risk and if calculating their contribution would 
require a disproportionate amount of time and 
effort.
Institutions have to calculate the economic 
value effects using their internal methods, pro -
cedures and parameterisations; these methods 
and procedures must comply with MaRisk. Cal -
culations must therefore be carried out in line The “Basel inter-
est rate shock” approach

stipulates that trading book positions which carry interest 
rate risk are also to be included in the calculations.Deutsche Bundesbank

with the requirements for adequately measur -
ing interest rate risks in the banking book. For 
positions in the banking book, the MaRisk re -
quirement to make suitable assumptions about 
positions where capital or interest rates are 
locked in for an indefinite period is particularly 
important.
This mainly affects positions such as savings de -
posits, for which the actual capital lock-in dif -
fers from the legal capital lock-in, as well as 
implied options in banking products. The latter 
are optional rights such as special redemption 
rights or special termination rights which are 
only exercised if and when bank clients so de -
cide. The interest rate risks stemming from 
these products must still be included when cal -
culating the “Basel interest rate shock” if they 
are material. Under MaRisk (BA), equity com -
ponents which are available for an unlimited 
period of time must not be included in these 
calculations in order to allow equity to carry 
out its function as a risk buffer. Institutions whose interest risk management is mainly 
earnings-based may use a simple fallback pro -
cedure, provided for in both the revised Circu -
lar and its predecessor. Under this procedure, 
institutions assign fixed maturity bands with 
pre-defined modified durations to positions 
that carry interest rate risk in order to calculate 
the economic value change.
Institutions must carry out these calculations at 
least once every quarter provided that this is 
permitted by the nature, scope, complexity and 
risk content of the interest rate risk position. 
However, if the interest rate risk position 
changes substantially, eg following completion 
of interest rate swaps or as a result of changes 
in the portfolio’s composition, prompt recalcu -
lation is required.
When institutions calculate the economic value 
effects stemming from the two supervisory 
interest rate scenarios, one scenario usually 
features an economic value gain, reflecting the Institutions must

prospect of additional income. The other scen -
ario usually results in an economic value loss 
and thus reflects the risk involved. The next 
step is for the institution to calculate the ratio 
of the two economic value changes computed 
in the scenarios to regulatory own funds. The 
interest rate risk coefficient is the least favour -
able of the two ratios for the institution and is 
calculated as follows:
Intere st rate ri sk coeﬃcien t
Regulator y ow n fundsMIN (Economic value change scena rio 1; Economic value change scena rio 2)
The interest rate risk coefficient acts as a super -
visory indicator for interest rate risks in the 
banking book under the prescribed scenarios. If 
an institution suffers an economic value loss of 
more than 20% of regulatory own funds, it is 
described as an “institution with elevated inter -
est rate risk”.
The revised Circular contains a fundamental 
overhaul of reporting requirements. While the 
previous Circular specified that only those insti -
tutions with an interest rate risk coefficient of 
more than 20% had to submit a report to 
supervisors, now all institutions are expected to 
submit quarterly reports (as at the end of each 
quarter). In future, institutions will only have to 
send a report to supervisors once if they over -
step the 20% threshold (as required under sec -
tion 24 (1) number 14 of the Banking Act), and this can also coincide with their quarterly re -
porting. Institutions are then no longer obliged 
to submit any additional reports to supervisors 
above and beyond the quarterly reports even if 
recalculation at a later date shows the institu -
tion to have an interest rate risk coefficient of 
more than 20%.
The role of the interest rate 
risk coefficient in the super -
visory assessment of interest 
rate risks in the banking 
book
The interest rate risk coefficient provides super -
visors with a standardised indicator for interest 
rate risk in the banking book. While this stand -
ardisation entails considerable advantages, it 
also holds certain disadvantages which must 
not be overlooked. One key advantage of this 
approach is that it makes interest rate risks in 
the banking book comparable by applying 
standardised scenarios and using regulatory 
own funds as the reference variable. This allows 
supervisors to observe an institution’s interest 
rate risk-taking over time. Furthermore, the 
interest rate risk coefficient can be used to 
draw comparisons between institutions, enab -
ling supervisors to conduct systematised obser -Calculation of

vations, analyses and evaluations of interest 
rate risks in the banking book.
Another advantage is the simplicity of the indi -
cator. Regulatory own funds, which institutions 
already have to calculate anyway, are used as 
the reference variable for calculating the coeffi -
cient. In addition, restricting the scenarios to 
parallel shifts means that only two of the many 
possible changes in the yield curve are simu -
lated. This and the use of internal methods and 
procedures mean that institutions have to ex -
pend only a small amount of time and effort on 
calculating the indicator. Aside from their in -
ternal scenarios, institutions only need to calcu -
late the effects of the two parallel shifts pre -
scribed by supervisors, as they are not obliged 
or indeed permitted to make any changes to 
the procedures and parameters used in their in -
ternal risk calculations when they compute the 
interest rate risk coefficient.
However, the decision not to impose detailed 
calculation requirements does entail certain 
drawbacks which supervisors must keep in 
mind when using the indicator. There is a dan -
ger, for instance, that the ways in which institu -
tions use the leeway they are allowed when 
calculating the indicator on the basis of their 
internal methods and procedures will differ. 
Supervisors must be particularly alert to signs of 
institutions using unsuitable procedures or pa -
rameterisations in their calculations. To address 
this danger, banking supervisors will continue 
to conduct regular on-site inspections at insti -
tutions to check whether their management of 
interest rate risk is in line with the supervisory 
minimum requirements for adequate risk man -
agement. Supervisory measures would be im -
posed on any institution using unsuitable pro -
cedures or parameterisations to manage inter -
est rate risks or to calculate the “Basel interest 
rate shock”.
Another disadvantage stems from the fact that 
only parallel shifts in the yield curve are simu -
lated. The danger is that the effects of other 
interest rate scenarios will not become appar -ent even though they may model an institu -
tion’s risk better than a parallel shift. It is even 
conceivable that an institution which is almost 
fully protected from the effects of a parallel 
shift could still suffer heavy losses if other inter -
est rate scenarios were to materialise. In cases 
such as these, the interest rate risk coefficient 
– given its limited focus – would indicate that 
interest rate risk in the banking book was low, 
masking the actual risk situation. Supervisory 
requirements therefore oblige institutions to 
take a more nuanced view of interest rate risks 
in their internal management and use different 
types of interest rate scenario to measure them. 
The use of regulatory own funds as a reference 
variable is also not without its issues, as this 
means creating a ratio of the economic value 
effects stemming from the scenarios to a bal -
ance sheet-oriented variable. These disadvan -
tages make the interest rate risk coefficient less 
meaningful, and supervisors must therefore 
take them into account when using it.
The overall risk situation is key to supervisors’ 
assessment of an institution. The interest rate 
risk coefficient can serve as an indicator for the 
size of interest rate risks in the banking book. 
However, supervisory actions cannot be based 
on this coefficient alone, as it does not enable 
supervisors to establish whether an institution’s 
interest rate risks in the banking book are in -
tolerably high. An institution might take high 
interest rate risks in the banking book, giving it 
a high interest rate risk coefficient and classifi -
cation as an “institution with elevated interest 
rate risk”, yet this would not be a problem if its 
other risks were very low, resulting in a toler -
able overall risk profile.
This is why BaFin and the Bundesbank opted 
for an integrated supervisory approach. Super -
visors apply the interest rate risk coefficient to 
assess the scope of an institution’s interest rate 
risks in the banking book, while also using the 
results of the “Basel interest rate shock” simula -

requirements when interest rate risks in the 
banking book are taken into account.
For this purpose, the economic value loss stem -
ming from the interest rate scenarios prescribed 
by supervisors is included in the calculation of 
regulatory capital requirements. If this check 
shows an institution’s capital to be insufficient 
in relation to its overall risk profile, BaFin will 
consider imposing a higher capital charge for 
interest rate risks in the banking book under 
section 10 (1b) number 1 of the Banking Act. 
Circular 11/2011 (BA) states that a higher cap -
ital charge can also be imposed on institutions 
whose interest rate risk coefficient is below the 
threshold of 20%.
Overshooting the threshold value will not, per 
se, have any supervisory repercussions, mean -
ing that an interest rate risk coefficient of more 
than 20% cannot be interpreted as a supervis -
ory ceiling on risk-taking which limits institu -
tions’ business potential. When taking interest 
rate risks, an institution’s primary consideration 
should be its ability to bear the risk rather than 
the size of a supervisory indicator. If an institu -
tion manages its interest rate risks appropri -
ately and its overall capital position is adequate 
according to the supervisory benchmark, there 
is no regulatory reason why elevated risk-taking 
in this area, reflected in an interest rate risk co -
efficient of more than 20%, should be forbid -
den. As at 31 December 2011, around 500 in -
stitutions were categorised as having “elevated 
interest rate risk”.
The revised Circular and the accompanying let -
ter to the banking industry emphasise this key 
point in several instances. Institutions which 
overstep the 20% mark are no longer termed 
“outliers” but “institutions with elevated inter -
est rate risk”. This reflects a change in how 
these institutions are viewed. The tougher 
scenario for rising interest rates means that 
many more institutions now have an interest 
rate risk coefficient of more than 20%. By 
changing the wording in the Circular, super -
visors have also given a clear verbal indication that overstepping the threshold no longer 
makes an institution an “outlier” in their eyes 
– and thus a deviation from the norm. More -
over, all institutions are expected to report 
regularly rather than just doing so when they 
exceed the 20% threshold. This means that all 
institutions receive equal treatment, regardless 
of whether their interest rate risk is elevated. 
Supervisors also take an integrated approach 
when establishing whether to impose a capital 
add-on for interest rate risks in the banking 
book pursuant to section 10 (1b) number 1 of 
the Banking Act, which means that taking 
interest rate risks per se  is not penalised.
Based on this overall analysis of risk, ie if inter -
est rate risks in the banking book are included 
in the calculation of regulatory capital require -
ments, as at 31 December 2011 around 20 of 
the institutions with “elevated interest rate risk” 
(or 1% of all credit institutions) were shown to 
have risks which would usually lead to further 
supervisory measures, extending to the impos -
ition of higher capital charges.

interest rate risk management so that it keeps 
risks to a tolerable level. This includes ensuring 
that there are sufficient available financial re -
sources for interest rate risks when assessing 
capital adequacy. Banking supervisors critically 
assess and monitor institutions’ underlying risk 
management processes, including through on-
site inspections.
As an indicator, the “Basel interest rate shock” 
plays an important role in assessing institutions’ 
interest rate risk-taking. However, supervisors 
are aware of the weaknesses in the indicator’s 
design and take these into account in their 
supervisory approach. Notably, the indicator is 
not used to limit interest rate risk-taking based 
purely on the figure it shows. Taking interest 
rate risks in the banking book is not problem -
atic per se  and therefore does not, in isolation, 
lead to supervisory measures. The Circular con -
sequently emphasises that the 20% threshold 
cannot be regarded as a supervisory ceiling on 
interest rate risk-taking in the banking book.
The only cause for concern would be if an insti -
tution’s interest rate risk-taking in the banking 
book were to give it an overly high overall risk 
profile in relation to its available capital. Section 
10 (1b) number 1 of the Banking Act provides 
supervisors with the legal grounds to penalise 
this kind of excessive risk-taking. Supervisors 
have deliberately opted for an integrated ap -
proach based on the “Basel interest rate shock” 
in their practical implementation of the regula -
tions. Under this approach, supervisors impose 
a capital add-on for interest rate risks in the 
banking book if an institution’s overall capital 
position is inadequate. Despite the tougher 
interest rate scenario, very few institutions are 
affected. Consequently, the provisions set out in the revised Circular do not jeopardise the 
banking sector’s desired maturity transform -
ation function.
With the MaRisk (BA) provisions on managing 
interest rate risk, the “Basel interest rate shock” 
indicator and their legal entitlement to penalise 
excessive risk-taking, supervisors have an ef -
fective toolkit for dealing with interest rate risks 
in the banking book. This allows them to ad -
equately address the negative impact of rising 
interest rates on institutions’ profitability and 
assets even in the current phase of low interest 
rates.
Interest rate risks are a risk type that can be ap -
propriately backed with regulatory own funds, 
which means that there are no conceptual rea -
sons why they should not be included in the 
minimum capital requirements under Pillar 1 of 
the Basel framework. The key challenge in 
terms of practical implementation is to deter -
mine supervisory parameters to take account 
of positions where capital or interest rates are 
locked in for an indefinite period. Further 
supervisory analyses will be needed to ensure 
that these positions are captured adequately. 
Looking ahead, however, it would be conceiv -
able to include interest rate risks in the banking 
book in Pillar 1 of the Basel framework if this 
were backed by an international consensus. 
The Basel Committee has already begun pre -
liminary work in this area. It intends to decide 
the extent of and the schedule for further ac -
tion in the course of 2012.8Institutions are

national banknotes still in circulation. 10The German contributions to the Euro- banknotes actually issued by the Bundesbank and the amount disclosed in
system’s monetary aggregates should on no account be interpreted as national accordance with the accounting regime chosen by the Eurosystem (see also footnote
monetary aggregates and are therefore not comparable with the erstwhile German 2 on banknote circulation in Table III.2).
