IndustryFollowing a sharp improvement at the begin-
ning of the third quarter, industrial businessactivity slackened somewhat in August. Afteradjustment for seasonal and working-dayvariations, new orders and output were bothslightly weaker than in July. In this context,the particular timing of the summer holidayshas to be taken into account, as, comparedwith the longer-term average, there wereonly relatively few school holidays in July anda large number of them in August. The sea-sonally and working-day-adjusted rates ofchange are therefore likely to have overstatedthe cyclical pattern somewhat in July andtended to have understated it in August.
The average volume of incoming orders in
July and August was 4
1/C252% up on the second
quarter. This represented an increase of 61/C252%
on the year in working-day-adjusted terms.
After the sharp increase in July, in which
some large-scale orders also played a part,there were fewer orders in August, in particu-lar from abroad. The strongest decline was inthe capital goods sector, which had expandedvery sharply in July. In July and August takentogether, new export orders were 6

likewise increased by 2%.
Industrial output declined by 13/C254% in August.
The annual growth rate slowed to 21/C254%. On
account of the holiday effects, the two-
month average is the more informative fig-ure. During that two-month period, produc-tion expanded by 1% compared with thesecond quarter and by 3% on the year. InAugust, capital goods producers recorded aparticularly marked decline following an in-crease in July. Output in the consumer goodsindustry was also lower than in July. Bycontrast, intermediate goods productionremained unchanged.
ConstructionIn construction, there was a continuation of
the slight improvement observed since mid-year. For instance, construction demand re-covered noticeably in July/August and was4% up on the year. The improvement inorder books in July took place mainly in publicroad construction. In August, there was an in-crease in orders placed by commercial cus-tomers, including the railways and the postoffice, among which were a number of large-scale contracts. Residential construction re-mained almost unchanged following a slightexpansion in July.
There was a further seasonally adjusted in-
crease in construction output in August. Theyear-on-year fall is smaller than before but re-mains large. Owing to the holiday effect, thecyclical increase might still have been some-what understated. On an average of the two-Economic conditions in Germany*

7month period of July and August, seasonally
adjusted construction output was 31/C254% high-
er than in the second quarter and 33/C254%
lower than in the same period last year.
Economy as a wholeThe available data – in particular, on develop-
ments in industry, construction, trade and theexternal sector – suggest that real gross do-mestic product (GDP) rose significantly in thethird quarter of 2005 after seasonal andworking-day adjustment. Thus, the cyclicalupturn in the German economy continued inthe summer months following the sidewaysmovement in the second quarter. Strongstimuli were generated by industry, whereproduction expanded perceptibly in the wakeof the surge in orders, especially from abroad.This was already reflected in a distinct rise inexports. However, net exports’ mathematicalcontribution to growth was dampened by im-ports, which likewise showed a marked in-crease. Fixed capital formation developedpositively. The pick-up in investment in ma-chinery and equipment seems to have con-tinued, and construction investment, too,may have been up on the second quarter. Bycontrast, consumer demand remained weakon the whole.
Labour marketAccording to the calculations of the Federal
Statistical Office, the seasonally adjustednumber of persons in work in Germany inAugust showed a further slight increase to38.99 million. This means that there were113,000 more persons in employment than ayear earlier. The increase in the third quarterwas due mainly to a rise in the number ofseasonal workers and, particularly in August,to a sizeable number of new job opportun-ities with a work-related benefit bonus(known as one-euro jobs).
According to the figures of the Federal Em-
ployment Agency, there was an increase inregistered unemployment in September.After adjustment for seasonal variations,4.84 million persons were officially registeredas unemployed in that month. However, theincrease was due solely to the special statisticaleffect caused by the delayed first-time inclu-sion in the statistics of recipients of un-employment benefit II registered with munici-palities having responsibility for the un-employed. As most of these municipalities arelocated in the west German federal states,the impact was felt more in western Germanythan in eastern Germany. Without this effect,there would have been a further slightdecline in unemployment. Consequently,the unemployment rate, as defined by theFederal Labour Office, went up to 11.7%.
According to the outcome of a telephone poll
carried out by the Federal Office of Statisticsbased on ILO criteria, the seasonally adjustednumber of unemployed persons rose to 3.98million in August. As a result, the unemploy-ment rate went up from 9.0% in July to9.3%. Much of this increase is likely to be re-lated to the relatively large number of holi-days in August, which delayed new recruit-ments.

8Prices
In September, the international energy mar-
kets were affected by the hurricanes in theGulf of Mexico. At the beginning of themonth, quotations for Brent crude oil hadclimbed to a new record high of US$67
1/C252per
barrel on the Rotterdam spot market. Thiswas followed by a new interim peak ofUS$65
3/C254in the wake of Hurricane Rita. At
the end of September, a barrel was beingquoted at US$63
1/C252. In early October, a fur-
ther easing was apparent. Petrol prices react-ed even more strongly to the hurricanes thancrude oil prices. The wholesale price of petrolquoted in Rotterdam rose from US$646 pertonne in August to US$704 per tonne in Sep-tember. In mid-October, it was quoted atUS$560.
Consumer price developments in September
were heavily influenced by energy prices andthe increase in tobacco tax. Tobacco cost6.1% more than a month before, thus con-tributing just under 0.2 percentage point toconsumer price inflation. As regards the en-ergy component, the prices of light heatingoil and fuels, which are now roughly 24
1/C252%
higher than last year, showed a particularlymarked rise.
Furthermore, clothing became rather more
expensive in month-on-month terms, whichmight have been related to the changeoverfrom the summer to autumn collection. How-ever, clothes were still 1.9% cheaper than inthe same period last year. By contrast, ser-vices prices fell somewhat in seasonally ad-justed terms, mainly on account of less ex-pensive package holidays.
On the whole, seasonally adjusted consumer
prices rose by 0.6% in September. The year-on-year rate of increase stood at 2.5%, com-pared with 1.9% in August. The HarmonisedIndex of Consumer Prices (HICP) was up by2.6% on the year.
Public finances
Indebtedness of central, state and
local government
According to the most recent notification of
1 September, in 2004 the deficit of generalgovernment (ie central, state and local gov-ernment plus the social security funds) asdefined by the Maastricht treaty amountedto381.2 billion, or 3.7% (2003: 4.1%) of
GDP . As consolidated indebtedness totalled31.451 trillion at the end of 2004, the gen-
eral government debt ratio was 1.6 percent-age points up on the year, reaching 66.4%.This overall picture confirms the huge needfor consolidation which central, state andlocal government in Germany are facing (seebox on page 9).
In August, the indebtedness of central, state
and local government decreased by 38.2 bil-
lion. This was due to redemptions by centralgovernment (- 311 billion), which, however,
were accompanied by an even larger reduc-tion in central government’s money marketdeposits (- 313.1 billion). With a decline of

9Critical budgetary situation calls for decisive consolidation
The situation of public finances in Germany is
extremely critical. In 2005 the general govern-ment deficit ratio will exceed 3% for the fourthyear in succession. Moreover, the deficits are pre-dominantly structural, rather than reflecting atemporarily unfavourable cyclical constellation.General government indebtedness rose from59.6% of GDP in 2001 to 66.4% of GDP in 2004,or by more than 3200 billion to almost 31.5 tril-
lion. It is continuing to increase sharply.
Even in an environment of historically low inter-
est rates, central government – but also manystate governments and a large number of localgovernments – are finding it very difficult tocomply with the national budgetary borrowingceilings, which are relatively generous anyway.In some cases this structural new borrowing farexceeds the statutory limits, which are coupledto the level of investment expenditure. The fiscalrules have often been complied with only in for-mal terms by repeatedly invoking the exceptionclause of a macroeconomic disturbance, and notleast by selling off assets or by making use of fur-ther problematic options. In the definition ofthe national accounts, net investment by central,state and local government is actually negative.The fiscal situation of the social security fundslikewise remains tight.
Following Germany’s continuous breaches of the
European limits for both the deficit and debtlevels since 2002 and the expiry of the originaldeadline for a correction of the excessive deficitin 2004, the Federal Government made a com-mitment to its European partner countries as re-cently as January this year to take all necessarymeasures to comply with the 3% limit in 2005. Itis doubtful whether the breach of the referencevalue now expected for 2005 owing to themarked dilution of the Stability and Growth Pactearlier this year can be justified by citing an un-expected macroeconomic downturn.
Germany should do everything possible to bring
the deficit back down below the reference valuein 2006. This is the only way to prevent prece-dents from being set so soon after the adoptionof the changes to the Stability and Growth Pactwhich would allow continuous breaches of thedeficit limits over many years without leading toany serious consequences. Germany’s responsi-bility in this respect is particularly important.
The Stability and Growth Pact requires deficits
to be cut by at least 0.5% of GDP per year (ad-justed for cyclical and temporary effects) until astructural close-to-balance budget position isreached. If Germany is to comply with this min-imum requirement, the growth of structural ex-penditure by central, state and local govern-ment needs to be kept around 2 percentagepoints below the rise in revenue for the foresee-able future.
At the same time, the necessary budgetary con-
solidation measures should be embedded in aconsistent reform agenda that covers the socialsecurity systems, too, and be accompanied byprudent fiscal planning, not least in order to re-gain the lost confidence of consumers and in-vestors alike. Growth-enhancing structural re-forms – particularly those raising labour marketflexibility – simultaneously need to promote em-ployment growth, thereby supporting a reduc-tion in the general government deficits.
Consolidating public finances is not an end in it-
self, but is urgently needed in order, inter alia ,
to avoid imposing an additional burden of highgovernment debt on future generations, whowill already have to bear a heavier load ensuingfrom demographic changes. This is the only wayto prevent excessive deficits from placing long-term constraints on economic growth and em-ployment and to widen fiscal policymakers’ ra-dius of action in the future. Fiscal discipline isnot least a key adjunct to a stability-orientedmonetary policy. Sound public finances are a cru-cial requirement for the European System ofCentral Banks to be able to ensure sustainedprice stability at relatively low interest rates.

capital market debt. The Bobl series 136 is-sued in August 2000, which still carried acoupon of 5%, was redeemed on schedule.By contrast, the volume outstanding of Fed-eral bonds (Bunds), in particular, increased.Taking market-smoothing operations into ac-count, their total amount outstanding rose by37.8 billion, 35.3 billion of which was ac-
counted for by the second topping-up of aten-year Bund issued in May with a yieldof 3.24%. Central government reduced itsmoney market debt by 34.6 billion. State gov-
ernment increased its indebtedness by 33.2
billion net, raising the funds required mainlythrough cash advances (+ 32.6 billion). Local
government’s total debt is likely to have in-creased slightly again in August. In the caseof those special funds not integrated intocentral government debt, the ERP SpecialFund redeemed bank loans in the amount of30.6 billion.
Central government borrowing
In September 2005, central government ex-
panded its indebtedness by a total of 36.3 bil-
lion. However, this was accompanied by anincrease in money market deposits on aroughly equal scale (+ 36.1 billion). Net bor-
rowing was concentrated mainly on themoney market (+ 34.6 billion). Although cen-
tral government tapped the capital marketfor320.5 billion gross, it concurrently re-
deemed liabilities amounting to 318.8 billion.
Most funds were obtained via Bobls (+ 36.3
billion). The initial issue of series 147 aloneraised 35.9 billion, with a yield of 2.57%. By
contrast, central government reduced thevolume outstanding of Federal Treasury notes(Sch/C228tze) by 34.1 billion. This was mainly due
to the redemption of a maturing note issuedin 2003 in the amount of 312 billion. The
new issue of a two-year Treasury note yielded37 billion for central government. While the
matured paper had carried a 2.5% coupon,the new issue’s yield of 2.2% enabled centralgovernment once again to refinance morecheaply. It also repaid bank loans to the valueto30.4 billion.
In the first three quarters of the year, centralgovernment indebtedness rose by 334.4 bil-
lion. As it took increasing recourse to themoney market, the share of money marketloans in the total amount of central govern-ment debt went up to more than 2%. Newborrowing was almost exclusively attributableNet borrowing in the market

Securities markets
Bond marketThe issue volume in the German bond market
declined to 382.8 billion in August after do-
mestic borrowers had issued bonds with amarket value of 3113.7 billion in July. After
deducting redemptions and changes in is-suers’ holdings of their own bonds and notes,the volume of domestic bonds outstandingfell by 34.6 billion, while securities worth
38.7 billion had been placed on the market in
the previous month. Foreign paper to theamount of 35.6 billion net was sold in Ger-
many, with the result that sales in the domes-tic bond market totalled 31.0 billion.
The main factors behind the net redemptionsof German bonds and notes were the lowlevel of new sales by credit institutions andlarge public sector redemption commitments.On balance, bank debt securities amountingto a mere 31.9 billion were issued. In August,
mainly debt securities of specialised credit in-stitutions were placed on the market ( 35.0
billion), whereas the volume of public Pfand-briefe outstanding declined (- 33.1 billion), as
it had in the previous month.
Federal and state governments reduced their
capital market debt by 35.9 billion net in
August. The volume of five-year Federalnotes (Bobls) outstanding went down by313.9 billion; this was due, in particular, to
the redemption of the first large-scale issue,the volume of which had been increasedtwice to generate higher liquidity in the sec-ondary market. Short-dated Treasury discountpaper (Bubills) were redeemed worth 30.3 bil-
lion net; on balance, state governmentsredeemed own debt securities to the sameamount. Ten-year “benchmark” Federalbonds (Bunds) were sold for 37.6 billion net,

bonds outstanding went up by 30.8 billion,
while two-year Federal Treasury notes
(Sch/C228tze) were sold for 30.4 billion net.
In August, non-financial enterprises reducedtheir debt in the German bond market by 30.6
billion. On balance, they redeemed only short-dated commercial paper amounting to 31.3
billion and issued corporate bonds with matur-ities of more than one year for 30.7 billion.
The high net redemptions of public-sectorbonds led to a shift in emphasis in investors’bond portfolios. Thus, while foreign investorspurchased private sector bonds worth 32.7
billion, they reduced their holdings of publicsector paper by 35.3 billion net. Domestic
non-banks, too, shifted from public bonds(-33.3 billion) to paper issued by private ( 32.1
billion) and foreign ( 31.8 billion) borrowers.
Only credit institutions added public debt se-curities totalling 32.8 billion net to their port-
folios. Furthermore, they bought foreignbonds amounting to 33.8 billion and sold
bank bonds for 33.9 billion.
Equity market
Issuing activity in the German equity market
remained weak in August with a marketvalue of 30.2 billion. Sales of foreign equities
reached 31.1 billion net. Shares were pur-
chased by domestic credit institutions ( 32.6

whereas German non-banks sold paperworth 32.3 billion on balance.
Mutual fund shares
In August, domestic mutual funds experi-
enced inflows of 34.0 billion, which was
down by half on the previous month. Institu-tional investors placed 32.2 billion in special-
ised funds, which amount went exclusively tomixed funds. Among the investment fundsopen to the general public, bond-based fundsand share-based funds recorded inflows offunds of 30.9 billion and 30.3 billion, respect-
ively. Investment fund shares were mostlypurchased by non-banks ( 35.4 billion), which

13Balance of payments
The German current account closed with a
surplus of 32.5 billion in August, 35.1 billion
below the previous month’s figure. A de-crease in the trade surplus and an increase inthe deficit on invisible current transactions,which comprise services, income and currenttransfers, contributed to the decline.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the foreign trade sur-plus in August went down by 32.9 billion on
the month to 311.6 billion. After adjustment
for seasonal variations, a 31 billion fall to
312
1/C252billion was recorded. The main reason
for this was the sharp rise in the value of im-ported goods, which rose 6% on the month,clearly exceeding that of exported goods(3
1/C252%). At 4%, nominal imports rose only
slightly more sharply than exports (31/C252%) in a
three-month comparison (June to Augusttaken together), with the increase in importvalues largely being attributable to price rises.
The deficit on invisible current transactions
went up to 37.5 billion in August, compared
with 35.6 billion in the previous month. This
increase can be put down mainly to a holi-day-related rise in the deficit on services, of32.1 billion to 35.7 billion. At the same time,
net cross-border income was somewhatlower in August ( 30.2 billion) than in July
(30.6 billion). By contrast, the deficit on cur-
rent transfers went down slightly, by 30.5 bil-
lion to 32.1 billion.
Cross-border portfolio investment led to netcapital exports in August ( 311.0 billion, com-Major items of the balance

months before). Acquisitions of securities byGerman portfolio investors amounting to310.1 billion were a major contributory factor
in this respect, whereas investments hadbeen liquidated in July on balance ( 31.7 bil-
lion). German investors focused on bondsand notes ( 34.0 billion) and mutual fund
shares ( 33.0 billion). They also acquired size-
able amounts of shares and money marketpaper ( 31.4 billion and 31.6 billion, respect-
ively). By contrast, non-residents sold Germansecurities overall ( 30.9 billion). In particular,
they reduced their holdings of public bonds(36.8 billion net) but added private bonds to
their portfolios ( 33.4 billion).
There were also net capital exports in thearea of direct investment ( 32.6 billion). The
main reason for this was that German parentcompanies provided their branches abroadwith new investment capital ( 32.0 billion).
Funds were likewise channelled into foreignsubsidiaries through internal group credittransactions ( 31.3 billion). Transactions by
foreign direct investors led to minor net out-flows of funds ( 30.2 billion). These can be at-
tributed to, among other things, the grantingof short-term financial loans to foreign parentcompanies.
In August, there were net inflows of 319.7
billion through the non-securitised credit
transactions of non-banks. At 314.4 billion
net, the financial operations of general gov-ernment played a prominent role in this re-spect, as they had done in July. In August,they recalled short-term funds that they hadtemporarily placed in foreign bank accountsin the previous month. Enterprises and indi-viduals repatriated funds amounting to 35.3
billion in the month under review. The credittransactions of the banking system resulted innet capital exports ( 37.5 billion) – essentially
reflecting all other balance of paymentstransactions. 313.6 billion was imported
throught the credit institutions’ cross-bordertransactions, whereas, at the Bundesbank, itwas particularly an increase in claims in con-nection with the gross payment systemTARGET that led to net capital exports worth321.1 billion.
The Bundesbank’s reserve assets fell in August– at transaction values – by 30.9 billion.

15Germany’s financial
linkage to the
EU budgetMedium-term planning for financing
the European Union between 2007and 2013 is to be finalised by 2006.However, the situation has been chan-ging significantly, not least becausethe economic strength of the majorityof the recently acceded countries is farbelow average.
The financial planning involves deci-
sions on the level and structure offuture expenditure and on the rulesgoverning how this expenditure is tobe financed. Each country’s net contri-bution ultimately depends on thefinancing rules and the expenditureagreed. Germany makes the largestfinancial contribution to the EU budgetin absolute terms. This amounted to38
1/C252billion in 2004. Particularly as a re-
sult of the insignificance of agriculturein Germany relative to the EU average,Germany is also one of the major netfinanciers of the EU budget in terms ofits economic performance as well.
This article examines Germany’s finan-
cial linkage to the EU budget. It startsby providing a brief overview of EU fi-nancial developments during the pastfew years and the plans for this yearand next before discussing the Euro-pean Commission’s proposals for themedium-term planning of EU finan-cing up to 2013.

16EU budget expenditure and receipts
How the EU’s political objectives are financed
at Community level is reflected in the EUbudget. On the expenditure side the agricul-tural subsidies and the assistance paymentsto the economically weaker regions predom-inate. On the receipts side the amount whichindividual member states contribute towardsthe financing of the budget is laid down, theamount levied being largely in line with thecorresponding national economic strength.A country’s net payer position is ultimatelyderived from the decision taken on receiptsand expenditure.
EU expenditureThe annual ceiling for EU budget expenditure
(payment appropriations) is currently 1.24%of the gross national income (GNI) of allmember states. The member states’ financialcontributions can be set and collected onlyup to this amount. In 2004 the total sum ac-tually spent amounted to 3100.1 billion,
which was 0.98% of GNI, as in previousyears, and therefore significantly less than theannual ceiling (see the table on page 17).While this represents a 10
1/C252% increase in ex-
penditure compared with that of 2003, mostof the increase was due to the EU enlarge-ment on 1 May 2004. Almost 7

Expenditure may be subdivided into threemain categories. Agriculture, despite a signifi-cant reduction from just over 49% in 2003 to43
1/C252% in 2004, continued to account for the
largest share of total EU expenditure ( 343.6
billion in 2004 compared with 344.4 billion in
2003). Rising expenditures on structural ac-tions were also significant (just over 34%, or334.2 billion compared with 328.5 billion a
year earlier). Of the structural actions in-cluded in the budget only 30.2 billion was
not taken up in 2004. In previous years thediscrepancy was much greater, with the resultthat the budgetary commitments up to theend of the planning period (2000 to 2006)are considerable. Consequently, the funds ini-tially budgeted for these areas might be ex-ceeded in 2005 and 2006 because the extentas a percentage of total expenditure

In 2004 Germany accounted for just over311
1/C252billion, or 111/C252%, of the EU’s expend-
iture. This means that there was virtually nochange in the share from the previous year.Just over 36 billion went into the agricultural
sector while approximately 34
1/C252billion was
used for structural actions. The European Re-gional Development Fund (ERDF) accountedfor just over half of this. Nearly one-thirdcame from the European Social Fund (ESF).The bulk of the structural funds (almost 70%)was paid out under the “Objective 1” meas-ures in which the federal states in easternGermany participate.

EU budget through borrowing is legally for-bidden. Planned receipts and expendituremust be completely matched. Any surplus isto be shown on the receipts side in the fol-lowing financial year. Any unforeseen ex-penditure requires an amendment to thebudget.
The United Kingdom receives a refund of
66% of its actual net contribution (excludingtraditional own resources) as a result of anagreement which was concluded in 1985 fol-lowing a European Council meeting held inFontainebleau in 1984 (and which has beenslightly modified over time). The contributionmade by the other member states to financethis correction is again based on their nationalGNI. Since 2001 Germany, the Netherlands,Austria and Sweden have been paying only25% of the resultant correction contributionswith all other member states paying a corres-pondingly larger amount.
5In absolute terms
the correction in 2004 meant just over 35 bil-
lion in financial relief to the United Kingdom.
Germany paid just over 320 billion to the EU
in 2004. Only just over 21/C252billion of this was
in the form of VAT-based own resource while
GNI-based own resource made up the bulk ofits contribution at almost 315 billion. These
two items were the equivalent of 8% of theGerman government’s tax revenue, fromwhich the amounts concerned were paid. Inabsolute terms, Germany’s contribution hasfluctuated sharply in the past few years. Bycontrast, its share of the EU’s total receiptshas continually declined – primarily as a resultof the gradual decrease in Germany’s totaleconomic weight within the EU. For example,Germany’s share of total own resource pay-ments fell from 31

3The reduction in VAT-based own resource and the sim-
ultaneous increase in GNI-based own resource that have
occurred since 2002 are the result of an agreement
reached by the European Council in March 1999 (Agenda
2000). This initially lowered the maximum levy rate for
VAT-based own resource from 1.0% to 0.75% (2002
and 2003) and then from 2004 to 0.5% of the harmon-
ised VAT assessment base.

ber states was based on only two-thirds of their GNI in2004 as their accession took place on 1 May 2004.

Net contribution
A country’s net position indicates the financial
advantage or disadvantage which it has vis-/C224-vis the EU budget. It is defined as the differ-ence between a country’s financial contribu-tions to the EU and the amount of funds thatcountry receives from the EU. Inaccuraciesarise here because not only some of the re-ceipts (such as customs duties) but also vari-ous types of expenditure (such as expenditureon administration) cannot be attributed tospecific member states with any certainty.
6
The EU also makes payments within theframework of its external actions which donot accrue to EU member states and there-fore do not represent allocatable expenditure.Nonetheless, the net contribution is an in-formative factor which plays an importantrole, especially in the political debate.
In 2004 Germany’s net contribution amount-
ed to approximately 38
1/C252billion after all allo-
catable payments had been taken into con-sideration. In absolute terms, Germany istherefore the largest net contributor to theEU. If expenditure on administration – whichis of little importance in the case of Germany– and traditional own resources are disregard-ed, however, Germany’s contributionamounted to 36 billion.
7On this basis Ger-
many was the fourth-largest net financialcontributor in 2004, with a contribution of0.3% of its GNI. The Netherlands (0.4%),Luxembourg (just under 0.4%) and Sweden(just over 0.3%) paid even larger contributions(see the explanatory notes on pp 20-21).

7These figures deviate from those of the European Com-
mission. The Commission regularly publishes operationalbudgetary balances which likewise eliminate expenditure
on administration and the traditional own resources from
its calculations. In addition, however, the remaining fi-
nancing contributions of the individual countries are ex-
trapolated in such a way that they match the total oper-
ational expenditure considered in the calculation. Conse-
quently, the net contributions are larger using this
method. The figure for Germany in 2004 is just over 7 bil-

20Deutsche BundesbankAnalysis of national net contributions to the EU budget
In 2004, Germany paid just over 0.9% of its gross natio-
nal income (GNI) into the EU budget, whereas it recei-ved just over 0.5% back. The resultant net contribution amounted to 0.4% of GNI. However, the informative value of these .  gures should be put in perspective. 
For example, particularly the traditional own resources (mainly customs duties) are regarded primarily as EU 
revenue. In addition, they are concentrated on a few 
countries with major ports, especially the Netherlands 
and Belgium (“Antwerp-Rotterdam effect”). In respect 
of administrative expenditure, the concentration is even 
heavier in Belgium and Luxembourg. This expenditure 
essentially covers remuneration for the services of those 
(of various nationalities) working there.If, on the receipts side, the traditional own resources 
and, on the expenditure side, the cost of administration are not distributed among the individual member states, there will be a net transfer of resources amounting to 0.3% of GNI in the case of Germany to the EU budget, 0.8% of which are contributions and just over 0.5% of GNI is money returned. This means that, in terms of economic strength, Germany was the fourth-largest net . nancier of the EU budget after the Netherlands, Lux-
embourg and Sweden. The largest net recipients, on the other hand, were the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia 
and Estonia as well as Greece and Portugal.

21paid over to the EU budget. Despite its slightly above-
average prosperity since EU enlargement, Germany transfers only average levels of VAT-based own resour-ces and GNI-based own resources to the EU. The reason for Germany’s relatively low level of transfers to the EU is that Germany, together with the Netherlands, Swe-den and Austria, pays only one-quarter of its normally payable contribution to .  nance the “British rebate”. 
Only Austria and the United Kingdom are not as heavily 
burdened, relatively speaking, by .  nancing the EU bud-
get with their own resources.
However, disproportionately little of the EU budget 
is spent on Germany. Only the United Kingdom, the 
Netherlands and Sweden receive even less funding as a 
percentage of GNI. By far the biggest recipients of EU 
funds, however, are the Baltic states as well as Greece 
and Portugal. It appears that the expenditure side 
determines the respective net payer position, whereas 
EU budget revenue is raised largely proportionally to national wealth in terms of GNI.
A further breakdown of the expenditure side illustrates 
clear differences. For example, of the old member states, 
the (in relative terms) largest recipients of agricultural 
subsidies and structural funds are still Greece, Portugal, 
Ireland and Spain. Ireland received 1.5% of its GNI in the 
form of agricultural subsidies in 2004 – surpassed only 
by Greece as the largest recipient. Even though Ireland 
is now one of the most prosperous of the EU member 
states in terms of GNI, it still receives far greater than the 
average amount of structural funds, albeit considerably 
less than the three southern European countries. 
The advantageous net payer position of the new mem-
ber states in 2004 is not so much a result of the tradi-
tional areas of EU budget expenditure but of the pre-
accession bridging aid granted to the accession countries 
(almost 1.1% of the reduced GNI of the ten accession 
countries).
Given the fact that the operating expenditure returned 
to Germany amounts to just over 0.5% of its GNI, Ger-
many ranks signi.  cantly below the EU average (almost 0.9%). This applies not only to the relatively insigni.  cant 
expenditure on internal policies but also to both agricul-tural expenditure (just under 0.3%, compared with an average of just over 0.4%) and the structural assistance provided primarily to eastern Germany (0.2%, compared with just over 0.3%). As a result of EU enlargement, these disparities are likely to continue to widen. Taking into account the transitional arrangements in the area of agriculture, an increasing proportion of the funds earmarked for this will be granted to the new mem-ber states. Furthermore, east German regions receiving funds will probably “suffer” from their relative closeness to the aid limit of 75% of GDP per inhabitant. However, this is a re.  ection of their relative prosperity, compared 
with many regions in the accession countries.

22The own resources paid over to the EU in-
creased by a total of just over 131/C252% while
total receipts, mainly as a result of the lowersurpluses in the previous year, increased atthe slower rate of just over 10
1/C252%. Overal ex-
penditure also increased by more than10
1/C252%. On the one hand, the new members
are achieving a below-average economic per-formance. In addition, their contributions tothe budget have been assessed on the basisof only two-thirds of their GNI. Hence, theyhave contributed only just over one-fourth tothe growth of EU member states’ contribu-tions. On the other hand, considerably great-er weight is attached to the agriculture sectorin the new member countries. However, theincrease in expenditure resulting from en-largement was considerably restricted by vir-tue of an agreement on transition regula-tions. For example, a ceiling of 322 billion
was set for structural aid to the new memberstates for the years between 2004 and 2006.Moreover, the farmers there received just25% of the usual direct payments in the firstyear (30% in 2005). The full amount of finan-cial support will not be paid until the end of atransitional period of ten years. These meas-ures meant that net transfers to the newmember states in 2004 were limited to a totalof approximately 33 billion.
EU budget in 2005 and 2006
The budget plan for the current year provides
for expenditure of 3106.2 billion, which, ac-
cording to the plans, is equal to 1.00% of theEU 25 GNI. Given an increase in total expend-iture of just over 6%, expenditure on agricul-ture and rural development is to be 12
1/C252%
more than in last year’s budget. This is duenot only to the increase in direct assistancefor the new member states but also to the ef-fects of the reform of the Common Agricul-tural Policy, according to which there is to bea particularly sharp rise in the funds availablefor developing the countryside. In the draft ofthe overall budget plan for the coming year
8
a further rise in expenditure on agriculture ofalmost 4
1/C252%t o 351.2 billion out of a total ex-
penditure volume of 3111.4 billion is
planned. The funds allowed for structural ac-tions in the 2005 budget plan were justunder 5
1/C252% below those in the previous year.
As a result of the possible increase in thefunds used under the existing budgetarycommitments, however, the payments initial-ly scheduled could be exceeded. In contrastto the plan for 2005, expenditure for struc-tural actions are again to be raised by 9
1/C252%
to335.5 billion in 2006.
An increase in Germany’s contributions to theEU is to be expected in 2005. In the federalbudget for 2005 payments of more than322 billion are earmarked (compared with a
sum of just over 320 billion which was paid
over in 2004). Twice in the current year, how-ever, the Commission has revised memberstate payments downwards. Particularly as aresult of the expected lower rate of growthfor Germany and the – albeit relatively small –budget surplus last year, the contributions tobe made by Germany will probably remainslightly below the level estimated in the fed-eral budget.

23Planning for the years 2007 to 2013
How Germany’s financial linkage to the EU
budget continues to develop will depend es-sentially on the decision taken on the new fi-nancial perspective for 2007 to 2013.
9The
European Commission issued a proposal onthis last year, which was based on the as-sumption that the EU would be further en-larged to 27 member states by the accessionof Bulgaria and Romania on 1 January 2007.This proposal continues to be the basis forthe negotiations on the financial perspectivebecause during the negotiation rounds thattook place under the Luxembourg presidencythe European Council was unable to reach anagreement on the compromise solutions thathad been proposed. Further negotiations onthe financial perspective are expected to takeplace in December at the earliest under theBritish presidency or else under the Austrianpresidency, which begins in January.
Although the European Commission pro-
poses that the payment appropriations whichhave to be met from the member states’ con-tributions must not exceed the current ceilingof 1.24% of GNI in any one year, it is likelythat they will come much closer to the ceilingthan they have done in previous years. Theplan is for average annual expenditure of1.14% of GNI. This means that the annualoutgoings proposed by the commission willbe far above the out-turns and plans up to2006 (2004: 0.98%, 2005: 1.00% and 2006:1.01%). This would mean that Germany, inline with its economic size, would have to payabout 33 billion per year more in contribu-
tions to the EU budget than it did in 2005.Expenditure on internal policies (citizenship ofthe union) and external actions (EU as aglobal partner) are to rise between 2007 and2013 by an annual average of almost 8
1/C252%
or just under 41/C252% respectively. This would
entail a rise of just under 2% to almost 3% inthe money spent under the heading “Citizen-ship” (immigration policy, cooperation withthe police and the judicial system, consumerprotection and cultural promotion).
10The
planned increase in expenditure share underthe heading “Europe as a global partner”,namely from 8
1/C252% to almost 10%, is a reflec-
tion of the efforts to intensify the CommonForeign and Security Policy. From a financialpoint of view, however, these headings are ofminor importance compared with the ear-marked expenditure for agriculture and struc-tural actions.
Common agricultural policyIn the new financial forecasts, expenditure on
the common agricultural policy (CAP), whichstill absorbs the lion’s share of the EU budget,is to form the largest section under the newheading “Conservation and management ofnatural resources”. In real terms, expenditureon CAP is to remain more or less unchanged
9The financial perspective is a multiannual financial
framework for EU expenditure. It is therefore of a binding
nature in that the expenditure ceilings for the individual
headings are to be observed. The financial perspective is
unanimously agreed by the European Parliament, the
Council and the Commission (“Interinstitutional Agree-
ment”). Detailed budgetary plans are to be approved for
each of the years in question.
10The change in the wording of the heading means that
in future the most important internal policies such astransport, environment, infrastructure, energy or industry
appear under heading 1 (Sustainable growth) and head-
ing 2 (Conservation and management of natural re-
sources). Expenditure in these fields is increasing dramat-
ically.Commission

24although the direct payments to farmers in
the new member states that are unrelated tooutput are to rise continually over the comingyears. This means that from 2007 the budget-ed share of expenditure on the agriculturalsector would decline to less than the share offunds spent on general structural actions,which is to be extended significantly.
This downturn in expenditure is based on the
Luxembourg resolutions on the reform of thecommon agricultural policy of June 2003.The key element of this is the decoupling ofdirect payments from production. Direct pay-ments for, say, the production of arable crops,beef and milk are no longer linked to produc-tion or to the number of animals but, instead,are included in a “single farm payment”.However, this decoupling is not complete,and the member states still have certainoptions in implementing the reform.
Another element of the reform is the linking
of direct payments to the observance of add-itional specifications (“cross-compliance”).The subsidy is paid only if the farmer main-tains certain minimum standards with respectto environmental protection, food and foddersafety standards, animal health and welfareand observes the provisions on “good agricul-tural practice” and ecological conditions. Thepurpose of the strengthened rural develop-ment policy
11(pillar 2) under the reformed
CAP is to help to achieve these objectives.Financial perspective for the EU budget, 2007 to 2013

25Furthermore, provision has been made to re-
direct funds from the areas of market policyand direct payments (pillar 1) to rural devel-opment (modulation).
The accentuated market orientation which is
enshrined in the Luxembourg resolutions andwhich is to be achieved by changing over todirect payments that are not linked to pro-duction and by reducing intervention pricescould help to weaken the misguided incen-tives to deploy excessive resources but with-out actually removing them.
12However, more
radical measures would be appropriate withinthe framework of a comprehensive reductionin subsidies even if international competitionis distorted by the subsidies of other coun-tries. A more open approach to the worldmarket would make it easier, not least for lessdeveloped countries, to gain market accessfor their agricultural produce.
Consequently, the expenditure which has
been shifted to the European level should notbe overlooked during the current debate inGermany on the desirability of reducing sub-sidies, especially as Germany, as the largestcontributor to the EU budget, helps to fi-nance to a considerable degree the sizeableagricultural expenditure in other countries, in-cluding some of the more prosperous. It istrue that with respect to repayments Ger-many, with repayments of just over 36 billion
in 2004, was in third place among the recipi-ent countries – in absolute terms – afterFrance ( 39.4 billion) and Spain ( 36.3 billion).
In terms of national GNI (0.28%), however,only two of the other “old” member states,namely the United Kingdom (0.23%) andLuxembourg (0.17%), received even less withregard to repaid contribution amounts.
13
Structural policy
While agricultural expenditure is expected to
stagnate in real terms up to 2013, the fundsearmarked for general structural actions (tobe known as “sustainable growth” in future)will increase sharply. Its share of the budget isto grow from 38
1/C252% in 2006 to 48%. The
funds planned for the subsection “competi-tiveness for growth and employment” (not-ably education and research promotion, andtrans-European networks) are to be increasedthreefold compared with the amount allo-cated in 2006, a decision which will be seennot least in connection with the Lisbon strat-egy. That would mean a rise in proportion tothe EU GNI from 0.08% to 0.21%. In thesubsection “Cohesion for growth and em-ployment” (formerly “Structure and cohesionfund”) 32
1/C252% more is to be spent in the com-
ing planning period, according to the com-mission, than at the end of the current plan-ning period (2006), and the correspondingshare of the EU GNI is to rise from 0.36% in2006 to 0.40% by 2013. The considerable in-crease in the funds for the structural policy isdue mainly to the increasing integration ofthe ten new member states and the expectedaccession of Bulgaria and Romania during the
12See OECD, Analysis of the 2003 CAP Reform, Paris
2004.
13The funds which are spent on agriculture and which
accrue to the member states that joined the EU in May2004 are, in terms of GNI, still below the share paid to
Germany except in the case of Latvia and Lithuania. This
is due to the transitional provisions, which stipulate that
the financial transfers vis-/C224-vis agriculture will be gradual-
ly increased to the full amount over a period of ten years.Distortions

26planning period, which will mean an accentu-
ation of the economic heterogeneity of themember states.
EU enlargement has meant a discernible de-
cline in the average per capita GNI. Even so, ifthe existing assistance criteria – especially theregional per capita GNI of less than 75% ofthe EU average – are applied, few of thepresent development regions will have toforgo payments from the structural fund.Only a relatively small number will probablyexceed the 75% threshold on statisticalgrounds alone. However, regions in Spain andeastern Germany, in particular, could be af-fected.
14Owing to EU enlargement, the total
number of Objective 1 areas has risen signifi-cantly. Moreover, transitional regulations areplanned which, on the one hand, restrict thelevel of subsidies to be paid to the recently ac-ceded countries on the grounds that they pre-sumably will have a limited absorption cap-ability and which, on the other hand, ensurethat those regions already enjoying assistancefunds can expect to do so in future. Accord-ingly, subsidies to the “old” member states,which are to continue receiving half of thefunds from the structural fund, will declineonly slightly in real terms.
The aim of the European structural policy is to
assist regions with below-average economicstrength and thereby foster convergencewithin the EU. As in all statutory promotionmeasures, however, there is also the dangerthat undesirable incentives are created andthat a transformation to a more efficientstructure (with respect to the allocation ofcapital and labour) is thereby impeded.Sometimes, too, there appears to be insuffi-cient consultation on the various Europeandevelopment objectives, and there is the dan-ger of assisting some regions several timesover. It therefore seems sensible to submit theEU’s regional policy to a critical examination,too.
Sharing the burden of fundingIn 1999 (Agenda 2000) the European Council
decided that the commission had to under-take a general review of the financing systemby 1 January 2006 and suggest suitablechanges. The commission based its proposal,which it submitted to the council in July2004, on the general principle of the 1984Fontainebleau agreement, which stated that“... any Member State sustaining a budgetaryburden which is excessive in relation to itsrelative prosperity may benefit from a correc-tion at the appropriate time.”
15From this, the
commission initially devised principal object-ives for a general correction mechanism: un-usually large net contributions by memberstates were to be avoided, the differences be-tween net contributors with comparablewealth were to be reduced and the volume ofincome redistribution under the correctionmechanism was to be limited to an accept-able level. The commission’s proposal for
14See European Commission, Third report on economic
and social cohesion, 2004. The federal government as-
sumes, however, that during the next assistance period
up to 2013 eastern Germany can expect to receive fur-
ther structural assistance as most of the regions con-
cerned will remain Objective 1 areas. See Bundestags-
Drucksache 15/5009 of 4 March 2005.

27modifying the own resources system, which
will probably continue to serve as a negotiat-ing basis, essentially consists of the followingelements:
– Threshold for budgetary deficits: the cor-
rection mechanism is to be applied when-
ever a member state’s net payment ex-ceeds a still unspecified percentage of GNI(eg 0.35%).
– Partial refund: correction consists of
refunding part (eg two-thirds) of theamount exceeding the threshold.
– Limit for the total refund volume: if the
sum of all corrections (eg 37.5 billion) ex-
ceeds the total predetermined volume,the refund rate is reduced accordingly.– Financing: the sum of all corrections is fi-
nanced by all member states (includingthose eligible for relief) in proportion totheir relative prosperity as measured byGNI.
The commission has illustrated the effects ofits proposal by offering the aforementionedvalues as examples and shown the conse-quent shifts in the level of burdens to be ex-pected between member states. The calcula-tions are based on the commission’s pro-posals for the new financial perspective. Theresultant total refund volume ( 37.5 billion)
would therefore be roughly equivalent to thecorrection amount which the United King-dom would receive if the present correctionmechanism were continued ( 37 billion in
2013). If the net budgetary balances resulting€ billion

those which would arise by retaining theexisting system, the United Kingdom wouldbe the member state that would lose most.Although its refund would decline from justover 35 billion in 2004 to an estimate of just
over 32 billion, it would still receive the larg-
est compensation amount. Almost all othermember states would be financially better offthan before. Germany, for example, could ex-pect to receive relief amounting to 0.06% ofGNI on average between 2008 and 2013,which is equivalent to a sum of just under31
1/C252billion. Moreover, the balances of the
largest net contributors would converge.However, the mechanism does not necessarilyresult in the level of the net contributionsbeing based on economic strength.The commission believes that the system tocompensate for excessive net budgetary bal-ances should be introduced as early as 2007.To accommodate the financial interests of theUnited Kingdom it has suggested transitionalregulations. In addition to the compensationamount calculated in accordance with thenew mechanism, the United Kingdom is to begranted lump-sum payments of 35 billion be-
tween 2008 and 2011.
16In order to limit the
associated increase in the overall financingcosts the partial refund for the other net con-tributors is to be gradually raised from (initial-ly) only 33% to the targeted level of 66% in2011. Only the refund level for the UnitedKingdom would be set at 66% throughoutthis period.
Conclusion
Together with those of other net contributors
the German government has advocated, inprinciple, an expenditure ceiling of no morethan 1.0% of EU GNI. The sum of the com-mitment appropriations proposed by thecommission over the entire planning periodwould then amount (at 2004 prices) to just3815 billion instead of the previously esti-
mated 3929 billion. Negotiations broke down

29is reformed and (b) the unilateral relief en-
joyed by the United Kingdom is renegotiated.
The debate on EU finances has essentially
raised questions about the extent of central-isation, redistribution within the EuropeanUnion and the tasks to be performed at theEuropean level. The principle of subsidiarityenshrined in Article 5 of the EC Treaty argues– in cases of doubt – in favour of the fulfil-ment of tasks at national level and thereforeadvocates restricting the volume of the EUbudget. The objective of strictly reviewing in-dividual elements of government expenditureand, in particular, of consistently limiting sub-sidies in order, ultimately, to achieve a consoli-dation of public finances and a reduction inthe persistently large contribution burdenwithin the EU should also apply to theEU budget.
The planned curb on agricultural subsidies is
a step in the right direction. However, furtherreforms in this area are appropriate. Makingthe agricultural sector more open to inter-national competition would be a case inpoint. One measure that could lead to a gen-eral reduction in subsidies and further limitthe extent of the EU budget could possibly befinanced jointly by the member states in aregulated manner. Germany would be likelyto have its financial burden eased by such areduction.In structural policy, too, greater attentionshould be paid to a transparent and efficientuse of resources. With regard to supportingthe catching-up process in the economicallyweaker member states, a strengthening of in-vestment spending is especially important.Nevertheless, in this area, too, attention hasto be paid to the risk of promoting ultimatelyuneconomic structures and of resources sim-ply being rechannelled. It is also typically thecase that it is very difficult to reduce subsidiesonce they have been granted. A strongerfocus on assistance for member states withgenerally weaker economies might improvethe targeting of resources since the othercountries would no longer take the indirectcourse of financing via the EU budget. In thecase of Germany, a greater concentration ofEU structural funds resources would mainlyaffect the eastern regions. This would be ac-companied by lower Federal governmentpayments to the EU budget.
The Commission’s proposal for a general cor-
rection mechanism for excessive budgetarydeficits could help to prevent exceptionallylarge net contributions. However, this will notensure that the level of such contributions isgeared to economic performance. On thewhole, it is welcome that this proposal repre-sents an attempt to replace the present indi-vidual solutions with a single financing regu-lation.

31German enterprises’
profitability and
financing – an analysis
b a s e do nan e wd a t a s e tThe Bundesbank’s annual analysis of
German firms’ profitability and finan-cing, which hitherto had to rely on bal-ance sheet data from its refinancingbusiness, is now based on a new, widerdataset. The data pool that is nowavailable was devised and constructedby the Bundesbank in the past fewyears after the number of corporateannual financial statements being sub-mitted to it for scrutiny plummetedfollowing the launch of Europeanmonetary union and the associated dis-continuation of the Bank’s rediscountbusiness.
The evaluation of the new statistics
shows that German firms’ pre-taxprofits improved slightly in 2003, up towhen extrapolated results are avail-able, after being strained heavily in2002. However, their gross return onturnover was lower than during theperiod 1998 to 2001. The financingsituation of German enterprises de-veloped rather positively. Overall, theenterprises managed to improve theirbalance sheet structures significantly.This article describes and explains theunderlying factors and relationships.

New dataset

32tem, the new data pool contains financial
statements from other agencies which evalu-ate firms’ annual accounts such as commer-cial banks and credit insurers (see methodo-logical explanations on page 45 ff). Anotherkey difference compared with earlier analy-ses, which for statistical reasons were con-fined to the production, trade and transportsectors, is that part of the services sectormore narrowly defined – specifically “com-puter and related activities”, “research anddevelopment” and “other business activi-ties” – can now be captured by the extrapo-lated results. Conversely, the electricity, gasand water supply sector is now no longer in-cluded in the dataset analysed here owing tothe particular extrapolation problems in sec-tors with a preponderance of large-scale en-terprises. For the same reason the subsectors“transport via railways” and “post and tele-communications” continue to be excludedfrom the extrapolation.
All in all, the results based on the Bundes-
bank’s corporate balance sheet statistics nowcover a significantly larger part of the non-financial enterprise sector than was previouslythe case. Thus the sectors as now recordedgenerated almost three-quarters of the totalgross value added of the business sector in2003, compared with around 60% using theold dataset. It should be noted, however, thatowing to the methodological changes the fig-ures published in this article are not fully com-parable with those of previous analyses.Cyclical setting
For the German economy 2003 was another
difficult year. The entrenched stagnation ofaggregate output which began in the secondquarter of 2001 led to a noticeable decline inreal GDP in the first half of 2003 after season-al and calendar adjustment. Although theGerman economy began to recover in thesecond half of 2003, on an annual averageoutput was
1/C254% below the level of 2002,
which in turn was only a little higher thanthat in 2001. Hence in 2003 actual output inGermany once again fell distinctly short ofpotential output, which expanded marginally,so that the output gap widened further. Theweak aggregate outturn is attested by thefact that the gross real value added of thesectors included in the corporate balancesheet statistics stagnated in 2003.
The slowdown in overall economic activity in
2003 was largely attributable to waning im-pulses from the external sector. Real exports,which in 2002 had expanded by over 4%, in-creased by only 2
1/C252%. This was partly due to
the fact that in the first half of 2003 worldtrade was still depressed by the effect of theIraq war and the consequences of the respira-tory disease SARS, which created uncertaintyin eastern Asia, in particular. In the secondhalf of 2003, however, the global economypicked up speed again. While this was reflect-ed in a revival of German exports, they in-creased more slowly than the sales marketsowing above all to the sustained appreciationof the euro against the US dollar. At the sametime imports grew twice as fast as a result ofexchange rate effects and a slowdown in de-Persistent weak

33stocking. In the context of national account-
ing, the reduction in the real contribution ofthe external sector stunted GDP growth by
3/C254
percentage point.
Domestic demand grew by1/C252% in 2003 com-
pared with a cumulative fall of 21/C252% in the
two preceding years. However, this rise was
due very largely to the aforementioned slow-down of destocking. Investment in new ma-chinery and equipment and in buildings fellfurther. In addition, households’ propensity topurchase remained dulled, even though realprivate consumption did not decline, as it hadin 2002, and instead increased marginally.The weak consumer demand was mainly dueto the subdued development of incomes.Thus net wages and salaries declined by
3/C254%
owing to the sharper fall in employment andthe renewed rise in social security contribu-tions. Another factor was that households in-creased their saving ratio by
1/C252percentage
point to 101/C254% of their disposable incomes
owing to the considerable uncertainty con-cerning the course of macroeconomic devel-opment and the worsening of the outlook inthe labour market.
Wage policy, which has a major bearing on
firms’ costs, was in keeping with the difficultoverall economic climate in 2003. In the ag-gregate, the new pay rates were lower thanin 2002, with the result that average nationalnegotiated wage and salary levels on anhourly basis rose by 2%, which was over
1/C252percentage point less than in 2002. More-
over, the increase in actual earnings of 11/C254%
was well below the rise in negotiated payrates. However, owing to slower productivitygrowth, which was at least in part cyclicallyinduced, aggregate unit labour costs went upby
1/C252%. The compensation of employees,
which encompasses gross wages and salariesas well as employers’ social contributions,was only a little (+
1/C254%) higher in 2003 than it
had been in 2002, whereas entrepreneurialand factor income again rose distinctly by3
1/C252%. Consequently, the overall profit ratio
– as defined in the national accounts – in-creased further and at 29
1/C254% of national in-
come reached its highest share since 1998.
Profitability
The muted momentum of business activity
throughout 2003 was duly reflected in cor-porate profit and loss accounts. The annualresult before taxes on income was only
1/C252%
above the level in 2002, when it had declinedby 6
1/C252%.1It was thus again below the peak
figure reached in 2001. At first sight these re-sults seem not to match the figures containedin the national accounts on the earnings ofnon-financial corporations.
2According to the
latter, corporate profits grew by over 11/C252%i n
2002 but fell by 5% in 2003. However, thetwo sets of figures are not directly compar-able. Firstly, the profit as defined in the na-tional accounts does not contain the results
1The annual result corresponds to the annual profit ac-
cording to the German Commercial Code (HGB) before
profit or loss transfers and provides a better indication of
the profits generated by the enterprises analysed in this
article. This is because numerous firms are associated
through profit transfer agreements with enterprises
which are not included in the corporate balance sheet
statistics (eg holding companies) and to which their
profits/losses are transferred.

Yetfirms’ income statements contained largevaluation losses in the years 2001 to 2002, inparticular, which significantly affected thepre-tax result. Major factors in this connec-tion were the share price slide duringthis period, the depreciation of the US dollarand the need in many cases to revalue thereal estate portfolio. In 2003 the valuationlosses were not as high as in the previous twoyears.
The profitability trend in 2003 indicated by
the corporate balance sheet statistics appearsin a somewhat better light if the further con-traction of business volume is taken into ac-count. The gross return on turnover, ie theratio of the annual result before taxes on in-come to enterprises’ turnover, remained atthe relatively high level of 3
1/C252%, although in
the years 1998 to 2001 it had been1/C254per-
centage point higher. It should be noted inthis context, however, that the number ofcorporate insolvencies recorded a big jump atthe beginning of the current decade. Thismeans that many firms with predominantlypoor earnings had to close down and hencedropped out of the Financial Statements DataPool.
The annual result after taxes in 2003 re-
mained at the depressed level of 2002 andconsequently developed a little worse thanthe pre-tax result. The reason for this is thattaxes on income and earnings increased by2% and thus by more than the gross annualresult. This undoubtedly owed something tothe temporary raising of the corporation taxrate at the beginning of 2003 from 25% to26.5% in order to finance the damagecaused by flooding in eastern Germany, inparticular. Another consequence of this isthat the ratio of taxes on income to the grossannual result rose by nearly
1/C252percentage
point to over 221/C252%. But the tax ratio thus
calculated was still 3 percentage pointsbelow the level in 2000, the last year beforethe corporate tax reform came into force.Even so, the net return on turnover in 2003,at 2
3/C254%, was no lower than in 2000 and
2001 when profitability was robust and wasonly a little below the peak figure reached in1998. However, this ratio is merely suitablefor depicting the development of earningsafter taxes. Its level is overstated to the extentthat taxes on earnings include, besides tradeearnings tax, only corporation tax (includingthe solidarity surcharge) paid by corporations.The annual results of non-corporations (part-nerships and sole proprietorships), by con-trast, are taxed as part of the entrepreneurs’private income and so their income tax pay-ments do not appear in these firms’ profitand loss accounts.
The aggregated figures on corporate profit-
ability mask some very disparate develop-ments in the individual sectors. For example,the pre-tax annual result of manufacturingfirms, which traditionally constitute the back-bone of national economic activity, fell sharp-ly again in 2003 by 9
1/C252%. This means it was
one-fifth lower than the peak reached in2000. The gross return on turnover deterior-ated by 1 percentage point to 3
3/C254%. The on-

35was due above all to the especially difficult
national and international market situation inthat year, when the profit margins of export-ers were additionally squeezed by the appre-ciation of the euro. On top of that, theprofit performance was dented by a declinein earnings from non-operating business.Within manufacturing, particularly producersof motor vehicles, machinery and equipment,basic metals and fabricated metal products,chemicals and textiles sustained a sharpdrop in earnings. By contrast, other indus-tries such as the manufacture of rubber andplastic products improved on their prior-yearresult.
In the construction sector the gross annual re-
sult improved by nearly one-tenth in the yearunder review, after having declined by one-fifth altogether in the two preceding years.This was assisted by the fact that the multi-year contracting trend in construction outputslowed somewhat in 2003. This was due inpart to speculation about a possible abolitionor reduction of the home buyers’ grant,which temporarily stimulated construction ac-tivities in the second half of the year, in par-ticular. This had already been signalled by theincrease in building permits granted aroundthe turn of 2002/2003. Another cause of theimproved profitability was the cost relief af-fecting virtually all expense items. A furtherfactor was that the incidence of insolvenciesin the construction sector was relatively highin 2003, too, with the result that many firmswith poor earnings dropped out of the datasample. Thus 271 of the 10,000 constructionenterprises were involved in insolvency pro-ceedings compared with 158 insolvencies in

The gross profits of enterprises in the whole-sale/retail trade sector likewise rose (by 8%)against the background of shrinking businessactivity. This pushed up the traditionally lowgross return on turnover further to 2
1/C252%; in
1997, ie at the start of the new data series,this ratio had stood at 2%. The improvementin 2003 was due to a lighter burden in somemajor expense items. The positive develop-ment of earnings was recorded in bothwholesale trade and the retail trade sector. Inthe transport sector, which as defined hereexcludes both railways and communication,the gross result picked up by 2
1/C252%, after hav-
ing already increased strongly in 2002. Thecorresponding return on turnover amountedto almost 2
1/C252%, which was a rather high
value in a longer-term comparison.
The providers of business-related services,
which are included in the new corporate bal-ance sheet statistics for the first time,emerged from the most recent sluggish cyc-lical phase more robustly than any of theother sectors considered here. The grossprofit, which had decreased by one-eighth in2002, expanded by more than one-fifth in2003. It is notable that the improvement inearnings was achieved despite a decline inturnover. This suggests a remarkable ability toreduce costs. The gross return on turnoverimproved over the year by 1

the highest figure of all the sectors. But thisEnterprises’ income statement*

Income and costs in detail
The total output – which, in addition to turn-
over, also includes changes in firms’ stocks oftheir own products and other capitalised pro-duction – of the sectors analysed in this articlefell again in 2003 owing to the cyclical slow-down in Germany by
1/C254%, compared with
11/C252% in 2002. In real terms the decline in
total output was probably only a little greaterin 2003. Thus while the domestic prices of in-dustrial products went up by
1/C254%, prices
went down by roughly the same amount inexport business. The level of constructionprices remained virtually unchanged. The re-tail trade price index edged up by just
1/C254%i n
2003 and wholesale prices increased bymerely
1/C252%. No data are available on produ-
cer price developments in the transport sectorand in the newly included business servicessector. It is noticeable that total output con-tracted in virtually all sectors; only in themanufacturing and retail trade sectors didbusiness activity expand slightly.
Interest received and other income (which in-
cludes income from participating interests,other operating income and extraordinary in-come) declined far more sharply than totaloutput in 2003. Interest received, which in2002 had slumped by no less than 12
1/C252%,
decreased by a further 2%. This was chieflyattributable to a further fall in market interestrates. By contrast, firms’ annual averagestock of interest-earning assets grew by 5%.The average rate of interest on these assetsof barely 3% was the lowest level since thestart of the series in 1998, when it had stoodat 3
1/C252%. Other income, which had gone up
appreciably in the preceding years, not leaston account of the extensive liquidation ofhidden reserves, declined by 7
1/C252% in 2003.
Total income was1/C252% down on 2002.
Total costs before taxes on earnings de-creased a little more strongly than total in-come, creating scope for the small rise in theannual gross result explained above. Themoderate development of costs was broadlybased in that all major cost items apart fromoperating taxes showed a downward ten-dency in 2003.
The cost of inputs fell by
1/C254% in line with
total output. Consequently, its ratio to total
output remained unchanged at just over61
1/C252%. As import prices fell again by over
2% in 2003, the cost of materials mightlogically have been expected to decrease byan even greater margin as past experiencehas shown that many inputs used in industryand in the retail trade sector are imported.On closer inspection it turns out, however,that only the prices of imported finishedgoods showed a marked decline – not leastowing to the appreciation of the euro –whereas the prices of imported raw materialsand semi-finished products tended to in-crease and those of imported intermediategoods remained more or less the same. In thecase of raw materials, in particular, the risingquotations (in US$) in the international com-modity markets probably outweighed theTotal output

38cost-dampening effect of the euro’s appreci-
ation.
A greater contribution to alleviating the bur-
den of overall corporate costs in 2003 wasmade by labour costs, which fell by 1
1/C254%o n
the year. Their ratio to total output decreasedmarginally to 18
1/C252%. On the one hand, the
reduction in labour costs was due to theaforementioned moderate growth of negoti-ated pay rates and to the even more moder-ate increase in actual earnings. On the otherhand, job cuts also helped to push down la-bour costs. In the sectors analysed in this art-icle, the number of employees went down byover 2% in 2003. The construction sector re-corded the biggest fall in employment (6%),followed by manufacturing (3%) and trade(2%). The number of persons employed inthe transport sector remained virtually un-changed. New jobs were created solely in thebusiness services sector. A factor which tend-ed to push costs up, on the other hand, wasthe rise of 0.4 percentage point in the contri-bution rate to the statutory pension insurancescheme to 19.5% at the beginning of 2003,of which employers had to pay half. At thesame time the income ceiling for the assess-ment of contributions to the statutory pen-sion and unemployment insurance schemeswas raised significantly.
Another factor helping to stabilise corporate
earnings was the further marked decrease indepreciation charges, which in 2003 came to2
3/C254%. The depreciation of tangible and in-
tangible assets, which make up more thannine-tenths of total depreciation costs, de-creased by
1/C252% and other depreciation by16%. In the case of the depreciation of tan-gible assets the downward tendency evidentin the previous two years continued, mirror-ing in particular the low level of investmentsince 2001. The principal cause of the sharpdrop in other depreciation was that the write-downs on financial assets and investments,which had doubled between 2000 and 2002and had showed a marked jump in 2001, inparticular owing to the massive slump inshare prices, declined by over one-fifth.
The interest expenditure of enterprises went
down by 8
1/C252% during the year under review.
This owed something to firms’ efforts to con-solidate their balance sheets, which had beendistorted considerably in some cases by the(largely debt-financed) investment boom innew tangible assets and participating inter-ests in 1999-2000 as well as by the overalleconomic slowdown and share price losses insubsequent years. The annual average stockof interest-bearing liabilities decreased slightlyin 2003 for the first time since the late 1990s.Another factor easing the interest burdenwas that the average rate of interest paid byenterprises fell noticeably in 2003 to just over4
1/C252%. This decline was signalled by the
downward market trend in both short-termand long-term interest rates.
By contrast, firms faced a higher burden from
operating taxes, which include tax on landand buildings, motor vehicle tax and excisetaxes; they grew by 10% during 2003. Thiswas caused largely by the entry into force ofthe final stage of the “ecology tax reform”and a further increase in tobacco tax. If theincreases in ecology tax and other taxes thatLabour costs,...

taken into account, the burden of operatingtaxes in 2003 was one-third higher than theequivalent level in 2000. This was offset tosome extent by other costs, which were2% lower than in 2002. This item includesrentals and leases, research and developmentcosts, advertising expense and extraordinarycharges.
Sources and uses of funds
The total sources of funds, which mirrors the
volume of financial and non-financial assetformation, was 5
1/C252% lower in 2003 than in
2002, when it had increased distinctly.4It was
more than one-third less than the peakreached in 1999. Over 90% of the decline inthe inflow of funds during this period was at-tributable to a smaller recourse to externalfunding and not quite one-tenth to a lowervolume of internally generated resources. In2002 and 2003 liabilities were actually repaidon balance. This was due chiefly to the cyclic-ally induced lower capacity utilisation and theassociated smaller need for replacement in-vestments but also to the measures taken byfirms to improve their balance sheet struc-tures. Another factor is that the internal cashflow, which comes overwhelmingly from therelatively constant level of “earned” depreci-ation, shows a smaller volatility over thecourse of the business cycle.
Although capital increases from retained
profits (and capital contributed in the case ofnon-corporations) were somewhat lower in2003, their level was nonetheless compara-tively high. By contrast, the externally fundedcapital increases of corporations fell moremarkedly. Their share of the total inflow of re-sources amounted to just 1% in 2003 com-pared with 9
1/C252% in 2001. Two reasons for
this were the smaller need for additionalfunds and the fact that the stock marketclimate for capital increases remained un-favourable. Total increases in capital fromboth internal and external sources in 2003amounted to 17% of the (reduced) total in-flow of resources; this was more than in thebuoyant years 1999 and 2000.
As regards the uses of funds, the budgets for
the formation of non-financial assets wereraised by 7
1/C252during the year under review,
which contrasts with a reduction of nearly30% in the period 2000 to 2002. This wassolely due to the fact that the trend towardsinventory depletion was halted and instead asmall amount of stockbuilding occurred. Onthe other hand, the gross formation of tan-gible assets recorded another sizeable declinein 2003 (7
1/C252%). This was one-fifth below the
level of 2000. For the first time since the startof the time series in 1998, gross expenditureon new machinery and equipment and build-ings in the sectors embraced by this studyfailed to offset the consumption of fixed cap-ital; in other words, the book value of thecapital stock declined in 2003.
One-quarter less was invested in the acquisi-
tion of financial assets in 2003 than in 2002,which had been influenced by exceptional

40factors. A net build-up of long-term debtors
was almost matched by a depletion of short-term debtors; in 2002 the total increase indebtors had played a much bigger role. Theacquisition of participating interests was like-wise reduced substantially, although equitypurchases still accounted for half of the totalfinancial asset formation in the year under re-view. The amount of resources invested in theacquisition of investments more than doubledfrom 2002 to 2003. Cash holdings, too, wereraised sharply; this was at least partly attribut-able to the low short-term interest rates,which determine the opportunity cost ofholding cash.
Balance sheet trends and key balance
sheet ratios
Corporate balance sheets were shaped in
2003 by the poor macroeconomic climate aswell as the lingering effects of the buoyantyears 1999–2000. The balance sheet growthof 1
1/C252% was similarly weak as in the two pre-
vious years. Between 1998 and 2000 it hadaveraged almost 5%. The individual sectorsevolved very differently, however. Manufac-turing firms’ assets and liabilities expanded by4%, as against nearly 6% on an annual aver-age from 1998 to 2000. A small increase of1
1/C252% was registered in the retail trade sector.
All other sectors saw their balance sheetscontract; the construction industry’s collectivebalance sheet shortened for the fourth yearrunning in the context of its long-lasting ad-justment process and shrank by almost one-quarter vis-/C224-vis the level of 1999.Enterprises’ sources and uses of funds*

41The small overall balance sheet growth in
2003 was due to the further decrease in non-financial assets, which corresponds to the netdecrease in tangible assets in the cash flowaccount, and to the slower accumulation offinancial assets. The decline in the stock oftangible and intangible assets was partlycushioned by the stable development of in-ventories. The weight of tangible assets in theasset total declined further to 43
1/C252%; in
1997 its share had been almost 49%. Theweight of debtors increased accordingly.
The growth of financial assets in 2003 was
slowed especially by the negative change inthe portfolio of short-term assets. This wascaused in turn by a fall in the stock of tradedebtors. Trade creditors likewise decreased.Both items tend to be very elastic to cyclicalmovements. In economic slowdowns this re-flects not only the slower growth of businessvolume but also the fact that, in view of thegeneral increase in default risk, suppliers at-tempt to minimise their outstanding receiv-ables.
Owing to the quite robust development of
capital increases from retained profits de-scribed above, total equity increased in 2003by 6%. Hence the marked increase in liablefunds observable since the start of the newdata series in 1997 continued. While totalcapital grew by one-fifth, the (vertical) equityratio expanded more sharply by 6 percentagepoints to 22%. Of this, 2
1/C252percentage points
were added during the low-profit years 2001to 2003. A key factor in this, presumably, wasthat the reform of overall business taxationthat became effective in 2001 encouragedEnterprises’ balance sheet*

43profit retention as opposed to profit distribu-
tion. Another factor is that, in the past fewyears, banks have exerted increasing pressureon firms with a low level of own funds tostrengthen their capital base. The statisticaleffect of the marked increase in insolvenciesmentioned above also played a part in this asmany enterprises whose own funds hadlargely been eroded by losses dropped out ofthe Financial Statements Data Pool.
The ratio of equity to the balance sheet total
rose in all sectors apart from the transportsector, whose ratio in 2003 was no higherthan it had been six years earlier. Amongmanufacturing firms the own funds ratioreached 27%, compared with 23% in 1997.Construction firms, too, managed to raisetheir level of liable capital by 3
1/C252percentage
points to 6%. The biggest increases wereachieved by the retail trade, which lifted itsequity ratio to 15% in 2003 as against 5
1/C252%
in 1997. This probably owed something toconcentration processes. In the wholesaletrade segment the equity ratio rose by 6 per-centage points to 21
1/C252% and among pro-
viders of business services by 61/C252percentage
points to 161/C252%.
German firms’ liabilities went down againslightly in 2003 (
1/C254%). The main reason for
this, besides the aforementioned lowering oftrade creditors, was the net repayment ofboth short and long-term bank loans, theoutstanding amount of which was 4
1/C252% less
than in 2002. Corporate indebtedness tobanks consequently dropped by 4 percentagepoints vis-/C224-vis the end of the 1990s, when ithad made up more than one-fifth of enter-Balance sheet ratios*

44prises’ total liabilities, to 17%. This presum-
ably reflects first and foremost a lower de-mand for bank credit. But the Eurosystem’sBank Lending Survey also suggests that arelatively large number of banks in Germanyresponded to the protracted phase of weakeconomic growth by tightening their creditstandards in the context of a more cautiousapproach to assessing business risks. Thecombined provisions of the firms increased by2
3/C254%, with provisions for company pensions
being raised by 4%. While the share of provi-sions in total liabilities increased marginally in2003 to 19%, this merely matched the 1997level.
The improvement in German firms’ financial
base is also reflected by the fact that the ratioof long-term capital to the balance sheet totalgrew further to around 45% and exceededthe stock of assets by 10%. Their short-termfinancing situation was likewise satisfactory in2003. Liquid funds plus short-term debtorscovered 87
1/C252% of the short-term liabilities;
this was the highest liquidity ratio since thedata series began in 1997. The ratio of the in-ternally generated cash flow to borrowings,which is a measure of firms’ ability to servicetheir debts, came to 15% in 2003 and wasthus on a par with the high level recorded inthe two preceding years.
Summary
Given the quite difficult macroeconomic set-
ting in 2003, which was reflected in a down-turn in German enterprises’ business activity,the fact that the annual result before taxesrose slightly and that the gross return onturnover was held at the 2002 level must berated as a quite positive outcome. This wasachieved mainly by stringent cost manage-ment. A key contribution to this was made bythe significant lowering of labour costs,which was made possible by moderate payincreases but also by cutting jobs. Germanfirms made good headway in improving theirbalance sheet structures, which in manycases had been strained by the steep increasein liabilities in 1999 and 2000 and largewrite-downs of financial assets, in particular,at the start of the current decade. This bal-ance sheet consolidation was facilitated, first-ly, by the sharply reduced expenditure onnew tangible assets and a more restrained ap-proach to acquiring additional participatinginterests. Secondly, the capital base wasstrengthened by higher profit retention,which was doubtless also associated with thechange in the business taxation regime thatcame into force in 2001. On the other hand,firms were able to reduce their indebtednessto banks. With this improvement in their fi-nancial situation, achieved through a toughconsolidation and restructuring course, Ger-man firms have strengthened their resilienceappreciably in the past few years and thustaken a major step towards improving theircredit ratings in the financial markets.

Methodological notes on the corporate
balance sheet statistics
DatabaseThe extrapolation results published in this article
are based for the first time on corporate balancesheets and income statements from the FinancialStatements Data Pool. This is a joint undertakingbetween the Deutsche Bundesbank and a numberof banks and other financial institutions with theaim of voluntarily integrating their respective fi-nancial statement databases at the Bundesbankfor statistical purposes. To ensure confidentiality,the data are transmitted anonymously, ie withoutnames and addresses and only including those de-tails required for statistical processing and analysis,such as the relevant sector and legal form. Dupli-cate financial statements are identified and elimin-ated by comparing selected items, while ensuringanonymity. In return for transmitting the data, theBundesbank’s partners receive comprehensive stat-istics of key ratios differentiated according to di-verse corporate groups which can, for example, beused in credit assessments.
The creation of the Financial Statements Data Pool
has more than offset the contraction of the Bun-desbank’s balance sheet database (as detailed inprevious Monthly Reports ) since the start of stage
three of European monetary union.
5Until 1998,
the Bundesbank had requested and received morethan 60,000 financial statements per year from en-terprises which had signed bills of exchange pur-chased by the Bundesbank so as to assess theircredit risk in the context of its rediscounting busi-ness. Since 1999, the Bundesbank has obtainedfirms’ balance sheets and income statements inorder to assess the eligibility of corporate loansand bills submitted by credit institutions as collat-eral for refinancing from the central bank. On theirown, these financial statements (currently around20,000 per financial year) no longer provide an ad-equate statistical basis for extrapolations. Never-theless, they constitute a significant input into thejoint data pool.
The Financial Statements Data Pool provides the
Bundesbank with a wide-ranging stock of individ-ual company accounts from non-financial enter-prises based in Germany from the 1997 financialyear onwards, which lately have totalled around105,000 a year. This is after duplicate data, whichmake up more than one-third of the total, havebeen factored out. However, not all the data in thepool are suitable for extrapolation purposes.Around 10% to 15% of the financial statementsare filtered out for a variety of reasons, for ex-ample because information has not been differen-tiated sufficiently, no turnover was generated orcertain ratios contained extreme values that mightdistort the extrapolation results. In addition, theextrapolation procedure is not equally applicableto all branches of the economy. Around one-quarter of the financial statements belong to sec-tors outside the extrapolation reporting sample. Asa result, just under 70,000 annual accounts arecurrently used for the extrapolation per completedfinancial year as opposed to around 50,000 beforebill rediscounting was abolished (see table onpage 47).

46Besides the increased data volume, the available
database has also improved because the data aredistributed more evenly across the different indus-tries. Far more financial statements are also nowavailable for sectors which used to be fairly poorlyrepresented in the Bundesbank’s database becauseof the minor significance of trade bills in those sec-tors. This mainly affects construction and trans-port, for which there is now respectively twice andthree times the data previously available. The busi-ness services sector has become so well represent-ed, in terms of the number of firms and the degreeto which turnover is captured in comparison withthe turnover tax statistics, as to make extrapolationpossible. Alongside “computer and related activ-ities” and “research and development”, this sectoralso includes “other business activities” (excludingholding companies).
The quality of the extrapolation is affected to a
greater extent by how representative the data are.The fall in the volume of Bundesbank data owingto the abolition of bill rediscounting did not just re-sult in a lack of data but also in a problem of repre-sentativeness. Because of the more rigorous eligi-bility criteria in the Bundesbank’s refinancing oper-ations since the start of the third stage of Europeanmonetary union, particularly firms with a lowcredit rating, especially those that are less well cap-italised, tended to drop out of the Bundesbank’sdatabase. Since 1997-98, financial statements sub-mitted to the Bundesbank have come increasinglyfrom well capitalised firms. This effect is reflectedlargely among small enterprises. For instance, theaverage equity ratio for manufacturing firms in thesize category of firms with a turnover of less than32.5 million increased from 6% to 25
1/C252% be-
tween 1997 and 2003. The chart on page 48 showsthe results of overlapping cylindered samples (iethose where data were available for two consecu-tive years) and indicates that the increase amongsmaller firms is largely due to the different com-position of the data (sample effect). If only thechange in the equity ratio within cylindered sam-ples is considered – ie if the level difference be-tween them is disregarded – there is a net increasein the equity ratio of just 2 percentage points overthe entire period under review. An (albeit weak)trend towards better capitalised firms is also appar-ent in the data pool material, where, amongstother things, the aforementioned structuralchanges in the Bundesbank data have had a similareffect. The changing data profile also mirrors thegeneral changes in the German corporate land-scape over the past few years, with more andmore undercapitalised firms disappearing from themarket.
ExtrapolationThe broader data volume now makes it possible to
present extrapolated results once again. From1998 until very recently, it was only possible topublish projections based on the extrapolated fi-nancial statements from the 1997 financial yearowing to the considerable structural changes inthe data. However, they were subject to growinguncertainty as the time gap vis-/C224-vis the projectionbaseline increased because of the cumulative esti-mation error. The results published here have beenextrapolated using the ratio estimation procedure,whereby the aggregated balance sheet and in-come statement data are extrapolated – stratifiedby turnover size category, sector and legal form –based on the turnover figures in the Federal Statis-tical Office’s turnover tax statistics.

48mentioned above. By contrast, the electricity, gas
and water supply sector will no longer be extrapo-lated in future. This resulted in a net rise in totalturnover across all extrapolated sectors of 3%(2002). The energy, gas and water supply sectorwas removed from the extrapolation process be-cause of the preponderance of large enterprises.Companies with a turnover of more than 350 mil-
lion account for almost 90% of total turnover inthe sector. Experience has shown that sectorswhere turnover is so heavily weighted towardslarge companies do not lend themselves to ex-trapolation.

may mean that there are differences in the wayeconomic sectors are defined which can have aconsiderable effect on the overall result in the sec-tor. Much the same applies to statistical breaks incompany accounts for reasons connected with ac-counting policy, tax law and company law whichdo not necessarily reflect economic phenomena. Insectors with a preponderance of large companies,these can have a strong impact on each sector’soverall result. However, in sectors that predomin-antly include small and medium-sized enterprises,these effects tend to cancel each other out. Assuch, these sectors are particularly suitable for ex-trapolation.
The real estate sector (including renting) is not ex-
trapolated because of the low average capitalturnover, ie the relationship between turnover andthe balance sheet total, as the estimation uncer-tainty for an extrapolation differentiated by turn-over size category is considered relatively high. Thissector is better suited to aggregation than extrapo-lation.

Consequently, the new extrapolation includes thefollowing sectors: manufacturing, construction,trade, transport excluding railways and businessservices. The mining and quarrying sector was sub-sumed under manufacturing because it is poorlyas a percentage of the balance sheet total

49suited to a separate extrapolation. Certain sectors
were merged within manufacturing so as to formbroader aggregates and thus improve consistencybetween the turnover tax and corporate balancesheet statistics.
8By contrast, the retail trade sector
was divided into the two groups retail trade in andrepair of motor vehicles and motorcycles (includingthe sale of automotive fuel) and other retail tradeservices (including repair of personal and house-hold goods).
In a further change, the previous division of the ex-
trapolation into three legal form categories (cor-porations, partnerships and sole proprietorships)has been superseded by a split into just two legalforms (corporations and non-corporations) be-cause the data in many sectors are insufficient toallow an extrapolation for sole proprietorships.Thus, the non-corporations also include partner-ships designated Kapitalgesellschaft & Co KG(Kap&Co). This is based on the classification oflegal form in the turnover tax statistics.
To exclude extreme values, a lower bound was set
for the capital turnover for each sector. The aim ofthe capital turnover filter is to prevent relativelylarge companies with a comparatively low turn-over from being categorised in an unusually lowsize category, thereby distorting the extrapolatedbalance sheet aggregates via a large extrapolationfactor.
Change in the definition of individual
financial statement items
Following the approach in the national accounts,
goodwill is recorded as an asset under “intangibleassets” and is no longer treated as an adjustmentto equity. As a result, the equity ratio is nowaround
1/C252percentage point higher than the ex-
trapolation results hitherto.
Because of the increasing significance of intangible
assets, these will be shown as a separate item infuture.
Contracts in progress will not be shown separately
any more because the data in the Financial State-ments Data Pool no longer permit it. They are nowincluded in the item “semi-finished products andservices”.

50relevant data (income from profit transfers and
costs arising from loss transfers by parent com-panies as well as profit and loss transfers by subsid-iaries) are derived from the other income or costsrespectively. Therefore, the “annual result beforetaxes on income” can be read directly off the in-come statement and does not have to be com-puted subsequently via corresponding adjustmentitems as was previously the case. Taxes on earningsare only deducted once this gross profit has beenderived. Other taxes are shown on the cost sideunder the collective item “operating taxes”.
Comparison with previous resultsThe new extrapolated series start with the 1997 fi-
nancial year – the most recent year for whichgenuine extrapolation results based on Bundes-bank data could be published. The 1997 financialyear acts as a transitional year for linking the newdata with the old extrapolation series. In a compar-ably defined sectoral sample, ie excluding busi-ness-related services and energy, gas and watersupply, the equity ratios for the new and the oldextrapolations for 1997 – defined excluding good-will – are at the same level between 16% and16
1/C252% (see the chart on page 49 and the adjacent
table). In addition, the results differ by sector onlyslightly. The differences are greater in the sector re-tail trade (including the sale and repair of motorvehicles and motorcycles and automotive fuel) andin transport, where the equity ratio using the newmethod is respectively around 1 to 2 percentagepoints above and below the result obtained usingthe old one.

51than the old value for 1997. The (positive and
negative) differences in individual sectors are alsoof this order of magnitude apart from construc-tion, where the return on turnover was just under1 percentage point above the old value.
As noted above, it was only possible to publish ser-
ies for the period after 1997 that were based onupdates to the 1997 extrapolation results becauseof changes in the database. As a result, adjust-ments to the period 1998 to 2001 are greater thanthose to the 1997 extrapolation. Using the new ex-trapolation, the equity ratio increases markedly be-tween 1998 and 2001 (the most recent year forwhich estimations are available), whereas the datapublished hitherto tend to show the ratio persist-ing at the 1997 level (see the chart on page 49).For 1998, a similar rise in the return on turnover isshown using both methods. Over the followingthree years – with comparably defined sectoralsamples – the new extrapolation shows the returnon turnover stabilising at that level while the oldmethod indicates a fall of
3/C254percentage point.

69New transparency rules
for credit institutionsThe new IAS/IFRS accounting rules,
which entered into force for publiclytraded institutions in 2005, and thenew Basel Capital Accord (Basel II),which will be implemented for all insti-tutions with effect from 2007, willprobably make credit institutions’ ac-tivities more transparent to the gen-eral public. Risk-oriented reportingwill represent the main addition to thestandard disclosure requirements.Credit institutions must not only ex-plain their assets, finances and earn-ings position but also outline theirown risk situation and their ability tomanage these risks. This shall enablethe recipients of the information tomake appropriate investment decisionsand enable the markets to provide nat-ural incentives for responsible govern-ance. Improved transparency shouldenable market indicators to reflect acompany’s outlook more accurately.The analysis presented here discussesvarious market indicators and theirsuitability for ensuring market discip-line.
Transparency, market discipline andsystemic stability

defines transparency as the disclosure of in-formation that allows market participants tomake an informed assessment of a bank’sfinancial position and performance, risk ex-posure, risk management practices and busi-

70ness strategy. However, transparency can be
achieved only if the published informationis timely, relevant, comprehensive and basedon sound measurement principles that areapplied consistently by banks.
1
In the past, a greater insight into credit insti-tutions’ circumstances was the domain of arelatively small group of business analysts (be-sides banking supervisors). Now, the provi-sions of Pillar 3 of Basel II and the new ac-counting principles are creating the materialframework for greater transparency amongall market participants and other interestedparties.
Transparency and market disciplineCorporate transparency represents the funda-
mental condition for the effectiveness of mar-ket discipline. Market discipline denotes acause-and-effect mechanism in which marketparticipants – creditors, shareholders and de-positors – have an incentive to monitorbanks’ risk-taking and, as appropriate, toreact through their investment decisions.Market participants are always likely to havesuch incentives if they have a stake in a bank’sbusiness risk and face the prospect of losses ifa bank becomes insolvent.
2In direct market
discipline, market participants’ actions have adirect impact on firms’ decisions, such asthrough the exercising of contractual rights(one example being a right to have a say atshareholders’ meetings) or through settingthe terms for the conclusion of financialcontracts (through risk premiums or higheramounts of collateral to be posted). In indir-ect market discipline, the behaviour of mar-ket participants influences decisions taken bythird parties (eg supervisors, rating agencies)who, in turn, themselves influence the behav-iour of banks through increased supervisorymeasures or potential rating corrections.
Market participants and market
discipline
With regard to the exercising of market dis-
cipline, the different groups of investors in abank have varying degrees of relevance. Thisresults from differences in incentive structures(expected returns and tolerance of risk). An-other way in which market participants differfrom one another is in their influence onbanks’ business policies.
Shareholders, as the bank’s owners, can ex-
ercise a direct influence on managementthrough the shareholders’ meeting and aretherefore fundamentally capable of exercisingdirect market discipline. However, they reactto changes in the bank’s business risk differ-ently from creditors. Since shareholders mayexpect, on average, higher yields for morerisky investments, they are less sensitive to abank’s higher-risk behaviour than, for in-stance, creditors, who can expect, at best, to
1Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), En-
hancing Bank Transparency, Basel, September 1998, p 8.
2An additional general condition for market discipline to
be effective is that there is no guarantee, or only a limitedguarantee, of government assistance to prevent bank
failure. If market participants assume that major banks
are “too big to fail” (see D Covitz, D Hancock and
M Kwast, Market Discipline in Banking Reconsidered: The
Roles of Funding Manager Decisions and Deposit Insur-
ance Reform, Federal Reserve Board FEDS series 2004-
53), this will be likely to result in moral hazard. Specifical-
ly, economic agents will neglect to take measures to re-
duce their own risk, as they will expect third parties to
bail them out of insolvency.Direct and

71receive the contractually fixed face value plus
the interest on their borrowed funds.
Holders of subordinated debt3have a particu-
lar incentive to monitor a bank’s risk-taking
because, as opposed to shareholders, theyhave only a limited stake in increased profits,yet, unlike other creditors, are fully exposedto an institution’s risks. In addition, the vol-ume of these funds is quite high relative tobanks’ liable capital.
The interbank market, which is used by banks
for short-term refinancing, is particularly cap-able of exercising effective market discipline.Owing to the fact that relatively largeamounts are traded on the interbank market,its participants have a considerable incentivefor mutual discipline. In addition, by their verynature, banks are well predisposed to obtain-ing and evaluating information about theirpeers.
Depositors are generally unable to exert suffi-
cient market discipline. One reason is thattheir stake is usually very small relative to thebank’s size, which means that their influenceon the bank is limited. Another is that, owingto the protective effect of deposit guaranteeschemes, depositors are insufficiently motiv-ated to monitor the deposit-taking institu-tion’s credit rating.
4It is only when credit rat-
ings plummet that private depositors react,albeit then by withdrawing massive volumesof funds, which can plunge a bank into li-quidity difficulties. In addition, most deposit-ors are non-experts who lack the experienceand expertise to assess a bank accurately. Thisvirtually rules out depositors as enforcers ofmarket discipline.
Despite the fundamental truth that market
participants exercise discipline, it stands toreason that this disciplining effect will wanewhenever a bank is under the threat of insolv-ency.
5Because of their limited liability in such
situations, shareholders potentially have aneconomic interest in tacitly approving or evenencouraging risk-taking by the bank. Al-though subordinated creditors have no par-ticular incentive for increased risk in times ofcrisis, their interest in minimising risk likewisevanishes, as their position in a bankruptcycomes close to that of the owners. Marketdiscipline can counteract, but not entirelyeliminate, incentives for taking inefficientlylarge business risks. Therefore, all that trans-parency and market discipline can do is tosupport banking supervisors. However, theyare not a substitute for a governmentalsupervisory authority that assumes special re-sponsibility for the stability of individual insti-tutions as well as of the financial system atlarge.
The force with which market discipline meas-
ures affect banks’ behaviour depends on their

sion Paper No 1886, 1998) show that banks without de-

banks with deposit guarantee schemes tend to pursue
risky strategies.

72internal incentive structure. Credit institutions
will only be willing to bear the increased costsof more extensive disclosure requirements ifeconomic incentives exist such as lower costsof equity capital,
6lower refinancing costs
and/or improved competitiveness. Firms witha strong credit rating, in particular, will thusendeavour to disclose comprehensive andcomplete information in a timely manner.Despite the undeniable danger of market par-ticipants punishing a weakened bank moreseverely than is economically justified, in-creased transparency may be expected, onthe whole, to broadcast positive signals.
Market discipline and the stability
of the financial system
The initial effect of tightening disclosure re-
quirements will be to give credit institutionsadded incentive to constantly improve theirrisk management and internal control system.As this applies equally to all banks and sav-ings institutions, it will enhance the stabilityof the financial system at large. Secondly, theeffects of market disruptions are generallyless extensive if information is regularly dis-seminated to investors. If market participantsare informed early and continuously, they canreact by means of smaller, gradual adjust-ments, making it easier to avoid overreacting.Thirdly, transparency-enhancing informationpresented in a uniform structure improves thepossibilities of making comparative analysesin the financial system (eg peer group analy-ses and analyses of overall systemic stability).This contributes to minimising the systemiceffects of market disruptions because marketparticipants are better able, in a crisis, to tellthe difference between troubled banks andstable banks. Fourthly, supervisors also con-sider it desirable to use the market informa-tion yielded by increased transparency in asubsidiary fashion, thereby enhancing theefficiency of supervisory activities.
It is questionable whether increased transpar-
ency has an exclusively positive effect on fi-nancial market stability. During economicslumps, even fundamentally sound institu-tions see their risk profile deteriorate. If mar-ket discipline is exerted by way of tighteninglending terms or withdrawing deposits, abank can suffer further disadvantages. If abank decides in this situation to reduce itscredit exposure, and other affected banks po-tentially follow suit, this could result in pro-cyclical impacts on the economy.
The latest empirical research indicates that
greater disclosure can significantly reduce abank’s willingness to take risks. In an inter-national study based on corporate informa-tion provided by major private banks,
7the
link between the degree of disclosure of cor-porate information and banks’ capital ratioswas examined. Firstly, government guaran-tees and deposit guarantee schemes werefound to have an adverse effect on the capitalratio. Secondly, the proportion of financialproducts which can exert market disciplineproves to be positively correlated with banks’capital ratios. Finally, the study shows that in-

73creased disclosure of information on the risk-
return profile leads to a distinct rise in capitalratios and thus to a lower probability of de-fault (PD). It must be taken into account,though, that the results of this study cannotbe applied to Germany wholesale because ofthe strong public sector presence in the Ger-man banking industry.
Traditional approaches in the German
Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch)
Since sufficient transparency is the key condi-tion for market discipline to work, this raisesthe question of how transparency rules forcredit institutions were designed in the pastand how they have been changed by the newaccounting regulations.
The rules contained in the German Commer-
cial Code with regard to preparing annual ac-counts are based on the principle of prudenceand serve mainly to preserve capital and pro-tect a company’s creditors. Conservative rec-ognition and measurement rules, in a verygeneral sense, enable a certain amount of“hidden reserves” to be accumulated. Thismakes it more difficult to present a company’sassets, finances and earnings transparently.
Moreover, section 340f of the Commercial
Code allows credit institutions to accumulateadditional hidden reserves up to a maximumof 4% of certain claims and securities report-ed at the lower of cost or market (the liquidityreserve) to protect against risks specific totheir line of business. This is done “silently”by undervaluing the relevant assets followedby cross-offsetting the resulting write-downswith other income within the profit and loss(P&L) account. The barrier to transparencythat this creates is intentional. Upon conver-sion to IAS/IFRS to prepare account state-ments, hidden reserves will no longer be per-mitted; they will have to be dissolved in IAS/IFRS-based consolidated financial statements.This means that such reserves will be uselessin single-entity financial statements as well.
The key factors for assessing a credit institu-
tion’s equity value are asset quality and thus,among other things, the creditworthiness ofthe loans granted. Any provisions set aside tocover an increase in the probability of default,however, are not visible in the balance sheet,since both specific and general provisions arededucted from the corresponding assets inthe balance sheet; in other words, recordedTransparency rules for

74net of specific provisions. The matching en-
tries in the P&L account, in addition, are re-ported in a summary item which also includeswrite-downs on securities in the liquidity re-serve and transfers to reserves in (off-balance-sheet) credit business. For banking supervi-sion purposes, therefore, separate data onthe quality of the bank loans are collected.
Recourse is taken to these data in an inter-
national context, such as for the IMF’s con-sultations. However, the lack of a uniformnational or international definition of im-paired loans to date has made it difficult tocompare such data across countries.
Extended risk reporting pursuant to
GAS 5-10
Back in 2000, the German Accounting Stand-
ards Committee (GASC) published an indus-try-specific standard for risk reporting bycredit institutions and financial services insti-tutions (GAS 5-10) in consolidated financialstatements, thereby taking on a pioneeringrole in this area in the development of disclos-ure requirements designed to increase trans-parency on capital markets.
GAS 5-10 requires banks to provide compre-
hensive information about their group’s riskas well as its risk management practices. Therisk is to be reported separately in the man-agement report, independently of the antici-pated developments. Industry-specific risksare to be addressed in special detail. Theexisting risk management systems as well asmonitoring and management measures areto be presented separately by risk category.The information must then be condensed toform an overall picture of the institution’s riskexposure. The capital held to cover risk aswell as balance-sheet risk provisioning are tobe discussed. On the whole, GAS 5-10 hassignificantly improved the transparency ofGerman financial groups.
Given the forthcoming transition of many fi-
nancial services companies which issue pub-licly traded securities to IAS/IFRS this year, itremains to be noted that the provisions ofGAS 5-10 will continue to apply to thosecompanies, too.
For institutions listed on exchanges, in par-
ticular, capital market provisions give rise toadditional national disclosure requirements.An overview of these requirements is pro-vided on page 75.

75Disclosure requirements under capital market law
Capital market law lays down a number
of disclosure requirements in order toprotect both investors and the integrityof the financial markets. The intention isto ensure that all financial marketplayers can make their investment deci-sions on the basis of the same informa-tion. Pursuant to section 15 of the Ger-man Securities Trading Act ( Wertpapier-
handelsgesetz ), an issuer of securities
admitted to trading on a German stockexchange must immediately publish anyinformation which is not publicly known.Persons with management responsibil-ities at an exchange-listed enterprise orthe spouses, registered partners or rela-tions in the first degree of such personsalso have to report any own dealings inthe securities of this enterprise (sec-tion 15a of the Securities Trading Act).Moreover, there is a notification require-ment pursuant to section 21 of the Secur-ities Trading Act concerning the purchaseor sale of voting rights in a listed com-pany whereby certain threshold valuesare reached. Regarding offers for the ac-quisition or takeover of securities, sec-tion 10 of the German Securities Acquisi-tion and Takeover Act ( Wertpapier-
erwerbs- und /C220bernahmegesetz ) stipu-
lates that the bidder must publish itsdecision to make an offer for the acqui-sition of a target company’s securitieswithout undue delay. The bidder mustthen, within four weeks, draw up anoffer document containing, in particular,information about the type and amountof the consideration being offered aswell as the conditions upon which theeffectiveness of the offer depends (sec-tion 11 of the Securities Acquisition andTakeover Act). The bidder must subse-quently provide regular reports on thesecurities acquired as part of the take-over offer (section 23 of the SecuritiesAcquisition and Takeover Act). Any per-son who attains control of a target com-pany (30% of the voting rights) mustreport this without undue delay and, as amatter of course, submit an offer docu-ment unless control was acquiredthrough a takeover offer (section 35 ofthe Securities Acquisition and TakeoverAct). The German Stock Exchange Act(B/C246rsengesetz ) stipulates that, for a
security to be admitted to trading on astock exchange, the issuer must publish apublic prospectus before admission(section 30 (3) number 2) and, as anissuer of shares, must regularly – at leastbiannually – publish an interim reportwhich gives a true and fair view of thefinancial position and the generalbusiness trend (section 40 (1)). Finally, inthe case of securities which are offeredto the domestic public for the first timebut are not admitted to trading on aGerman stock exchange, the issuer must,as a matter of course, publish a prospec-tus pursuant to the Securities ProspectusAct ( Wertpapier-Verkaufsprospektgesetz ).

76the current state of the company. The IFRS
presume the complete reporting of all assetsand debts – including derivatives – and thatthey are largely marked-to-market.
The important rules for credit institutions in
the IAS/IFRS system are, above all, those onthe recognition, measurement and disclosureof financial instruments. In the past, alongwith IAS 39 (Financial instruments: recogni-tion and measurement), these included theindustry-specific standard IAS 30 (Disclosuresin financial statements of banks and similar fi-nancial institutions) and IAS 32 (Financial in-struments: disclosure and presentation),which still contain the key disclosure require-ments for the accounting treatment of finan-cial instruments.
Whereas marking-to-market probably corres-
ponds most closely to the IFRS’s fundamentalpremise (ie fair presentation) in terms oftransparency for those balance sheet itemsfor which market prices actually exist, fair-value measurement has its limits in the caseof those balance sheet items for which no ob-jective market prices are available. Derivedmeasurements (marking-to-model) run coun-ter to the concept of transparency, particular-ly in cases where the value measurement ap-proach is no longer objective.
The IAS/IFRS suffer from an additional deficit
deriving from limited comparability. On theone hand, the historical comparability of theannual accounts suffers from a one-off inter-ruption as a consequence of the change inthe accounting system. On the other hand,owing to the large number of options formeasurement and the vast discretionaryscope, comparability among IAS/IFRS financialstatements will, in principle, only be limited.
The IAS 30 and IAS 32 disclosure require-
ments will, in future, be compiled largely in asingle standard, IFRS 7 (Financial Instruments:Disclosures). This new standard applies a prin-ciples-based approach and is directed at allenterprises. This means that, in particular, theIAS 30 rules governing the structure of thebalance sheet and P&L account will no longerapply. Instead, standard setters are confiningthemselves to only a very few minimum re-quirements derived from IAS 1 (Presentationof financial statements), leaving it largely upto companies to choose how to present theinformation to be disclosed. Under IFRS 7, itcan be presented either in the balance sheetand P&L account or in the “Notes”.
IFRS 7 is intended to provide information that
enables the reader of a financial statement toindependently visualise the significance of fi-nancial instruments for the company and thetype and extent of the risk taken. To this endit envisages, among other things, that carry-ing values be given for all financial instru-ments, grouped according to the IAS 39measurement categories. The significance ofthe financial instruments for the company’sperformance are also to be disclosed accord-ing to these categories. In addition, all typesof financial instruments are to be disclosed atfair value, even if the relevant instruments arerecorded in the balance sheet at initial recog-nition. In certain cases, the fair value of assetspledged as collateral is also required to be dis-closed. If the measurement of own liabilities

77at fair value results in fair value gains owing
to a reduction in the reporting company’scredit rating, these have to be disclosed sep-arately.
For a better assessment of credit risk, not
only the gross credit volume (by type) is to begiven but, among other things, a more de-tailed analysis of loans that are past due orimpaired and a description of the chosencollateral. The evolution of risk provisioningduring the reporting period likewise has to bedisclosed; it, too, is to be broken down bytype of loan.
IFRS 7 envisages disclosure not only of credit
risk but also of market risk and liquidity riskderiving from financial instruments. Here,market risk is to be described with the help ofsensitivity analyses for all relevant types ofrisk (eg share price, currency, interest raterisk). Recourse may also be taken to a value-at-risk (VaR) approach if it is used in the com-pany for internal risk management purposes.Liquidity risk is to be explained using con-tractual residual maturities of the firm’s liabil-ities.
To complete the risk assessment, the intro-
duction of IFRS 7, through amending IAS 1,seeks to require the reporting firm to discloseits capital and capital management.
On the whole, there are many similarities and
no inconsistencies between the new IASBstandard and GAS 5-10 or any of the disclos-ure requirements under Pillar 3 of Basel II de-scribed in the following section; this will prob-ably make it easier for many firms to imple-ment the IFRS. Given the lack of structuralrules and the vast scope of companies’ discre-tion in how they report information, it re-mains to be seen whether IFRS 7 disclosurewill lead to major gains in transparency. Theminimum information required by IFRS 7,which applies equally to banks and non-banks, will not be enough in systemic termsto assess the risks to a credit institution deriv-ing from financial instruments. However, thestandard is supplemented by more detailedapplication guidance from the IASB that goesabove and beyond the minimum requirementand facilitates the establishment of transpar-ency.
Future supervisory transparency rules
In June 2004, the Basel Committee on Bank-
ing Supervision adopted a Revised Frame-work for the International Convergence ofCapital Measurement and Capital Standards,which superseded the 1988 Basel Capital Ac-cord. The transparency requirements for en-hancing market discipline under Pillar 3 in-clude the general semi-annual disclosure ofrisk information. Certain qualitative informa-tion that provides a general overview of theaims and procedures of risk management, in-ternal reporting and definitions can also bepublished annually. By contrast, the RevisedFramework envisages the quarterly disclosureof tier 1 and total capital adequacy ratios aswell as information on risk exposures that isprone to rapid change. In certain exceptionalcases in which the required disclosures mayreveal proprietary and confidential informa-tion, this information can remain unpub-

78lished. In such cases, however, the institution
is required to disclose more general informa-tion on the subject matter of the requirementand a reason why the specific items of infor-mation have not been disclosed.
The specific disclosure requirements – in
terms of content – can be subdivided intothree areas; a further distinction is made be-tween qualitative and quantitative informa-tion. The first area governs the scope of appli-cation of the new Framework; in this context,disclosure requirements essentially apply tothe top consolidated entity of the bankinggroup. The disclosure of tier 1 and total cap-ital ratios of significant bank subsidiaries (indi-vidual or subconsolidated) by the parent en-tity is an exception. The most important elem-ent of the additional information to be dis-closed is a list of the entities within the groupand the method with which these entitieswere included in the consolidation.
The second area encompasses information on
the capital structure and capital adequacy.The focus here is on tier 1 capital and the in-dividual components thereof, as well as thetotal sum of tier 2 and tier 3 capital, deduc-tions and total eligible capital. The require-ments cover, moreover, information on cap-ital requirements for the individual types ofrisk and the capital ratios of the consolidatedgroup.
In the third area, institutions have to disclose
information on their risk exposure and assess-ment, separately for credit risk, market risk,operational risk, equity risk and interest raterisk in the banking book. The disclosure ofcredit risk initially features information on theportfolio structure and the distribution of ex-posures as well as information on impairedand past due loans. Moreover, institutions arerequested to provide further details regardingthe use of IRB approaches for managingcredit risk. On that vein, for instance, theaverage loss given default (LGD), risk weights(RW) and exposure at default (EAD) weightedwith the outstanding exposures are to be dis-closed for each credit portfolio on the basis ofan adequate number of probabilities of de-fault (PD). Retail loans may instead be dis-closed by meaningfully breaking down theportfolio by expected losses (EL). In order toassess the quality of the applied IRB ap-proach, IRB estimates should be comparedwith actual outcomes following a transitionperiod.
Finally, in the area of credit risk, information
on the securitisation of assets and credit riskmitigation techniques also need to be relayedto market participants.
The new Basel Framework will be transposed
into EU legislation by amending the CodifiedBanking Directive (2000/12/EC) and the Cap-ital Adequacy Directive (93/6/EEC), therebymaking the supervisory transparency rules ap-plicable to all credit institutions and invest-ment firms. The European rules of Pillar 3largely correspond to those of Basel II, al-though there are still some minor differencesin individual areas, such as terminology anddisclosure frequency. Whereas Basel II gener-ally envisages semi-annual disclosure, EU le-gislation envisages annual disclosure.

80The EU rules will be transposed into German
law through a Solvency Regulation which isbeing “midwifed” by an expert panel on dis-closure requirements, which has issued com-ments and presented use cases that can befound on the websites of the Bundesbankand BaFin. The legal framework for transpar-ency is therefore now in place, so that in Ger-many more meaningful corporate informa-tion will be available to the financial markets.This will make market indicators increasinglymore valuable as a supplementary source ofinformation. A more effective market discip-line can thus be expected to develop infuture.
Market indicators as drivers of market
discipline and systemic stability
The improved level of transparency should re-
sult in market indicators being able to repre-sent a company’s outlook more accurately. Inthe following, selected market indicators willbe studied to see whether they react to com-pany news in a manner suited to exercisingdiscipline on management behaviour. Thiswould ensure that improved corporate trans-parency and the risk information to be dis-closed in future would also lead to better dis-cipline. As already discussed, only sharehold-ers, banks and subordinated creditors havesufficient incentive and influence to monitorbanks’ behaviour. For this reason, only thosemarket indicators that can be influenced bythese participants’ actions will be looked athere.The share price is a market indicator that isgenerally well suited to market discipline. Asone of the most liquid types of market, theequity market unites beneficial features suchas the timely and adequate presentation ofrisk,
9as well as general availability and good
usability. However, Germany, of all countries,has a particularly small share of banks listedon exchanges, which renders such an indica-tor useless for vast segments of the Germanbanking system.
Along with share prices, spreads
10of inter-
bank deposits may be regarded as potentially
suitable market indicators. In Germany, thismarket indicator may be regarded as risk-sensitive as all banks are represented in theinterbank market either directly or indirectly.Interbank price information, however, has vir-tually no external impact on other marketparticipants. In general, the discipline exer-cised by the interbank market may be expect-ed to be very effective owing to the large vol-ume of transactions and interbank marketspreads may be regarded as leading indica-tors of banks’ credit ratings. However, theirpublic availability is insufficient, which meansthat this market indicator can be used only bybanks themselves.
It can generally be assumed that a bank’s risk
exposure is sufficiently reliably reflected bythe issue prices of subordinated debt and
9However, the derivation of probabilities of default from
share prices is eclipsed by other effects. The share price
therefore serves in many cases as an input for other indi-
cators, as well.

risky investment and that on a risk-free investment withthe same residual maturity.National imple-

81similar participation rights.11The post-issue
trading volume of these instruments, how-
ever, is limited, thereby preventing pricesfrom reflecting the bank’s current risk situ-ation at all times. With regard to availability,this market indicator is superior to shares inGermany; according to 2004 financial state-ments, around 58% of all German institu-tions, accounting for 94% of German banks’balance sheet total,
12issued subordinated
debt and comparable participation rights.This may be particularly because these instru-ments are already recognised by supervisorsas own funds in Principle I (section 10 (5), (5a)and (7) of the Banking Act). The subordinateddebt and participation rights issued by allbanks amounted to 3132 billion this year, or
around 1.8% of the balance sheet total.However, 3115 billion of this total is recog-
nised as supervisory own funds. This corres-ponds to 30.7% of regulatory capital, under-scoring the significance of these instrumentsas a source of capital and their suitability as amarket indicator.
Looking at the “big four” German banks, the
total volume of subordinated debt
13and par-
ticipation rights for 2004, at 330 billion,
makes up some 43% of these institutions’total regulatory capital. The average share ineligible capital was around 21% for savingsbanks, at 315 billion. Only for cooperative
banks does subordinated debt in the broadersense seem to have a lesser importance forobtaining capital. At 33.8 billion, it made up
an average share of merely 9%.
The chart on page 82 shows clearly that both
the annual number of issues and the volumeof subordinated debt
14issued tended to rise
in the 1990-2004 period.
On the whole, it may be stated that subordin-
ated debt in the broader sense can play animportant role as an indicator for market dis-cipline purposes, especially where large Ger-man banks are involved. In terms of transpar-ency, an even higher frequency of issue mightbe desirable for this market indicator; forsupervisory purposes, however, it is also ofgreat importance to preserve the highquality of the capital structure. Furthermore,standardising subordinated instruments couldmake a key contribution to increasing theliquidity of the secondary market. Increasingthe liquidity of trading would reinforce themarket discipline imposed by the holdersof subordinated debt instruments. This haselicited occasional proposals to achieve thisaim by making it mandatory for all banks toregularly issue subordinated debt.

11This characteristic is also reflected in the parallel
movement of the spreads of subordinated debt and
other market indicators. See D Hancock and M Kwast,
Using Subordinated Debt to Monitor Bank Holding Com-
panies: Is it Feasible?, Journal of Financial Services
Research, Vol 19, No 2/3, December 2001.
12Between 1997 and 2001, Germany was in first place
throughout Europe regarding the number of issues ofsubordinated debt within the meaning of section 10 (5a)
of the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz) (see
R Gropp and J Vesala: Markets for Bank SubordinatedDebt and Equity in Basel Committee Member Countries,
Basel, August 2003, BIS Working Paper No 12, p 12).
13This refers to the total volume irrespective of the fact
that long-term subordinated debt is assigned to liablecapital and short-term subordinated debt, as tier 3 funds,
is used to calculate own funds.

82The spreads of credit default swaps (CDS)16
are an additional market indicator. CDS
spreads can be regarded as the market’s viewof banks’ creditworthiness and thus as atransparent benchmark of a bank’s risk ex-posure.
17They are, however, available only
for four large German banks. It is possible,though, with the aid of rating information, todraw conclusions about the risk exposure ofother similarly rated banks. For market discip-line purposes, it would be desirable if the in-dicator were available for many more institu-tions. The chart on page 83 shows the devel-opment of the CDS spreads of four large Ger-man banks between January 2003 and June2005.
The advantage of ratings is that they are
based on company information not yet avail-able to other market participants. They areonly indirectly based on quantitative marketdata. For the future, however, it can be as-sumed that rating agencies’ information ad-vantage will tend to decline owing to increas-ingly stringent transparency requirements.
Among the purely quantitative creditworthi-
ness indicators, KMV-EDF
18may be con-
sidered as a significant market indicator.19
KMV-EDF generally reflects banks’ risk ad-equately and in real time.
20Since the KMV-
EDF methodology is based on share pricesand balance sheet data, with KMV-EDF, aswith the other market indicators, it may beassumed that risk sensitivity will increase withenhanced transparency. The disadvantage,however, is that the calculation method inKMV-EDF is not completely disclosed. In add-ition, the market indicator is available for onlysome 30 listed German banks. Although itwould be desirable for KMV-EDF to be avail-able for all institutions, the currently availableindicators can already help in assessing the€b n

16A CDS is a credit derivative for trading in default risk.
Five-year CDSs will be used in our analysis.
17CDS spreads represent insurance premiums against
the default risk of a bond issuer. They express the bond’sdefault risk relative to a risk-free investment. The CDS
spread of a no-default-risk bond is zero.
18KMV-EDF stands for KMV-Expected Default Fre-
quency, and is a measure of a company’s probability ofdefault. The KMV company, named after its founders,
was established in 1990 and has been a part of the Moo-
dy’s rating agency since 2003.
19Unlike purely statistical models (eg logit models, dis-
criminant analysis), “Moody’s KMV model” is an eco-nomic model based on option pricing theory. In the KMV
model, capital is regarded as a call option on goodwill.
According to option pricing theory, it is then possible to
derive a probability that the option will be exercised,
from which a company’s probability of default can then
be estimated. Additionally, in KMV-EDF the probability of
default extracted in this manner is calibrated using empir-
ical data.

faulty signals in the KMV methodology.Credit defaultswaps

Conclusion
In principle, any indicator is better able to
measure a bank’s risk exposure if there isgreater transparency. In an ideal case, indica-tors look at all the information available onthe market. Their quality can therefore onlycontinue to increase if either the disadvan-tages of each market indicator are eliminatedand/or the amount of available meaningfulinformation increases. The latter is what thenew transparency rules are aimed at.
At present, a definitive positive correlation
between increased transparency and themeaningfulness of a market indicator cannotyet be empirically demonstrated because theproposed improvements in the area of infor-mation provisioning have not yet been imple-mented, even though several major credit in-stitutions have already begun to voluntarilydisclose much of the information that willlater be subject to mandatory disclosure re-quirements.Irrespective of empirical provability, there isno question that market participants are ableto assess financial institutions’ risk exposure.In Germany, too, the fundamental effective-ness of market discipline that this ensures cancontribute to the stability of the financialmarkets as a complement to banking super-vision.Daily data

85Risk appetite in a
dynamic financial
market environmentThe risk appetite of investors is of spe-
cial importance to financial stability.The willingness of market participantsto take risks can provide an indicationof the condition of financial markets.Particularly in the light of the currentlow risk premiums, the question arisesas to the extent and nature of inter-action between the willingness of mar-ket participants to take risks and theperformance of financial markets.
This article starts by explaining how
risk appetite influences the market andidentifies reasons for the variance ofrisk appetite over time. Following this,selected indicators are discussed whichare used to investigate the risk appe-tite of investors in the internationalbond and stock markets in the periodfrom 1995 to 2005. In addition, new in-dicators are drawn up which are basedon an explicit separation betweenasset price risk and investors’ willing-ness to take this risk.
It is shown that risk appetite is often
subject to cyclical fluctuations. Themodels for measuring such fluctu-ations provide a useful tool for analys-ing potential risks in financial markets.
Importance of risk appetite with regardto financial stability
Financial stability is of crucial importance for
economic and monetary policy. However, rec-

86ognising potential dangers at an early stage
and introducing effective measures in goodtime poses a special challenge.
1It can be con-
cluded from the currency crises in Europe in1992-93 and in Mexico in 1994-95, the Asia,Russia and LTCM crises in 1997-98 and mostrecently the Argentina crisis in 2001-2002that the economic environment is regularlyconfronted with financial crises.
2
What is particularly important with regard tofinancial crises is that they can generally notbe explained solely by fundamental factors.
3
It is becoming increasingly recognised that atthe same time the risk appetite of marketparticipants, which is subject to fluctuationsover time, also has a decisive influence. Riskappetite is defined as the willingness of in-vestors to bear risks. While there is often nodistinction made in the literature between theterms risk aversion and risk appetite, this dis-tinction is being made here on the basis oftheir different variability over time.
4
Risk appetite poses a threat to financial stabil-ity in particular if the yields investors expectto receive in return for bearing risk appeardisproportionately high or low in relation totheir historical mean. The main problem,however, is that such mismatches cannot sys-tematically be clearly identified ex ante, as
neither the risk nor the risk appetite prevail-ing among market participants can be directlyobserved. Hence it is virtually impossible tospecify a fair valuation level for the pricing ofrisks, which in turn makes it considerablymore difficult to identify developments pos-ing a danger to stability.Risk appetite seems to fluctuate around anunknown equilibrium level. As it is not pos-sible to precisely determine this level, a long-term average is calculated on the assumptionthat while risk appetite may diverge signifi-cantly from this over the short term, the long-term tendency points towards this level. Thisphenomenon is also referred to as the mean
reversion. Deviations from this average can
also be interpreted as indicating risk poten-tial.
A drop in risk appetite leads ceteris paribus to
higher financing costs, as the yield expect-ations of investors increase despite the risk re-maining unchanged. This makes it more diffi-cult to raise capital on equity and debt capitalmarkets in phases of low risk appetite, for in-stance. With regard to financial stability it iscrucial that a change in market sentimentdoes not only give rise to varying yield expect-ations from just a few individual securities butthat it is able to influence a large number ofsecurities, in many cases across national bor-

3For instance, the importance of non-fundamental fac-
tors is shown based on the example of exchange rate de-velopments in P De Grauwe (2000), Exchange rates in
search of fundamentals: The case of the euro-dollar rate,International Finance, pp 329-356.
4Risk aversion is seen as a relatively time-invariable de-
gree of aversion towards uncertainty regarding futureconsumption possibilities. Rather than describing risk per-
ception within a specific financial market environment, it
reflects the underlying attitude to all types of (financial)
risk. By contrast, risk appetite can also be subject to
sharp short-term fluctuations. See also P Gai and N Vause

cial Stability Review, Bank of England, London, pp 127-136.The conse-

87ders owing to the international portfolio con-
nection.5
Mostly, however, it is not a below-averagebut an above-average or rising degree of riskappetite that is seen as a threat to financialstability. In this case the market price of riskfalls and investors demand a smaller risk pre-mium compared with typical reference situ-ations. This gives rise to an increased demandfor risky securities and a decreasing demandfor relatively secure ones.
6Hence investments
can appear to pay off that in normal situ-ations do not represent an efficient return-risk combination. A high risk appetite cantherefore result in risky or unprofitable pro-jects being carried out which would be un-profitable in the case of risk propensity in linewith the long-term average. As the process ofmean reversion in the long term causes riskappetite to decline again, the risk of instabil-ity cannot be ruled out in such situations. Thefinancing conditions then deteriorate, so thatsome of the projects implemented are per-ceived as potentially loss-making, thusprompting some of the capital-providers towithdraw. As a result, this could potentiallygive rise to an inefficient termination of theproject. The strength of the decline in risk ap-petite and the time frame in which it takesplace are the primary factors determining therisk potential.
A change in risk appetite is reflected in the
risk premiums of risky assets. A look at thechange in the yield spread of risky corporatebonds over low-risk government bondsshows significant changes over time (seechart on page 88).However, the fluctuations in the yield spreadcannot be simply taken to point to an equiva-lent variance in risk appetite as the causeeven if we assume that risk aversion remainsconstant.
7The reason can also lie in a credit
risk or liquidity risk that changes over time. Ifcorporate bonds become more risky in rela-tion to government bonds, the yield spreadwill increase. The fact that the yield spreadsof the different rating classes move in thesame direction can also not be interpreted asa clear sign of changes in risk appetite. Jointprice movements of assets with varying de-grees of risk may also result from a riskchange simultaneously affecting all assetsunder consideration. It is also conceivable,however, that they might be brought aboutnot by a shift in the absolute risk position butin the relative risk position compared to otherassets.
Nevertheless it can mostly be assumed that a
change in the general risk appetite of marketparticipants contributes to a similar extent tothe fluctuation of the risk premium as the ac-tual risk connected with the bonds in ques-
5This is illustrated empirically in N Tarashev, K Tsatsaronis
and D Karampatos, Investors’ attitude towards risk: what
can we learn from options? , BIS Quarterly Review, June
2003, pp 57-65.
6This basic conclusion is compatible with the Capital
Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) as long as the risk-free inter-est rate at which all investors can borrow or invest an un-
limited amount of money is no longer assumed to exist.
For details see MS Kumar and A Persaud (2002), Pure
contagion and investors’ shifting risk appetite: analyticalissues and empirical evidence, International Finance,
pp 409-410.7The risk associated with a bond should be reflected in
its rating. If a bond remains in the same rating class, how-ever, this does not imply per se that the risk has remained
unchanged. For details, see, for instance, EI Altmann and

nomic Notes, Vol 34, No 2, pp 127-154.The problem of

88tion. Hence the risk premium is determined
by two factors. While it is negatively correl-ated to risk appetite, it has a positive correl-ation to the actual risk. Looking at the yieldspread alone therefore does not enable anyconclusions to be drawn regarding the extentof or change in risk appetite.The factors determining fluctuationsin risk appetite
Various reasons are assumed for the some-
times sharp and protracted deviations of riskappetite from their (unknown) equilibrium.Empirical analyses show that there is a long-term positive correlation between risk appe-tite and economic performance.
8Investors
are more prepared to bear additional riskwhen financial markets are booming, whiletense market phases often give rise to a rapiddecline in risk appetite.
One reason for this behaviour by market par-
ticipants is seen to lie in the fundamental limi-tation of human cognitive abilities, thus lead-ing to bounded rational behaviour.
9Accord-
ing to the theory of bounded rationality,human beings only have a limited ability tofully absorb information, process it quicklyand store it for a sufficiently long period oftime. Cognitive restrictions force the econom-ic agent to use simplified rules of conductthat do not correspond with the behaviour ofthe customary theoretical construct of homo
oeconomicus. However, the use of simplified
heuristics in some cases leads to systematicwrong valuations and hence to deviations ofrisk appetite from the equilibrium path.
So-called availability and representativeness

89context.10The former refers to the fact that
the probability of an event is rated higher the
more firmly it is cognitively embedded in ourconsciousness. This means that in prosperingmarkets there is a lower awareness of the riskof a downturn, while the probability of a con-tinuation of the upturn is overestimated. Thisleads to a self-reinforcing process as the up-swing (downturn) entails a rise (fall) in risk ap-petite and vice versa. The interactive en-hancement continues until it is interrupted byone or more unexpected events which rekin-dle awareness of the existing risks and lead toa decline in risk appetite.
Representativeness heuristics exacerbate
these processes by making the assessment ofprobabilities depend on how similar the dif-ferent assets appear in the observer’s eye. Inthis way a large number of assets can be af-fected by a change in risk appetite althoughthe unexpected event was originally only rele-vant for a small number of them.
11
In addition to the bounded rationality of mar-ket participants, there is another conceivablereason at a non-individual level for shifts inrisk appetite. If the participant structure inmarket events changes, the risk appetite inthe market generally also changes. In connec-tion with the availability heuristics describedabove, a change in the composition of the in-vestor group can therefore also trigger self-reinforcing processes.
It can be concluded from the relationship be-
tween risk appetite and fundamental factorswhich is explained by the concept ofbounded rationality that strong deviationsfrom the long-term average are to be expect-ed in the run-up to a pronounced change inthe direction of risk appetite. Such changesof direction can pose a threat to financial sta-bility as they are often followed by funda-mentally non-justified price developments.An extremely high risk appetite can thereforepave the way for the emergence of financialcrises. On the other hand, human behaviouralpatterns characterised by availability andrepresentativeness heuristics cause negativesurprises to be followed by a decline in thereadiness to take risks.
In fact, some empirical investigations have
proven that financial crises are often pre-ceded by phases of extremely high risk appe-tite.
12The successful development of reliable
indicators for measuring risk appetite wouldenable warning signs of potential financial in-stabilities to be recognised at an early stageso that the necessary corrective action couldbe taken.

heuristic factor, framing, but this is very similar to the
ones mentioned here. See P De Grauwe (2000), pp 344-

90Indicators for the measurement of
risk appetite
A number of financial crises occurred in the
1990s, the main examples being the Mexicanpeso crisis in 1994-95, the Asian economicand currency crisis in 1997, the moratoriumon sovereign debt by Russia and the near-insolvency of the hedge fund LTCM in 1998.The financial literature already provided somemodels for explaining financial crises.
13Des-
pite this, economists and market participantsfailed to anticipate these events. Followingthis experience, efforts to improve the fore-casting of financial crises were intensified.
14
In addition to predicting economic funda-mentals, indicators for assessing the risk ap-petite prevailing on the financial marketswere also developed. Some indicators relatedirectly to surveys assessing market partici-pants’ views or investor confidence. However,most indicators attempt to derive the risk ap-petite of investors from the development ofmarket prices in the international financialmarkets. The main advantage of marketprices compared with surveys is that they canbe called up cheaply, are published more fre-quently and provide an up-to-date reflectionof current developments. Furthermore, mar-ket prices reflect the actual views of marketparticipants which were implemented in trad-ing decisions. There are many differentapproaches to assessing the risk appetite ofinvestors by means of market prices. Some ofthese indicators are presented below asexamples.
15
The Bank for International Settlements (BIS)calculates an indicator by comparing the stat-istical likelihood of and subjective probabilitythat market participants ascribe to futureasset returns.
16This concept is based on mod-
ern financial market theory, which states thatasset prices reflect preferences regarding fu-ture returns and an assessment of the likeli-hood that these returns will be achieved. Afurther assumption is that the future benefitsof capital gains for investors are the higherthe smaller their wealth. This correlation givesrise to a preference-weighted probabilityabove the statistical probability for low re-turns. The statistical probability of future re-turns is estimated using historic patterns inspot prices. The assessments of market par-ticipants are derived from the prices of stockoptions. The preference-weighted subjectiveprobability of investors regarding future re-turns of the underlying of the option con-tracts can be estimated from a set of optionprices with different strike prices. The higherthe risks of losses assigned by investors to theunderlying lie above the statistical probabilityof sharp losses, the lower the willingness ofmarket participants to take on risks.
An indicator developed by Credit Suisse First
Boston (CSFB) in 2001 draws on the correl-ation between risk appetite and the relative

91performance of riskier and less risky assets.17
This approach is based on the assumption
that an increasing risk preference shifts thedemand from less risky investments to assetsassociated with higher risks, thus pushingtheir prices up relative to low-risk assets. Inthe event of lower risk appetite, however,there is a preference for risk-free assetswhose prices increase as a result of the higherdemand. This approach is methodologicallyimplemented by relating the returns of64 international stock and bond indices totheir risk which is approximated by historicvolatility. The value of the CSFB index is theslope of the repression line measuring thecorrelation between the current performanceof shares and bonds in relation to their risk.
Other examples of the broad variety of risk in-
dicators are the indices of Goldman Sachsand JP Morgan. The indicator calculated byGoldman Sachs draws on a consumption-based Capital Asset Pricing Model for assess-ing the risk appetite of investors.
18The Li-
quidity, Credit and Volatility Index (LCVI) ofJP Morgan comprises seven sub-indices cap-turing credit risks, liquidity risks and volatilityin different financial markets. The LCVI is cal-culated as the arithmetic average of the nor-malised sub-indices, thus smoothing out theirfluctuations.
19Furthermore, an aggregation
of several individual indicators can also beused to identify risk appetite as a commonfactor of the individual indicators by means ofa principal component analysis. This approachwas selected by the Bundesbank in a previousreport, for instance.
20The indicators can be used to assess the de-velopment of investors’ risk appetite overtime. The higher the indicator, the higher therisk appetite. However, the level of risk appe-tite can only be interpreted in relation to itshistoric development. Whether the willing-ness of market participants to take risks isrelatively high or low can be assessed in com-parison to the long-term average and thepeaks and troughs reached by the indicatorsto date.
The development of the indicators shows
that risk appetite can change rapidly and thatit fluctuates, at times in cyclical movements,around a long-term mean. A sudden drop inrisk appetite can, for instance, be triggered

appetite index, in: Credit Suisse First Boston, Global Strat-
egy Research: Market Focus, February 2004.
18See Goldman Sachs, Risk aversion, in: The Foreign Ex-
change Market, October 2003, pp 28-31. A fundamentalassumption of this model is that individuals aim to
smooth out their consumption over time. Hence capital
investments that are profitable in times of high consump-
tion offer them relatively little marginal utility. The rela-
tively large difference in returns between shares and
bonds is therefore said to be due to the risk aversion of
market participants aiming for stable returns to keep con-
sumption as constant as possible. The volatility of this dif-
ference in returns, which is higher than that of short-
term US Treasuries and consumption, is thus explained by
fluctuations in risk appetite over time.

to trade fx: Introducing the LCVI, in: JP Morgan Global

Liquidity risks are approximated by the difference in re-
turns between so-called on-the-run and off-the-run US
Treasuries. On-the-run Treasuries are the US Treasuries is-
sued most recently that are normally traded the most in-
tensively and therefore have a higher liquidity than older
off-the-run Treasuries. In addition, US swap spreads are
also included, as they generally expand during tense mar-
ket phases. The differences in returns between US cor-
porate bonds and government bonds of emerging coun-
tries on the one hand and US Treasuries on the other are
used for assessing the credit risks. Volatility is taken into
account on the basis of implied volatilities in the foreign
exchange markets and in the US equity market.

Impact of
financial crises

DEUTSCHE
BUNDESBANK
Monthly Report
October 2005
92by financial crises that rekindle market partici-
pants’ awareness of specific risks and thussignificantly impact the risk perception of in-vestors. Examples of this are the Asian finan-cial and economic crisis in the second half of1997, the events surrounding the morator-ium on sovereign debt by Russia and the fi-nancial problems faced by the hedge fundLTCM in autumn 1998, and the burst of thetechnology and internet bubble in early2000. On the other hand, an increase in riskappetite can also develop over a prolongedperiod, such as in 2003 after the end of theslump in the stock market.
A comparison of the indicators shows that
they have undergone phases with similarmovements over the past ten years. Periodsshowing varying developments are likely tobe caused primarily by the different ap-proaches to measuring risk appetite. For in-stance, the indicators of the BIS and GoldmanSachs are based on theoretic models whilethe LCVI is derived from a simple aggregationof observable individual indicators. Further-more, the varying coverage of financial mar-kets could also have an impact. While the BISindicator relates exclusively to equity markets,the CSFB and Goldman Sachs indicators arebased on bond and equity markets. More-over, the LCVI also takes the foreign ex-change markets into account. However, thislast argument is put into perspective by thefact that integrated financial markets are in-fluenced by investors with similar perceptionsand that a change in the risk appetite of in-vestors with diversified portfolios will prob-ably have an impact across the financial mar-kets.
When interpreting the indicators based on
market prices it should be borne in mind thatthese are affected exclusively by market par-ticipants. Hence a varying composition ofmarket participants over time could also giverise to variations in the indicators over time.For instance, an increased – often only tem-porary – activity of hedge funds, which aregenerally prepared to take on more risk than,

93for example, pension funds or insurance com-
panies, could also boost the measured riskappetite. Moreover, non-linear relationshipsbetween the development of market pricesand risk appetite are also conceivable. Hencethe indicators should not be considered as anaccurate quantitative measure of risk appetitebut rather as a qualitative assessment. More-over, identifying risk appetite is dependent onthe extent to which a separate allocation ofthe effects of risk appetite and risk on assetprices is possible. In this connection, riskmeans the risk of a negative deviation fromthe expected returns.
New indicators for the measurement of
risk appetite
The indicators outlined below explicitly separ-
ate the impact of risk and risk appetite on thedevelopment of asset prices. These new indi-cators are based on the approach of the CSFBindex, which derives risk appetite from therelative development of stocks and bonds ofvarying risk. The current performance ofstocks and bonds is related to their volatility,which depicts the underlying investment risk.In addition, the impact of a change in thecredit risks of bonds is also assessed on thebasis of credit ratings. However, ratings oftenreact with a time-lag to changes in creditrisks. The stable and in part even slightly posi-tive development of the ratings of emergingAsian countries in the years preceding theAsian crisis illustrate this phenomenon. Theywere only adjusted to the decline in the eco-nomic environment at the end of 1997. Morerecent studies have also shown that marketprices react significantly faster to new infor-mation regarding the credit risks of bondsand that upgrades and downgrades of rat-ings are reflected in the risk premiums ofbonds several weeks beforehand.
21
Although the ratings of agencies generally in-dicate drops in creditworthiness with a time-lag (the agencies point out above all that theyonly intend to depict sustained changes insolvency rather than temporary ones such asthose spanning an economic cycle), theirmostly ex post actions reflect a market con-sensus in assessment already establishedbeforehand. They therefore do not have aforecasting character but a confirmatory one.This is the reason why we bring them forwardby up to two months when including them inour estimates.
The approach presented calculates two new
indicators, of which the first (Index 1) is basedon 33 international corporate bonds indicesand government bonds and the second(Index 2) additionally comprises a further tenstock indices. Whenever the new indicatorsapproached values of two standard devi-ations above or below the mean, a trendreversal could often be observed. Reachingor exceeding these thresholds representsextreme values of investors’ risk appetite byhistorical standards.
Index 2, which also comprises the equity mar-
kets, reaches very high values at the start ofthe Asian crisis in July 1997 and at the peak

By contrast, the first indicator suggests thatrisk appetite in the bond markets duringthese months was at around the level of itslong-term average.
22As a result of the Asian
crisis and the burst of the technology andinternet bubble, both indicators declinesharply albeit that risk appetite in the equitymarkets fell to a larger extent, starting from avery high level, than in the bond markets.
In autumn 1998, the looming insolvency of
the hedge fund LTCM initially boosted the de-cline in the risk appetite of market partici-pants, which was already decreasing due tothe moratorium on sovereign debt by Russia.The efforts of the US Federal Reserve to miti-gate the crisis by coordinating financial aidand cutting interest rates several times helpedto instill market participants with renewedconfidence. In an environment of improvingmarket sentiment and rising prices, investors’risk appetite also rebounded rapidly.
23
After risk appetite had picked up again in thetwo years following the burst of the technol-ogy bubble, a decline in the second indicatorin mid-2002 coincided with stressed financialmarkets owing to the insolvency ofWorldcom. The BIS and CSFB indicators alsopoint towards a sharp drop in risk appetite atthis time. By contrast, Index 1, which is basedexclusively on the bond markets, performedrelatively stably at this time and as early as au-tumn 2002 posted a sustained increase whichin early 2003 resulted in a peak within the ob-servation period. This development is primar-ily due to the fact that a global trend towardsdecreasing interest rates and bond spreadswas already established at the end of 2002.From the end of 2002 the other indicatorsmentioned in this article also went up againsignificantly. This development in particularreflects the global recovery in the equity mar-kets, although this would seem to be onlypartially attributable to an increase in risk ap-petite among investors. Instead, the upswingin the equity and bond markets was alsodriven by expectations of rising corporateprofits.

95New indicators for the measurement of risk appetite
The new indicators for the measurement
of risk appetite are based on governmentbonds, corporate bond indices and stockindices across the world. The approach isbased on the assumption that the leveland development of the risk premiums isfundamentally determined by the under-lying risk and the risk appetite of invest-ors. An increase in investors’ risk appetiteceteris paribus shifts demand in favour ofriskier assets and their price rises relativeto less risky assets. Conversely, decreasingrisk appetite increases the demand forassets associated with low risks and trig-gers a price increase relative to riskierinvestments.
In order to implement this approach the
current performance of stocks and bondsis regressed on their risk which is meas-ured on the basis of the annualised vola-tility of the past twelve months. Further-more, the effect of a change in the is-suer’s credit rating on bond prices istaken into account separately in the esti-mates by using a variable incorporatinginformation on rating upgrades anddowngrades.
Two indicators are estimated, the first of
which is based on 16 government bondsand 17 corporate bond indices and thesecond of which also includes anotherten international stock indices. For theperiod from January 1995 to mid-August2005 the two indicators are estimated foreach day using the following regression:
ER
i=b0+b1volatility i+b2Drating i+ei
where ERirefers to the difference be-
tween the current six-month return of
bond or stock i and short-term US Treas-uries. The volatility variable stands for
the historic volatility of the excess returnsof the past 360 days. Drating comprises
the numerically scaled change in theissuer rating in the period from 60 daysbefore to 30 days after a rating change.To this end the ratings have initially beenranked in increasing numerical order(from 1 for AAA to 21 for C). If in thenext 60 days a rating upgrade or down-grade takes place or if this took place inthe last 30 days, Drating is negative (posi-
tive) and otherwise equivalent to 0. Theconstant
b0in the regression illustrates
an overall market trend in bond prices onthis day. The indicators for measuringrisk appetite are derived from the coeffi-cient
b1which measures the correlation
between performance (excess return) andvolatility. A positive (negative) coefficientindicates a relatively high (low) risk appe-tite. To facilitate the comparability withthe indicators presented thus far,
b1has
been transformed into a scale of 0 to 100in the chart on page 96.

96companies in the US automobile industry in
early 2005 affected investors’ risk appetiteonly temporarily. At present the two new in-dicators point to an increase in risk appetiteuntil the start of August 2005.
Interaction between risk appetite and
financial market developments
The financial markets in the USA and Europe
have been dominated by decreasing interestrates and sharply declining risk premiums onbonds and stocks over the last two years,which have been reflected by rising bond andequity prices. As well as improved corporateprofitability and declining default rates, in-vestors’ search for higher-yielding assets at atime of historically low interest rates will alsohave contributed to the decline in risk pre-miums. By contrast, the high demand forlow-risk government bonds seems not to rep-resent a “flight to security” but could ratherbe due to other factors, such as purchases ofAsian countries resulting from the large bal-ance of payments surpluses in these countriesor an expansionary monetary policy in con-nection with low inflation rates. The in-creased demand of insurance companies andpension funds for debt securities with longermaturities may also have played a role.
There is a long tradition in the finance litera-
ture of analysing the relationship betweenperformance and volatility in the equity mar-kets. A common explanation for the negativecorrelation between equity prices and theirvolatility is that the capital ratio decreaseswith declining equity prices, thereby causingthe risk and volatility of the stock to in-crease.
24The correlations calculated for the
period from 1995 to 2005 between the dif-ferent risk indicators and the development ofequity prices and volatilities in the US finan-cial markets show that the degree of invest-ors’ risk appetite also changes along with fi-nancial market dynamics. Whereas the inter-dependencies between the indicators vary, allindicators display a negative correlation withthe VIX volatility index and – with the excep-tion of Index 1 which refers solely to thebond markets – a positive correlation withthe S&P 500.Bonds and shares

97In the light of the interdependence between
risk appetite, volatility and financial stability,measuring and interpreting a varying risk ap-petite is gaining importance. The indicatorspresented show that a self-reinforcing effectof declining prices for risky assets and de-creasing risk appetite may occur. Such dy-namics can be triggered by a crisis event.A trend reversal in risk appetite has oftenbeen observed after reaching historically highor low values.
