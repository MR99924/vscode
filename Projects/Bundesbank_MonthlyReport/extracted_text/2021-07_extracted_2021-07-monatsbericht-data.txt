Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The second quarter of 2021 likely saw a robust 
recovery in economic output in Germany. This 
is likely to have more or less offset the severe 
setback the economy suffered in the first quar -
ter, which was primarily brought on by the 
temporary tightening of pandemic contain -
ment measures. The services sector played a 
large role in driving this recovery. The loosening 
of restrictions, made possible by a lower inci -
dence of COVID-  19 infections, led to a signifi -
cant increase in activity from May onwards. 
However, ongoing bottlenecks in the supply of 
intermediate products slowed industrial out -
put, causing a considerable slowdown in pro -
duction in the automotive industry. According 
to Ifo Institute surveys, materials shortages are 
also a growing problem in the construction 
sector. Nevertheless, construction output in -
creased substantially compared with the first 
quarter. Provided the pandemic does not lead 
to any notable setbacks and the supply bottle -
necks begin to at least gradually be resolved, 
the aggregate pace of growth is likely to accel -
erate even further in the third quarter, and real 
gross domestic product could potentially return 
to its pre- crisis level as early as the third quar -
ter.
Industry
Industrial output dropped again somewhat in 
Germany in May 2021, with a reduction of ½% 
on the month (adjusted for seasonal and calen -
dar effects). On an average of April and May, 
industrial output was ¾% down on the first 
quarter. Ongoing supply bottlenecks for certain 
raw materials and intermediate products con -
tinued to have a dampening effect. The auto -
motive sector was hit particularly hard, with a 
considerable drop in output compared with the first quarter (-9%).1 Excluding the automotive 
sector, industrial output increased somewhat 
(+½%), however. Broken down by sector, the 
production of intermediate goods rose slightly 
and the production of consumer goods in -
creased markedly. The production of capital 
goods, when considered without the auto-
motive sector, remained unchanged. Robust 
growth was seen in the manufacture of com -
puter, electronic and optical products. The 
manufacture of machinery and equipment saw 
a marked increase in output.
The volume of industrial orders fell sharply in 
May 2021 in seasonally adjusted terms (-3¾%) 
compared with the figure for April, which was 
very high and had additionally undergone a 
marked upward revision. Looking at April and 
May in aggregate, however, reveals a signifi -
cant rise on the first quarter (+1¾%), with an 
even stronger increase if large orders are ex -
cluded. Broken down by region, domestic 
orders and, in particular, orders from within the 
euro area saw strong growth compared with 
the first quarter of 2021. Demand from non-  
euro area countries, however, increased only 
somewhat. Broken down by sector, orders of 
consumer goods and capital goods rose 
sharply. Automotive manufacturers also saw a 
strong increase. Producers of intermediate 
goods saw a slight reduction in new orders, 
however. In contrast to industrial output, which 
was still significantly below its pre- crisis level 
from the fourth quarter of 2019, demand for 
German industrial products substantially ex -
ceeded its pre- crisis level by more than 10% in 
the first two months of the second quarter.
After adjustment for seasonal variations, nom -
inal industrial sales rose somewhat in May 2021 
(+½%) compared with April, when they had Robust recovery

sunk significantly. On an average of April and 
May, sales were up slightly on the first quarter 
(+¼%). In regional terms, a marked domestic 
increase and a substantial rise in euro area 
countries contrasted with a considerable de -
cline in sales in non- euro area countries. Broken 
down by sector, sales of intermediate goods 
saw robust growth, while sales of consumer 
goods rose markedly. By contrast, sales of cap -
ital goods dropped sharply. This can be traced 
back to a sizeable decline in sales in automo -
tive and other vehicle manufacturing. In May 
2021, nominal exports of goods saw a slight 
seasonally adjusted rise on the previous month 
(+¼%). Looking at April and May in aggregate, 
there was a marked rise when compared with 
the first quarter (+1½%). There was no change 
in real terms, however, where a considerable 
increase in the euro area was balanced out by 
a similar drop in non- euro area countries. May 
saw a steep rise in nominal goods imports 
(+3½%). On an average of April and May, they 
significantly exceeded the value of the previous 
quarter (+6%), with price effects playing an im -
portant role here. Even after price adjustment, 
however, there was a considerable increase 
(+2¼%), with the majority accounted for by 
non- euro area countries.
Construction
After adjustment for seasonal variations, out -
put in the construction sector increased signifi -
cantly in May 2021 when compared with the 
previous month (+1¼%), which had been re -
vised up markedly. On an average of April and 
May, construction output rose sharply com -
pared with the first quarter (+4½%). The finish -
ing trades and the main construction sector 
both saw strong growth. This growth was also 
partially due to construction output having 
been hampered at the beginning of the year by 
anticipatory effects connected to the return to 
higher VAT rates and unfavourable weather 
conditions. However, the Ifo Institute reports 
that materials shortages during the second 
quarter placed a growing burden on construc -Industrial sales

tion activity. Nevertheless, the overall situation 
in the construction sector remains positive. 
While enterprises in the main construction sec -
tor received significantly fewer orders in April 
– the most recent month for which statistics 
are available  – than in the first quarter, the 
reach of the order books, as measured by the 
Ifo Institute, increased somewhat in the aver -
age of the second quarter from its already high 
level. Additionally, the level of utilisation of 
machinery  and equipment in the main con -
struction sector rose markedly.
Labour market
The recovery in the labour market has mani -
fested itself primarily in the reduced promin -
ence of short- time work, after the large- scale 
deployment of this instrument in winter stabil -
ised employment and unemployment figures. 
After a steep decline in March 2021, the num -
ber of short- time workers continued to drop in 
April – albeit at a slower rate than in the previ -
ous month  – despite the resurgence of the 
pandemic during the third wave. In April, the 
Federal Employment Agency reported that, ac -
cording to its initial estimate, there were still 
2.34 million persons in economically induced 
short- time work, more than a quarter fewer 
than two months prior. The volume of hours 
lost to short- time work even fell by more than 
a third in the same period. The further loosen -
ing of restrictions in May and June is likely to 
have led to a further sizeable reduction in the 
use of this instrument. Based on its own eco -
nomic surveys, the Ifo Institute estimates that 
there were still 1.5 million people in short- time 
work in June.
As in the previous two months, May saw only 
slight growth in the total number of persons in 
work. Although employment subject to social 
security contributions has remained especially 
stable during the crisis –  having almost re -
turned to pre- crisis levels – the number of per -
sons in this form of employment grew only 
slightly in April. By contrast, the ongoing reduc -tion in the number of persons in exclusively 
low- paid part- time employment and self-  
employment continued, with a sizeable gap re -
maining between the levels of both forms of 
employment and their levels at the beginning 
of 2020. The following months are likely to see 
a significant increase in the rate of employment 
growth, however. Indicators of willingness to 
recruit new staff moved deep into expansion -
ary territory, and the number of vacancies rose 
once again.
Registered unemployment was down by 
38,000 (seasonally adjusted) in June, a consid -
erably greater reduction than in previous 
months, with the unemployment rate dropping 
to 5.9%. While there was a continued sizeable 
decline in unemployment driven primarily by 
cyclical factors, unemployment covered by the 
basic welfare allowance did not rise any fur -
ther. The IAB’s unemployment barometer rose 
again in June, reaching its highest level since it 
began taking measurements more than 12 
years ago. The next three months could there -
fore see a steep drop in unemployment.
Prices
Crude oil prices rose markedly in June 2021. 
One key factor in said rise was a vigorous re -
covery in demand alongside the rigorous on -
going implementation of production cuts by 
OPEC and its partners. Prices were up by 7½% 
on May and by around 80% on the year. Prices 
were continuing to rise at the beginning of July. 
As this report went to press, the price of a bar -
rel of Brent crude oil stood at US$74. Crude oil 
futures were trading at marked discounts, how -
ever: US$3¼ for deliveries six months ahead 
and US$5½ for deliveries 12 months ahead.
The substantial increase in import prices in Ger -
many persisted in May. Energy prices played a 
larger role in this increase than in the previous 
two months, however. Excluding energy, the 
increase actually weakened slightly, although it 
remained fairly strong. By contrast, at the in -First signs of

dustrial producer level, the price increase ex -
cluding energy continued to strengthen some -
what. At the same time, the growth in energy 
prices gained traction, meaning prices in gen -
eral rose more strongly than in previous 
months. At last report, import prices and indus -
trial producer prices exceeded prior- year levels 
by nearly 12% and just over 7%, respectively. 
Excluding energy, those figures came to roughly 
6% and 5%, respectively.
Consumer prices as measured by the Harmon -
ised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) rose sub -
stantially by 0.5% (seasonally adjusted) in June, 
following an average increase of 0.3% in the 
previous months.2 As in May, the prices of in -
dustrial goods excluding energy rose very 
steeply. Once again, this was especially notice -
able in the prices for shoes and clothing. By 
contrast, price increases for other industrial 
goods excluding energy, which had been not -
able in the previous month, were somewhat 
weaker. Price increases for services were also 
stronger. This was likely due in part to the fact 
that the resumption of certain services came 
with a marked price increase. By contrast, 
prices for energy and food rose only moder -
ately. Annual headline HICP inflation fell from 
2.4% to 2.1%,3 while the core rate excluding 
energy and food declined from 1.6% to 1.2%. 
This decline was caused by last year’s later 
Whitsun holiday, which meant travel was sig -
nificantly cheaper in a year- on- year compari -
son. Excluding this component and clothing, 
inflation rose slightly from 1.6% to 1.7%. From 
the current month onwards, the base effect of 
the temporary cut in VAT rates in 20204 means 
that HICP inflation can be expected to return to 
significantly higher rates, even if a one- off stat -
istical effect will still have a dampening impact 
at first. This effect is due to the adjustment of 
some HICP weights to the consumption habits 
of 2020 being fairly large as a result of the pan -
demic. It caused the HICP rate to rise markedly 
in the first quarter of 2021 and will curb it sig -
nificantly at times from July to October.5 As 
things stand, rates of over 4% could be seen temporarily when this dampening effect abates 
towards the end of the year.
Public finances6
Local government finances
In the first quarter of 2021, local government 
(core budgets and off- budget entities) recorded 
a high deficit of €8½ billion, compared with 
€9½ billion at the start of 2020. The deficit was 
funded (on balance) from reserves, which were 
generated, not least, from the high surplus in 
the final quarter of 2020.
Revenue rose substantially on the year, by 5½% 
(€3 billion). Tax revenue grew just as strongly 
(+€1 billion in total), though the first quarter of 
2020 was probably still fairly unaffected by the 
pandemic. After deducting the shares accruing 
to other government levels, revenue from local 
business tax increased by 2%. The improve -
ment in total tax revenue was largely the result 
of the state of Lower Saxony forwarding in -
come tax shares to its local governments earlier 
than in previous years. Transfers received from 
state government rose more strongly than tax 
revenue (+8%, or €2 billion). This was due to 
the expanded central government contribution 
to accommodation costs for job seekers. Gen -
eral purpose grants from state government 
stagnated overall, however. Receipts from fees 
fell by 4½% because childcare and other public 
facilities had restrictions on opening or were 
closed entirely on account of the pandemic.Stronger

national Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined from 2.5% to 
2.3%.

6 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain an in- depth description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter.

debt, see the statistical section of this report.Deutsche Bundesbank

Overall expenditure grew by 3%. Spending on 
social benefits rose especially steeply (6%), 
which was down to integration assistance in 
particular. By contrast, fixed asset formation 
declined (-4%), notably construction invest -
ment. In particular, this was more adversely af -
fected by weather conditions than last year.
A significant deficit is expected for the year as 
a whole (2020: surplus of €2 billion). The 
coronavirus crisis is likewise continuing to place 
a strain on local government finances, and the 
relief provided by central and state government 
is much smaller than in 2020. Based on the cur -
rent tax estimate, the Federal Ministry of Fi -
nance’s projection for the Stability Council 
shows just a slight increase in revenue. In par -
ticular, this reflects the absence of the €11 bil -
lion in compensation for shortfalls in local busi -
ness tax paid by central and state government 
last year. Expenditure is expected to rise signifi -
cantly, particularly on fixed asset formation. On 
balance, then, this leaves a deficit of close to 
€10 billion. In the medium term, local govern -
ment budgets will be more or less balanced ac -
cording to the tax revenue- adjusted forecast. 
Even so, it would still be advisable to funda -
mentally reform local government finances to 
put local government budgets on a stable foot -
ing and ensure they are commensurate with 
their tasks.7 This is important not least in view 
of the political objectives with regard to invest -
ing more heavily in local infrastructure.
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
The statutory health insurance (SHI) scheme 
– comprising the health insurance institutions 
and the health fund – posted a small surplus 
(+€½ billion) in the first quarter of 2021.8 This 
amounted to an improvement of €5 billion on 
the year, which was largely due to additional 
funds provided by central government. In add -
ition, expenditure saw relatively weak growth 
only, starting from an elevated level last year.The health fund recorded a surplus of €½ bil -
lion, following a deficit of €3 billion in the pre -
vious year. The strong improvement in the first 
quarter is chiefly attributable to additional cen -
tral government funds of €5 billion9 given that 
the fund passes on just one- quarter of this to 
the health insurance institutions each quarter. 
By contrast, there was a burden of almost €1 
billion on the balance, because central govern -
ment in some cases did not reimburse special … and expend -

8 In 2021, reserves totalling €8 billion will be redistributed 
among the health insurance institutions via the health fund 
(€2 billion per quarter). The payment flows associated with 
this redistribution between the health insurance institutions 
and the health fund do not influence the financial situation 
of the statutory health insurance scheme as a whole and its 
two constituent parts. The revenue and expenditure 
growth figures in this report are therefore adjusted for this.
9 The health fund will also receive €300 million for tempor -
arily increased child sick pay on account of the pandemic. 
The extra funds will initially increase the health fund’s re -

expenses related to the pandemic until later.10 
Excluding the delayed outflows and reimburse -
ments mentioned above, the health fund’s re -
sult was virtually unchanged on the year. On 
the revenue side, contributions increased by 
3½%. At the start of the year, the current sup -
plementary contribution rates rose by an aver -
age of almost 0.3 percentage point to around 
1.3%. Without the higher rates, contributions 
would have risen by 2%. Contributions on 
short- time working benefits and unemploy -
ment benefits dampened the negative employ -
ment effects. Contributions payable on pen -
sions increased by 4½%.11 Overall, fund rev -
enue went up by 19%. Expenditure grew by a total of 12½%, mainly owing to pandemic-  
related special expenses. The regular transfers 
to the health insurance institutions rose by 
4½%.
The health insurance institutions achieved a 
broadly balanced result. Last year, they had 
posted a deficit of €1½ billion. Their total rev -
enue increased by 3½%. Expenditure rose by 
just 1½%. Spending on pharmaceuticals grew 
by 1% only, although the previous year’s level 
was elevated: given the uncertainty prevailing 
at the start of the coronavirus crisis, prescrip -
tions were brought forward to the first quarter 
last year. Spending on hospital treatments, a 
major expenditure item, fell by 2%. Because of 
the pandemic, significantly fewer treatments 
were carried out than in the same quarter of 
the previous year.12 By contrast, there was 
steep growth in spending on outpatient treat -
ment (+7%). Sick pay saw another considerable 
increase of 5½%. Overall, spending on benefits 
rose by 2%. At the end of the quarter, the 
health insurance institutions still had reserves of 
€16½ billion (just under three- quarters of aver -
age monthly expenditure).
The health insurance institutions are expected 
to post a significant deficit for 2021 as a whole. 
However, it could be smaller than the €8 billion 
that the Federal Ministry of Health had planned 
for in the autumn of last year. The Ministry ex -
pected a major increase in expenditure of 
6½%. After the weak growth in the first quar -
ter, take- up of benefits should normalise going

10 The pandemic- related special expenses amounted to 
just over €5 billion. They consisted of financial assistance of 
€3 billion for hospitals to compensate them for empty beds 
owing to the pandemic. There was also spending on pro -
tective masks for risk groups (almost €1½ billion). Testing 
and vaccinations (mainly the cost share accruing to vaccin -
ation centres) each accounted for around €½ billion.
11 The higher rates barely played a role here, because they 
are generally carried over to pensions with a two- month 
delay.
12 Ongoing payments from the statutory health insurance 
scheme to hospitals still saw a strong year- on- year increase 
of 13%, since hospitals were compensated for empty beds 
in some cases.Deutsche Bundesbank

are likely to be undertaken. The surge in ex -
penditure needed to reach the annual rate 
expected  back then would be very high, how -
ever. All the same, allowance should be made 
for the continuing high level of uncertainty.
The health fund is set to post a deficit of €1 bil -
lion for 2021: funds are intended to flow from 
the reserves to the health insurance institutions 
to provide some compensation for the lower 
contributions on occupational pensions since 
2020. There will also be transfers to the innov -
ation fund and hospital structures fund. Growth 
in the contribution base could be very much in 
line with expectations, which would mean only 
limited deviations from the planned deficit.
Even beyond that, there is set to be strong 
pressure on finances. In order to avoid an in -
crease in supplementary contribution rates next 
year if possible, the statutory health insurance 
scheme will again receive additional central 
government funds. At €7 billion, these are €2 
billion higher than this year. The remaining 
funding gap is to be covered using the freely 
available reserves of the health insurance insti -
tutions, meaning that much of these will prob -
ably be used up. From 2023, significantly higher 
supplementary contributions are likely: no more 
substantial central government grants are 
planned, nor will the Federal budget have the 
scope for this.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €138.8 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in May 2021 was down slightly 
on the previous month’s figure (€146.8 billion). 
After deducting redemptions, which were 
lower than in the previous month, and taking 
account of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, net issuance of domestic 
debt securities came to €31.6 billion. The out -
standing volume of foreign debt securities in 
Germany rose by €1.8 billion during the report -ing month, boosting the outstanding volume 
of debt instruments in the German market by 
€33.4 billion overall.
The public sector issued debt securities to the 
tune of €28.3 billion net in the reporting 
month, compared with €9.0 billion in April. 
On balance, central government was the sole 
issuer of new securities (€28.9 billion), placing 
above all ten- year and 30- year Federal bonds in 
the market (Bunds; €9.5 billion and €6.2 bil -
lion, respectively), but also two-  year Federal 
Treasury notes (Schätze; €5.6 billion), five-  year 
Federal notes (Bobls; €5.0 billion), and Treasury 
discount paper (Bubills; €4.8 billion). State and 
local governments redeemed bonds worth 
€0.6 billion on balance.
Domestic enterprises issued bonds with a net 
value of €6.9 billion in the reporting month, 
compared with €6.1 billion in April. On bal -
ance, other financial intermediaries were the 
chief issuers.
In May, domestic credit institutions reduced 
their capital market debt by €3.6 billion net, 
following €2.7 billion in April. The outstanding 
volume of debt securities issued by specialised 
credit institutions – which include, for example, 
public promotional banks – fell by €3.5 billion, 
thereby accounting for the bulk of the decline. 
The outstanding volume of public Pfandbriefe 
and other bank debt securities that can be 
structured flexibly also shrank slightly (by €0.9 
billion and €0.3 billion, respectively). Only 
mortgage Pfandbriefe recorded net issuance 
(€1.1 billion).
The Bundesbank was the main buyer of bonds 
in May. It acquired debt securities amounting 
to €25.5 billion net, predominantly under the 
Eurosystem’s asset purchase programmes. Do -
mestic non- banks purchased bonds worth €5.9 
billion net. For the most part, this was foreign 
paper. Non- resident investors acquired German 
debt securities amounting to €4.2 billion net, 
while domestic credit institutions scaled back 
their bond portfolios by €2.2 billion net.Health fund:

Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed new shares worth €1.2 billion net in the 
German equity market. The volume of foreign 
equities in the German market rose by €2.8 bil -
lion over the same period. On balance, shares 
were purchased chiefly by domestic non- banks 
(€3.6 billion), but also by foreign investors (€0.8 
billion). By contrast, domestic credit institutions 
scaled back their equity exposure by €0.4 bil -
lion on balance.
Mutual funds
In May, German mutual funds recorded net in -
flows of €7.9 billion (April: €10.9 billion). On 
balance, specialised funds reserved for institu -
tional investors were the chief beneficiaries of 
such inflows (€4.5 billion). Among the various 
asset classes, new shares were placed in the market primarily by mixed securities funds (€5.6 
billion) and, to a lesser extent, by open- end real 
estate funds (€1.2 billion). The outstanding vol -
ume of foreign mutual fund units distributed in 
Germany rose by €4.7 billion in the reporting 
month. In May, domestic non- banks purchased 
mutual fund shares worth €10.9 billion net. 
German credit institutions and foreign investors 
acquired mutual fund shares worth €1.5 billion 
and €0.3 billion net, respectively.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €13.1 billion in May 2021, down €7.9 billion 
on the previous month’s level. In addition to 
the declining surplus in the goods account, the 
main reason for this decrease was the balance 
in invisible current transactions, which com -
prise primary and secondary income as well as 
services, switching from a surplus to a deficit.
In May, the surplus in the goods account fell by 
€1.1 billion on the month to €14.4 billion, with 
the exports of goods dipping somewhat, while 
goods imports remained virtually unchanged 
from the level in April.
The balance in invisible current transactions 
changed from a surplus in April, falling by €6.8 
billion to a deficit of €1.3 billion, largely be -
cause the net position in primary income con -
tracted by €6.7 billion to a slight deficit of €0.1 
billion. This was particularly driven by higher 
dividend payments to non- residents for port -
folio investment. In May, the surplus in the ser -
vices account narrowed as well, albeit to a 
lesser extent, falling by €1.6 billion to €1.2 bil -
lion. Receipts were down in various sub- items 
such as other business services. By contrast, the 
secondary income deficit shrank by €1.4 billion 
to €2.4 billion, with general government rev -
enue from current taxes on income and wealth 
increasing in particular.

ening growth outlook in conjunction with ris -
ing inflation expectations. It was against this 
backdrop that Germany’s cross- border port -
folio investment recorded net capital exports of 
€2.9 billion (after €25.9 billion in April). Domes -
tic investors added €8.1 billion worth of secur -
ities issued by non- residents to their portfolios. 
They acquired bonds (€4.9 billion), mutual fund 
shares (€4.7 billion) and shares (€1.6 billion) but 
offloaded money market paper (€3.2 billion). 
Conversely, foreign investors purchased Ger -
man securities in all asset classes amounting to 
€5.2 billion in total. They mainly invested in 
money market paper (€3.0 billion) and bonds 
(€1.1 billion) but also stocked up on shares 
(€0.7 billion) and mutual fund shares (€0.3 bil -
lion).
In May, financial derivatives again recorded net 
capital exports: these amounted to €3.6 billion.
Direct investment generated net capital im -
ports of €1.8 billion in May (up from €0.1 bil -
lion in April). Non- resident investors injected 
their affiliated enterprises in Germany with dir -
ect investment funds worth €4.7 billion net. 
They increased their equity by €1.2 billion and 
provided €3.4 billion via intra- group lending. 
German enterprises made net direct investment 
flows of €2.9 billion abroad. The increases they 
made to their equity in branches abroad of 
€5.2 billion were partly offset by repayments to 
affiliates abroad (€2.3 billion) for loans they 
had received previously.
Other statistically recorded investment – which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments – registered net 
outflows amounting to €1.8 billion in May (fol -
lowing inflows totalling €9.2 billion in April). 
Bundesbank accounts also recorded net capital 
exports (€35.3 billion). This was attributable to 
the €52.2 billion increase in TARGET2 claims on 
the ECB; non- residents’ deposits with the Bun -
desbank likewise rose, albeit to a lesser extent.

Cross- border corporate takeovers: 
the impact of internationalisation on 
enterprises  in Germany
Over the past few decades, the German economy has contributed greatly to the increasing inter -
national division of labour. Its integration into the global economy is the cornerstone of prosper -
ity in Germany. Alongside foreign trade, the free movement of capital has also played a signifi -
cant role in this. Direct investment is particularly relevant for domestic enterprises; in this vein, 
German firms have made significant investments abroad over the past few years, but the equity 
capital held in Germany by foreign companies is also substantial.
This article investigates the economic impact of the internationalisation of enterprises through 
direct investment. Such internationalisation occurs either when a previously national enterprise is 
taken over by a foreign company or when a previously national enterprise engages in foreign dir -
ect investment (FDI) for the first time. In general, enterprises profit from internationalisation 
through direct investment. Compared with their national competitors, such internationally linked 
enterprises show increasing productivity, more innovations and/ or higher turnover. Positive effects 
predominate on the labour market, too. However, this is not the case for all firms. The effects vary 
depending on the sector and the size of the enterprise. Enterprises which have restricted their 
activities to the national level may see themselves as the relative losers of globalisation, although 
the study does not explicitly state whether or not they regard themselves to be worse off than 
before in absolute terms in view of the globalisation of their competitors.
Overall, the results reiterate that the German economy is reaping substantial economic advan -
tages from direct investment in both directions, allaying the occasionally- voiced concern that for -
eign investors are primarily interested in German expertise and that a technology transfer could 
threaten the competitiveness of the German economy. Beyond this, however, there are also fears 
that foreign governments could have an influence on other countries’ security- related sectors or 
their systemically important infrastructures. These reservations apply, first and foremost, to state- 
affiliated investors from authoritarian states and have culminated both in Germany and the Euro -
pean Union in stricter regulation of corporate takeovers from third countries.
In view of the economic advantages of international corporate investments presented here, take -
overs of German firms by foreign firms should be prohibited for political reasons in exceptional 
cases only. It should also be borne in mind that due to a potential reciprocity of foreign govern -
ments’ measures, German enterprises may also be restricted in their investments abroad. This 
aspect is even more pertinent considering that the investment stocks of domestic multinational 
enterprises abroad amount to approximately twice the equivalent stocks of foreign companies 
held in Germany.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Over the past few decades, multilateral regula -
tions under the aegis of the World Trade Or -
ganization (WTO) as well as the formation of 
economic blocs and bilateral free trade and in -
vestment protection agreements have reduced 
investment and trade barriers and boosted 
globalisation.1 Here, direct investment repre -
sents a key form of global integration. It en -
ables enterprises to profit from competitive ad -
vantages in different countries. Local produc -
tion also makes it easier to consider consumer 
preferences in these countries. Germany has 
made a particularly great contribution towards 
continued international interconnectivity. In 
this vein, many major multinational enterprises 
are domiciled in Germany and run their pro -
duction sites or distributors in countries all over 
the world. However, smaller firms also often 
have branches based abroad or are planning to 
establish these in order to take their operations 
to the next strategic level. Conversely, foreign 
companies have reinforced their presence in 
Germany through purchases; economic output 
and the number of persons employed at do -
mestic enterprises with foreign parent com -
panies have attained considerable relevance for 
the German economy. In Germany, the broad 
consensus reached over the past few decades 
is that the international focus of the German 
economy has contributed significantly to the 
country’s high level of prosperity.
In the more recent past, however, potential 
negative side effects of this process have also 
come to the forefront of political and societal 
debate. Corporate takeovers, above all, are 
being viewed increasingly critically. In Germany, 
the purchase of a robot manufacturer and the 
failed takeover bid of a mechanical engineering 
company by foreign investors have even fuelled 
public debate. Critics of such takeovers argue 
that the new shareholders are usually only 
interested in the use of specific technologies 
and that the economic performance of the 
company they have acquired is of secondary 
importance – which could be linked to job losses, amongst other things. Furthermore, 
particularly in the case of state- affiliated enter -
prises from authoritarian states, they speculate 
that political and possibly also military aims are 
being pursued. A further criticism is that gain -
ing access to foreign markets is, in some cases, 
more difficult for German enterprises than vice 
versa. However, calls for general reciprocity in 
terms of restrictions have also come up against 
criticism.2 In its Annual Reports of 2016/ 17 and 
2017/ 18, the German Council of Economic Ex -
perts calls in its majority for open access to the 
German market for foreign investors, even if 
foreign markets do not open to German invest -
ors to the same degree.3
As a political consequence of the debate sur -
rounding foreign corporate takeovers with po -
tentially negative implications for the domestic 
economy, Germany’s Foreign Trade and Pay -
ments Regulation (Außenwirtschaftsverord -
nung)  underwent a reform in 2017 and was 
tightened further in December 2018. The new 
provisions stipulate that takeovers of strategic -
ally important enterprises by investors from 
non- EU countries are to be screened more Germany as part 
of the global 
economy

1 Here, there may also be a relationship between foreign 
trade and direct investment, as branches based abroad 
may support or even replace cross- border trade. In some 
instances, trading activities are also the preliminary steps 
towards direct investment. Furthermore, a significant share 
of foreign trade is attributable to cross- border trade within 
multinational enterprises. In the case of the United States, 
it accounted for around one- half of all trade with other ad -
vanced economies on an average of the years 2002 to 
2014 (Lakatos and Ohnsorge (2017), based on data from 
the US Census Bureau). Unsurprisingly, Germany’s foreign 
trade has also seen sizeable growth over the past few dec -
ades.
2 In China, for example, foreign investment was only pos -
sible through joint ventures for a long time. However, this 
obstacle did not constitute a burden in the view of some 
economic actors, as it facilitated integration into the local 
economic process. There are also enterprises in Germany 
that would have experienced economic issues without an 
affluent foreign investor. For information on joint ventures 
and technology transfer, see Jiang et al. (2019). For infor -
mation on the restrictions European enterprises in China 
face, see EURObiz (2016).

stringently and may potentially be prohibited.4 
Pursuing the same aim, the European Parlia -
ment and the European Council passed a regu -
lation in 2019 establishing a joint European 
legal framework for the screening of foreign 
direct investment. This provides 17 EU Member 
States (including Germany) with the necessary 
screening mechanisms to safeguard security 
and public order.5
Against the backdrop of this debate, this article 
first describes key developments in the direct 
investment of German enterprises abroad and 
foreign enterprises in Germany. Following this, 
the results of an empirical study by the author 
are presented. The aim of this study is to exam -
ine the extent to which key enterprise metrics 
of the German subsidiaries of foreign enter -
prises differ from those of purely German en -
terprises. The same question is analysed for 
German enterprises which have engaged in FDI 
for the first time.
Globalisation in direct 
investment 
International capital links through direct invest -
ment have exhibited very strong dynamics since 
the 1990s. According to UNCTAD,6 global in -
vestment stocks at end- 2019, at the equivalent 
of around €31 trillion, far exceeded the level 
recorded   at end-  1990 (just over €1½ trillion). 
Robust stock growth was interrupted only tem -
porarily by declines, which were in part due to 
value adjustments. This was seen during the 
dotcom crisis of 2002 and the international 
finan cial crisis of 2008, for instance. Given the 
greatly reduced activity in many economic sec -
tors, the coronavirus pandemic is also likely to 
leave its mark. However, as direct investment is 
generally planned on a long- term basis and 
with a lead time, there will be a lag before the 
full impact of the crisis- related decline is visible 
in future stock figures. It remains to be seen 
whether a changed risk assessment of inter -
national interdependencies will result in a per -manent adjustment to value chains, with cor -
responding effects on direct investment.
Cross- border mergers and acquisitions (M&A 
for short) have been a driving force behind the 
increasing importance of direct investment, ac -
counting for high transaction volumes in some 
instances. Corporate takeovers frequently occur Steep global rise

4 The Regulation also defines the corporate actions that 
could affect public order in concrete terms. In particularly 
sensitive fields, a transaction may be subject to screening at 
a voting rights threshold as low as 10% (previously 25%). 
See Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (2019, 
2020).
5 The investment screening relates to the European level. 
FDI is thus to be interpreted as investment from third coun -
tries outside of the European Union. However, the actual 
form the regulations take may differ slightly between 
Member States in terms of percentages of voting rights 
and screening prior to and after the takeover. See also 
Regulation (EU) 2019/ 452. A possible circumvention of the 
law via holding structures is also studied in more detail 
within the scope of the investment screening procedure 
(see FAQ on investment screening under the Foreign Trade 
and Payments Regulation) published on 13 May 2019 at

in waves (sometimes known as merger waves), 
which are chiefly triggered by deregulation 
measures and are also associated with fluctu -
ations on the stock markets, as was the case 
during the dotcom bubble.7 Corporate take -
overs are frequently reliant on external finan -
cing, the drying- up of which partly explained 
their steep decline during the financial crisis. 
The international interconnectedness of direct 
investment and trading activity is particularly 
pronounced in economic blocs and geograph -
ical regions with investment and trade agree -
ments.8 That said, the lion’s share of corporate 
takeovers still take place at the national level, in 
spite of such integration efforts.
German enterprises also contribute towards 
globalisation by means of direct investment; 
they upped their consolidated stock of FDI 
from just over €120 billion at the end of 1990 
to a little under €1½ trillion at end- 2019.9 Dir-
ect investment by foreign enterprises in Ger -
many was not quite able to keep pace; having been only around one- quarter lower than Ger -
man enterprises’ FDI at the end of 1990, it 
amounted to considerably less than half of this 
at the end of 2019, at just over €550 billion. 
These divergent developments are also re -
flected in the employment figures – between 
end- 1999 and end- 2018, the number of per -
sons employed at the foreign branches of Ger -
man companies almost doubled from just over 
4 million to slightly under 8 million.10 Con -
versely, the number of persons employed at 
German branches of foreign enterprises in -
creased from around 2 million to over 3 million 
in the same period.11

employed at branches with primary or secondary (held 
through holding companies) participating interests are also 
consolidated figures.
11 The discrepancy between the number of persons em -
ployed at the foreign and domestic ends of Germany’s dir -
ect investment operations suggests that production pro -
cesses at the foreign branches are comparatively labour-  
intensive. In view of Germany’s wage level, which is rela -
tively high from an international perspective, this is 
unsurprising.
12 Conversely, broken down by investment enterprises’ dir -
ect holdings per region, the EU even accounted for over 
one- half of German direct investment in 2019, whereas the 
absolute share attributable to the United States was corres -
pondingly lower. This discrepancy shows the great import -
ance of involving holding companies based in the EU, par -
ticularly in direct investment relationships with the United 
States.Deutsche Bundesbank

eighth, lagged behind the top two target re -
gions despite brisk growth over the past few 
years. A glance at the individual investment tar -
get countries outside the EU shows that the 
United States ranked highest, ahead of the 
United Kingdom and the People’s Republic of 
China. The order changes when looking at the 
number of people employed at branches; here, 
the United States ranked above China, and the 
United Kingdom followed in third place by a 
relatively wide margin. China’s higher ranking 
in this area could be seen as an indication of its 
comparatively labour- intensive production pro -
cesses.
Domestic enterprises invested in different eco -
nomic sectors – foreign branches in the manu -
facturing sector accounted for one- third of all 
direct investment stock, employing around 
one- half of the staff working at German for -
eign branches.13 Other important sectors in -
cluded financial and insurance services (one-  
quarter of stocks) and the repair of motor ve -
hicles and motorcycles (one- eighth of stocks). 
In addition, holding companies both with and 
without a management function assumed a 
special role.
The origin of foreign direct investors in Ger -
many at the end of 2019 largely matched the 
direction of German enterprises’ direct invest -
ment. In terms of investment broken down by 
region of origin, the EU, with just under 60% 
of all direct investment stock in Germany, 
ranked above the Americas, with a share of 
slightly less than 20%. Asian countries ac -
counted for just over one- tenth of such invest -
ment. In a breakdown of individual countries 
outside of the EU, the United States once again 
took the lead, also in terms of the number of 
persons employed at its branches in Germany, 
followed by companies from Switzerland.
Direct investment by foreign enterprises in Ger -
many was spread across several sectors at the 
end of 2019, albeit in a different ranking order 
to that of the foreign enterprises of German in -
vestors. Investment in the area of financial and insurance services (around one-  third of all in -
vestment) exceeded investment in the manu -
facturing sector (roughly one- quarter of invest -
ment). However, the number of persons em -
ployed at the branches was far greater in the 
manufacturing sector than in financial and in -
surance services. Significantly more staff were 
employed in the trade sector, too.
The FDI stocks of foreign firms in sectors that 
would be especially sensitive to a potential 
technology transfer were comparatively low; at 
around €17 billion, or less than 2% of all FDI 
stocks, investment was still highest in the do -
mestic manufacture of machinery and equip -

(€5½ billion) was significantly lower. In the pro -
duction of electronic components and boards, 
stocks stood at just over €2½ billion.
In a 2021 survey conducted by the Association 
of German Chambers of Commerce and Indus -
try (DIHK), German investors highlighted three 
motives that were particularly important for 
their foreign investment decisions. Multiple an -
swers were possible, and over 40% of respond -
ents stated that setting up sales and customer 
services played a crucial role in their decision to 
invest abroad. 30% of firms planned to estab -
lish local production facilities in order to gain 
access to the local market (horizontal direct in -
vestment). Conversely, just over one- quarter of 
the surveyed enterprises intended to reduce 
production costs by shifting production to 
other countries, stating that the outsourcing of 
production stages to foreign sites was aimed at 
increasing overall production efficiency (vertical 
direct investment). In 2003 and 2004, cost sav -
ings still constituted the most important motive 
for investing abroad.
In addition, particularly with cross- border cor -
porate acquisitions, an expanded knowledge 
base in terms of both production technologies 
and management capabilities is crucial. Expert -
ise is key to the long- term development poten -
tial and the competitiveness of German enter -
prises which bring their activities abroad; the 
same applies to foreign companies conducting 
operations in Germany.14
Impacts of 
internationalisation 
The enterprises’ own objectives, impacts on 
staff and society’s expectations or fears are key 
benchmarks for assessing the success of inter -
nationalisation. With a view to efficient pro -
duction –  with production stages potentially 
spread out over multiple sites – questions arise 
regarding trends in firm productivity and also 
innovations. The primary yardstick for assessing 
success in opening up new distribution chan -nels is the pattern of turnover following inter -
nationalisation. Moreover, it needs to be clari -
fied whether jobs have actually been lost at ac -
quired firms, as feared. Conversely, the ques -
tion that investor companies will pose is 
whether domestic employment has been re -
duced by, for instance, outsourcing production 
activities or has potentially even benefited 
thanks to increased division of labour or the 
opening- up of new markets.
Owing to the variety of different rationales be -
hind foreign investment, it stands to reason 
that various characteristics of enterprises sway 
acquirers’ decisions regarding the acquisition of 
firms in Germany. Conversely, enterprises that 
engage in FDI are likely to display particular 
traits as well. These selection criteria first need 
to be examined in order to avoid distorting the 
results of an analysis of the subsequent effects 
(a phenomenon known as “selection bias”). 
This was accomplished by examining around 
1,800 takeovers of German firms by foreign in -
vestors and around 900 German firms en -
gaging in FDI for the first time over the period 
from 1999 to 2018.15 German firms’ FDI con -
sisted of either takeovers of existing firms or 
start- ups on “greenfield sites” (see the box on 
pp. 21ff.)
A Bundesbank study that links data from Ger -
man direct investment statistics with other firm 
properties shows that enterprises in Germany 
which are taken over by foreign firms often 
share similar traits to German firms engaging in 
FDI for the first time. To prove the point, it was 
primarily relatively large and innovative firms 
– in both manufacturing and services – which 
ventured into internationalisation. Where for -
eign takeovers were concerned, acquirers were 
apparently interested in the existing expertise 
at the target firm; conversely, German investors 
exported specialised knowledge to their for -
eign subsidiaries. Interestingly, the profits of Highly complex

Impact of takeovers of German ﬁ  rms by foreign investors 
and of German ﬁ  rms’ ﬁ  rst- time foreign direct investment 
on the performance of the ﬁ  rms involved*
The object of the present analysis is to 
examine the extent to which the productiv-
ity1, sales, innovations2 and labour costs of 
German aﬃ   liates of foreign parent com-
panies have developed as compared to Ger-
man enterprises that are active on the Ger-
man market exclusively.3 This study also 
looks at whether German ﬁ  rms that carry 
out foreign direct investment for the ﬁ  rst 
time differ from purely domestic enter-
prises. The impact of ﬁ  nancial globalisation 
is consequently examined in both invest-
ment directions.
The study combines information from two 
Bundesbank datasets. The Microdatabase 
Direct investment (MiDi) contains informa-
tion on Germany’s bilateral foreign direct 
investment relationships in both directions. 
A key advantage of the MiDi is that German 
ﬁ  rms are, under certain circumstances, le-
gally obliged to report their foreign direct 
investments to the Bundesbank.4 Any bal-
ance sheet items of foreign (German) aﬃ   li-
ates held by German (foreign) parent com-
panies have to be reported. In addition, the 
database includes information on the own-
ership structure and on the industry classiﬁ  -
cations of the parent companies and aﬃ   li-
ates involved.
Information on ﬁ  rms’ performance is taken 
from the Bundesbank’s JANIS database, 
which contains individual annual ﬁ  nancial 
statements as well as the proﬁ  t and loss ac-
counts of German non- ﬁ  nancial corpor-
ations.5 The JANIS ﬁ  rms are each separately 
linked to an investment direction as per the 
MiDi.6 The ﬁ  rst part of the study, which 
looks at developments in a German ﬁ  rm 
after takeover by a foreign investor, takes into account only the reports of domestic 
aﬃ   liates from the MiDi. Conversely, the 
second part of the analysis, which looks at 
German enterprises carrying out a foreign 
direct investment for the ﬁ  rst time, only 
uses the reports of domestic parent com-
panies.
On this basis, three categories of ﬁ  rm can 
be distinguished: German parent com-
panies that acquired or established at least 
one foreign aﬃ   liate during the period under 
analysis; German aﬃ   liates that were taken 
over by a foreign owner; and ﬁ  rms that had 
no foreign direct investment relationship 
over the entire period (“purely national 
* The analysis is based on the research paper: R. Frey 
and S. Goldbach, “Beneﬁ  ts of internationalisation for 
acquirers and targets – but unevenly distributed”, 
Deutsche Bundesbank Discussion Paper, forthcoming.
1 The analysis looks at total factor productivity (TFP). 
TFP is calculated using the method of Levinsohn and 
Petrin (2003), with separate estimations for all two- 
digit NACE 2 classiﬁ  cations (under the assumption of 
different production functions).
2 As measured by the volume of intangible assets.
3 Besides labour costs as a whole, information on em-
ployment and wages as separate metrics is also of 
interest. However, information on employment is less 
comprehensive in the underlying data sources, mean-
ing that several enterprises would be excluded from 
the analysis. The study therefore concentrates on 
labour  costs because data availability is better there.
4 The deﬁ  nition of a foreign direct investment must be 
met here. This is the case if, amongst other things, the 
stake in a foreign enterprise is at least 10% and the 
foreign ﬁ  rm’s total assets amount to at least €3 mil-
lion. For further information on reporting require-
ments, see https://www.bundesbank.de/en/statistics/

fi  rms”).7 Both parts of the analysis use the 
merged observations from the two datasets 
as well as unmatched observations from 
the JANIS database. In order to assess not 
only short- term, but also long- term effects, 
only fi  rms with observations for at least fi  ve 
consecutive years are included (for corpor-
ate takeovers: the two years before the 
takeover, the year of the takeover itself and 
the two years after the takeover).8 The an-
nual data are available as an unbalanced 
panel from 1999 to 2018 and encompass 
roughly 360,000 fi  rm- year observations. 
Roughly 1,800 German fi  rms were taken 
over by a foreign investor over this period, 
and around 900 German enterprises carried 
out their fi  rst foreign direct investment.9 
The control group of purely domestic fi  rms 
comprises approximately 57,000 fi  rms.
The empirical analysis uses a multi- stage ap-
proach in order to take into account poten-
tial self- selection effects of internationalisa-
tion.10 The procedure is described based on the fi  rst part of the study (takeover of a 
German fi  rm by a foreign investor); the 
second part is carried out in an analogous 
manner (German fi  rm engaging in fi  rst- time 
foreign direct investment).
In a fi  rst step, a probit model is used to de-
termine the probability of a German fi  rm i 
being taken over at time t:
7 If fi  rms move from “national” to “international” and 
back during the observation period, only the fi  rst step 
is classed as internationalisation for the purpose of the 
estimations. Firms that were part of an international 
group at the beginning of the observation period have 
been disregarded, even if they lost that status in the 
years that followed.
8 This qualifi  cation is based on the academic literature, 
which looks at long- term developments in corporate 
takeovers (see Egger et al. (2020)).
9 The takeover of a German fi  rm by a foreign investor 
is identifi  ed using a data- driven process. Assuming a 
fi  rm is contained in the JANIS database throughout the 
period 1999 to 2018 and is also included in the MiDi 
as a domestic affi   liate (K4 report) from 2001 onwards, 
then the year 2001 would be interpreted as a corpor-
ate takeover by a foreign investor.
10 The empirical literature shows that fi  rms do not 
serve a foreign market at random. These fi  rms tend, on 
average, to have certain properties. Not taking them 
into account would distort the estimation results.Example of total factor productivity (TFP):

ket entry using TFP as an example.12 The fact 
that effects are signifi  cant suggests self- 
selection in internationalisation. Column (1) 
illustrates that in manufacturing foreign 
buyers are interested in large fi  rms, high in-
novations, high turnover and relatively low 
labour costs. The coeffi   cients in column (2) 
show that, for the services sector, larger 
fi  rms with higher productivity combined 
with higher labour costs, lower fi  xed assets 
and lower profi  ts are preferred. According 
to columns (3) and (4), German investors 
carrying out foreign direct investment for 
the fi  rst time tend to be large fi  rms with 
higher innovations and lower fi  xed assets.
Based on the previous probit estimation, a 
likelihood of takeover or likelihood of mar-
ket entry can be calculated for every fi  rm at 
every point in time. In a second step, pro-
pensity score matching is used to attempt 
to determine an optimum control enter-
prise for every fi  rm that is taken over and 
therefore belongs to the treatment group. 
To this end, radius matching with a small ra-
dius is used for the same two- digit NACE 2 
sector and the same year.13 In order to as-
sess how well matching works, a covari-
ance balance test is conducted. This test 
requires  the distribution in the treatment 
group to be as close to that of the control 
group as possible. This condition is met in 
the present analysis. The two identifi  ed 
groups consequently appear to be readily 
comparable.
In the third step, the analysis uses a 
difference- in- difference estimator. Average 
developments in the respective perform-
ance metric in the treatment and control 
group are compared to one another. The 
following equation is estimated:

have been taken over, is one in year k (max-
imum of two years) after the corporate 
takeover and zero otherwise;14 µi stands for 
fi  rm- specifi  c fi  xed effects, whereas ρjt repre-
sents sector- time- specifi  c fi  xed effects. The 
estimation is carried out separately for the 
manufacturing and the services sector and 
takes clustered standard errors into consid-
eration at the fi  rm level.
In a further specifi  cation of the differences- 
in- differences estimator, the study addition-
ally takes the infl  uence of fi  rm size into ac-
count:

foreign investors. In manufacturing, small

of the four performance metrics. This differs from the 
table on p. 22 only in the last variable. For the probit 
estima tion of turnover, all explanatory variables are 
identical except for the previous period’s TFP growth: 
here, the previous period’s turnover growth is used. 
The estima tion coeffi   cients for the other parameters 
are virtually  unchanged for the respective performance 
metrics.

bour matching or radius matching for estimations. Nei-
ther the selected radius nor the method change the

the new “multinationals” started out from a 
relatively below- average base. Short- term 
profits might possibly not have been the pri -
mary focus at this stage; below- average profit -
ability of a target firm, associated with a low 
firm valuation, could well have even made this 
firm enticing to potential suitors.
Building on this preliminary review, the central 
section of the study addresses the question of 
the advantageousness of internationalisation 
from the point of view of a freshly acquired 
company and a firm engaging in FDI for the 
first time. Manufacturing and service firms will 
be looked at separately, and a distinction be -
tween firms by size will be made as well.16 
Lastly, this section will examine the extent to 
which the impacts unfold more in the short or 
long term.
The study yielded positive effects regarding 
productivity, in both the short and somewhat 
longer term. However, not all firms benefited equally. Rather, the study produced heteroge -
neous results which varied by sector and firm 
size: the positive effects for German manufac -
turers acquired by foreign firms were driven by 
developments among the somewhat smaller 
enterprises. This classification refers, however, 
to companies actually acquired, which, as men -
tioned above, are on average larger than firms 
that have remained national. By contrast, in the 
services sector it was the larger target firms 
which made productivity gains.17 The study 
identifies similar productivity gains for German 
investors among smaller manufacturing com -
panies, but not among firms in the services sec -
tor.

Result: positive 
outcomes for 
productivity, …productivity, turnover, innovations and 
labour  costs in the short and long term – 
measured in each case against the control 
group. For services, fi  rms display positive 
signifi  cant short- term and long- term effects 
for productivity and turnover.
The bottom table on p. 23 presents the re-
sults for domestic parent companies mak-
ing their fi  rst foreign direct investment. In 
manufacturing, small fi  rms in particular dis-
play positive short- term and long- term 
effects  in terms of productivity, turnover 
and labour costs. Looking at services, the 
results are similar: small fi  rms achieve posi-
tive short- term and long- term effects for 
turnover and labour costs as a result of the 
corporate takeover. Only for productivity is 
there no signifi  cant effect. In return, small 
fi  rms also tend to achieve positive effects in 
terms of innovations in the long term.The objective of this study was to examine 
whether takeovers by foreign investors or 
fi  rst- time foreign direct investment infl  u-
ence certain performance measures at the 
fi  rms in question. The results of the analysis 
suggest that the free movement of capital 
in foreign direct investment tends to have 
positive effects on average: the affected 
enter prises perform better, on average, 
than companies that operate exclusively in 
their home country. This is true for both in-
vestment directions. The results further 
demonstrate that the effects may differ de-
pending on the sector, fi  rm size and dynam-
ics. The same is true of individual fi  rms’ per-
formance trends. In order to make infer-
ences about the effects of corporate take-
overs on individual enterprises, other 
methods would have to be used – for in-
stance, case studies.
16 In the study, the size is the sum of fixed assets and in -
tangible assets. Robustness checks using total assets as a 
measure of size do not change the results.

considerably smaller than in manufacturing.Deutsche Bundesbank

vides clues regarding the contribution of inter -
nationalisation to productivity developments. 
The evolution of gross value added serves as a 
benchmark.18 Up until the beginning of the 
global financial crisis, the value added of for -
eign firms’ German subsidiaries grew at above- 
average rates; their growth subsequently 
dropped somewhat behind the developments 
for the overall economy. The value added of 
FDI firms domiciled in Germany evolved largely 
consistently with aggregate value added but, in 
most years, posted slightly higher gains.
The success of an enterprise, especially in the 
long term, also hinges on its innovations and 
expertise. This matters particularly to com -
panies in highly competitive sectors. The study 
uses the stock of intangible assets as an indica -
tor. This comprises, for instance, the value of 
research and development, management tech -
nologies, but also brand names.19 In the study, 
smaller manufacturing firms’ innovations ex -
perienced positive short and long- term effects 
following takeover by foreign companies – as 
was already previously the case with regard to 
productivity. As regards the services sector, the 
positive effects were weak and restricted to 
larger enterprises in the short run. This initially 
refutes concerns voiced upfront that takeovers 
by foreign firms could lead to a technology 
transfer to the parent and a loss of innovation 
capacity here in Germany.
German firms’ initial forays abroad had virtually 
nil impact on their own innovations.
In comparison with the universe of firms in 
Germany, international firms showed a higher- 
than- average increase in the stock of intangible 
assets between 1999 and 2018. Stocks varied 
strongly among German subsidiaries of foreign 
firms; this was attributable at least in part also 
to isolated takeovers of larger enterprises. The 
higher than average increase in intangible 
assets among German group parent companies 
appears to have been driven by firms that were 
already operating internationally prior to the 
observation period. In the study, these firms are not recorded as operating internationally for 
the first time. The relevant move, therefore, 
already  happened further in the past. Positive 
impacts of an international orientation may 
well make themselves felt only in the very long 
term, which is not adequately captured by the 
present study.20 At all events, one argument in 
favour of this interpretation is that no impacts 
in this area were identified among German 
investors  engaging in FDI for the first time. It 
seems plausible that established groups exert a 
major influence because, amongst other things, 
they are, on average, considerably larger than 
the new entrants.
A further key motive for FDI is to enlarge distri -
bution channels for products already contained 
in the firm’s range. Based on turnover figures, 
the study identifies positive impacts of inter -
nationalisation in terms of achieving this ob -
jective, too, though the results are once again 
heterogeneous: as was the case for productiv -
ity and innovations, it was, in particular, smaller 
manufacturing firms which benefited in the 
short and long term from being taken over by 
a foreign firm. In the services sector, the identi -
fied turnover effects were largely independent 
of firm size. On the other hand, among those 
German firms to go international, it has con -
sistently been precisely the smaller companies 
that have seen an increase in turnover.
Relative to the German corporate universe, 
German parents of foreign subsidiaries have 
seen a strong rise in turnover. This growth was 
especially dynamic following the slump in -
duced by the global financial crisis. By contrast,

ations, …

18 Value added is just one of several determinants which 
feed into the calculation of productivity. That makes it only 
a very rough approximation of productivity growth, and 
only limited conclusions can be drawn from this. At the ag -
gregate level, adding net taxes on products to gross value 
added yields gross domestic product.
19 The firm’s expertise can have a positive impact on prod -
uctivity efficiency, product innovations and – where brand 
names are concerned – marketing opportunities.

foreign groups recently underperformed com -
pared with the universe of firms in Germany.
Owing to data availability issues, the impact of 
internationalisation on staff is imputed based 
on trends in labour costs,21 which are impacted 
by both salary levels and the number of per -
sons employed and therefore provide only a 
rough guidepost for the trend path of employ -
ment. Thus, an increase in labour costs may 
very well be reflected in higher wages, which 
could potentially be attributable to more 
highly- skilled staff, without an increase in the 
number of employees or their hours worked 
having occurred. Given this indicator, it has 
been particularly smaller firms in manufacturing 
and in services which have experienced observ -
able positive short and long- term effects of a 
takeover. On balance, there was no evidence of 
negative impacts of internationalisation on the 
domestic labour market. Rather, there was a 
tendency to hire additional staff, or effective 
hours worked were increased, or higher wages 
were paid. No negative effects on employment 
were visible with regard to German parent 
companies which went abroad, either. Smaller 
firms even increased their expenditure on local 
national staff, in both manufacturing and ser -
vices.
Compared with the pattern of total labour 
compensation in Germany, the development of 
labour costs of all domestic German subsidiar -
ies of foreign parents over the entire 1999 to 
2018 period was positive – even despite the 
post- 2015 slump. The pattern of employment 
figures reported in the FDI stock statistics, fit -
tingly, is likewise positive. By contrast, however, 
the labour costs of international parent com -
panies domiciled in Germany initially moved 
sideways –  declining significantly during the 
dotcom crisis and the global financial crisis – … and with

before turning on to a path of growth as from 
2009.
To sum up, compared with the economy as a 
whole, it is particularly the larger and more in -
novative firms which tend to go international. 
Existing expertise that can also be applied at a 
newly acquired firm can make it an enticing 
proposition to go abroad. Conversely, an acqui -
sition can also open up access to the new sub -
sidiary’s knowledge base. Amongst inter -
national manufacturing enterprises, in the past 
it tended to be smaller firms which benefited 
from positive effects on productivity and turn -
over. This would indicate that they were able to 
successfully set up cross- border value chains or 
additional distribution channels at the new lo -
cation. Domestic firms taken over by foreign 
firms gained additional expertise – counter to 
occasionally voiced fears. In the services sector, 
stakeholding firms, depending on their size, 
were likewise able to grow their productivity 
and turnover, in particular. Over the observa -
tion period, however, there were far fewer in -
vestors from the services sector than in manu -
facturing – as regards domestic target firms, 
both sectors were roughly evenly represented. 
One possible explanation for this asymmetry is 
that Germany’s small and medium- sized enter -
prises are relatively strong and internationally 
competitive in the manufacturing sector and 
are also leveraging their good position abroad.
A note on the informative value of the study: 
the dataset is not sufficient to study any long- 
term effect above and beyond three years. The 
dataset does not permit the clear identification 
of firms which remain in existence for fewer 
than three years post- takeover. Furthermore, 
the case figures are too small to conduct esti -
mations confined to firms which are relevant in 
terms of ensuring public utilities in Germany, 
for instance. For the same reason, a distinction 
by individual partner country cannot be made, 
either.Conclusion
In the past few decades, the integration of the 
global economy has been highly dynamic, not 
least in the area of direct investment. This has 
also been reflected in the employment figures 
for multinational corporations. In the mean -
time, global economic interconnectedness has 
reached a considerable extent and has become 
an indispensable part of economic activity in 
the economies involved. The continued dyna -
mism of internationalisation – despite fluctu -
ations – is a sign that most FDI benefits the par -
ticipating companies. The study presented here 
confirms a multitude of positive effects on firms 
which go international. However, the results 
are heterogeneous: not all enterprises benefit 
in equal measure, and the firms that have con -
tinued to operate purely nationally could re -
gard themselves as losers of globalisation, 
given the positive performance of their com -
petitors.
Internationalisation has typically had a positive 
impact on the involved firms’ productivity, in -
novations and turnover, probably making not 
only these firms themselves, but also the sector 
as a whole, more competitive – which is also 
likely to have benefited consumers, in particu -
lar. In addition, employees have also usually 
benefited in the form of higher wages or rising 
employment figures. The fear voiced in the 
public debate that takeovers of German firms 
by foreign companies could lead to job losses 
may materialise in isolated cases – yet the re -
verse has been more frequently observed. Con -
versely, too, the study does not find any empir -
ical evidence that German firms cut domestic 
jobs following FDI – for instance, through sub -
stantial outsourcing of activities previously lo -
cated in Germany.
Given the overwhelmingly positive impacts of 
global interconnectedness and how highly rele -
vant to the involved economies cross- border 
firms have now become, national governments 
should only intervene in the free movement of 
capital with care: efforts to protect sensitive Large and

domestic infrastructures against manipulation 
from abroad or the desire to classify, in individ -
ual cases, specialised high- tech firms as merit -
ing protection out of national security consid -
erations must not be used as a pretext for un -
justified protectionist interference in freedom 
of investment. Not only would the direct bene -
fits to the economic sectors allegedly to be pro -
tected be dubious, but potential retaliatory 
measures abroad should also be borne in mind. 
After all, it is not only foreign investors that are 
interested in German firms; German firms are 
also seeking to improve their international 
competitiveness by acquiring foreign com -panies. It is precisely for German groups that 
open markets are particularly important: Ger -
man firms’ FDI stocks are roughly double the 
number of foreign subsidiaries in Germany.
Policymakers should therefore focus on deriv -
ing maximum benefit from globalisation and 
mitigating potential risks by taking transparent 
and globally coordinated precautions. A suit -
able framework is provided not least by the 
European capital markets union, along with ex -
tensive investment and trade agreements be -
tween the European Union and its partner 
countries.

Crypto tokens and decentralised financial 
applications
Decentralised financial applications deliver financial services in combination with crypto tokens 
across distributed networks, replacing intermediaries such as banks, exchanges or insurers. This 
fast- growing business area is a melting pot of innovation, and the boundaries between decentral -
ised financial applications and the conventional financial system are becoming increasingly por -
ous.
Participants in these networks use blockchain technology and modifiable open source program 
code to develop technical solutions such as algorithm-  based consensus mechanisms and what 
are known as smart contracts – programs that automatically execute transactions – to replace 
trust in intermediaries and minimise administrative intervention in the financial services offered. 
Decentralised financial applications’ use cases are much the same as those found in the conven -
tional financial system: there are decentralised trading platforms, decentralised forms of lending 
or deposit business, decentralised stablecoins, decentralised derivatives issuance and trading, and 
also the first forms of decentralised insurance policies.
Decentrality has many sides to it, and in its purest form, appears to be more of a theoretical con -
struct. Even the decentralised financial applications used in practice employ centrally managed 
governance processes as stabilisation mechanisms or to fix code bugs, for instance. And at the 
end of the day, the conventional financial system as a whole can also be regarded as a hybrid of 
centralised and decentralised structures.
Decentralised financial applications are still in their infancy and need to overcome some major 
challenges: software bugs can be a source of security risks which centralised administrative struc -
tures could manage to keep in check; not all programmed incentive systems are capable of elim -
inating misconduct altogether; the public blockchains used often cannot cope with larger busi -
ness volumes; interoperability across blockchains and with off- chain systems is limited; and inter -
connectedness means that problems can ripple out across applications, potentially endangering 
the ecosystem as a whole.
Assuming the risks can be kept in check and effective governance mechanisms are assured, 
decentralised financial applications can be expected to provide important impetus for the finan -
cial system. These technologies might end up being adopted by the conventional financial sys -
tem, say, or the governance mechanisms built into individual decentralised financial applications 
might evolve centralised structures, causing them to become part of the conventional financial 
system. It is also conceivable that parts of the conventional financial system will be crowded out, 
or that financial market incumbents will offer their customers access to decentralised financial 
services as intermediaries.
All in all, decentralised financial applications are likely to promote innovation in the conventional 
financial system. Effective regulation of decentralised financial applications could increase trust in 
this market segment and boost growth there, even if regulators face particular challenges in this 
regard.Deutsche Bundesbank

Decentralised financial 
applications : origins and 
basic idea
The financial system has seen innovation over 
the past ten years, not least due to the emer -
gence of crypto tokens1 such as Bitcoin and 
Ether. Crypto tokens have attracted a great 
deal of attention, mainly on account of their 
volatility, but their technological features have 
also met with interest. These developments, 
which are based on distributed ledger technol -
ogy (DLT),2 remain a rich source of innovative 
potential, having already led to the issuance of 
stablecoins, the debate conducted almost 
worldwide on tokenised forms of money, in -
cluding central bank digital currency (CBDC), 
and the increasing uptake of DLT for settlement 
in the conventional financial system.3 A whole 
raft of decentralised financial applications have 
also emerged. These DLT- based solutions de -
liver various financial services in combination 
with crypto tokens without any need for cen -
tralised intermediaries such as banks, ex -
changes or insurers. The use cases are much 
the same as those in the conventional financial 
system: there is trading based on crypto tokens, 
for example, or collateralised lending in crypto 
tokens.
Views differ on what it means for a network to 
be “decentralised”, though many would agree 
it primarily means the network is free of inter -
mediation4 – that is to say, transactions take 
place directly between the network partici -
pants without intermediary involvement. A 
conventional credit transfer from one agent to 
another, for example, would normally require 
the involvement of at least one account-  
keeping bank. However, involving intermediar -
ies is always a question of trust, which makes it 
a potential source of uncertainty. Hence, the 
declared aim of decentralised financial applica -
tions is to create a system in which transactions 
can be settled without any need for trusted 
third parties. That means defining procedural 
rules and incentives that enable the system to run without administrative intervention and 
stabilise itself if required.
The reasons mentioned in the literature for the 
push towards decentralised applications, above 
all in the world of finance, are of a technical, 
political and economic nature: distributed sys -
tems, it is claimed, are less vulnerable to cyber 
risks, are censorship- proof,5 and eliminate the 
potential risk of intermediary misconduct.6 
Intermediaries can perform all manner of func -
tions, from the safekeeping or management of 
assets to pricing, and all the way to running in -
frastructures and optimising their workflows. 
Accordingly, the degree of decentralisation 
– the freedom from intermediation – can be 
measured by multiple criteria, such as the ab -
sence of central agents, the existence of open 
source code that anyone can program, process 
transparency, transaction traceability, or the in -
ability to identify stakeholder network partici -
pants.
The conventional financial system as a whole 
can be regarded as a hybrid of centralised and 
decentralised structures. While intermediaries 
such as banks, depositories, payment systems, 
central counterparties and custodians play im -
portant roles, and even tend towards monop -
olising market infrastructures in some cases, 
the most extreme form of centralisation – cen -
tral provision – does not exist in practice in its 
unadulterated form. Indeed, custodians and Decentralised

2 Distributed ledger (DL) normally means a database 
shared across a network which gives participants joint 
rights to write, read and store entries in the ledger. The 
most common DLT applications are based on blockchain 
technology, which has proven to be a particularly useful 
ledger for recording histories of transactions. See Deutsche

2008 partly in response to the financial crisis. The first 
block of the Bitcoin blockchain (the “genesis block”) from 
January 2009 contains a reference to a report on the UK 
government’s second bailout for banks, which is read as a 
critique of intermediaries.Deutsche Bundesbank

depositories tend to be rivals; there are gener -
ally legally enforceable rights for participation 
in financial market infrastructures; and the 
levels of transparency and objectivity surround -
ing procedural rules are significant, protecting 
the interests of individual agents. Most notably, 
agents can invoke antitrust law to limit the 
negative implications of monopolistic tenden -
cies in cases where market infrastructures are 
operated by private agents.
By the same token, most decentralised financial 
applications are unlikely to be entirely decen -
tralised in reality, either. In most cases, not all 
their participants have equal rights to modify 
program code and the like. Furthermore, many 
applications permit administrative intervention 
to repair the applicable procedural rules as ap -
propriate, and they work on the basis of gov -
ernance rules that tend to distribute design 
rights unequally, despite having full decentral -
isation as their declared aim.
The technical ability to program automated 
smart contracts is the key precondition for 
whether a blockchain is a suitable layer on 
which to run decentralised financial applica -
tions. Smart contracts automatically release 
assets held as digital tokens as soon as prede -
fined terms and conditions are met.7 The auto -
mated transaction validation process of the 
underlying blockchain makes sure that smart 
contracts run without interruption. As a result, 
it is possible to hardwire complex governance 
rules and business logics into the program 
code, which facilitates the implementation of 
new and transparent forms of process automa -
tion, thereby reducing process and transaction 
costs.
Expanding smart contracts or linking them 
algorith mically can automate the settlement 
of complex, tiered transactions. Taken to the 
extreme , it is possible to automate entire pro -
cess chains, like in an enterprise. Decentralised 
finan cial applications operated collectively 
using what are known as governance tokens 
are therefore also known as decentralised au -tonomous organisations (DAOs).8 Governance 
tokens enable their bearers to vote jointly on 
changes to the program code, the idea being 
to facilitate collective management depending 
on how the tokens are distributed.
The theoretical considerations on DAOs grad -
ually took shape and evolved into individual de -
centralised financial applications for various use 
cases. “Decentralised finance (DeFi)” is the um -
brella term used in the literature for decentral -
ised financial applications, but definitions of 
this term tend to vary. In an effort to address 
technical hurdles as well as incentive and trust 
issues inherent in the system, various solutions 
based on different blockchains have been de -
veloped and offered. As these solutions be -
come more advanced, the boundaries between 
decentralised financial applications and the 
conventional financial system could become in -
creasingly porous, warranting closer analysis. 
There are also questions surrounding potential 
implications for the financial system and, look -
ing ahead, for financial stability and for regula -
tion and taxation regimes.

7 Smart contracts are not contracts in a legal sense, but aid 
execution of the same. The term “smart contract” was 
coined by IT specialist Nick Szabo, who used the idea of a 
vending machine as a crude prototype of a smart contract. 
The vending machine, he explained, represents a smart 
contract between the vendor and whoever buys an item 
stored in the vending machine. Anyone with the right coins 
can operate the vending machine. Security mechanisms 
protect the stored coins and contents from attackers, suffi -
ciently to allow profitable deployment of vending machines 
in a wide variety of areas. See Szabo (1997).

The DAO
Perhaps the best- known decentralised au-
tonomous organisation to date was a vir-
tual investment fund called The DAO. This 
“company without people”1 was imple-
mented on the Ethereum blockchain in 
2016. Users could buy shares in The DAO 
with Ether (the Ethereum blockchain’s na-
tive crypto token). Following this fi  rst phase, 
project proposals were to be submitted to 
the virtual fund via smart contracts. Subse-
quently, users were intended to be able to 
vote on which projects The DAO would in-
vest in. The entire process, including inter-
est and dividend payments, was to take 
place automatically.
This decentralised alternative to investor- 
supported risk fi  nancing generated a great 
deal of interest and, helped along by rising 
Ether prices, secured total investment 
equivalent to US$150 million – a record 
sum for similar forms of crowdfunding at 
the time. This “social experiment” –  as it 
was dubbed by one of the programmers – 
was intended to be an enterprise without 
entrepreneurs, without a formal place of 
business, without an executive board, and 
without responsible parties.
In the end, however, the project never 
reached the investment stage, as a coding 
error in the share- buying phase was dis-
covered which allowed an “attacker” to 
withdraw around a third of the contents of 
the fund. As the smart contract could not 
be altered, the programmers could not stop 
the withdrawal.
To limit the damage to the reputation of 
Ethereum as a basis for smart contracts and 
the reputation of other DAOs, the majority 
of the Ethereum community agreed to im-
plement a hard fork. This meant supposedly immutable entries on the Ethereum block-
chain were retroactively cancelled, allowing 
the stolen funds to be confi  scated from the 
“attacker”. Practically, this meant a minority 
was expropriated by the majority, the justi-
fi  cation given for which was the use of 
funds in a manner that grossly violated The 
DAO’s intended purpose.2
These events are important, beyond the 
community involved, for two reasons. It 
was the fi  rst time a decentralised autono-
mous organisation of signifi  cance had ever 
been implemented. This had a positive 
effect  on Ethereum’s reputation beyond 
blockchain enthusiasts. It also demon-
strated that the lack of governance in such 
structures makes them very vulnerable in 
various ways, such as to cyber risks.

distributed ledger –  usually a blockchain of 
some kind (layer 1) – and on smart contracts 
(layer 2).9 While the blockchain serves as the 
transaction settlement system and register, the 
smart contracts specify which terms and condi -
tions for transactions via the base blockchain 
need to be verified and what actions they trig -
ger. This means that a wide variety of different 
use cases can be modelled. Users tend to pur -
chase crypto tokens on centralised trading plat -
forms in return for commercial bank money 
and credit them to an electronic wallet they 
need to open for each individual blockchain. 
Service providers can bundle together different 
applications and offer them to their customers 
on a single platform as a way of enabling them 
to access and use different decentralised finan -
cial applications (aggregators). The only bridge 
to the real world are usually actors known as 
oracles, which source external data that many 
applications use.
The organisational base layer for decentralised 
financial applications is provided by a block -
chain, a string of largely immutable blocks stor -
ing information on transactions with the aid of 
cryptographic mechanisms. Blockchains nor -
mally support the storage and transfer of what 
are known as native tokens, which are built dir -
ectly on- chain and exist exclusively on the dis -
tributed ledger.10 Some blockchains further -more allow additional digital tokens to be cre -
ated, e.g. for governance purposes (govern -
ance tokens), to represent unique real- world 
assets (non- fungible tokens, or NFTs) such as 
works of art, as synthetic assets (stablecoins 
based on crypto tokens on other blockchains 
or real assets), or as electronic securities. A 
blockchain of this kind can serve as a common 
settlement ledger and register for a variety of 
different decentralised financial applications. 
Crypto tokens cannot, however, be directly 
transferred from one blockchain to another.
It would be possible to use commercial bank 
money in decentralised financial applications if 
it could be issued by credit institutions as 
tokens on the base blockchain on which the 
applications in question are based. The same 
holds true for central bank money, which could 
theoretically be issued by central banks as Decentralised

9 The terms blockchain and DLT are often used inter -
changeably, and the blockchain is indeed a particular type 
of DLT and its best- known use case. In terms of its encryp -
tion technology, validation process and consensus mechan -
ism, blockchain is a decentralised architecture in the broad -
est sense of the term.
10 The Bitcoin blockchain, for instance, allows the decen -
tralised transfer and storage of electronic tokens that exist 
in the form of Bitcoins. Beyond that, the underlying pro -
gramming language does not support complex calculation 
logic, which means it is unsuitable as an organisational 
base layer for decentralised financial applications. See

tokens, or for any other assets that could be 
represented by a digital token.11
Decentralised financial applications are nor -
mally based on public blockchains that support 
pseudonymised12 use and have no access con -
straints (public permissionless blockchains). In 
order to extend the blockchain for all network 
participants with matching and error- free trans -
actions, there need to be what are known as 
consensus mechanisms.13 Network participants 
use a consensus mechanism to agree on trans -
actions to be added to the blockchain, and in 
what order. The choice of consensus mechan -
ism, then, plays a major role in the security of a 
blockchain and thus also in the level of security 
offered by the decentralised financial applica -
tions based on that particular blockchain.
The program code used in decentralised finan -
cial applications is open source software with 
source code that anyone can inspect. This 
means it can be used by developers as a blue -
print for new projects.14 By combining existing 
lines of code and adding new ones, it is pos -
sible to create new applications with relatively 
little programming effort. At the same time, 
network participants at least stand a chance of 
understanding how applications are designed 
and how they work.15
Smart contracts can only access data located 
within the blockchain network, but decentral -
ised financial applications sometimes need to 
access external data such as foreign exchange 
rates and securities prices to verify when prede -
fined terms and conditions have been met. This 
task is performed by oracles, which collect data 
from the real world, send them to the network 
and convert them into a format readable by 
smart contracts. They act as a bridge between 
on- chain and off- chain inputs and support a 
variety of use cases. The trustworthiness of or -
acles is of crucial importance for the level of se -
curity offered by applications and ultimately for 
user acceptance as well.16 This is because smart 
contracts execute transactions autonomously, 
so erroneous external data could result in the irreversible execution of erroneous transac -
tions.
Decentralised financial applications are based 
on predefined program code, which means 
that, without outside involvement, they are un -
able to respond to unforeseeable events or 
changing circumstances. To nonetheless allow 
external administrative intervention to take 
place, it is commonplace to implement decen -
tralised governance processes. For this pur -
pose, decentralised financial applications gen -
erally use governance tokens to technically rep -
resent decision- making processes on the under -
lying blockchain (a set- up known as on- chain 
governance).17 If proposals are made to im -
prove the application, the bearers of these gov -
ernance tokens can use a weighted voting sys -
tem to decide on those proposals.18
Development of the market
Since starting in 2015, the Ethereum blockchain 
has established itself as the most important 
foundation for decentralised financial applica -
tions. It was the first blockchain enabling the 
deployment of complex smart contracts.19 The 
applications based upon it are interoperable 
and benefit from a broad user and developer 
base, as well as the network effects that this 
entails.20Consensus

Other public blockchains which support smart 
contracts and exhibit a comparatively high 
degree  of decentralisation exist besides 
Ethereum, with examples including Tezos, 
Solana and Cardano.21 Ethereum is also in the 
process of being upgraded to Ethereum 2.0, 
with a view to increasing transaction through -
put and thereby cutting transaction costs.22
Total value locked (TVL) can serve as a rough 
indicator for the growth of decentralised finan -
cial applications. It refers to the amount of col -
lateral deposited and liquidity provisioned by 
users – in the form of respective crypto tokens – 
in decentralised financial applications. In both 
cases, users temporarily deposit crypto tokens 
in smart contracts for the purposes of specific 
use cases.
In June 2019, the TVL on the Ethereum block -
chain equated to an average of around US$0.5 
billion; by June 2020, this value had risen to 
US$1.4 billion. In June 2021, the TVL tied up in 
the Ethereum blockchain had already reached 
US$58.1 billion, a development partially the re -
sult of price appreciation across a number of 
crypto tokens. The majority of liquidity is de -
posited in applications for the generation of 
decentralised stablecoins, in decentralised lend -
ing platforms and in decentralised trading plat -
forms.23
It must be said that the TVL metric suffers from 
a lack of precision, however. Converted into US 
dollar or euro, prices for the deposited crypto 
tokens display a high degree of volatility. In 
addition, assets can end up being counted 
twice, for example if tokens are deposited in 
one application as collateral for token issuance 
in another application. Furthermore, in the case 
of certain applications, the TVL volume can 
only provide a limited idea of how they are 
actually  being used. When it comes to decen -
tralised lending platforms, for instance, the TVL 
does not reveal anything about what propor -
tion of the crypto tokens deposited as liquidity 
are being extended as loans.Financial use cases
The development of decentralised financial ap -
plications is still in its infancy. Use cases can be 
found in trade, credit- like and deposit- like 
transactions, and stablecoin and derivative issu -
ance. In addition, services which could be 
classed under the insurance or asset manage -
ment umbrella are evolving, although these 
currently still occupy a comparatively minor 
place in the ecosystem of decentralised finan -
cial applications.24
Decentralised trading 
platforms 
Decentralised trading platforms enable net -
work participants who do not know each other 
to exchange different crypto tokens among 
themselves without the intervention of a cen -
tral party as broker, price- setter or crypto cus -
todian. Users retain control of their crypto 
tokens throughout the entire trade process, in 
a set-  up known as non-  custodial exchange.25 
In this way, users can avoid the risk that their 
crypto tokens –  which have to be deposited 
when trading on centralised trading plat -
forms – might be stolen.26 Decentralised trad -
ing platforms only allow the exchange of 
crypto tokens issued via the same underlying 
blockchain, for example the blockchain’s native 
token, stablecoins or governance tokens.

as automated market- makers.27 Liquidity pools 
for certain crypto token trading pairs are estab -
lished using smart contracts. Network partici -
pants can provision these pools with liquidity in 
the form of crypto tokens. In return, they re -
ceive liquidity tokens which represent the li -
quidity that they have contributed. In the form 
of these liquidity tokens, holders generally re -
ceive the fees accrued for trades; this can be 
seen as compensation for the provision of li -
quidity. At the same time, liquidity providers 
bear the risk of price changes when it comes to 
re- exchanging the liquidity tokens for the li -
quidity that they have contributed. A trading 
transaction takes place when an asset is added 
to the pool and another asset withdrawn at the 
same time. The swap shifts the ratio of the 
token trading pair to each other in the liquidity 
pool. On the basis of an algorithm, these 
changes in the value ratio lead to price changes, 
whereby the user who carried out the ex -
change loses out (known as slippage loss). The 
greater the shift an exchange transaction pro -
duces in the value ratio of a trading pair, the 
greater the slippage loss. It is therefore import -
ant to have a sufficiently large pool of liquidity; 
otherwise, even small trading transactions 
would lead to high slippage loss. Since the rela -
tive prices of tokens formally change in inverse 
proportion to the volume ratio in the liquidity 
pool, they do not necessarily reflect supply and 
demand in the market. This gives rise to an in -
centive for arbitrageurs28 to exploit price differ -
ences between trading platforms to generate 
profit. For example, a token whose value has 
dropped as a result of its being added to a 
liquidity  pool may be purchased relatively 
cheaply and then sold on another trading plat -
form.29
Decentralised lending 
platforms 
Decentralised lending platforms enable liquidity 
in the form of crypto tokens to be borrowed 
and lent, with interest applied.30 To ensure that 
loans are repaid in spite of the anonymity of their parties, borrowers are usually required to 
provide collateral.31 By means of collateralised 
borrowing of this kind, borrowers can leverage 
their own positions.32 Those holding crypto 
tokens for speculative reasons, for example, 
can opt to pledge these as collateral. If the 
crypto tokens taken out as a loan also climb in 
value, the borrower can make a profit, pro -
vided that the amount by which the value of 
the borrowed crypto tokens and the borrow -
er’s collateral has increased exceeds the 
amount that they have had to pay in interest.33 
Depending on the application concerned, the 
collateralised lending is executed either via 
what are known as lending pools, which bun -
dle liquidity provided by network participants in 
a smart contract, or directly between individual 
network participants.34 Applications based on 
lending pools tend to be more liquid, and thus 
more popular. They work in a similar way to 
the liquidity pools of decentralised trading plat -
forms. On account of the highly volatile and 
illiquid  nature of many crypto tokens, borrow -
ers often have to over- collateralise their liabil -
ities – for example, at a rate of 150% – so as to 
incentivise repayment. The collateral is parked 
in a smart contract and then released again … and are

Loans via decen -
tralised lending 
platforms are 
typically collat -
eralised, …27 By contrast, trade via centralised trading platforms is 
based on order books in which buy and sell orders are re -
corded in lists and matched up. As a rule, there is a con -
stant flow of market- makers prepared to act as counterpar -
ties, which generally guarantees a high degree of liquidity. 
In the case of decentralised trading platforms, market-  
makers would – due to the underlying blockchain technol -
ogy – have to pay fees for each order change and transac -
tion, and this would quickly render market- making in the 
traditional sense of the term uneconomical. See Jensen et 
al. (2021).
28 Arbitrage describes the process of buying and selling 
the same asset in different markets to profit from differ -
ences in price.
29 See Daian et al. (2020) and Adams et al. (2020).

and deposit rates at https://defirate.com/lend

32 Leverage describes the way borrowed capital can mag -
nify return on equity. This effect arises when capital can be 
borrowed at a rate of interest lower than the total return 
generated through the investment for which those bor -
rowed assets are used. The collateral posted in decentral -
ised lending platforms then corresponds to the share of 
equity capital.

once the loan has been repaid. Most decentral -
ised lending platforms have variable lending 
and deposit rates. In the case of lending pools, 
these rates are determined by rules- based 
protocols depending on the size of the pool 
concerned. If the pool starts to run low on 
liquidity  , interest rates rise, creating a more 
pressing incentive for borrowers to repay their 
loans. At the same time, other network partici -
pants have a bigger incentive to supply liquid -
ity. The same principle in reverse applies in the 
event of an over- abundance of liquidity.35
Uncollateralised loans can be made, for ex -
ample, in the form of a flash loan. Flash loans 
have to be repaid within the same blockchain 
block, otherwise the entire transaction is un -
wound. This effectively does away with the 
credit risk for the lender. Flash loans serve, for 
instance, as arbitrage instruments, in that price 
differences between different decentralised 
trading platforms are monetised. However, 
flash loans can also be misused to mount mali -
cious attacks on decentralised financial applica -
tions, for example through the acquisition of 
governance tokens and subsequent alteration 
of the application’s program code to benefit 
the attacker.36
Decentralised stablecoins
Decentralised stablecoins try to be as stable in 
value as possible in relation to a reference 
value. Unlike centralised stablecoins, such as 
Tether or the planned Diem, the idea is for 
there to be no need for trust in an issuer; in 
other words they are “non- custodial”. Decen -
tralised stablecoins can be backed37 only by 
crypto tokens (on- chain). The stablecoin is 
minted by users depositing crypto tokens as 
collateral in a smart contract. The amount of 
stablecoins produced depends on the current 
exchange rate of the deposited collateral to the 
reference value, information which is obtained 
through an oracle. Stablecoins are typically col -
lateralised at rates of over 100%. As a result, 
drops in the value of the collateral do not im -mediately mean losses in the value of the sta -
blecoin. If the value of the deposited collateral 
falls below a certain threshold, it can be bought 
by third parties at an additional discount in ex -
change for the stablecoin. When this happens, 
the collateral is taken out of the smart contract 
and the returned stablecoin is destroyed. This 
mechanism is designed to prevent under-  
collateralisation of the stablecoin and thus 
keep its value stable.38 This cannot be guaran -
teed, however.39
Decentralised derivatives
Decentralised derivatives are crypto tokens 
which derive their value from the performance 
of an underlying asset or from the occurrence 
of a particular event. A host of assets are suited 
for use as the underlying – stocks, commodities 
or crypto tokens of other blockchains, for ex -
ample. Decentralised derivatives work in a simi -
lar way to decentralised stablecoins. However, 
the underlying assets of decentralised deriva -
tives generally exhibit significant fluctuations in 
value, rendering collateralisation of several 
100% necessary. Users deposit collateral in the 
form of crypto tokens in a smart contract and 
receive the derivative in return. Oracles feed 
the smart contract with information on how 
the underlying asset is performing.
Event-  based derivatives rely on an observable 
variable which can have clear outcomes over a 
specific period of time.40 There is a separate … with the

35 See Aave (2020) and Schär (2021).
36 See Gudgeon et al. (2020) and Aave (2020).
37 The value of centralised stablecoins is usually kept 
stable by their being pegged to, and collateralised with, a 
genuine currency. An alternative approach to the on- chain 
collateralisation of decentralised stablecoins consists in the 
attempt to use algorithms to control the volume of the is -
sued stablecoin or the interest rate applying to it in such a 
way as to hold the stablecoin’s price in relation to a refer -
ence value as steady as possible. This approach is not par -
ticularly common at present, however. See Deutsche Bun -
desbank (2019).

event occurs, the smart contract disburses all of

that represent the outcome which has tran -

Potential for development
A multiplicity of decentralised financial applica -
tions has developed in the course of just a few 
years, varied both in terms of the use cases that 
they represent as well as in design. So far as it 
is possible to tell, both the amount of liquidity 
locked in as well as the volumes being handled 
are growing apace.42 A not insignificant part of 
the reason why the market for decentralised 
finan cial applications is proving dynamic and 
innovative is that many applications are de -
veloping free from consideration of regulatory 
requirements or because regulatory interven -
tion has so far had barely any inhibiting effect . 
This fosters the development of business 
models which are unsustainable or even detri -
mental to users in some cases.
Compared with the conventional financial sys -
tem, decentralised financial applications are of 
quantitatively minor significance at present 
and, so far, they appear to have made barely 
any meaningful inroads in terms of relevance to 
the real economy. Their growth as well as the 
innovativeness of the solutions being de -
veloped could point towards an increasing rele -
vance in future, however. In addition, decen -
tralised financial applications stand before vari -
ous challenges – some inherent – which could 
prove to be barriers to development. These in -
clude, in particular, security risks associated 
with the program codes used, poor incentive 
systems, a lack of scalability, restricted inter -
operability, contagion risks arising from interde -
pendencies, insufficient governance and partly 
unclear or non- existent regulatory require -
ments.Security
The use of decentralised financial applications 
entails security risks. This is because external 
security checks and incentive systems are not 
able to eliminate the possibility of software 
bugs and misuse by individual network partici -
pants. The way decentralised financial applica -
tions work from a technical perspective is, in 
principle, transparent. Software errors (or smart 
contract bugs) can lead to unintended prob -
lems, however. Since individual participants do 
not generally have write permissions for the 
program code, the fixing of these errors must 
first be put to the network for consensus. De -
centralised governance thus militates against 
swift and effective intervention in an emer -
gency.43 Bugs in the program code also offer a 
major attack surface for abusive conduct and 
examples of this have been seen in the past 
even when individual program codes have 
been checked by external security companies.44 
What follows is that trust in intermediaries 
must necessarily be replaced by trust in the 
program code functioning properly.45
From an economic point of view, incentive sys -
tems are meant to stop network participants 
wrongfully enriching themselves at the expense 
of the network’s other participants or acting 
contrary to the way that the network is in -
tended to work.46 An example of their use is 
with oracles. As an information interface with 
the outside world, oracles are of crucial import -
ance for decentralised financial applications.

meanwhile, would be penalised by taking away 
governance tokens. The idea is to render the 
provision of incorrect or manipulated data eco -
nomically unattractive, even if this cannot be 
completely prevented.47
Scalability
In the case of public blockchains, which are 
typically operated by a large number of net -
work participants, there is a conflict between 
the twin aims of scalability and decentralisa -
tion. Compared with private blockchains, 
which are run by a restricted circle of network 
participants, transaction costs are often high 
and they enable a comparatively low transac -
tion throughput. The main reason for this lies in 
the consensus mechanisms which they employ. 
As the number of network participants involved 
in the consensus mechanism increases, the 
process of reaching a consensus tends to be -
come more secure but the cost and duration of 
the procedure will also rise.48 In order to facili -
tate higher transaction throughput, some 
blockchains rely on a more centralised consen -
sus mechanism involving a smaller set of net -
work participants.49 Some decentralised finan -
cial applications enable settlement of off- chain 
transactions which no longer need to be indi -
vidually validated on the underlying blockchain 
(“layer 2 solutions”).50 Such procedures are 
similar to ancillary system settlement in the 
conventional payments space. A side effect 
– as with conventional payments – is liquidity 
fragmentation, however.
There is currently no effective fix for the trade- 
off between a high degree of scalability and a 
high degree of decentralisation. But without 
sufficient scalability, the usability of decentral -
ised financial applications is heavily curtailed.Interoperability
A common infrastructure and shared standards 
enable a high degree of interoperability be -
tween decentralised financial applications. 
Moreover, smart contracts can be modified and 
combined in manifold ways, paving the way for 
new and more complex use cases. However, 
interoperability between different blockchains 
– the organisational bedrock of decentralised 
financial applications – as well as with other 
systems not based on blockchain is significantly 
restricted. Decentralised financial applications 
can interact with applications external to their 
ecosystem only to a limited degree and it gen -
erally requires the involvement of intermediar -
ies. This can result in solutions being developed 
in isolation  – contributing to fragmentation of 
the market and of liquidity – as well as, some -
times, market power ending up in the hands of 
a small number of providers. Various projects 
are attempting to find a solution to these limi -
tations without the need for intermediary in -
volvement. These are still in the early stages of 
development, however.51
Interdependencies
The combined use of different applications pro -
duces interdependencies which, depending on 
the degree of integration, can entail commen -
surately high risks for the ecosystem as a whole. 
For example, a user may deposit collateral in 
one application, using it to obtain a stablecoin. 
Suppose they then place this stablecoin on a 
trading platform to acquire liquidity tokens; 
these liquidity tokens could then, in turn, be Public block -

Klages- Mundt et al. (2020).
48 Where data are held and updated decentrally there are 
physical barriers with regard to communication between 
network participants. These arise because only a limited 
amount of data can be transferred within a certain time -
frame. This places a constraint on block size, and hence the 
number of transactions which can be processed per block.

lent via a lending platform. Such operations 
create chains of dependence. These chains har -
bour contagion risks which may be triggered, 
for example, by particularly volatile market de -
velopments pertaining to the crypto tokens 
concerned or through technical problems such 
as in the event of a software bug.52 The risks 
stemming from interdependencies within pub -
lic blockchains demand particular attention.53
Governance
Decentralised governance essentially means 
that all stakeholders are jointly and equally re -
sponsible for changes to the program code or 
for averting threats. However, the bulk of appli -
cations are based on decentralised governance 
processes founded on collective voting proced -
ures using governance tokens. Decentralised fi -
nancial applications often begin life with a 
higher degree of centralisation than is ultim -
ately aspired to as the original developers re -
tain larger shares of governance tokens or ear -
mark them for investors.54 There is also a risk of 
individual agents using governance tokens to 
obtain a majority of votes and modify the pro -
gram code to their advantage (governance at -
tack).55 This danger is heightened by network 
participants’ pseudoanonymity and the associ -
ated lack of transparency when it comes to 
decision- making structures. Risks of this kind 
could be addressed by implementing program 
changes with a system time delay. This would, 
at least theoretically, give network participants 
enough time to exit if they disagreed with the 
changes. But, at the same time, delaying the 
implementation of program changes leads to 
sluggishness in the system.56
Regulation
Decentralised financial applications are often 
not captured by existing regulation, especially 
as the term decentralisation is sometimes inter -
preted in different ways. Even regulatory provi -
sions that should otherwise be applicable often cannot be sufficiently enforced as there are no 
natural or legal persons to act as addressee, 
meaning no one can be held responsible or li -
able for any damages.57 The possibility that 
providers will attempt to obscure their actual 
central governance by referring to the decen -
tralisation of an application in order to evade 
any regulation also cannot be ruled out.58 
Regulators are thus faced with a series of by no 
means trivial issues.
– What functions of decentralised financial 
applications and their underlying block -
chains are covered by existing regulatory 
frameworks and which require regulation?
– What parties (e.g. developers, holders of 
governance tokens, users) can be subject to 
regulation? How can they be identified?
– Which jurisdiction is responsible for an appli -
cation without a legal seat? Can an effective 
international framework be developed to 
prevent regulatory arbitrage?Effective govern -
ance requires

elements

53 For example, in the conventional financial system, 
Regulation of the European Central Bank (EU) No 795/ 2014 
requires systemically important payment systems (SIPS) 
established  in the euro area to identify critical participants 
who could present a risk for the entire system if they were 
to default.
54 See Bitkom (2020) and World Economic Forum (2021).
55 See Klages- Mundt et al. (2020) and Gudgeon et al. 
(2020). This potential risk can also result in, for example, 
providers of collateral pushing up the value of governance 
tokens to reduce the risk of a damaging attack and to pro -
tect their collateral. This runs counter to the actual purpose 
of governance tokens, i.e. the collective management of 
the application.
56 See Schär (2021).
57 The European Commission published its digital finance 
package on 24 September 2020. This includes, amongst 
other things, legislative proposals for the regulation of 
crypto tokens and stablecoins that are not subject to any 
other existing European regulation, as well as a proposal 
for a pilot regime for market infrastructures based on DLT. 
In their current versions, both proposed regulations essen -
tially address issuers of crypto tokens, certain service pro -
viders and market infrastructure operators – i.e. specific 
legal persons. The decentralised financial applications con -
sidered here and the blockchains underlying them would 
thus not fall under the regulations included in the digital 
finance  package.

– How can regulation be effective and, at the 
same time, sufficiently technology-  agnostic 
as to allow for secure innovations?
– How can networks be identified whose 
agents only give the impression of decen -
tralisation to evade regulation, for example?
In some cases, regulatory regimes already exist 
for the interfaces between decentralised net -
works and the conventional financial system, 
such as centralised trading platforms. A par -
ticular focus here is the purchase and sale of 
crypto tokens in exchange for commercial cen -
tral bank money, with regulation seeking to 
combat money laundering and terrorist finan -
cing, for instance.59
A clear framework which also includes partici -
pants in decentralised financial applications 
with core functions (e.g. oracles) could provide 
legal certainty and thus protect the interests of 
consumers and investors. Regulation and the 
trust it establishes could thereby boost the ap -
peal and acceptance of decentralised financial 
applications. At the same time, it would con -
tribute to the stability of the system and, given 
the increasing degree of interconnectedness, 
ultimately also the financial system as a whole. 
In this context, regulators worldwide should 
collaborate to prevent opportunities for regula -
tory arbitrage so that existing risks are regu -
lated equally, irrespective of the technology 
employed and different providers. This would 
create a level playing field for decentralised 
networks vis- à- vis conventional financial mar -
ket agents. Regulation could be a precondition 
for sustainable growth as it is likely a necessary 
step in bringing decentralised financial applica -
tions to the attention of a broader set of users.Potential implications
Links to the conventional 
finan cial system and possible 
impact
Decentralised financial applications might 
prove to be drivers of innovation for the econ -
omy as a whole by stimulating technological 
developments in the conventional financial sys -
tem, too.60 Decentralised financial applications 
could also help tap into new business areas or 
contribute to developing hybrid business 
models through the combination of decentral -
ised and centralised elements.61
As things stand, there are barely any major 
links to be seen between conventional financial 
actors and decentralised financial applications 
on account of the fact that the latter are still at 
such a premature stage of development. Never -
theless, if the use and prevalence of decentral -
ised financial applications increases, this could 
have an impact on the financial system and the 
role of the central bank. For this to happen, 
however, the described constraints of decen -
tralised financial applications would have to be 
removed.
There are four ways in which decentralised 
finan cial applications may conceivably seep 
into the conventional financial system.
– Technologies employed by decentralised 
finan cial applications could be absorbed by 
the conventional financial system.
– Individual decentralised financial applica -
tions could centralise and become part of 
the conventional financial system as new 
competitors. A greater degree of centralisa -
tion means that key agents could more eas -

ing some of the obstacles to development 
to be overcome.
– Financial services provided by decentralised 
financial applications that are not offered in 
the conventional financial system could 
complement the supply of services. In such a 
scenario, the conventional financial system 
could offer its customers access to decen -
tralised financial applications or link these 
applications to the services it provides.
– Decentralised financial applications could 
crowd out parts of the conventional finan -
cial system on account of more efficient ser -
vices or a lack of parity in regulation.
Potential effects on the stability of the financial 
system depend on a number of factors and are 
difficult to gauge at the current stage of devel -
opment.62 In principle, increased competition 
that improves capital and risk allocation, and 
decentralisation of such exposures as have so 
far been focused on individual or handfuls of 
actors would be welcome. As a result, the sys -
temic importance of individual actors and the 
accumulation of large exposures could be re -
duced. In addition, the use of different tech -
nologies in the world of finance can limit the 
risks, such as in the form of cyberattacks.
However, decentralised financial applications 
can also lead to new vulnerabilities due to in -
herent weaknesses regarding infrastructure, 
the technology used and potential links to the 
conventional financial system, for instance. It is 
often impossible to adequately assess the way 
individual applications work, their response in 
the event of market turmoil as well as potential 
interdependencies with other applications and 
agents. Furthermore, concentration, liquidity 
and maturity transformation risks, for example, 
may arise just like in the conventional financial 
system. Additionally, the potential outflow of 
liquid ity from the conventional financial system 
to decentralised financial applications may give 
rise to structural changes in the financial sys -
tem. The automatic mechanisms in decentral -ised financial applications could also contribute 
to procyclical developments, particularly in 
times of crisis. Mechanisms of this kind can 
come into play, for instance, if a sudden decline 
in the value of crypto tokens used as collateral 
for loans or stablecoins triggers automated 
margin calls. If these calls are not met, self-  
reinforcing liquidation spirals could ensue if 
loans or stablecoins are, for their part, used as 
collateral for other transactions.
Decentralised financial applications could make 
the provision of liquidity and the function as 
lender of last resort, which is based upon this, 
more difficult for central banks. In this capacity, 
central banks can provide illiquid but solvent 
finan cial institutions with liquidity in the form 
of central bank money to offset temporary 
liquid ity shortages that could otherwise escal -
ate into a liquidity crisis.63 A financial system 
with decentralised financial applications, alter -
native and less transparent market structures 
and reduced dependence on the conventional 
cash cycle, and therefore also on central bank 
money, could prove to be more fragile com -
pared with the current financial system and 
could increase the risk of liquidity crises.
Competition and innovation 
in the financial system
Conventional financial intermediaries contrib -
ute fundamentally to reducing market partici -
pants’ transaction costs – in favour of overall 
economic welfare.64 However, network effects 
can cause individual financial intermediaries to 
gain dominant market positions, which, in 
turn, may lead to monopoly rents being ex -
tracted. Competition with regard to certain 
finan cial services and in the payments space 
could benefit from new providers in the form 
of decentralised financial applications. In add -
ition, the decentralised nature of their govern -Decentralised

ance structures could make it hard for them to 
monetise a dominant market position. This 
could lessen welfare losses stemming from 
high market concentration on the provider 
side.65
Technological advancements could help DLT to 
realise its potential for reducing process and 
transaction costs in a broader sense. Transac -
tions in decentralised financial applications 
could better ensure the execution of contract -
ual services and reduce the need for custodians 
and central counterparties. This could result in 
costs being saved and inefficiencies remed -
ied.66
As already indicated, however, trust in inter -
mediaries, legal frameworks and institutions 
needs to be replaced by trust in decentralised 
systems. Although transparency exists in de -
centralised financial applications, relevant ex -
pertise is also required. It is highly unlikely that 
the majority of end users will be capable of 
understanding the program codes within a rea -
sonable period of time. Compared with con -
ventional finance applications, it can be harder 
for users to understand products as a result. 
Users have to trust that qualified individuals 
– in other words, trusted third parties after all – 
monitor the program code to avoid software 
bugs or damaging attacks occurring. Other -
wise, decentralised financial applications will 
not be able to successfully reduce the transac -
tion costs in an economy.
If decentralised financial applications grow in 
importance, a number of conventional business 
models in the financial sector could come 
under pressure. This could be fuelled by an 
environ ment free from regulation and there -
fore conducive to innovation. Unlike in the 
conventional financial system, there are low 
barriers to market entry as a result of often un -
enforceable or non- existent regulation and low 
investment expenses for new program code. 
Furthermore, open source program code and 
the ability to combine applications open up the 
possibility of strong momentum for enhance-ments, which do not require the permission of 
the original developers.67
However, there is a risk that the economic in -
centives are insufficient for sustainable dynamic 
growth. Achieving positive returns from corres -
ponding investment in projects concerning 
decen tralised financial applications might tend 
to prove difficult since existing code can be 
copied and newly published with minor modifi -
cations.68 Owing to a lack of licensing income, 
the labour- intensive development of innovative 
solutions with the objective of harvesting 
profits in future would therefore carry signifi -
cant risks. Nevertheless, developers could at -
tempt to generate returns using additional 
services , such as consultancy or by providing 
services in the area of software support.69
Overall, financial uncertainty does not currently 
appear to be slowing down the dynamism 
pushing forward innovation in the field of de -
centralised finan cial applications. Furthermore, 
many of the innovative developments could 
also be transferred to existing centralised sys -
tems. This represents possibly the greatest 
technological potential for existing economic 
structures given the inherent problems associ -
ated with complete decentralisation.
A number of established enterprises could 
absorb  innovations or offer interoperability 
with their own applications in combination 
with the implementation of DLT. Regulatory 
uncer  tainties and the need for a high level of 
cooperation among competitors to create 
interoperable infrastructures may stand in the 
way of this.70New technolo -

Conclusion
Decentralised financial applications support an 
ever broadening range of financial services. 
Creative business models and types of enter -
prises are of particular interest alongside new 
technology. Fast- moving innovation and rapid 
growth could imply an increasing impact of de -
centralised financial applications on the con -
ventional financial system.
However, numerous challenges and risks arise 
from the decentralised structure, which can act 
as obstacles to growth. By tendency, many bar -
riers could be mitigated through forms of cen -
tralisation, such as organised governance.Increasing integration with the conventional fi -
nancial system is conceivable as a further stage 
of development. This could result in stronger 
competition accompanied by lower transaction 
costs. At the same time, risks for the financial 
system may emerge, making regulatory adjust -
ments necessary, although regulation of decen -
tralised financial applications represents a par -
ticularly challenging undertaking in this con -
text. In the light of this, the evolution and 
macroeconomic impact of decentralised finan -
cial applications should be the object of greater 
investigation and scrutiny.

Digital risks in the banking sector
The advancing digitalisation of the world in which we live and work is putting German banks to 
the test. The resulting intensification of competition in financial services as well as customers’ 
expectations have been putting them under significant pressure to adapt and evolve for a num -
ber of years now. New technologies such as artificial intelligence and the widespread use of scal -
able cloud services are accelerating the digital transformation. Information technology’s current 
support of banking processes will become more pronounced as a result.
Over the course of the digital transformation, it is important not to lose sight of security, particu -
larly in view of the fact that banks are increasingly becoming a target for professional hackers. 
Banks need to ensure that their customers’ data are available at all times, secured against 
unwanted changes and protected against unauthorised access. Technology alone is not enough 
to stay ahead of digital risks. The human component as well as technical and organisational 
measures, together with well- structured, effective and interlinked processes, are the key factors 
for success.
To ensure that the scope needed to implement measures is always available, banking supervisors 
rely on an approach to regulation and oversight that is oriented around principles and processes. 
In this context, expectations are outlined in greater detail in a technology- neutral manner in the 
circulars Minimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) and the Supervisory Require -
ments for IT in Financial Institutions ( Bankaufsichtliche Anforderungen an die IT – BAIT ). These also 
make it possible to effectively supervise bank- internal processes based on current and future tech -
nological developments such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence.
Within the framework of the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP), in particular by 
conducting inspections at banks, the Bundesbank assesses not only financial risks but also non- 
financial ones, such as digital risks. Although steady improvements can be seen in risk manage -
ment processes, basic vulnerabilities and a need for improvement are identified time and again 
when it comes to addressing digital risk – particularly with respect to information risk manage -
ment, information security management, and outsourcing management – and these are moni -
tored closely by supervisors.
Digitalisation will continue to shape societal and economic developments, and the pace of tech -
nological change will remain high, especially in the banking sector. The Bundesbank has always 
taken a positive view of technological progress among banks, as digital innovation bolsters Ger -
man banks by rendering them more competitive and profitable, and therefore more stable and 
resilient. Banks’ long- term success nevertheless depends heavily on the consistent and proper use 
of innovative technologies. The Bundesbank will continue to promote the principles- based and 
technology- neutral regulation of digital risks at both the European and global levels. Techno -
logical progress needs to be facilitated, as does the proportionate and autonomous implementa -
tion of regulation at institutions. Only if institutions take the initiative and face up to the oppor -
tunities and risks presented by digitalisation in a confident and balanced manner will it be pos -
sible to safeguard the functioning of the financial system over the long term.Deutsche Bundesbank

Digitalisation is changing 
banking
The way in which banks operate has always 
been highly influenced by the technology that 
is available. Nowadays, a functioning and mod -
ern information technology (IT) infrastructure is 
essential for an ever larger proportion of finan -
cial services and products.
For example, the number of employees in the 
German banking industry has fallen continu -
ously over the past two decades, while total 
assets have risen by approximately 50% over 
the same period. This productivity boost was 
made possible not least due to the increased 
use of IT. Today, running a bank without IT is 
unimaginable.
The sharp rise in the performance and inter -
connectivity of IT over the past few decades 
has made it possible to transfer and process 
huge volumes of data in very short spaces of 
time. Technologies such as artificial intelligence 
and machine learning use these volumes of 
data to carry out increasingly sophisticated pro -
cesses, tasks and analyses in an autonomous 
and highly automated manner. Furthermore, 
new applications are continuously being de -
veloped through agile methods by drawing on 
their iterative and incremental approaches. These organisational and technological innov -
ations are sustainably transforming not only 
the expectations of bank customers, but also 
the way in which financial services are offered 
and provided.
Digitalisation is also accompanied by a division 
of labour that was not possible in the past. 
Today, more than ever, banks can decide 
whether they provide services themselves or 
procure them from third parties. For example, 
specialist banking applications, including core 
banking systems, no longer need to be de -
veloped by banks themselves, but can instead 
be purchased from third parties and even run 
on their external IT infrastructure. Globally ac -
tive providers thus offer quick, flexible and 
straightforward access to computer resources 
with almost unlimited options for customisa -
tion (see the box on pp. 51ff.).
At the same time, the intense competitive en -
vironment has, for a number of years now, 
been putting strong pressure on institutions to 
adapt both themselves and consequently their 
business models. Through the continued trans -
formation and outsourcing of operating pro -
cesses, banks are hoping particularly to achieve 
shorter provisioning times, better service qual -
ity and lower operating costs.
The COVID-  19 pandemic has considerably 
ramped up the trend towards digitalisation 
once again. For example, services have had to 
be provided to customers increasingly via 
digital channels for more than a year now. Sim -
ultaneously, an as yet unknown number of em -
ployees have been working from home. To 
make this possible, institutions were forced to 
invest more heavily in new hardware and soft -
ware and to digitise previously analogue pro -
cesses.
The Bundesbank has always taken a positive 
view of technological progress among banks.

ing them more competitive and profitable, and Information

Cloud computing
The trend towards outsourcing information 
technology (IT) processes has been picking 
up pace for a number of years now and is 
having a positive impact on digital trans-
formation in the fi  nancial sector. As a result, 
the market has seen the emergence of new 
specialised service providers and technolo-
gies. The new tasks facing banks, super-
visors and service providers stemming from 
digital transformation and how these can 
be managed can be illustrated using cloud 
computing as an example.
The use of third- party IT services is generally 
classed as outsourcing in cases where third 
parties are appointed to carry out bank 
transactions as well as fi  nancial or other 
institution- specifi  c services.
The legal provisions pertaining to institu-
tions’ risk management of outsourcing and 
other external procurement of IT services 
are set out in Sections 25a and 25b of the 
German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz)  
and are outlined in greater detail in the 
BaFin Circular on the Minimum Require-
ments for Risk Management (MaRisk), and 
the Supervisory Requirements for IT in 
Finan cial Institutions (BAIT).
Outsourcing to cloud service providers
Shorter technology cycles, mounting cost 
pressure and specialisation are all reasons for 
institutions to outsource IT activities and pro-
cesses, especially to providers of cloud ser-
vices. Moreover, cloud services also provide 
smaller institutions with an effi   cient means 
to access modern technology, such as artifi  -
cial intelligence and machine learning.
The US standards agency NIST (National 
Institute  of Standards and Technology) defi  nes  cloud computing as “a model for 
enabling convenient, on- demand network 
access to a shared pool of confi  gurable 
computer resources (e.g. networks, servers, 
storage systems, applications and services) 
that can be provisioned rapidly and released 
with minimal management effort or service 
provider interaction.”1
Cloud computing provides standardised IT 
services thus enabling such services to be 
provisioned with the highest degree of 
automation possible. Given customers’ 
fl  exibility to use and scale these IT resources 
as required, institutions also hope that their 
cost structures will become more effi   cient 
as a result. In addition to increased fl  exibil-
ity, institutions are aiming for greater free-
dom in procuring services as well as im-
proved availability and performance com-
pared with their own IT infrastructures, 
which have usually evolved over a longer 
period of time.
Compared with 2018, when 91% of institu-
tions still chose to operate their IT infra-
structure themselves, according to a study 
conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers 
GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft 
(“PwC”) more and more institutions are 
now turning to third- party IT services.2 Here 
a small number of large enterprises domin-
ate the market; they share almost 60%3 
of  the global supply of cloud computing 
services .
Outsourcing to cloud service providers is, in 
general, subject to the same requirements 
regarding the management of outsourcing

and services as outsourcing to other (IT) 
service  providers. The Federal Financial 
Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and the Bundes-
bank have formulated a joint assessment on 
outsourcing to cloud service providers and 
published this in a Guidance.4
Risks, challenges and current 
developments 
Institutions that outsource to cloud service 
providers also have to set up processes to 
manage the risk arising from inadequate or 
failed internal processes, people and sys-
tems or from external events, including 
legal risk (operational risk).
If an institution wants to use cloud services, 
the impact of cloud computing has to be 
considered from the outset, starting as early 
as in the strategy process. Before migrating 
to cloud services, the IT landscape usually 
has to be standardised and internal pro-
cesses adapted.
From the Bundesbank’s perspective, but 
also from the perspective of the institutions’ 
risk management and internal control func-
tions, outsourcing to cloud service providers 
also presents particular challenges with 
regard  to monitoring and managing out-
sourced services and the service provider 
itself . This results, in particular, from the size 
and complexity of the organisation, and the 
technology used by the large cloud service 
providers.
When using cloud computing, there is a risk 
that an institution – for legal, organisational 
or technical reasons – may become tied to 
one provider and can only switch to an-
other provider with great diffi   culty (a state 
known as “vendor lock- in”). Supervisors ex-
pect institutions to consider these risks and 
analyse potential alternatives before con-
cluding a contract.Institutions are further hampered by their 
limited negotiating power with cloud ser-
vice providers operating on an international 
or inter- sectoral scale. At the same time, 
cloud service providers are confronted with 
a large number of – essentially – similar re-
quirements from the fi  nancial and banking 
sector.
The internal audit function of an institution 
has to examine and assess in a risk- oriented 
and process- independent manner the 
effective ness and appropriateness of the 
risk management system and of the internal 
control system as well as the appropriate-
ness of all activities and processes in gen-
eral, even if they have been outsourced. 
Due to the size and complexity of cloud 
service  providers, this is virtually impossible 
for individual institutions to achieve by 
themselves, which can obstruct audit activ-
ities.
Institutions are therefore increasingly turn-
ing to pooled audits, an approach already 
established under the Minimum Require-
ments for Risk Management (MaRisk). Au-
ditors from several institutions come to-
gether to conduct on- site audits of cloud 
service providers in order to pool know- 
how and secure an effi   cient use of re-
sources where audit areas overlap.
An institution must nevertheless still ensure 
that its contract monitoring, risk manage-
ment and internal audit can keep pace with 
developments in IT and outsourcing. This 
also requires looking at the cloud service 
provider’s structures, processes and tools in 
place to ensure transparency, for instance in 
the case of security incidents, at the extent 
to which risk- mitigating measures have 
been implemented and at test and audit re-
sults.

therefore more stable and resilient. The Bundes-
bank itself is taking numerous initiatives in 
order to better fulfil its stability mandate 
through the use of digital technologies, includ -
ing in the field of banking supervision.
Digital innovation is not primarily concerned 
with technology per se, but rather with how to 
use it in a meaningful way. As a result, the 
Bundes bank has set up a common platform 
within the Eurosystem for cooperation across 
business units on projects and topics surround -
ing the digital transformation at the Bank. In 
cooperation with the Banque de France, the 
Bundesbank runs the Eurosystem’s BIS Innov -
ation Hub in Frankfurt, which focuses on mod -
ern technologies aiming to support financial 
supervision (SupTech and RegTech) as well as 
cybersecurity and sustainability issues (green 
finance ).
The Bundesbank also has networks outside of 
the central banking community, such as in the start- up scene, where it is an institutional part -
ner of the TechQuartier innovation platform in 
Frankfurt, which brings together enterprises, 
innovators, academic institutions, as well as the 
financial and public sectors. This may provide 
the Bundesbank with additional impetus when 
coming up with ideas for its own digitalisation 
projects and also allows the Bank to pass on its 
own experiences.
However, new technologies and types of pro -
curement must not endanger the institutions’ 
security. Dependence on functional and secure 
IT has risen, as failures in key IT systems, such 
as core banking, payment or trading systems, 
can have a severe impact on the ability of an 
institution to provide its services. Customers 
become particularly aware of this when online 
banking or cash machines do not function as 
normal, or when payments or security orders 
are executed incorrectly or not executed at all. 
The threat of cyberattacks is another growing 
challenge for institutions and the wider finan -… networks 
internally and 
in the central 
banking com -
munity …
… and beyondUse of technol -
ogy must not 
jeopardise 
securityFor supervisors, it will become increasingly 
important to analyse institutions’ depend-
ency on IT services. Concentration risk could 
lead to systemic risk. The European Banking 
Authority’s Guidelines on outsourcing ar-
rangements, which have currently been im-
plemented in the German Banking Act and 
the corresponding statutory orders as well 
as in MaRisk, address this inter alia with 
new requirements to set up an outsourcing 
register for institutions and to report out-
sourcing information to supervisors.Deutsche Bundesbank

cial system. Hackers are benefiting from the 
growing level of technical complexity and are 
themselves becoming more professional in 
terms of how they operate. Hackers are par -
ticularly interested in payment systems, which 
can be targeted in order to fraudulently trans -
fer funds, for example, and in core banking sys -
tems, which are a prime target for extortion 
due to the damage that could be caused by 
taking them down. If hackers gain access to 
business- critical data, they encrypt these data 
using ransomware, for instance, so that they 
can then demand a ransom for their decryp -
tion. Furthermore, attacks can take down or 
otherwise interfere with a bank’s key IT systems 
for communicating with customers, such as its 
website or email system.
The broad application and intensive use of IT 
therefore call for a greater focus on compliance 
with the necessary security requirements. Banks 
need to manage the digital risks associated 
with digitalisation in a reliable way, which 
means that their and their customers’ data are 
available at all times, secured against unwanted 
changes and protected against unauthorised 
access.
Outlook of banking and 
financial  supervision on 
digital risks
Supervisory approach to digital 
risks
The financial system is intended to ensure the 
efficient and cost- effective provision of finan -
cial resources and services to economic agents 
and individuals. Banking supervisors are tasked 
with monitoring the business activity of credit 
institutions by guaranteeing the efficiency and 
stability of the banking system.
Secure use of IT requires the successful com -
bination of human components with organisa -
tional and technical measures – it is therefore 
not enough to focus solely on technology. In addition, well- structured and effectively imple -
mented processes are a key factor for success 
in managing digital risks. Supervisors are thus 
taking an approach that is targeted towards 
analysing systems, not only with regard to the 
functioning of individual elements of risk man -
agement, but with respect to how these elem -
ents interact with each other within the risk 
management system and how they are embed -
ded in the bank’s integrated performance and 
risk management strategy.
As with other material risks, an approach to -
wards regulation and monitoring that is based 
on principles and processes has proven to be 
effective. For instance, the organisational du -
ties under Section 25a and Section 25b of the 
German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz)  are 
intended to ensure that credit institutions have 
adequate risk management, and this also 
covers outsourced processes.
The circulars issued by the Federal Financial 
Supervisory Authority (BaFin) on the Minimum 
Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) 
and Supervisory Requirements for IT in Finan -
cial Institutions ( Bankaufsichtliche Anforderun -
gen an die IT  – BAIT) outline in greater detail 
the expectations of the Banking Act in a 
technology- neutral manner. They reflect Euro -
pean requirements and the supervisory experi -
ence gleaned from IT inspections.
The Bundesbank and BaFin collaborate closely 
in drafting the circulars. Amongst other things, 
the Bundesbank relies on its practical experi -
ence gained from conducting on- site inspec -
tions. This, alongside discussions in expert 
panels and public consultations, has made it 
possible to structure the regulatory framework 
in line with practice. The specific information in 
the circulars is not exhaustive, as institutions 
also need to be aligned with the current stand -
ards and best practices on how to deal with 
digital risks.

stitutions themselves to decide which tech -
nologies or methods they wish to employ. This 
means that current developments such as 
cloud computing are also regulated in prin -
ciple. The principles- based requirements even 
allow effective supervision of artificial intelli -
gence and machine learning. In this context, it 
is essential to identify new methods and risks 
early on and to direct supervisors’ focus to -
wards them (see the box on pp. 57 ff.).
The Bundesbank’s role in 
addressing  digital risks in the  
banking sector
Working in conjunction with BaFin, the Bun -
desbank supervises around 1,650 credit institu -
tions in Germany. Cooperation in the off- site 
supervision of institutions is governed by Sec -
tion 7(1) of the Banking Act and the Prudential 
Supervisory Guideline (Aufsichtsrichtlinie) . The 
bulk of the Bundesbank’s work is carried out in 
its nine regional offices, in geographical prox -
imity to the institutions. Since 2014, the Bank 
has also been part of the Single Supervisory 
Mechanism (SSM) for the supervision of signifi -
cant institutions (SIs) in Europe, in which it also 
plays an important operational role through its 
participation in joint supervisory teams.
The cornerstone of supervisory activity is the 
supervisory review and evaluation process 
(SREP). In addition to financial risks, non-  
financial risks, including those of the digital var -
iety, are also assessed within this framework. 
Starting this year, the information required for 
this purpose has been collected not only from 
SIs1 but also directly from less significant insti -
tutions (LSIs) using a structured questionnaire. 
This is used as a basis for performing a super -
visory assessment of the potential digital threat 
facing an institution and how this is handled in 
the institution’s internal risk management sys -
tem.
On- site inspections provide the Bundesbank 
with a deep insight into institutions’ business operations and, in particular, their risk manage -
ment. The Bundesbank’s inspections are com -
missioned by BaFin in the case of LSIs and by 
the European Central Bank in the case of SIs. 
For IT inspections, the scope of the inspections 
relates to the organisational and technical re -
quirements set out in Sections 25a and 25b of 
the Banking Act and the further details on 
these provided in the MaRisk and BAIT circu -
lars. These system inspections are designed to 
assess the adequacy of risk management in 
light of the specific circumstances of each insti -
tution. The resulting ability to gain an overall 
picture of an institution’s digital risks as well as 
the process- oriented approach to IT inspections 
has proved to be a very effective way of work -
ing for the Bundesbank.
Over the last decade, the Bundesbank’s inspec -
tions of institutions and their IT service pro -
viders have increasingly focused on IT- related 
aspects and identified or brought about steady 
improvements in risk management processes. 
However, they frequently also detect funda -
mental vulnerabilities, problem areas and points 
for improvement with respect to addressing 
digital risks. Since 2010, the Bundesbank has 
carried out more than 2,000 on- site inspec -
tions and found material risk management de -
ficiencies in almost half of all inspections. 
Around 15% of these findings related to IT 
issues, primarily in the areas of information risk 
management, outsourcing management and 
information security management.
In addition to raising awareness of these issues 
through its inspections, the Bundesbank works 
towards the permanent elimination of deficits 
by continually monitoring them and conduct -
ing follow- up inspections. Supervisors thus 
continue to attach a great deal of importance 
to the topic of digital risks, particularly since 
the inspections routinely highlight the tasks … and permit

Artifi  cial intelligence and machine learning
The increased performance of IT infrastruc-
ture and advances in the application of ma-
chine learning processes open up the possi-
bility of the banking industry, too, using 
such innovative processes in both front and 
back offi   ce areas, for example in rating sys-
tems. From a supervisory perspective, the 
use of such processes in risk measurement 
and risk management systems is of particu-
lar interest. Manual processes and conven-
tional risk models are replaced with artifi  cial 
intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) 
processes, collectively referred to as ML 
methods for short. In this context, the term 
“AI” refers to the aim of using computer 
systems to perform complex tasks that trad-
itionally have required human intelligence.1 
ML is focused less on replicating human in-
telligence and more on applying learning 
processes such as neural networks – which 
are capable of mapping complex, non- 
linear relationships – and ensuring they can 
be deployed effi   ciently in decision- making 
processes. However, ML methods also give 
rise to new risks that need to be assessed 
by banking supervisors and ultimately con-
tained.
Relevant ML methods
There are many different approaches to de-
fi  ning ML.2 In order to delineate the areas 
that are relevant to banking supervision, it 
is therefore necessary to formulate a prag-
matic approach to identifying innovative 
models and their associated risks. The Bundes-
bank has thus chosen to base its consider-
ations on a three- dimensional ML scenario.3
– The fi  rst dimension, which comprises the 
dataset and methodology, describes the 
complexity of an ML method. For ex-
ample, if banks make use of deep neural 
networks, this leads to a high degree of complexity. On the other side of the spec-
trum are traditional statistical methods, 
as have been used in the fi  nancial sector 
for decades (such as logistic regressions 
or expert systems).
– The second dimension is based on the 
ML method itself and describes how the 
output is used. It thus represents the 
signifi   cance of the method within the 
risk management process. Here, account 
should be taken of how much weight 
the ML method has within the overall 
model as well as of how, and with what 
impact, its output is used in areas rele-
vant for supervision. If these fi  rst two 
dimen sions are particularly strongly pro-
nounced, the inspection techniques and 
inspection intensity of supervisory prac-
tices must be adapted.
– The third dimension relates to outsour-
cing and IT infrastructure. Supervisors 
have proposed a technology- neutral ap-
proach that, in particular, makes no dis-
tinction between in- house development 
and outsourcing or between underlying 
IT infrastructures. As central service pro-
viders and fi  ntech companies are ex-
pected to be the driving force behind the 
development of ML methods, there are 
plans to carry out prudential on- site in-
spections – within the scope of the exist-
ing regulatory framework for outsour-
1 See Financial Stability Board (2017).
2 Defi  nition by the Financial Stability Board (2017): 
“Machine learning may be defi  ned as a method of de-
signing a sequence of actions to solve a problem, 
known as algorithms, which optimise automatically 
through experience and with limited or no human 
intervention.” Mitchell (1997): “A computer program is 
said to learn from experience E with respect to some 
task T and some performance measure P , if its per-
formance on T, as measured by P , improves with ex-
perience E.”

cing  – at external service providers as 
well.
The role of current supervisory law
ML methods constitute neither their own 
supervisory area nor are they prudentially 
relevant solely due to the new technologies 
involved. Instead, these new methods can 
be largely assessed and evaluated for risk 
on the basis of existing process- oriented 
inspec tion frameworks. This applies, for ex-
ample, to rating systems, which are in any 
case subject to approval, and to early warn-
ing systems, which have been operated in 
the past without the use of ML. The super-
visory approach can be applied in a 
technology- neutral way, even if ML methods 
give rise to their own specifi  c issues. Primar-
ily, it is a matter of identifying the differ-
ences that exist compared to traditional 
models and processes, and determining 
how supervisors can deal with these. Above 
all, there are differences with regard to ex-
plainability, model development and valid-
ation, and training cycles. In order for banks 
to have certainty of planning when invest-
ing in ML methods, supervisors should 
tighten their focus and communicate any 
new requirements in a transparent way.4
Explainability
Banks must be able to understand their 
own decision- making processes and justify 
the measures that they implement. Deci-
sions should be based on causalities and 
functional relationships. By contrast, ML 
methods are successful mainly because they 
are able to independently recognise pat-
terns within data without being provided 
with fi  xed causalities, and thus enable 
measures to be derived from these pat-
terns. An inherent property of many ML 
methods is that, as a result of forgoing prior 
knowledge of causalities, they have a lack 
of explainability. This defi  ciency can be a hindrance to applying these methods – spe-
cifi  cally if causal explanations are required 
when using the output. Banks must there-
fore weigh up the benefi  ts offered by ML 
methods against the disadvantages pre-
sented by this “black box” characteristic. To 
this extent, increased model performance 
and/ or predictive ability, or a lack of other 
suitable methods, may justify the use of 
ML. However, it must be ensured that clear 
accountability is taken for decisions that are 
prepared chiefl  y, or even made entirely, by a 
black box method, and that these decisions 
are well integrated into comprehensive 
control processes. A number of approaches 
have been developed to make ML retro-
actively explainable (“explainable AI”, or 
XAI). These approaches are highly promis-
ing, as they provide selective and often in-
tuitive insight into how ML methods func-
tion. However, caution is still needed, as no 
XAI approach is able to offer complete ex-
plainability. The degree to which this black 
box characteristic can be tolerated there-
fore depends on the ML scenario in each in-
dividual case.
Model development and validation
In comparison with traditional statistical 
procedures, ML methods exhibit particular 
features in their development and mainten-
ance. As the volume, frequency and signifi  -
cance of data –  including unstructured 
data – increases, so too does the import-
ance of data quality and data preparation. 
There is a danger that inadequate data will 
be used to satisfy the high data require-
ments of ML methods, while the resulting 
consequences remain obscured due to their 
black box characteristic. However, insuffi   -
cient data quality not only has an impact on

that institutions were faced with and, in some 
cases, still are.
Information risk management is of particular 
importance in the management of digital risks. 
It represents a control loop in which safeguards 
are assigned to all IT components and risks, in 
particular from the incomplete implementation 
of these safeguards, are identified and moni -
tored on an ongoing basis. Process deficiencies 
in information risk management can lead to 
the institution lacking transparency regarding 
digital risks and consequently not managing 
these appropriately. It is often observed that in -
stitutions lack a complete overview of their key 
IT components and therefore not all necessary 
elements can be factored into risk analyses. In 
addition, many institutions still need to set out 
complete and consistent requirements for the 
safeguards needed and implement the main -
tenance processes necessary for these. Where 
there are requirements to be met, reviews of 
actual compliance with these often do not go into sufficient depth or are carried out too in -
frequently.
Outsourcing management is the practice of 
managing and monitoring outsourced pro -
cesses and the risks associated with these. This 
is mainly a decentralised process performed by 
the institution’s outsourcing units, which 
should be supported by central units such as an 
outsourcing function or central outsourcing 
management. The core principle of outsour -
cing management is that, whilst an institution 
can outsource the processes themselves, it can 
never outsource responsibility for them. As 
such, each institution must have a sufficient 
level of expertise on hand to be able to fully 
oversee its outsourcing arrangements and out -
sourcing risks. Shortcomings in the outsourcing 
management process can result in digital risks, 
especially those relating to IT services, going 
undetected or being subject to no more than 
rudimentary assessment. Inspections have re -
peatedly found that services are not classified Institutions need

processes  and 
activities, …model development, but also makes valid-
ation more diffi   cult, which is especially im-
portant in the case of black box methods.
Like all models, ML methods must therefore 
be integrated into a suitable control envir-
onment, too. This must ensure that model 
developers, validators and users are all 
equally convinced of the good quality of 
the model output, that accountability for 
errors is clearly regulated, and that both in-
ternal and external control units can gain 
adequate insight into the ML methods.
Training cycle
ML methods often allow for ongoing ad-
justment to take account of new data. This 
process, known as retraining, can either 
change the structure of the method and 
what are known as its hyperparameters,5 or 
be limited to optimising the method within its existing framework. This way, a model 
can be brought closer to a changing reality 
(for example in the case of structural 
changes and breaks). Nevertheless, banks 
should be aware of the disadvantages of re-
training – specifi  cally, reduced continuity 
and comparability. It is crucial that banks 
justify the need for the selected training 
cycle. In particular, model validation that 
typically takes place in predefi  ned cycles 
must also be able to suffi   ciently cover and 
comprehensively evaluate a model with on-
going retraining.

as outsourcing and that risk analyses for deter -
mining the materiality of an outsourcing ar -
rangement exhibit basic failings. Moreover, 
there are shortcomings related to the stipula -
tion of information and audit rights in outsour -
cing contracts and to requirements regarding 
sub- outsourcing. Monitoring long or complex 
chains of outsourcing is a challenging task for 
outsourcing management.
Information security management involves de -
fining and monitoring compliance with meas -
ures intended to safeguard IT under the direc -
tion of an information security officer. How -
ever, protection against hackers is only ever as 
good as the weakest link in the chain. Process 
deficiencies in information security manage -
ment can prevent institutions from reaching an 
appropriate and consistent level of security. 
With that in mind, safeguards implemented to 
protect IT should always comply with the re -
quirements set out in the prevailing standards, 
be in keeping with the state of the art and be 
tested regularly. However, if information secur -
ity officers are too close to the operational 
units they are monitoring, there is a risk that 
they will not be able to carry out their work 
without conflicts of interest. Inspection practice 
shows that there is often catching- up to do in 
both of these areas. In addition, internal tests 
to assess the effectiveness of implemented security  measures do not always go into suffi -
cient depth or are carried out too infrequently.
In particular, attacks that exploit inadequate 
security  measures have become one of the 
most significant digital risks and, due to the 
complex IT links between institutions, now 
pose a challenge to the financial system as a 
whole. The Bundesbank is making a vital con -
tribution to enhancing the cyber resilience of 
Germany’s financial sector on a lasting basis by 
conducting TIBER2-DE tests, as these tests de -
termine how effectively an enterprise’s defence 
mechanisms avert cyberattacks using attack 
scenarios that are as realistic as possible (see 
the box on pp. 61f.).
Outlook
The Bundesbank addresses digital risks in both 
SREP assessments and on- site inspections. As a 
voluntary instrument, TIBER- DE tests also help 
the financial sector to evaluate its resilience to 
digital risks. However, as the division of labour

TIBER- DE
As the pace of digital transformation picks 
up in the fi  nancial sector, so does vulner-
ability to cyberattacks. Against this back-
drop, central banks are increasingly focus-
ing on how to improve resilience to both in-
ternal and external attacks.
In summer 2019, the Bundesbank and the 
Federal Ministry of Finance implemented 
the European System of Central Banks’ 
framework for Threat Intelligence-based 
Ethical Red Teaming (TIBER- EU) in Germany 
as TIBER- DE.1 The TIBER- DE implementation 
document was published in July 2020.2 The 
aim behind TIBER- DE is to strengthen the 
cyber resilience of entities in Germany’s 
fi  nan cial sector and thus make a major 
contri bution to keeping the fi  nancial system 
stable and up and running.
During a TIBER- DE test, ethical hackers carry 
out simulated attacks on an entity. The tests 
take place under controlled conditions and 
are subject to strict risk management. The 
objective is to determine how effectively 
the entity’s defence mechanisms avert cy-
berattacks using attack scenarios that are as 
realistic as possible. To this end, information 
collected about the entity- specifi  c threat 
situation is exploited during the TIBER- DE 
test using techniques applied by real hack-
ers. Such attacks explicitly target the entity’s 
critical functions and the corresponding live 
systems. For banks, this could be cash or 
cashless payment systems, lending systems 
or online banking. Unlike classic penetra-
tion testing, which focuses solely on tech-
nical vulnerabilities in systems, TIBER- DE 
tests also cover organisational shortcom-
ings as well as the human factor in their 
attack  scenarios.Ideal candidates for TIBER- DE are large 
banks, insurers, fi  nancial market infrastruc-
tures and their critical service providers. Par-
ticipation in TIBER- DE tests is voluntary and 
encourages entities to act on their own ini-
tiative and take a critical look at their own 
cyber resilience. To raise awareness of the 
growing threat posed by cyberattacks, the 
executive board of the entity being tested is 
involved in the process from the outset. A 
TIBER- DE test should not be seen as a pass- 
fail test; instead it is successful if it has been 
conducted in accordance with the frame-
work.
The national competence centre for TIBER- 
DE – the TIBER Cyber Team (TCT) – is based 
at the Bundesbank and is separate from 
fi  nan cial supervision in both organisational 
and procedural terms. However, fi  nancial 
supervisors are informed that a test is to be 
carried out and involved at set points in the 
proceedings. The TCT is overseen by a steer-
ing committee comprising representatives 
from the Bundesbank and the Federal 
Finan cial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). This 
steering committee defi  nes the strategic 
objectives for TIBER- DE.
The TCT supports entities throughout the 
TIBER- DE test, providing them with the 
neces sary expertise and checking compli-
ance with the TIBER- DE framework. Once 
the test has been completed –  a process 
which can take up to one year – the TCT 
provides attestation confi  rming that the 
 entity’s test was conducted in accordance 
with the framework.

The TIBER- EU framework has been imple-
mented in other EU Member States, too, 
for instance in the Netherlands, Denmark 
and Belgium. Those Member States that 
have already implemented TIBER- EU have 
agreed to mutual recognition of test com-
pletion. Close cooperation and a coordin-
ated approach between the authorities in-
volved and the entities should thus improve 
cyber resilience throughout the fi  nancial 
sector and appropriately counter the risks 
stemming from digital transformation.
There is high- level acceptance of and de-
mand for TIBER- DE in the German fi  nancial 
sector. At the time of writing, the number 
of TIBER- DE tests that have begun already 
stood at nine.
TIBER- DE tests can make a major contribu-
tion towards strengthening cyber resilience. 
In particular, they enable participating 
entities  to use a concrete attack scenario to 
test the interplay between various pro-
cesses to thwart cyberattacks, the employ-
ees involved in these processes and the sys-
tems affected. TIBER- DE tests show that 
human error or a lack of security guidelines 
may render technologically sophisticated 
security measures ineffective. They also 
highlight shortcomings in existing processes 
and insuffi   cient investment in safeguards, 
and convey these fi  ndings transparently 
to  management. Raising management’s 
awareness of specifi  c cyber risks can help to 
pinpoint additional areas that require in-
vestment, tailor budget decisions more 
closely to security requirements and imple-
ment corrective measures in a more tar-
geted manner.
TIBER- DE tests also show that attentive and 
informed employees are able to detect and 
ward off even sophisticated attacks early on 
if entities have well- defi  ned internal security 
protocols and processes. Regular campaigns to raise staff awareness of cyberattacks are 
one possible defence measure, and the 
effec tiveness of such campaigns can be 
examined in TIBER- DE tests.
By implementing standardised TIBER tests 
in  Germany, the Bundesbank is ensuring 
that entities’ resilience does not just exist 
on paper but that this is also checked in 
practical terms and under real- world condi-
tions. In view of the growing risk situation, 
TIBER- DE tests are therefore making a vital 
contribution to enhancing the cyber resili-
ence of  Germany’s fi  nancial sector on a 
lasting basis.Deutsche Bundesbank

ments also have to be made to the supervisory 
approach.
For example, in its updated principles for the 
management of operational risk3 and new prin -
ciples for operational resilience,4 the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision recently 
gave the banking sector clear guidance on the 
design of the essential elements in dealing with 
digital risks and on how to address them. These 
principles are adopted by supervisory author -
ities in national frameworks and supervisory 
practice, amongst other things, and should be 
implemented proportionately by banks.
Furthermore, in drawing up the Digital Oper -
ational Resilience Act (DORA),5 the European 
Commission will create harmonised require -
ments for managing digital risks at institutions, 
increase transparency with regard to any pos -
sible concentration of digital risks, and 
strengthen financial supervisory authorities’ 
ability to act with regard to banks and critical 
third- party IT providers. This outsourcing issue 
is also addressed in the Act to Strengthen 
Financial  Market Integrity (Gesetz zur Stärkung 
der Finanzmarktintegrität) ,6 which was adopted 
by the Bundestag in May of this year.
Work is also being carried out to harmonise the 
supervisory approach to artificial intelligence 
and machine learning at the international level 
in the future in order to create a level playing 
field. In addition to the principles published by 
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 
the European Commission is drafting a regula -
tion on artificial intelligence that proposes har -
monised rules to apply beyond the financial 
sector.7 However, taking machine learning as a 
case in point shows that the risks stemming 
from new technologies and methods can al -
ready be adequately addressed within the 
scope of existing regulatory requirements.
Digitalisation will continue to shape societal 
and economic developments, and the pace of 
technological change will remain high, espe -
cially in the banking sector. Institutions’ long-  term success therefore also depends heavily on 
the consistent and proper use of innovative 
technologies. Institutions have to face up to 
this rapid transformation and play an active 
part in shaping it in order to be able to con -
tinue offering services relevant to their custom -
ers and thus remain structurally competitive.
The downside of digitalisation, however, is that 
the rising complexity and increasing division of 
labour in banking business is also causing the 
potential for risk to grow, especially where in -
stitutions continue to work with highly frag -
mented IT landscapes and technologies that 
have evolved over time. It is important to con -
tinue operating IT infrastructures and applica -
tions securely and enhance them as needed in 
order to protect sensitive customer data and 
ensure stable operation. To this end, banks 
need to have, first and foremost, a thorough 
understanding and must ensure that their 
digital risks are managed in an appropriate 
manner. The same applies to outsourced pro -
cesses. This is the only way for institutions to 
keep their customers’ trust and maintain the 
level of resilience needed as key factors for sus -
tainable economic success.
The Bundesbank will continue to promote the 
principles- based and technology- neutral regu -
lation of digital risks at all levels. Technological 
progress needs to be facilitated, as does the 
proportionate and autonomous implementa -
tion of regulation at institutions. In addition, 
the Bundesbank will continue to encourage in -
stitutions to be resolute in taking advantage of 
the opportunities offered by digitalisation. At 
the same time, however, it is necessary for 
banks to systematically strengthen the way in 
which they manage the risks that these entail 
in order to keep up with the growing digital Banking busi -

Macroprudential policy and growth-at-risk
The connection between financial imbalances and severe downturns in the real economy has 
increasingly come to the forefront of academic and economic policy debate since the global 
financial and economic crisis. In times when the economy is expanding, vulnerabilities can build 
up in the financial system. These include excessive leverage and overpriced assets. If a negative 
shock were to hit such financial imbalances, the result may be unfavourable interactions between 
the financial system and the real economy. This could culminate in a severe recession or even a 
financial and banking crisis. Looking to the upturn following the coronavirus crisis, too, there is 
the question of the extent to which financial vulnerabilities are building up that could result in 
new downside risks further down the road.
This article presents the growth- at- risk approach, which models the relationship between finan -
cial imbalances and downside risk in the real economy. Downside risk in the real economy is 
measured using the lower end of the probability distribution for the growth rate of gross domes -
tic product (GDP) – such as the largest decreases that occur with a 5% probability. Quantile 
regressions are used to show that downside risk in the real economy fluctuates over time in con -
nection with financial stress and financial vulnerabilities.
This relationship is then studied in more detail with the help of structural quantile vector auto -
regressive models. These models enable the quantification of the impact of exogenous shocks on 
downside risk in the real economy. According to the model estimates, an abrupt deterioration in 
financing conditions can significantly increase the risk of severe downturns in the real economy.
The effect of financial shocks on downside risk in the real economy varies systematically depend -
ing on certain country characteristics which reflect financial vulnerabilities. For example, the prob -
ability of very large downturns in the real economy caused by financial shocks is greater, in par -
ticular, in countries with structurally higher levels of household debt and in countries whose bank -
ing systems have high foreign currency exposures.
Macroprudential policy can strengthen the resilience of the financial system and counteract the 
build- up of financial vulnerabilities, reducing downside risk in the real economy. However, the 
empirical evidence also shows that it is difficult to make real- time estimates of growth- at- risk with 
a longer lead time. Thus, findings from the growth- at- risk approach should always be embedded 
in an overall picture of the risk situation in the financial system, enabling macroprudential policy -
makers to respond to the build- up of vulnerabilities at an early stage.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The period prior to the onset of the financial 
and economic crisis of 2008-09 – just like the 
period leading up to the sovereign debt crisis in 
the euro area – was characterised by years of 
vulnerabilities building up in the financial sec -
tors of some countries. These vulnerabilities 
can be traced back to financial imbalances such 
as excessive leverage and overpriced assets. In 
the wake of these crises, the relationship be -
tween financial imbalances and severe down -
turns in the real economy received more atten -
tion in the academic literature and economic 
policy debate. Strong slowdowns in economic 
growth in Germany have generally been linked 
to stress in the financial system since at least 
the 1970s (see the chart below).1 This relation -
ship was very pronounced during the financial 
and economic crisis of 2008-09 in particular, 
and the need for measures with a greater pre -
ventive focus became clear.The interaction between economic growth and 
the financial system can be heavily influenced 
by vulnerabilities and the systemic risk resulting 
from them. Vulnerabilities can build up in times 
when the economy is expanding. During such 
periods, financing conditions are typically fa -
vourable, risk premia are small, and asset prices 
are rising. This can produce a situation in which 
decisions taken by market players seem to 
make sense at the micro level but neglect the 
potential negative implications for the stability 
of the financial system. These “externalities” 
can lead to an excessive increase in leverage in 
the non- financial sector and risk appetite in the 
financial system. If substantial vulnerabilities 
have built up, even small shocks can trigger 
amplification effects through the financial sys -
tem which may result in strong economic 
downturns. This is especially the case if there 
are financial constraints in the economy which 
have the potential to become binding in a cri -
sis. If a negative shock hits the economy, the 
market price of assets falls. Falling asset prices 
can worsen the creditworthiness of the non-  
financial sector, for one thing. For another, the 
financial sector becomes less willing to grant 
loans, and there may be a supply- side credit 
crunch. If financial constraints become binding, 
risk premia can rise abruptly. The initial shock 
may be amplified by the interplay between fall -
ing asset prices, reduced lending and deterior -
ating creditworthiness. The higher the leverage 
of the non- financial sector and the more the 
finan cial sector reduces its risk appetite com -
pared with an upturn, the more significant this 
amplification mechanism becomes.
Macroprudential policy plays an important pre -
ventive role. It contributes to the stability of the 
financial system by identifying macro- financial 
vulnerabilities at an early stage and acting to 
counter them using the appropriate instru -
ments. On the one hand, macroprudential pol -
icy reduces the incentives to take on excessive Especially deep

risk ex ante. The instruments used for this pur -
pose are designed to help ensure that the ef -
fects of individual decisions on the stability of 
the financial system are taken into account. On 
the other hand, various macroprudential instru -
ments, such as the countercyclical capital buf -
fer for banks, enhance the financial system’s 
resili ence. This lowers the probability of self-  
reinforcing mechanisms being triggered.
This article explores the question of whether 
variables that reflect the build- up of vulnerabil -
ities and short- term stress in the financial sys -
tem contain information about downside risk 
in the real economy. In this context, downside 
risk in the real economy means the lower end 
of the probability distribution for the rate of 
change in GDP – such as the largest decreases 
that occur with a 5% probability. The growth- 
at- risk approach is used for this purpose. This 
approach examines the relationship between 
downside risk in the real economy and financial 
stress as well as financial vulnerabilities.2
The growth- at- risk approach is now being used 
by many central banks and international institu -
tions, such as the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF). It makes it possible to quantify the im -
pact of the build- up of vulnerabilities in the 
finan cial system and the potential occurrence 
of financial stress on downside risk in the real 
economy. However, growth- at- risk is a very 
new and dynamic research field. Existing stud -
ies sometimes arrive at different results regard -
ing the extent to which robust conclusions for 
the probability distribution of economic growth 
can be derived from macro- financial variables.3 
Being aware of its limitations, the Bundesbank 
applies the growth- at- risk approach in its finan -
cial stability analyses alongside other methods, 
such as the early warning indicator for financial 
crises, and is constantly refining the models 
used for this.4Financial imbalances and 
growth- at- risk – conceptual 
framework
In 2008, the global financial crisis interrupted a 
period of stable economic growth and low 
finan cial market volatility that had lasted sev -
eral years. Especially severe downturns of this 
kind with a low probability of occurrence are 
also known as tail events. One explanation for 
them is financial frictions, which can lead to 
non- linear economic growth. In other words, 
enterprises and households which would re -
ceive loans under normal circumstances are 
suddenly shut out of the credit market and 
have to restrict their consumption and invest -
ment. This exacerbates an economic down -
turn.5
Both financial intermediaries and enterprises in 
the non- financial sector often face constraints 
when financing their activities (financial fric -
tions) if, for example, they have low equity 
ratios or too little collateral.6 If, for instance, 
the market value of equity (difference between 
the value of assets and of debt) in the financial 
sector is high, that sector has easy access to 
additional debt funding. During periods of eco -
nomic stress, however, the value of assets de -
clines, which means that if the value of debt re -
mains unchanged, the market value of equity 
falls and access to financing is hindered. A simi -
lar financial friction restricts the debt capacity 
of non- financial enterprises and households. In Growth- at- risk

2 The term “growth- at- risk” was first used by Wang and 
Yao (2001). The concept and methods were popularised by 
the paper published by Adrian et al. (2019). The term is 
based on the financial sector concept of “value- at- risk”.

Financial Stability Committee (2018) and Beutel et al. 
(2019).
5 Another example of a friction which can likewise bring 
about strong non- linearities is the effective lower bound of 
the short- term interest rate. See, in particular, Christiano et 
al. (2014) and Aruoba et al. (2017).
6 For models in which financial intermediaries face finan -
cial constraints, see, inter alia, Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) 
and Gertler and Karadi (2011). Examples of models in 
which the financial constraint exists in the non- financial 
sector include Bernanke et al. (1999), Kiyotaki and Moore 
(1997) and Carlstrom and Fuerst (1997).Deutsche Bundesbank

particular, their ability to take up additional 
finan cing depends on the market value of their 
total assets. The higher the market value of 
assets, the easier and cheaper it is for the non- 
financial sector to obtain loans from the finan -
cial sector in order to finance investment and 
consumption.
Irrespective of whether the financial friction 
exists in the financial or the non- financial sec -
tor, it produces amplification mechanisms be -
tween the real economy and the financial sys -
tem. The market value of total assets in the 
non- financial sector and of equity in the finan -
cial sector is subject to cyclical volatility. In 
times of high asset valuations and low volatility, 
the financial and non- financial sectors can ob -
tain funding relatively easily. In the financial 
sector, this increases the incentive to take on 
more debt in order to enjoy greater leverage. 
This means that given a specific level of assets/ 
equity, a higher level of debt is possible. Risk 
premia for risky investments are low, and finan -
cial intermediaries increase the loan supply. In 
such times, rising asset prices, low financial 
market volatility and highly valued collateral in -
crease banks’ solvency and lending capacity, 
but also their willingness to take greater risks.7 
In the non-  financial sector, high asset prices 
and low volatility imply greater collateral qual -
ity. Debt capacity rises along with assets, mean -
ing that enterprises and households take on 
more debt. Market players’ decisions to take 
on more debt and more risk seem to make 
sense at the micro level, but can potentially 
have adverse  implications for the stability of 
the finan cial system if negative shocks occur at 
the macro level.
The leverage built up during an upturn makes 
the economy vulnerable. If a negative shock 
hits the economy, output, investment and the 
market price of assets all fall. If the financial or 
real sector is heavily indebted, even small 
changes in the market price of assets can lead 
to major equity losses. As a result, financial fric -
tions may become binding for enterprises, 
households and banks, meaning that loans that would have been possible in normal times are 
no longer granted. First, the non- financial sec -
tor’s debt capacity drops substantially. Second, 
the financial sector becomes less willing to 
grant loans, and there may be a supply- side 
credit crunch. Risk premia can rise abruptly on 
account of growing risk aversion in the finan -
cial sector, which would exacerbate a down -
turn in the real economy. If financial frictions 
become binding, they can be amplified by mar -
ket liquidity frictions. The latter limit the ability 
to exchange investments and other assets for 
liquid financial assets such as deposits during 
periods of stress. The financial friction leads to 
investors increasingly and simultaneously wish -
ing to sell assets in times of crisis in order to re -
main solvent. This has a negative impact on the 
value of asset prices. Existing market liquidity 
frictions can result in market illiquidity, with 
even stronger drops in asset prices. The latter 
exerts added pressure on equity, amplifying fi -
nancial frictions which put more pressure on 
asset prices. Frictions which affect market li -
quidity can therefore trigger additional non-  
linear dynamics.8 The initial shock can be amp -
lified in a non- linear way by this self- reinforcing 
interaction between asset prices and financial 
and market liquidity frictions in the economy 
(see the chart below for a stylised depiction).9 
The vulnerabilities built up from the high lever -
age and weak balance sheets in the financial 
sector and/ or the real economy can thus lead 
to severe recessions or even financial and bank -
ing crises.10… which are 
not binding in 
times of sound 
economic 
growth. Vulner -
abilities can thus 
build up, as 
incentives to 
take on more 
debt and finan -
cial risks 
increase
When existing 
vulnerabilities 
are high, finan -
cial constraints 
can become 
binding in reces -
sions and amp -
lify the down -
turn7 See Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009), Adrian, Moench 
and Shin (2010) and Adrian and Shin (2014).
8 The model of Kiyotaki and Moore (2012) contains both 
market liquidity frictions and financial constraints. Financial 
constraints restrict access to additional external financing, 
while the market liquidity friction limits firms’ ability to gen -
erate additional funds by selling financial assets in the mar -
ket. Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009) show how these 
two constraints interact with and reinforce each other. In 
their model, market liquidity constraints result in high asset 
price volatility brought about by fire sales. Strong down -
turns in asset prices resulting from market liquidity con -
straints in turn increase financial constraints.

Models with financial frictions form the theor -
etical basis for macroprudential policy meas -
ures. By strengthening the resilience of the 
finan cial system, macroprudential instruments 
can help prevent financial frictions from be -
coming binding, thus limiting downside risks to 
economic growth.11 Without macroprudential 
policy, economies in these models show exces -
sive debt levels owing to financial frictions, 
which increases the frequency and severity of 
financial  crises and recessions.12 This is because 
the decisions made by market participants fail 
to take into account the potential negative re -
percussions for the stability of the financial sys -
tem. Theoretically speaking, macroprudential 
instruments could prevent excessive debt and 
bolster economic resilience.13 The theory sug -
gests that the use of macroprudential instru -
ments is particularly welfare- enhancing when 
its intensity is tailored to the build- up and de -
cline of vulnerabilities. This can be achieved by 
means of a four- step policy cycle.14 First, the 
policy objective is specified and the relevant 
frictions are pinpointed. The second step is to 
identify objectively verifiable and measurable 
indicators which can be used to evaluate the 
need for policy action. The impact of any meas -
ures on pre- defined indicators can be estimated 
through ex ante evaluations. Once the meas -
ures have been taken, ex post evaluations can 
reveal whether the objectives have been achieved and whether any unintended side 
effects  have arisen. Information about the rela -
tionship between developments in the financial 
system and real economic downside risks from 
the growth- at- risk approach can potentially be 
incorporated into all four of these steps.
Empirical link between 
financial  imbalances and 
growth- at- risk
Periods in which macro- financial imbalances 
have built up are often followed by severe re -
cessions and financial crises.15 Strong credit 
growth can also predict sharp declines in bank 
equity prices.16 Moreover, a study for the 
United States shows that periods of very low 
credit risk premia and optimistic expectations 
about future financing terms often give way to 
periods of weak economic growth.17 In add -Macroprudential

ition, credit crunches lead to more serious 
reces sions, with the subsequent economic 
recovery  taking place more slowly compared 
with recessions that are not accompanied by 
credit crunches.18 Part of the empirical growth- 
at- risk literature also investigates the extent to 
which macro- financial developments are linked 
to the occurrence of extreme events a few 
years later. Although exceptionally favourable 
finan cing conditions are accompanied by low 
downside risks in the short term, in the me -
dium term, this relationship is reversed, with 
economic downturns that are especially severe 
becoming more likely.19 The severity of these 
downturns also depends on the degree and 
dynamics  of private sector debt, developments 
in real estate prices and the accumulation of 
current account deficits.20 Above- average levels 
in these measures signal that significantly larger 
downside risks to the real economy are to be 
expected in a few years’ time. This is consistent 
with the early- warning characteristics that earl -ier empirical studies identified for debt and 
house price indicators.21
The extent to which cyclical downside risks are 
correlated with changes in financial stress can 
be estimated using the growth- at- risk ap -
proach, which analyses how the estimated 5% 
quantile of the growth in industrial production 
fluctuates as financial stress rises and falls (for 
details about the model used, see pp. 73-74).22 
Finan cial stress is measured using an indicator 
of financial conditions and an indicator of fi -
nancial market uncertainty. These indicators 
combine a large quantity of relevant informa -
tion and are influenced by monetary policy and 
fiscal policy, amongst other factors. The adja -
cent chart shows the development of the 5th, 
50th and 95th percentiles of the probability 
distribution of German industrial production 
conditional on these indicators as well as the 
values actually recorded for the observation 
period. It illustrates that the conditional down -
side risks (5th percentile) fluctuate significantly 
more strongly than the median (50th percent -
ile) or the corresponding upside risks (95th per -
centile). It is clear, for instance, that the down -
side risks were particularly high during and 
after the global financial and economic crisis of 
2008-09. This indicates that financial market 
variables have an asymmetrical impact on the 
conditional probability distribution of industrial 
production, which supports theories in which 
financial and market liquidity frictions can sud -
denly become binding.
The link outlined for Germany between ele -
vated financial stress and growing real eco -
nomic downside risks can be observed across a 
large number of countries. The upper chart on

finan cial stress (top) and financial vulnerabilities 
(bottom) before and after recessions.23 The 
path of both measures reflects the average 
across all time periods and countries ob -
served.24 The point in time at which the reces -
sion begins is standardised to zero.25 There are 
signs that the measure for financial stress rises 
sharply during recessions and then falls again. 
The measure for vulnerabilities, which captures 
the simultaneous rise in debt and asset prices 
(equity, debt and real estate prices) largely mir -
rors this. In times of low financial stress, finan -
cial vulnerabilities build up in accordance with 
the theory on the expected impact of financial 
frictions.
Owing to the close (inverse) relationship be -
tween financial stress and the build- up of finan-
cial vulnerabilities, both measures are used to 
estimate growth- at- risk models in the litera -
ture. The upper section of the adjacent bottom 
chart calculates growth- at- risk by making it 
conditional on the measure for financial stress, 
whilst in the lower section, growth- at- risk is 
conditional on the measure for financial vulner -
abilities. The chart shows the 5th percentile of 
the average growth rate of GDP across the 
countries and periods analysed. In both cases, 
it falls significantly during the recessions. The 
key finding from this analysis is that there is a 
robust statistical relationship across a large 
number of countries and periods between an 
abrupt deterioration in financing conditions 
and the probability of severe economic slumps.

25 The following simplified method is used in order to date 
recessions uniformly across different countries. The start of 
the recession is dated as the first quarter in which the GDP 
growth rate was negative. The end of the recession is 
dated as the third consecutive quarter in which GDP 
growth was positive again.Deutsche Bundesbank

to fall sharply is five quarters before the start of 
a recession. The increased likelihood of a se -
vere economic slump is therefore indicated 
fairly shortly before the outbreak of a reces -
sion.26 Because macroprudential measures usu -
ally require  a longer lead time before they take 
effect , such signals could come too late. Inter -
preting the signals in real time poses an add -
itional challenge. This means that macropru -
dential policy measures need to be imple -
mented before growth- at- risk estimates indi -
cate strong downside risks in order to 
counteract the build- up of vulnerabilities in 
good time. Macroprudential measures that 
make the financial system more resilient to 
shocks should be taken in “good times”, and 
thus much earlier than growth-  at- risk models 
are normally able to show, in order to limit the 
risk of negative shocks being amplified through 
financial frictions in “bad times”.
The transfer of financial 
shocks to growth- at- risk 
and the role of financial 
imbalances 
The results obtained so far indicate a statistical 
relationship between real economic downside 
risks and financing conditions. The analyses 
have not yet revealed whether there is also an 
economic and causal relationship between the 
variables. This is also true for the potential di -
rection of impact: although a slump in eco -
nomic activity may, on the one hand, be caused 
or amplified by stress in the financial markets, 
on the other hand, the financial markets might 
also respond to deteriorations in the real econ -
omy or greater uncertainty regarding the future 
economic outlook with turmoil and increased 
volatility. To gain a better understanding of the 
impact of time- varying financing conditions on 
the economy, researchers in this area use struc -
tural vector autoregression (SVAR) models. 
These linear multi- equation models can capture 
the dynamic relationships between a large 
number of key macroeconomic variables. The 
residual values of the various individual equa -tions can be used to identify the drivers of the 
model, i.e. the structural economic shocks. The 
aim is to observe the impact of exogenous 
shocks on the system in isolation and to esti -
mate their relative importance.
The majority of SVAR models used in the ap -
plied economic research model the dynamic re -
lationship of the averages of each variable, 
while the distribution of the variables around 
the average only depends on the statistical 
properties of the residual values. Model classes 
that model the dynamic relationships of the in -
dividual quantiles of the variables separately 
can be used to analyse changing dynamic cor -
relations between financing conditions and 
economic growth at different points of the 
probability distribution of economic growth.27 
To this end, methods have recently been de -
veloped in the academic literature that expand 
the above-  mentioned quantile regressions 
using dynamic multi- equation models. These 
models are called structural quantile vector 
autore gression (structural QVAR) models (see 
the box on pp. 76 f. for a more detailed explan -
ation of the methods and an additional appli -
cation).28
To capture the dynamic relationship between 
financing conditions and the distribution of 
economic growth in the short and medium 
term, a model of this type is estimated for Ger -
many for the period from the first quarter of 
1983 to the second quarter of 2019 with the 
following endogenous variables: the US excess 
bond premium (EBP), German GDP , German 
employment figures, the German Consumer 
Price Index, euro area key interest rates, and Causal effects

markets  and

26 The difficulty of predicting growth- at- risk over longer 
periods is discussed, inter alia, in Brownlees and Souza

27 Alternatively, models with stochastic volatility can be 
used. See Carriero et al. (2020) for information about esti -
mating the risk of extreme events using Bayesian VARs with 
stochastic volatility.

on Schüler (2020b). See also Beutel et al. (2020). A further

Estimating growth- at- risk using quantile regressions: 
methodological  background
Growth- at- risk is measured as a pre- defi  ned 
quantile at the lower end of the distribution 
of a real economic growth rate. Real eco-
nomic growth can be measured here as the 
growth rate of, for instance, gross domestic 
product (GDP) or industrial production. 
Growth- at- risk is then often measured as 
the 5% quantile of the distribution of this 
growth rate conditional on certain explana-
tory variables. By estimating various quan-
tiles, the entire conditional distribution can 
also be approximated. Quantile regressions 
are a widespread method of estimating 
quantiles of variables.1
In quantile regressions, the conditional 
quantile of a variable Y is modelled as a lin-
ear function of a vector of conditioning 
variables X:
qY,⌧(X)=X0.
Here, qY,τ(X) is the τ quantile of Y condi-
tional on X, defi  ned as:
P(yt+hqY,⌧(X);Xt=X)= ⌧.
This means that the probability, conditional 
on X at time t , that Y  at time t  + h is less 
than or equal to the considered quantile, is 
exactly τ, i.e. 5%, for instance.
In order to put this concept into operation, 
the parameter vector β must be estimated. 
The estimated parameter vector βˆ minim-
ises the sum, weighted with the chosen 
value τ, of the absolute value of the devi-
ations ut+h = yt+h – Xtβ:
ˆβ=argminThX
t=1(⌧1ut+h0 |ut+h |
+ (1⌧)1ut+h<0|ut+h |),where 1(.) is an indicator function which 
assumes  the value of 1  if the condition is 
met and 0 otherwise. This “loss function” 
penalises more severely those deviations 
which should be less likely given the quan-
tile to be estimated. For instance, if a 5% 
quantile is to be estimated, exactly 5% of 
the values in the sample should be less than 
or equal to the quantile and 95% of the 
values  greater than it. It is exactly this aim 
which is achieved by the described loss 
function: values under the 5% quantile in-
crease the function value to be minimised 
more strongly than values above the 5% 
quantile. The robustness of the estimate in-
creases with the number of available obser-
vations. This approach can be used to esti-
mate various growth- at- risk models de-
pending on the choice of the variables Y, X 
and τ.
An example that illustrates this point is a 
growth- at- risk model designed to gauge 
the downside risk to industrial production 
in Germany attributable exclusively to fi  nan-
cial stress using available short- term data. 
Unlike measures such as the Bundesbank’s 
weekly activity index (WAI),2 the focus of 
the model is not to measure or predict the 
business cycle but to operationalise the 
above- described interplay between fi  nan-
cial market developments and downside 
risks to the real economy from the perspec-
tive of the growth- at- risk approach.3 To this 
end, various quantiles of industrial produc-
tion growth with a frequency and forecast

the German financial stress index CLIFS.29 The 
EBP is the residual component of the credit risk 
premium adjusted for the influence of the pro -
jected probability of default of the enterprises 
and economic activity. It can therefore be inter -
preted as risk appetite within the financial sys -
tem.30 The effects of an unexpected deterior -
ation in global financing conditions on the dif -
ferent quantiles of the probability distribution 
of economic growth can be quantified using 
the structural QVAR model. Here, shocks to the 
US EBP are used to proxy shocks to global 
finan cing conditions.31 The US dollar plays a 
pivotal role as a financing currency for inter -
national financial intermediaries and as an an -
chor currency for portfolios worldwide. As a 
result , US financing conditions are a key factor 
for the global financial cycle and financing 
conditions  around the world.32
The influence of the financial shock on growth- 
at- risk in Germany can be estimated using what 
are known as quantile impulse response func -tions. These depict the response of the various 
quantiles of the probability distribution of the 
endogenous model variables following shocks 
to financing conditions. Impulse response func -
tions for various scenarios are derived from the 
structural QVAR model (see the chart on p. 75). 
The first scenario analyses the dynamic re -
sponse at median economic growth in Ger -
many to a shock to global financing conditions 
originating from the United States. This scen -
ario can be interpreted as the typical response 
of the financial sector and real economy in Ger -
many. The results of the “median scenario” 
show that a sudden rise in the EBP of 200 basis 
points would lower the median (i.e. the 50th Estimation

the VIX volatility index. These measures are 
available at a weekly frequency and refl  ect 
global funding conditions and uncertainty 
in the fi  nancial markets, which play a key 
role for Germany, too, owing to an inte-
grated international capital market.4 The 
quantile regression is estimated over the 
January 1990 to October 2020 period. By 
estimating a series of quantiles, the entire 
conditional distribution function can be ap-
proximated.

NFCI for a given month are used in the quantile regres-
sions.

percentile) of economic growth in Germany by 
up to 0.8 percentage point in the first quarter. 
Here, the simulated rise in the EBP roughly cor -
responds to the rise that was seen in the United 
States during the 2008 financial crisis. Four 
quarters later, the median of the growth distri -
bution returns to its original value. Financing 
conditions in Germany would also deteriorate 
significantly, which may be a reason for the 
negative economic impact of the global finan -
cial shock. These results from the median scen -
ario are consistent with the existing literature 
on the international transmission of US finan -
cial shocks.33
The second scenario investigates how GDP 
growth behaves at the bottom 10th percent -
ile.34 A considerably stronger response to a rise 
in the EBP is seen at the 10th percentile of GDP 
growth than at the median of the distribution. 
The 10th percentile of GDP growth is thus 
around 2.5 percentage points below the base -
line. As the unconditional 10th percentile of 
GDP growth stands at -0.5%, this means that 
German GDP growth would, with a conditional 
probability of 10%, stand at -3% or lower in 
the first quarter following a global financial 
shock. After this shock, the bottom 10th per -
centile of GDP growth also remains below its 
historical baseline for a considerably longer 
period of time than the median. Only after 
around eight quarters does growth- at- risk re -
turn to its baseline. The impulse response func -
tions thus suggest that a global financial shock 
can have a non- linear impact on the distribu -
tion of economic growth and that the probabil -
ity of especially severe economic downturns 
rises considerably.
This non-  linearity can also be confirmed for a 
broad cross- section of countries. For this, the 
structural QVAR is expanded into a multi-  
country model (known as a panel SQVAR, or 
PSQVAR). This allows the impulse response 
functions at the 10th percentile of economic 
growth to be estimated for a large number of 
countries (details on the model and its results 
can be found on pp. 76 f.). For the cross- section of advanced and emerging economies, as is 
also the case for Germany, it appears that a 
global financial shock significantly increases 
growth- at- risk on average across all countries. 
Here, there are considerable differences in the 
magnitude of the effect between the individual 
economies. These differences can be linked to 
various country- specific characteristics that de -
pict financial vulnerabilities. In this way, it is 
possible to determine whether there is a rela -
tionship between the financial vulnerability of a 
country and its growth- at- risk following an un -
expected deterioration in global financial con -
ditions over a cross- section of multiple coun -
tries.

Impact of global fi  nancial shocks on downside risks to 
growth in an international panel
If global fi  nancial shocks of the kind seen 
during the global fi  nancial and economic 
crisis in 2008-09 materialise, there can be 
downside risks to the global economy. It is 
possible to quantify such downside risks 
from a global fi  nancial shock using an inter-
national panel dataset based on a structural 
quantile vector autoregressive (QVAR) 
model.1 This structural QVAR model allows 
analysts to depict non- linear relationships 
between the endogenous variables. In par-
ticular, it enables an assessment to be made 
of the impact of a global fi  nancial shock on 
the different percentiles of the probability 
distribution of real gross domestic product 
(GDP) growth. As a result, it is possible to 
determine the growth- at- risk effects of the 
shock at the lower end of the GDP distribu-
tion, making the model particularly suitable 
for identifying downside risks.The analysis is based on an international 
panel of 44 countries in total.2 Two steps 
are used to determine the impact of a 
global fi  nancial shock. In the fi  rst step, a 
QVAR model is estimated for each country 
over a period extending from the fi  rst quar-
ter of 1980 until the fourth quarter of 2018. 
The model estimation uses Bayesian methods 
with a non- informative prior distribution for 
the coeffi   cients, and models the US excess 
bond premium (EBP),3 real GDP growth, 
consumer price infl  ation and the short- term 
interest rate of the country in question. The 
EBP is used to proxy global fi  nancing condi-
tions on account of the key role played by 
the United States in global fi  nancial mar-
kets.4 The second step is to estimate panel 
quantile impulse responses. This is done 
using a mean group estimator based on 
average country- specifi  c impulse responses.5
To depict a typical fi  nancial shock, the struc-
tural QVAR model is used to simulate an un-
expected increase in the EBP by one stand-
ard deviation. The shock is identifi  ed by ap-
plying a Cholesky decomposition to what is 
known as the co- exceedance matrix of the 
residuals from the structural QVAR model, 
with the EBP being ordered fi  rst.6 The results  
are robust to other identifi  cation assump-
tions.

(2021) and Schüler (2020).

4 The EBP measures the average credit risk premium in 
the US corporate bond market. Its advantage is that it 
represents a comparatively exogenous residual vari-
able, making it particularly suitable for identifying ex-
ogenous fi  nancial shocks. See Gilchrist and Zakrajšek 
(2012).

The model estimates suggest that downside 
risks to the global real economy increase 
signifi  cantly if there is an unexpected deteri-
oration in global fi  nancing conditions. It is 
already evident at the median of the prob-
ability distribution of GDP growth that an 
unexpected increase in the EBP by one 
standard deviation is accompanied by a de-
cline in GDP growth of around 0.2 percent-
age point relative to the baseline (see the 
chart on p. 76). Four quarters later, the me-
dian of the growth distribution returns to its 
baseline value. If the model implied only a 
shift in the distribution of GDP growth fol-
lowing a shock, the effects at the median 
(50th percentile) and in the bottom 10th 
percentile (and also in the top 90th per-
centile) would be identical. However, the 
impact of the simulated shock at the lower 
end of the GDP distribution is signifi  cantly 
stronger than it is at the median, with GDP 
growth at the 10th percentile dropping by 
around 0.7  percentage point below the 
baseline one quarter after the shock. By 
contrast, a fi  nancial shock has a consider-
ably smaller impact on GDP growth at the 
median. Overall, the distribution of GDP 
growth conditional on the fi  nancial shock is 
therefore skewed to the left, compared 
with the unconditional distribution, and the 
downward risks increase. The effects at the 
lower end of the distribution are stronger 
for countries with comparatively high bank-
ing system exposures in foreign currency, 
and for countries with heightened levels of 
household sector debt and with fi  xed ex-
change rate regimes (see the adjacent 
table).Impact of various country

finan cial shocks to the distribution of economic 
growth. For example, the probability of severe 
downturns in the real economy is greater, in 
particular, in countries with higher levels of 
household debt as well as those with banking 
systems that have higher foreign currency ex -
posures. These outcomes confirm the theoret -
ical mechanisms that financial vulnerabilities 
create the preconditions that allow negative 
shocks to trigger extreme events through feed -
back effects.
Macroprudential policy and 
growth- at- risk
The theoretical and empirical evidence for the 
relationship between financial imbalances and 
growth- at- risk suggests that macroprudential 
policy measures to limit the build- up of vulner -
abilities may reduce downside risks to the real 
economy.
Empirical studies show that macroprudential 
policy can have an impact on debt dynamics 
and lending growth in the private sector as 
well as property price dynamics.35 Effective 
macroprudential policy can, for example, coun -
teract excessive debt in the private sector. The 
findings from the multi-  country model in the 
previous section, too, suggest that macropru -
dential policy can reduce downside risks to the 
real economy. This can be achieved by limiting 
the build- up of excessive debt and lowering the 
extent of risk- taking. This reduces the vulner -
ability of the economy to unexpected shocks to 
financing conditions, as it weakens the feed -
back effects arising from financial frictions. In 
addition, it may be possible to mitigate reinfor -
cing effects throughout the financial system by 
loosening macroprudential instruments during 
periods of acute stress, for example by lower -
ing countercyclical capital requirements in 
order to prevent financial frictions from becom -
ing binding and the banking system as a whole 
from excessively restricting lending.In the academic literature, there are studies 
that more directly estimate the relationship be -
tween macroprudential policy and growth- at- 
risk.36 While these studies differ in terms of the 
utilised datasets, investigated groups of coun -
tries, and analysed macroprudential instru -
ments, they all reach the same main conclu -
sion: tightening macroprudential instruments 
leads, with a time lag of around two to three 
years, to a significant reduction in future down -
side risks (growth- at- risk). At the same time, 
although   the associated effects on both the 
median and the upper quantiles of GDP growth 
are negative, they are smaller, or even statistic -
ally insignificant, in absolute terms. While this 
suggests that there is a certain degree of 
macroprudential trade- off, theoretical models 
show that the use of macroprudential instru -
ments in the presence of financial frictions may 
increase welfare. Furthermore, the estimation 
results point towards the effectiveness of 
macroprudential interventions being depend -
ent on cyclical factors. For example, if macro -
prudential instruments are tightened during a 
boom in the financial cycle, this leads to a 
greater reduction in future downside risks.
Even if the analyses from the literature on 
growth- at- risk and the impact of macropruden -
tial policy do produce valuable findings, there 
are some limitations that must be taken into 
consideration during the practical application 
of the individual approaches and their results. 
For example, the quantitative relationships be -Response of

research
35 A comprehensive overview of the literature is provided, 
for example, by Galati and Moessner (2018) and Aikman et 
al. (2018). Araujo et al. (2020) conduct a meta- analysis of 
58 of the most significant research articles on the effects of 
macroprudential policy measures. The majority of the re -
sults indicate that instruments that lead to a tightening of 
lending standards (such as upper limits on loan- to- value or 
debt- service- to- income ratios) have a greater dampening 
effect on credit and property price dynamics than capital 
and liquidity requirements on banks, for example.
36 See Brandao- Marques et al. (2020), Duprey and Ueber -
feldt (2020), Franta and Gambacorta (2020), Aikman et al. 
(2021), Galán (forthcoming) and International Monetary 
Fund (2021). In an ongoing project, the ESRB expert group 
“Macroprudential Stance – Phase III” is investigating the 
impact of macroprudential measures on growth- at- risk in 
the EU as well as the possibilities for formulating metrics on 
macroprudential stance based on empirical analyses. For 
more information, see also Suarez (2021).Deutsche Bundesbank

tween macroprudential measures and growth- 
at- risk found in these analyses are largely not 
causal in nature, but are instead primarily re -
flections of statistical correlations.37 As the rela -
tionships between policy measures and future 
downside risks are estimated in reduced form, 
it is difficult to reach any conclusions on the 
relevance of individual transmission channels. 
The macroprudential policy indicators used are 
–  due to limited data availability, short time 
periods and differences in the individual instru -
ments – likewise incomplete. For example, the 
utilised indicators mostly only measure the fre -
quency of macroprudential interventions, not 
their magnitudes. Ultimately, the fact that the 
results are largely based on data from Euro -
pean, non- European and emerging market 
economies may limit their applicability to Ger -
many.
Outlook
Since the developments before and during the 
global financial crisis and the European sover -
eign debt crisis at the latest, the issue of the re -
lationship between financial imbalances and 
real economic downturns has taken greater 
prominence in economic research and eco -
nomic policy debate. At many central banks 
and international institutions, the concept of 
growth- at- risk is applied to investigate whether 
financial vulnerabilities and short- term stress in 
the financial system can provide information on the probability of particularly sharp downturns 
in economic growth.
Within the scope of the econometric applica -
tion of the growth- at- risk concept for Ger -
many, it can be seen that an abrupt deterior -
ation in financing conditions is linked to down -
side risks to the real economy. More detailed 
analyses show that there is a causal relation -
ship between unexpected deteriorations in fi -
nancing conditions and the probability of deep 
recessions. Initial findings on the impact of 
macroprudential policy suggest that instru -
ments that mitigate the build- up of vulnerabil -
ities – such as excessive debt and increased risk 
appetite – may reduce downside risks to the 
real economy. However, the empirical evidence 
also shows that it is difficult to make real- time 
estimates of growth- at- risk with a longer lead 
time. For this reason, policy recommendations 
derived from the growth- at- risk concept should 
always be incorporated into an overall picture 
of the state of the financial system as a whole 
so that macroprudential policy can respond to 
a build- up of vulnerabilities in good time. This 
would limit the risk of shocks being excessively 
amplified by the financial system.Growth- at- risk

Discrepancies may arise from rounding.  * The banking system's liquidity position is
defined as the current account holdings in euro of euro area credit institutions with the
Eurosystem. Amounts are derived from the consolidated financial statement of the
Eurosystem and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  1 Figures are daily averages
for the reserve maintenance period ending in the month indicated. Following the
changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the
Eurosystem's asset purchase programmes.  4 From August 2009 includes liquidity
absorbed as a result of the Eurosystem's foreign exchange swap operations.  5 From
2002 euro banknotes and other banknotes which have been issued by the national cen-
tral banks of the Eurosystem and which are still in circulation. In accordance with the
accounting procedure chosen by the Eurosystem for the issue of euro banknotes, a
share of 8% of the total value of the euro banknotes in circulation is

allocated to the ECB on a monthly basis. The counterpart of this adjustment is shown
under “Other factors”. The remaining 92% of the value of the euro banknotes in
circulation is allocated, likewise on a monthly basis, to the NCBs, with each NCB
showing in its balance sheet the share of the euro banknotes issued corresponding to
its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-
system and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  7 Equal to the difference bet-
ween the sum of liquidity-pro viding factors and the sum of liquidity-absorbing factors.
8 Calculated as the sum of the “Deposit facility”, “Banknotes in circulation” and “Credit
institutions' current account balances”.

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

Sources: The calculations for the insurance sectors are based on supervisory data
according to Solvency I and II and for pension funds on IORP supervisory data and own
data collections as of 2020 Q1. Until 2019 Q4 these are compiled using Solvency I
supervisory data, supplemented by voluntary reports and own calculations.  1 Including
deposits retained on ceded business as well as registered bonds, borrowers' note loans
and registered Pfandbriefe.  2 Including claims of pension funds on pension managers
and entitlements to non-pension benefits.  3 Technical reserves "life" taking account oftransitional measures. Health insurance is also included in the "non-life insurance"
sector.  4 Own funds correspond to the sum of "Net worth" and "Shares and other
equity".  5 Not including the reinsurance business conducted by primary insurers, which
is included there.  6 Valuation at book values. The term "pension funds" refers to the
institutional sector "pension funds" of the European System of Accounts. Pension funds
thus comprise company pension schemes and occupational pension schemes for the
self-employed. Social security funds are not included.  7 Change in data sources.

* Non-financial groups admitted to the Prime Standard segment of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange which publish IFRS consolidated financial statements on a quarterly or
half-yearly basis and make a noteworthy contribution to value added in Germany. Ex-
cluding groups engaged in real estate activities.  1 Earnings before interest, taxes, de-
preciation and amortisation.  2 Quantile data are based on the groups' unweighted re-
turn on sales.  3 Annual figures do not always match the sum of the two half-year fig-ures. See Quality report on consolidated financial statement statistics, p. 3.  4 Adjusted
for substantial changes in the basis of consolidation of large groups and in the
reporting sample. See the explanatory notes in Statistical Series Seasonally adjusted
business statistics.  5 Including groups in agriculture and forestry.  6 From this point on-
wards: significant changes in IFRS standards, impairing comparability with previous pe-
riods.

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the
currency concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's
price competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective
exchange rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitive-
ness. The weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more
detailed information on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the
Deutsche Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1  The
calculations are based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral
exchange rates of the euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following countries: Australia,
Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan,
Norway, Poland, Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United
Kingdom and the United States. Where current price and wage indices were not avai-lable, estimates were used.  2 ECB calculations. Includes countries belonging to the
