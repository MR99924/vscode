Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The German economy continued to recover in 
the third quarter of 2021. Economic activity is 
likely to have risen slightly more sharply than in 
the second quarter. This was because services 
picked up substantially, benefiting from the fact 
that most coronavirus mitigation measures had 
lapsed. Revenue in the hotel and restaurant 
sector, for example, and the results of surveys 
by the ifo Institute on how service providers as -
sess the current situation are signalling a con -
siderably higher level of activity than in the 
second quarter. Demand remained strong in 
the manufacturing sector despite the latest set -
back, but ongoing bottlenecks in the supply of 
raw materials and intermediate goods damp -
ened industrial output. This prevented an even 
stronger increase in gross domestic product 
(GDP). In the current quarter, growth in aggre -
gate economic activity will probably be signifi -
cantly weaker. The robust momentum in the 
services sector is likely to subside considerably. 
A certain level of pandemic- related precaution -
ary measures will probably remain in place for 
the time being. The manufacturing sector is 
likely to continue to suffer under supply short -
ages. A significantly slower pace is also indi -
cated by enterprises’ business expectations, 
which became cloudier in the summer months 
according to surveys by the ifo Institute. Eco -
nomic output will therefore probably continue 
to fall short of its pre- crisis level (from the 
fourth quarter of 2019) in the final quarter. For 
2021 as a whole, GDP growth is likely to be 
much lower than predicted in the Bundes -
bank’s June projection.
Industry
Seasonally adjusted1 German industrial output 
receded sharply in August 2021 compared with the previous month (-4¾%). On an average of 
July and August, in which holiday effects 
broadly balance each other out, it was also dis -
tinctly below the second- quarter level (-1½%). 
Broken down by sector, only the production of 
consumer goods was up on the quarter by a 
significant amount. Production of capital goods 
was down considerably, by contrast. This was 
mainly attributable to a steep drop in the 
manufacture of motor vehicles. Only machinery 
and equipment manufacturers managed to 
keep their production levels more or less stable. 
The manufacture of intermediate goods like -
wise saw a significant decline. Industrial pro -
duction continues to be impaired by consider -
able bottlenecks in the supply of intermediate 
goods. According to surveys by the ifo Insti -
tute, shortages of materials intensified again in 
the summer months.2 This is having a particu -
larly strong impact on the automotive industry, 
which is mainly experiencing a shortage of 
semiconductors. According to data from the 
German Association of the Automotive Indus -
try (VDA), far fewer passenger cars were manu -
factured in September than the average for July 
and August. In the third quarter as a whole, 
the number of motor vehicles produced 
dropped by one- fifth on the already notably 
depressed level of the preceding quarter.
Industrial new orders in August 2021 saw a 
steep drop on the month after seasonal adjust -
ment (-7¾%). On an average of July and Au -
gust, they significantly exceeded the high 
second- quarter level (+2¾%), but were down 
after excluding large orders (-2¼%). Broken 
down by region, domestic demand rose mark -
edly overall and demand from non- euro area 
countries picked up strongly. By contrast, the 
inflow of orders from the euro area remained 
unchanged. Comparing sectors, orders of cap -Increase in Ger -

ital goods saw a steep increase, driven mainly 
by other transport equipment. Manufacturers 
of machinery and equipment also received con -
siderably more orders. Orders for motor ve -
hicles dropped sharply, however. Demand for 
consumer goods also grew substantially, par -
ticularly in the case of manufacturers of 
pharmaceutical products. Orders of intermedi -
ate goods fell significantly, by contrast. Total 
order intake in industry stayed well above its 
pre- crisis level from the fourth quarter of 2019 
(+15¼%). The gap between demand for Ger -
man industrial products and industrial output 
that has been created by delivery bottlenecks 
thus remained exceptionally large. Industrial 
output averaged across July and August was 
5½% lower than its pre- crisis level.
In August 2021, nominal industrial sales saw a 
strong month- on- month drop in seasonally ad -
justed terms (-5%). However, comparing the 
average of July and August with the second 
quarter, they remained stable. A significant 
drop in sales to non- euro area countries con -
trasted with marked increases in Germany and 
in the euro area. Broken down by sector, sales 
of capital goods decreased considerably, par -
ticularly on account of motor vehicles and 
other transport equipment. By contrast, manu -
facturers of machinery and equipment and of 
computer, electronic and optical products 
ramped up their sales markedly. Sales of inter -
mediate goods picked up distinctly and sales of 
consumer goods, especially pharmaceutical 
products, even registered a steep rise. In Au -
gust 2021, nominal goods exports were down 
distinctly on the month after seasonal adjust -
ment (-1¼%). Looking at July and August in ag -
gregate, they were slightly up on the quarter 
(+1%), but in real terms they fell distinctly short 
of the second-  quarter level (-1½%), owing, in 
particular, to a significant decrease in exports 
to non- euro area countries. Nominal imports of 
goods saw a large month- on- month increase in 
August (+3½%). Averaged across July and Au -
gust, they fell slightly short of the previous 
quarter’s average (-¼%) despite prices being 
considerably higher. In price- adjusted terms, Industrial sales 
and nominal 
goods exports

imports of goods were substantially lower 
(-5%). This is probably an effect of delivery dif -
ficulties, as with the weak level of real exports.
Construction
In August 2021, output in the construction sec -
tor fell steeply on the month after seasonal ad -
justment (-3%), after having increased strongly 
in July. Average output for July and August was 
slightly lower than the second- quarter level 
(-½%). It decreased significantly in the main 
construction sector, while increasing markedly 
in the finishing trades. In July – the most recent 
month for which data are available – order in -
take in the main construction sector declined 
slightly compared with the second quarter. 
Output in the main construction sector was 
dampened by labour shortages in the summer 
months, according to surveys by the ifo Insi -
tute. Many enterprises also complained of ma -
terials shortages, although the proportion of 
them has fallen somewhat since the highest 
point in June. Nonetheless, enterprises as -
sessed their business conditions more positively 
in September, and utilisation of machinery and 
equipment remained well above the long- term 
average. Moreover, the reach of the order 
books maintained the already high level of the 
previous month.
Labour market
The robust recovery is continuing on the labour 
market. Employment rose by 66,000 persons in 
August 2021 after seasonal adjustment. The 
number of persons working in exclusively low- 
paid part- time jobs went up considerably in 
July, as was already the case in June. This form 
of employment thus experienced its first recov -
ery since the dramatic decline during the pan -
demic. This is primarily connected with the re -
opening of high- contact services. By contrast, 
employment subject to social security contribu -
tions was already back above its pre- crisis level, 
but its growth in July was relatively moderate. New staff were recruited mainly in hotel and 
restaurant services and in the wholesale and re -
tail trade. Short- time work was scaled back 
enormously in June and July. While over 2.3 
million people were still in cyclical short- time 
work in May, the Federal Employment Agency 
puts the figure at just over 0.9 million in July. 
However, short- time work is likely to decline at 
a considerably slower pace now. Delivery 
bottlenecks in manufacturing, in particular, are 
throttling production and even leading to re -
newed short- time work arrangements in some 
cases. However, a rapidly rising number of 
firms in the services sector, in construction and 
in parts of the manufacturing sector are report -
ing labour shortages as the recovery pro -
gresses. The willingness of enterprises to recruit 
new staff and the number of vacancies both 
grew further in September. The labour market 
is likely to continue recovering over the next 
few months, and labour shortages are likely to 
increase.
Registered unemployment was down signifi -
cantly by 30,000 persons in September after 
adjustment for seasonal variations. However, 
this decrease was not as steep as it had been in 
the previous three months. Rounding meant 
that the unemployment rate remained at 5.5%. 
Total underemployment fell somewhat more 
strongly, because unlike in previous years, there 
has been no distinct expansion in labour mar -
ket policy measures again at the end of the 
summer holidays. The unemployment barom -
eter of the Institute for Employment Research 
(IAB) fell markedly from its recent high, but re -
mained in positive territory. Unemployment is 
therefore likely to decline more slowly over the 
coming months than it has of late.
Prices
Crude oil prices recently saw a marked rise. 
Against the backdrop of temporary production 
shortfalls, some caused by weather conditions, 
prices picked up by just over 6% on the month 
in September 2021. They were thus up by 80% Steep decline

on the year. In the first three weeks of October, 
the upward trajectory continued. One signifi -
cant factor behind this was the decision of 
OPEC and its partners not to increase produc -
tion more than previously planned. In addition, 
there was greater demand for oil as a substi -
tute for natural gas, which has recently be -
come much more expensive. As this report 
went to press, the price of a barrel of Brent 
crude oil stood at US$84. Crude oil futures 
were trading at significant discounts. The dis -
count on crude oil futures was US$4 for deliv -
eries six months ahead and US$8 for deliveries 
12 months ahead.
Import prices continued to rise fairly steeply in 
August. This was true of both energy and other 
goods. There was also sustained upward pres -
sure overall on industrial producer prices, for 
which data are already available for September. 
Excluding energy, however, prices declined. Im -
port prices and industrial producer prices re -
cently outstripped their prior- year levels, by 
16½% and roughly 14%, respectively. Exclud -
ing energy, the rate of increase was around 
10% and 8½%, respectively.
Consumer prices as measured by the Harmon -
ised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) saw an -
other moderate increase of 0.2% in September. 
Food prices were more or less unchanged. 
Prices for services likewise went up only mar -
ginally overall, mainly because unusually steep 
price drops for transport services had a damp -
ening effect. Prices of energy and other indus -
trial goods similarly rose only moderately. In the 
case of the latter, however, this was owing to 
clothing and footwear, the prices of which nor -
mally fluctuate sharply. By contrast, the prices 
of other industrial goods continued to climb 
substantially. Energy prices picked up, chiefly 
because crude oil prices were higher again. By 
contrast, the continued substantial rise in spot 
market prices for natural gas probably will not 
filter through to consumer prices until the start 
of next year. In this case, longer- term contracts 
make for delayed pass- through. Annual head -
line HICP inflation climbed from 3.4% in Au -gust to 4.1% in September and, excluding en -
ergy and food, from 2.1% to 2.5%. Here, the 
price- driving base effect from the temporary 
VAT cut in the second half of 20203 became in -
creasingly evident, as the distinctly dampening 
statistical effect in the preceding two months 
tailed off. This effect is due to the coronavirus 
pandemic having led to fairly major adjust -
ments to some HICP weights for 2021 in line 
with consumption habits of the previous year.4 
As a result, the gap between the HICP and the 
national consumer price index, for which the 
weights are not updated annually, was closed.5 
In the current month, the statistical effect will 
likewise only dampen the rate slightly. In No -
vember, it will then push the rate up some -
what, before being eliminated entirely in De -
cember. Overall, the inflation rate is likely to 
rise further at first, before gradually declining in 
the coming year.
Public finances6
Local government finances
Local government core budgets and off- budget 
entities recorded a surplus of €3 billion in the 
second quarter of 2021, compared with the 
balanced quarterly result posted a year earlier. 
Revenue rose on the year by a very substantial 
7½% (€5 billion), with tax revenue seeing a 
steep increase of 16½% (€4 billion). This was 
primarily attributable to the rise in receipts from 
local business tax (a large revenue item), which 
climbed by 61% (€4 billion) after deduction of 
the shares accruing to other government levels. 
By contrast, income tax shares fell slightly.

6 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain an in- depth description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter.

rule; the first quarter of this year was more 
strongly affected by the coronavirus crisis than 
the same quarter last year. Receipts from fees 
experienced strong growth (+13%, or €1 bil -
lion). A key factor here was that many facilities 
experienced closures last year and monthly 
contributions for childcare, for example, were 
waived. Transfers from state government, a 
large revenue item, fell slightly (-1%, or -€½ bil -
lion). One- off effects in the previous year were 
key here, too: in 2020, the federal states had 
partially brought forward their general purpose 
grants into the second quarter. The higher cen -
tral government contribution to the accommo -
dation costs of unemployment benefit II recipi -
ents resulted in additional revenue. This contri -
bution was permanently increased by one- half 
in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.
Expenditure climbed by 3% (€2 billion). Spend -
ing on personnel, a large expenditure item, 
saw dynamic growth of 4½%, partly as a result 
of a wage agreement (+1.4% as of April). 
Spending on social benefits also rose signifi -
cantly (+6%), particularly the costs of integra -
tion assistance for persons with disabilities. 
Other operating expenditure grew even more 
strongly, by 8%. Fixed asset formation, by con -
trast, declined (-4%) – as in the first quarter.
The local government deficit stood at €5½ bil -
lion in the first half of the year. This was €4 bil -
lion lower than a year prior. Compared with the 
crisis year 2020, taxes and fees are also likely to 
experience significant growth overall in the 
second half of 2021. That said, in comparison 
with last year, central and state governments 
are withdrawing a considerable amount of 
their support. Particularly significant here are 
the payments of €11 billion that central and 
state governments made in the fourth quarter 
of 2020 to compensate for expected local busi -
ness tax shortfalls. Furthermore, central gov -
ernment did not pay out its increased contribu -
tion to accommodation costs for the whole 
year until the final quarter of 2020. Overall ex -
penditure is also likely to see continued robust 
growth. All in all, a considerable deficit can be expected for the year as a whole (2020: surplus 
of €2 billion).
Next year, the local government budget deficit 
is likely to decline: tax revenue should continue 
to recover, and expenditure growth will prob -
ably remain limited. At present, the extent to 
which the coronavirus crisis will weigh on local 
government tax revenue in the medium term 
cannot yet be reliably assessed. That said, this 
revenue has seen an unexpectedly strong re -
covery over the past few months, at least. State 
government tax receipts also play a role here 
because they are generally reflected in the 
equalisation amount paid to local government, 
and temporary stabilisation measures in the 
pandemic situation are coming to an end. Ul -
timately, the federal states are responsible for 
equipping their local governments with ad -
equate finances – to enable them to invest in 
key infrastructure, for instance.Rise in expend -

Securities markets
Bond market
At €138.8 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in August 2021 was down on 
July’s  figure (€146.8 billion). After deducting 
the significantly lower redemptions and taking 
account of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, net issuance of domestic 
debt securities came to €33.6 billion. The out -
standing volume of foreign debt securities in 
Germany fell by €4.9 billion in the reporting 
month, which meant that the outstanding vol -
ume of debt instruments in the German market 
rose by €28.7 billion overall.
In the month under review, the public sector is -
sued debt securities worth a net €25.4 billion 
(compared with €11.6 billion in July). On bal -
ance, central government was the sole issuer 
of new securities (€25.9 billion), chiefly in the form of ten- year Federal bonds (Bunds: €6.3 
billion), two- year Federal Treasury notes 
(Schätze : €4.8 billion) and five- year Federal 
notes (Bobls: €4.4 billion). The other Bund ma -
turity segments also continued to be serviced. 
State and local governments redeemed their 
own bonds worth €0.5 billion net.
Domestic credit institutions increased their cap -
ital market debt by €6.9 billion net in August, 
following net redemptions of €9.2 billion in 
July. On balance, growth was seen primarily in 
the outstanding volume of debt securities is -
sued by specialised credit institutions (€7.4 bil -
lion), which include, for example, public pro -
motional banks. Meanwhile, there were net re -
demptions of mortgage Pfandbriefe  (€1.1 bil -
lion).
In August, domestic enterprises issued bonds 
with a net value of €1.2 billion, compared with 
€3.7 billion one month earlier. Other financial 
intermediaries were the chief issuers on bal -
ance.
The Bundesbank was a major purchaser of 
bonds in August. It acquired debt securities to -
talling €17.3 billion net, predominantly under 
the Eurosystem’s asset purchase programmes. 
Foreign investors expanded their German bond 
portfolios to the tune of €15.3 billion. In net 
terms, domestic non- banks purchased debt 
securities for €1.4 billion, while domestic credit 
institutions offloaded €5.3 billion worth of 
bonds net.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed new shares worth €4.7 billion in the 
German equity market. The volume of foreign 
equities in the German market rose by €7.5 bil -
lion over the same period. On balance, domes -
tic non- banks were by far the main purchasers 
of shares (€12.2 billion). Domestic credit institu -
tions added €0.2 billion to their holdings, while High net issu -

foreign investors reduced their equity exposure 
in Germany by €0.3 billion on balance.
Mutual funds
German mutual funds recorded net inflows of 
€8.1 billion in August, compared with €11.8 bil -
lion in July. On balance, specialised funds re -
served for institutional investors were the chief 
beneficiaries (€4.4 billion). Among the various 
asset classes, new shares were placed on the 
market primarily by mixed securities funds (€2.3 
billion) and open- end real estate funds (€2.1 
billion). The outstanding volume of foreign mu -
tual fund shares distributed in Germany in -
creased by €8.6 billion during the month under 
review. On balance, domestic non- banks were 
virtually the only purchasers of mutual fund 
shares in August (€16.2 billion), acquiring more 
foreign than domestic securities. Domestic 
credit institutions expanded their fund port -
folios by €1.0 billion, while foreign investors 
sold German shares for €0.5 billion net.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €11.8 billion in August 2021, down €6.1 bil -
lion on the previous month’s level. While the 
surplus in invisible current transactions, which 
comprise services as well as primary and sec -
ondary income, saw a slight increase, the sur -
plus in the goods account declined much more 
sharply.
In August, the surplus in the goods account de -
creased by €6.5 billion on the month to €11.0 
billion, with exports of goods contracting more 
sharply than imports.
The surplus in invisible current transactions 
grew by €0.4 billion to €0.7 billion in August. 
This was primarily caused by increases in the 
balances of primary and secondary income.

lower dividend payments to non- residents from 
portfolio investment. In addition, the deficit in 
secondary income fell by €1.0 billion to €4.8 
billion, with lower general government ex -
penditure playing a role in particular. Although 
payments to the EU budget in connection with 
financing related to gross national income 
went up, there was a stronger countermove -
ment in expenditure on current transfers relat -
ing to international cooperation, which had 
risen significantly in July. By contrast, the deficit 
in the services account widened by €2.6 billion 
to €4.8 billion. Receipts in this account de -
clined, which was attributable in particular to 
other business services and charges for the use 
of intellectual property. Furthermore, the de -
creases and increases in the expenditure sub-  
items effectively balanced each other out. As is 
typical for this time of the year, travel expend -
iture grew considerably as the improved pan -
demic conditions increased the opportunities 
for travelling abroad again.
In August 2021, international financial markets 
proved to be largely robust despite unexpect -
edly high inflation rates, with share prices tend -
ing to rise and few changes in exchange rates. 
It was against this backdrop that Germany’s 
cross- border portfolio investment recorded net 
capital imports of €3.6 billion (after net capital 
exports of €33.0 billion in July). Foreign invest -
ors acquired German securities worth €14.5 bil -
lion, investing in money market paper (€10.7 
billion) and bonds (€4.5 billion). Their holdings 
of shares and mutual fund shares remained 
nearly unchanged on balance. Domestic invest -
ors added €10.9 billion worth of securities is -
sued by non- residents to their portfolios, pur -
chasing mutual fund shares (€8.6 billion), 
shares (€7.1 billion) and money market paper 
(€0.6 billion). At the same time, they disposed 
of foreign bonds (€5.5 billion).
In August, the balance of financial derivatives 
recorded net inflows (€5.7 billion).Direct investment recorded net capital exports 
of €3.5 billion in August (July: €9.7 billion). Do -
mestic enterprises increased their foreign direct 
investment by €6.1 billion. They boosted their 
equity capital in non- resident enterprises by 
€9.1 billion, of which just under two- thirds was 
through reinvested earnings. By contrast, re -
demptions predominated in intra-  group lend -
ing (€3.0 billion). Non- resident firms injected 
their affiliated enterprises in Germany with dir -
ect investment funds worth €2.6 billion. They 
raised their equity capital by €1.6 billion, and 
another €1.0 billion was added through add -
itional intra- group loans.
Other statistically recorded investment – which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments – registered net 
inflows amounting to €14.5 billion in August 
(following €47.5 billion in July). The Bundes -
bank recorded net capital imports of €30.4 bil -
lion. Although TARGET2 claims on the ECB rose 
by €12.3 billion, the Bundesbank’s liabilities 
also increased considerably at the same time. 
This is because the International Monetary 
Fund granted the Bundesbank new special 
drawing rights in August, which was reflected 
in a higher adjustment item on the liabilities 
side of the Bundesbank’s balance sheet. Fur -
thermore, there was a rise in the deposits of 
non- euro area residents. Monetary financial in -
stitutions (excluding the Bundesbank) also re -
corded net capital imports (€3.3 billion). Trans -
actions by enterprises and households (€15.7 
billion) and by general government (€3.5 bil -
lion) each led, on balance, to net capital out -
flows.
The Bundesbank’s reserve assets grew –  at 
transaction values – by €31.3 billion due to the 
International Monetary Fund’s allocation of 
new special drawing rights in August, as ex -
plained above.Inflows in port -

State government finances in 2020: deficit 
due to temporary effects of pandemic, 
escape clauses also used to build reserves
The coronavirus crisis left a major dent in government finances last year, hitting central govern -
ment in particular. State and local government budgets, too, went from a surplus (€22 billion 
combined) to a high deficit (€32 billion). This deficit stems from negative cyclical effects, tempor -
ary coronavirus response measures as well as financial transactions. Adjusted for these factors, 
state and local governments actually still managed to record a slight surplus.
In 2020, all federal states activated the escape clause in their debt brakes. However, they chose 
to use them in very different ways. Bremen and Saarland, for instance, both received large- scale 
budgetary recovery assistance and did not use their escape clause during budget implementa -
tion. Other federal states used it not just to finance current deficits but also to build up reserves – 
sizeable ones in some cases (in particular, Schleswig- Holstein, Berlin and Mecklenburg-  West Pom -
erania). In addition, scope for borrowing is still available in part.
Thanks to the vaccination campaign, the coronavirus crisis has been easing since the second 
quarter of 2021. Next year, crisis- related budgetary burdens are likely to more or less peter out. 
Hence, there no longer seems to be a plausible case for activating escape clauses in 2022.
Once these clauses cease to apply, the federal states will have to comply with their debt brakes 
again. There are major differences across the federal states as regards the action required. For 
some federal states, the fact that there will no longer be temporary burdens from the coronavirus 
crisis will likely be sufficient. Other federal states will probably have to make adjustments. The 
requirements depend, not least, on the state- specific debt brake rules – for instance on cyclical 
effects or repayment periods. In addition, the reserves available to ease the return to a balanced 
budget with no net borrowing also vary. However, using the escape clause to build reserves and 
thus create financial scope for purposes not related to the crisis would undermine the intention 
of the debt brake. This is true not just for state governments, but for central government, too.
The transparency problem when analysing state government finances has yet to be resolved. This 
applies, inter alia, to information on state- specific debt brakes. As a result, it is difficult to see just 
how much action will be required in some federal states once the emergency situation subsides. 
The extent to which provisions have been made –  possibly also on the basis of the escape 
clauses – is also unclear. In order for fiscal surveillance to be effective, as a minimum budget out -
turns as defined under the respective debt brake rules should be available in a timely manner. 
Moreover, the degree to which state government finances can be compared remains very 
restricted, as the government finance statistics data available for this purpose are of limited 
informative value. The essential task of securing suitable data would be conferred upon the Sta -
bility Council. Without comparable data, it is not possible for informative comparisons to be 
drawn between the federal states. Nor can the advantages of the federal system be fully exploited.Deutsche Bundesbank

Overview
The coronavirus crisis weighed on state and 
local government budgets in 2020. The high 
budget surpluses recorded in 2019 shifted to 
high deficits. This was chiefly driven by cyclic -
ally induced tax revenue shortfalls and, to a lesser extent, by temporary crisis aid. By con -
trast, the strain on state and local governments 
was eased by payments from central govern -
ment. Headway made in combating the pan -
demic means that a sweeping macroeconomic 
recovery can be expected. This should allow 
the high budget deficits to be reduced again 
relatively rapidly going forward.
This article presents the financial results for 
2020 – the box on pp. 17 ff. explains how the 
data were prepared and the data gaps. The art -
icle opens with an overview of the federal 
states as a whole before going on to describe 
selected aspects of specific federal states. It 
also contains an analysis of the various designs 
of the debt brake and how they were imple -
mented in 2020. The conclusion puts develop -
ments and available data into perspective.

In 2020, state government budgets, including 
their off- budget entities and local govern -
ments, recorded a high deficit of €32 billion 
(1% of gross domestic product (GDP)) after 
having posted a surplus of €22 billion in 2019 
(see the adjacent table, item 1, and the chart 
above it). The deficit in state government core 
budgets amounted to €42 billion (2019: surplus 
of €10 billion). Both in 2020 and in 2019, ex -
tensive funds were transferred from the core 
budgets to special funds, where revenue then 
exceeded outflows. As a result, off- budget en -
tities reported a surplus of €7½ billion on bal -Coronavirus cri -

Preparing state government data and data gaps
The Bundesbank routinely produces a more 
detailed report on state government fi  nances 
in the fourth quarter of the year. This presents 
the state government budget outturns, in-
cluding their off- budget entities and the 
local government level, for the previous 
year. Outturns are presented in aggregate 
and on a state- by- state basis. The data are 
based on the quarterly fi  gures from the 
government fi  nance statistics. They are not 
available for a given year in this degree of 
detail and including closing entries until the 
third quarter of the following year.
National accounts data are the data used 
for European fi  scal surveillance. However, 
these cover the federal states as a whole, 
not individually. This box explains how the 
government fi  nance statistics data are pre-
pared for evaluation. The aim of this pro-
cess is to bring the data closer into line with 
the national accounts and to make com-
parisons between the federal states more 
meaningful. Nevertheless, the data remain 
to some extent diffi   cult to interpret.
Off- budget entities and local 
government  level are included
– Off- budget entities belong to the gov-
ernment sector in the national accounts 
and are included to provide a full picture 
of the federal states’ fi  scal situation. A 
number of new off- budget entities were 
set up in connection with the corona-
virus pandemic. On the one hand, look-
ing at the core budgets on their own can 
cause the burden on state government 
fi  nances to be understated, as some of 
these off- budget entities take out their 
own loans. On the other hand, the bur-
den is temporarily overstated if loans are 
taken out in the core budget in order to 
prefi  nance coronavirus off- budget en-
tities. The latter was more of an issue in 
2020.– Municipalities are subdivisions of the 
federal states under constitutional law, 
with the latter sharing responsibility for 
the fi  nances of the former. In addition, 
the way in which tasks are distributed 
between the state government and local 
government levels varies from state to 
state. Budget outturns are more mean-
ingful and easier to compare when the 
local government level is factored in. In 
addition, this allows the non- city states 
to be compared more effectively with 
the city states, as the latter always in-
clude the local government level in their 
outturns. Nevertheless, since the city 
states are afforded signifi  cantly higher 
fi  nancing requirements under the new 
fi  nancial equalisation scheme as well, 
they can still only be compared with the 
non- city states to a limited extent.
Structural balance is determined
A structural balance is determined to give a 
better idea of a federal state’s underlying 
budgetary situation: fi  nancial transactions, 
the cyclical component and one- off effects 
are deducted from the fi  scal balance. In 
addition, state government fi  nancial equal-
isation is recorded on an accruals basis.
– Financial transactions reallocate fi  nancial 
assets, affecting the balance in the gov-
ernment fi  nance statistics (defi  cit or sur-
plus). For example, when a loan is 
granted, expenditure in the government 
fi  nance statistics increases (and the bal-
ance declines). However, the state’s 
claims against third parties rise by the 
same amount (which is ignored in the 
government fi  nance statistics balance). 
Overall, fi  nancial assets remain un-
changed in net terms. In the national ac-
counts, therefore, fi  nancial transactions 
have no effect on the balance. Like the 
Federal Government, the majority of fed-Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
October 2021

eral states do not count these towards 
the limits imposed by their debt brakes.
– State government fi  nancial equalisation 
is accounted for on an accruals basis.1 To 
this end, the distribution of VAT among 
the federal states as well as supplemen-
tary central government grants are ad-
justed to include lagged settlement pay-
ments.
– In a further step, the data are adjusted 
for cyclical effects. Most debt brakes 
allow for this in principle. In this report, 
cyclical effects are determined not in ac-
cordance with state- specifi  c rules but ra-
ther uniformly using the Bundesbank’s 
procedure (except in the case of individ-
ual annual results to approximate the re-
quirements of the debt brakes). This is 
done on the basis of the spring 2021 
macroeconomic forecast.2 The cyclical 
component calculated for Germany as a 
whole was distributed across the individ-
ual federal states based on their respect-
ive tax share, making the cyclically ad-
justed data better suited for comparisons 
between states and with prior- year fi  g-
ures.
– More pronounced and easily identifi  able 
one- off effects are factored out of the 
data. Accordingly, the structural balance 
was adjusted for the fact that central 
government made a one- off contribution 
compensating for shortfalls in local gov-
ernment business tax revenue. As a re-
sult, the federal states and their munici-
palities were afforded temporary relief in 
net terms. In the structural balance, tax 
revenue shortfalls at the local govern-
ment level are already cancelled out for 
the most part via the cyclical component. 
For the federal states as an aggregate, 
the cost of temporary coronavirus- related 
measures has also been factored out in 
this report.– However, it was not possible to properly 
distribute these cost- increasing one- off 
effects across the individual federal 
states, so they are not taken into ac-
count in the state- specifi  c fi  gures. This is 
indicated by the classifi  cation “partially 
adjusted”.
There remain shortcomings in the 
 dataset and areas for improvement
– The data are diffi   cult to interpret to some 
extent as the federal states record identi-
cal types of expenditure in different 
ways. One major example is coronavirus 
aid for businesses, provided by central 
government: most federal states classi-
fi  ed this as transfers to enterprises in line 
with classifi  cation in the government 
budgetary planning system. In North 
Rhine-Westphalia, by contrast, it was re-
corded as operating expenditure. Here, 
as in other cases, it would be helpful to 
have effectively binding requirements for 
assigning items to certain revenue and 
expenditure categories. This would also 
make it easier to meet European require-
ments for data provision.
– Sizeable payments are made between in-
dividual government units (including fed-
eral states and their off- budget entities). 
However, these are, in some cases, only 
collectively adjusted in the government 
fi  nance statistics – for example, based on 
total current revenue and expenditure. 
For the purposes of the analysis, it is es-
sential to cancel out these payments be-
tween government units on a disaggre-
gated basis as well, i.e. by type of rev-
enue and expenditure.3 In addition to 
transfers between government units, fee 
payments between these units also dis-
tort budget data. As a rule, the receiving

ance (2019: €7 billion).1 In 2020, it was primar -
ily the off-  budget entities for coronavirus-  
related purposes that posted surpluses; in 
2019, the focus had been on making provisions 
for investment, amongst other things. Local 
governments also reported a surplus again. At 
€2 billion, this was €4 billion lower than in 
2019. Local government finances were buoyed 
by extensive assistance from central govern -
ment and state governments.
However, given the situation in 2020 in particu -
lar, the unadjusted balances are not especially 
meaningful. They are heavily tilted by major 
cyclical effects and temporary coronavirus re -
sponse measures. To better grasp the structural 
situation, financial transactions as well as tem -
porary cyclical effects and one- off factors are 
deducted from the balance:
– In 2020, a deficit of €20 billion can be traced 
back to cyclical effects as a result of the eco -nomic downturn (see the tables on p. 16 and 
p. 23, item 5 in both cases).
– A further €8 billion can be attributed to 
financial transactions (see the tables on p. 16 
and p. 23, item 2 in both cases). These chiefly 
concern loans granted by the federal states 
and their municipalities.
– Temporary coronavirus response measures 
that can be reasonably well defined and 
quantified contributed €5 billion on balance 
to the deterioration in the result. Support for 
enterprises and households was factored in … but major 
impact stem -
ming from 
cyclical  effects, 
acquisition of 
financial assets 
and temporary 
measuresunit does not distinguish between fees 
from a government unit and from a third 
party. Accordingly, consolidated receipts 
from fees are too high overall – as is, on 
the other side of the balance sheet, 
spending on service purchases. This dis-
tortion becomes greater when services 
that are used by the core budget are out-
sourced to off- budget entities.
– In some cases, government tasks are 
performed by institutions outside the 
government sector. These frequently 
have their own sources of revenue. In 
this case, the revenue and expenditure 
reported in the government fi  nance stat-
istics understate the activities commis-
sioned by general government. If these 
institutions’ own revenue is insuffi   cient, 
supplementary government grants are 
usually paid. These then increase govern-
ment expenditure, but the structure of 
this spending differs from the structure seen when services are directly provided: 
instead of being recorded as own per-
sonnel and other operating expenditure, 
transfer payments are reported in the 
government fi  nance statistics. Timely 
data for core budgets and off- budget 
entities on revenue and expenditure cat-
egories broken down by area of activity 
could provide much- needed information 
in this context. This applies in particular 
to comparisons between the federal 
states, as they make varying use of out-
sourcing of this kind.4
4 These data are published by the Federal Statistical 
Offi   ce in its accounting fi  gures for the general govern-
ment budget. This is with a considerable lag, however: 
at present, data do not extend beyond 2013.
1 Items have been added to off- budget entities here in 
comparison with data in the government finance statistics. 
For instance, the transfer of €½ billion from the IMPULS 
special fund to the core budget in Schleswig- Holstein was 
included as an expenditure item. The figures for 2019 in -
clude an additional off- budget entity each for Brandenburg 
and Lower Saxony (they are not included in the govern -
ment finance statistics until 2020). This means that in both 
2019 and 2020, the off- budget entities’ surplus reported 
here is €½ billion lower than in the government finance 
statistics.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

as having a negative impact. This was offset 
by central government’s contribution of €6 
billion to compensate for expected lower 
revenue from local business tax. Deducting 
the lagged residual payments of consolida -
tion assistance for 2019 (cumulative total of 
almost €½ billion) also provided temporary 
relief.
Looking at the budgetary situation in these 
structural terms shows that conditions last year 
were heavily influenced by temporary factors. 
State and local governments reaped the bene -
fits of starting out on a solid fiscal footing over -
all following a high structural surplus in 2019. 
While the figures may have fallen considerably 
on the previous year (by €22 billion),2 it was still 
possible to post a small structural surplus (€½ 
billion).
The structural deterioration reported here is 
even likely to be overstated. The balance con -
tains additional coronavirus- related temporary effects that could only be roughly estimated 
and were therefore not deducted in the above 
calculations. Receipts from fees and revenue 
from business activity, in particular, lagged con -
siderably behind their estimated trend. In add -
ition, on the expenditure side, other operating 
expenditure appears to have increased signifi -
cantly even after factoring out coronavirus re -
sponse measures booked under this item. It is 
likely that additional coronavirus effects (such 
as procuring personal protective equipment) 
had a sizeable role to play here. Overall, these 
additional temporary effects stemming from 
the coronavirus pandemic could run up to €15 
billion (see the table on p. 16, memo item, item 
11). Therefore, as the coronavirus crisis comes 
to an end, a large part of the structural deteri -
oration reported here may be reduced again. 
Meanwhile, in tax revenue estimates to date, a 
somewhat lower path is expected in the me -
dium term – but this is also due, not least, to 
changes in legislation adopted in the mean -
time.
All in all, the state and local government 
budgetary position was not at all unfavourable 
last year if the temporary effects of the corona -
virus crisis are disregarded. The 2020 budget 
outturn for the federal states as a whole thus 
does not point to a need for structural consoli -
dation. However, looking at the individual fed -
eral states, with their varying financial situ -
ations and debt brake designs, it is a mixed pic -
ture.3

2 The positive cyclical influence for 2019 is now estimated 
to be €6 billion lower than expected in last year’s report on 
state government finances. This means that a larger part of

outlined above (see the overview on p. 18), it 
was not possible to assign the cost of tempor -
ary coronavirus response measures to the indi -
vidual federal states in structural terms. The 
structural balances reported for the individual 
federal states are thus termed “partially ad -
justed”. The structural situation is therefore 
more favourable. For the federal states as a 
whole, the partially adjusted structural deficit 
amounted to €120 per capita. In Bremen, this 
figure exceeded €430, even though this state 
– like Saarland – received extensive budgetary 
recovery assistance from central government 
(€590 per capita in Bremen). At the other end 
of the scale, Mecklenburg-  West Pomerania and 
Rhineland- Palatinate even managed to record 
rather high partially adjusted structural sur -
pluses of well over €100 per capita (for infor -
mation on figures for the individual federal 
states, see the table on pp. 22 f., item 7).
The net interest burden –  that is, the pre-  
existing burden on any (net) debt – is also de -
ducted from the partially adjusted structural 
primary balance (see the table on pp. 22 f., 
item 9). This primary balance was balanced for 
the federal states as a whole. Bavaria and Sax -
ony recorded the highest primary deficits calcu -
lated this way. These states have less legacy 
debt and have continued to take a looser 
stance than other federal states when drawing 
up their budgets. Bremen is at the other end of 
the spectrum with the highest surplus, fol -
lowed by Saarland. Without the extensive 
budgetary recovery assistance they received, 
however, these states would have come in 
somewhat below the correspondingly adjusted 
figure for the federal states as a whole. There 
was therefore no indication that these two 
states had made savings elsewhere in order to 
offset higher legacy debt.
On a per capita basis, the partially adjusted 
structural budgetary position was down on the 
previous year in all federal states (for the fed -
eral states as a whole, by almost €400; for 
more information on changes in the individual 
federal states’ figures, see the table on pp. 26 f., item 7). The largest deterioration – €970 – was 
recorded in Hamburg, where the structural sur -
plus was also still the highest in 2019. Saarland 
and Mecklenburg-  West Pomerania were at the 
other end of the scale, reporting drops of less 
than €100 per capita. The situation in Saarland 
was eased not least by the state receiving 
higher budgetary recovery assistance. In 2019, 
Saarland also recorded the most unfavourable 
structural balance.
The main factor driving the deterioration in the 
unadjusted balances was falling tax revenue. 
The extent to which this revenue developed 
varied widely across the federal states (see the 
table on pp. 26 f., item 19). It was in the federal 
states with high financial capacity that tax rev -
enue declined most noticeably. Hamburg 
posted the largest amount, a decline of €660 
per capita. Particularly sharp drops were also 
recorded in Hesse and Baden-  Württemberg. By 
contrast, federal states with lower financial 
capacity generally reported much smaller de -Partially

clines. Mecklenburg-  West Pomerania benefited 
from the new state government financial equal -
isation scheme – as did the other eastern Ger -
man federal states – and was even able to post 
slight growth in tax revenue.5 However, the 
variation in tax developments is likely to be 
notably overstated overall by the fact that the 
state government financial equalisation scheme 
only uses estimates of revenue from local gov -
ernment business tax, an item that is especially 
volatile.6
In structurally adjusted terms, the reform of the 
financial equalisation scheme resulted in struc -
tural tax revenue rising in all federal states with 
the exception of Hamburg. However, this was 
partly offset by the fact that a number of pay -
ments previously made by central government 
and that had not counted as tax revenue came 
to an end.7
Despite this, almost all federal states recorded 
growth in central government transfers – sig -
nificant growth in some cases (see the table on 
pp. 26 f., item 21). This was chiefly driven by 
central government funds for coronavirus re -
sponse measures that were channelled via state 
government budgets. In terms of transfers un -
related to the pandemic, Saarland and Bremen 
reaped the greatest benefits: the new budget -
ary recovery assistance (of €400 million per 
year for each state) significantly exceeds the ex -
piring consolidation assistance. In 2020, the 
final payment of consolidation assistance (one- 
third of the annual amount) was also made.
Debt and interest burdens
Debt was up in all federal states, in most cases 
by a sizeable amount (see the table on pp. 26 f., 
item 23, and the chart on p.  25). Although 
Bremen did not take out any loans on the basis 
of the escape clause, its debt still rose by the 
largest amount by far, by well over €10,000 per 
capita. Bremen had already recorded the high -
est per capita debt level in 2019. As in the pre -
vious year, Bremen’s cash advances rose 
sharply. These were used to finance additional collateral that the state had to provide in con -
nection with large forward transactions in the 
previous year.8 While this additional collateral 
also expanded Bremen’s holdings of financial 
assets (claims from collateral provided), this 
was offset by the lower present value of the 
derivatives portfolio amid falling interest rates. 
It is not easy to estimate the precise impact of 
these derivatives transactions, including the im -
pact on interest payments. This makes it diffi -
cult to assess the debt structure and interest 
burdens. More transparency in this area would 
be extremely welcome – and that applies not 
just to Bremen, but to other federal states, too.New financial

Debt up in all

Bremen5 Mecklenburg-  West Pomerania and the other eastern Ger -
man federal states benefited particularly from the new sup -
plementary central government grants for municipalities 
with low financial capacity. Central government’s special-  
purpose grants for reconstruction in eastern Germany, 
which have now come to an end, were previously not 
counted as tax revenue in these calculations.
6 For instance, Hamburg’s capacity to raise local business 
tax revenue fell by almost twice as much as that of the fed -
eral states as a whole. The procedure used to date to set -
tle payments under the financial equalisation scheme as -
sumes uniform developments throughout Germany.
7 These include central government’s special- purpose 
grants for reconstruction in eastern Germany as well as an -
nual funds of around €2½ billion that central government 
had been paying since 2007 by way of compensation for 
phasing out joint tasks – such as university construction.
8 See Federal Statistical Office (2021). Collateral in connec -
tion with forward transactions can decouple debt develop -
ment from the budget deficit. With forward transactions, 
counterparty claims are generally to be secured by provid -
ing collateral. If a federal state provides or receives collat -
eral for this purpose, it is usually not reported as expend -
iture or revenue that would affect the budget (the balance 
does not change). However, in most cases, the state’s debt 
level does change as a result. (First, the collateral received 
pushes up the state’s cash balances. The counterparty usu -
ally has a claim for repayment in the amount of the collat -
eral that it provided – just as with a loan. This claim is 
therefore recorded in the relevant amount on the liabilities 
side as a cash advance. Second, collateral to be provided is 
often financed using cash advances. Cash advances in -
crease debt. This is offset by a claim on the collateral taker 
in the amount of the collateral provided.) As a rule, the vol -
ume of collateral gives a rough indication of the amount 
that the collateral provider would have to pay if the deriva -
tive were redeemed at this time. The volume of collateral 
rises or falls if, for instance, interest rate changes cause the 
market value of the derivative to shift. If, for example, a 
debtor’s long- term fixed interest rate is secured by a payer 
swap, the debtor has to provide more collateral if the inter -
est rate falls (the derivative becomes less favourable for the 
debtor). The market value of the liability portfolio therefore 
has a greater impact on the debt level reported in the stat -
istics than in cases where no derivatives are used. Loans 
and bonds in and of themselves are reported in the statis -
tics at face value.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

The debt levels in Mecklenburg-  West Pomerania 
and Berlin also rose sharply. Saxony-  Anhalt and 
Saarland recorded the lowest debt growth. The 
debt level is calculated as at 31 December, and 
the debt growth figure is for the calendar year. 
After year- end, loans can still be taken out for 
the budget outturn, for example. However, this 
does not increase the debt level retroactively; 
instead, this borrowing only becomes visible in 
the figures for the following year. In the latest 
figures, this applies to a large proportion of the 
high borrowing incurred by Schleswig- Holstein 
in order to top up its reserves.
Excluding Bremen, the range of per capita debt 
remained unchanged at €18,500. The figure 
for Bremen at the end of 2020 was five times 
higher than that of the federal states as a 
whole (see the table on pp.  22 f., item 23).9 
Hamburg, Saarland and Berlin were also far 
above average. Bavaria and Saxony were at the 
lower end of per capita debt, with their levels 
each amounting to only one- quarter of the fig -
ure for the federal states as a whole.
The calculated average rate of interest on debt 
continued to fall significantly on the year across 
Germany, declining by 0.3 percentage point to 
1.6% (see the tables on pp. 22 f. and pp. 26 f., 
item 24 in both cases). Generally speaking, the 
capital markets assume that the federal states’ 
creditworthiness is high and that, in extreme 
circumstances, they would probably receive as -
sistance from the German state as a whole. 
However, the calculated average rates of inter -
est that state governments pay on their debt 
vary. This is due chiefly to the debt structure. 
For instance, there are differences in interest 
rate fixation periods and the percentage of 
loans that were taken out during years when 
interest rates were higher. Derivatives transac -
tions or high premia on bond issues probably 
also contribute to the variance.10
As interest expenditure is partly offset by inter -
est income (which, in some cases, is received 
from other entities within a federal state), the 
netted total of interest expenditure and interest income more accurately reflects the interest 
burden. To obtain this figure, interest expend -
iture on debt is netted with interest income 
from financial assets (net interest). As interest 
rates remained low last year, interest burdens 
declined despite rising debt. Excluding the high 
interest burdens in the city states and in Saar -
land, the amount by which the federal states’ Closing entries 
after year- end 
do not appear

9 Factoring out cash advances for collateral purposes, 
Bremen’s debt was still almost three times the level for the 
federal states as a whole.
10 The booking of premia and discounts can also play a 
substantial role in annual comparisons of the calculated 
average rates of interest. Premia reduce and discounts in -
crease the underlying interest expenditure. For more infor -
mation, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2021b). The sharp de -
cline in the average rate of interest in Saxony reflects, in 
particular, its coronavirus response fund’s negative interest 
expenditure stemming from premia (amount payable in 
2020: -€34 million). This results in an average interest rate 
of 0.8%, which is not very meaningful. In addition, the 
interest expenditure largely flowed into two civil servant 
pension funds belonging to Saxony. In Bremen, the calcu -
lated average rate of interest fell particularly sharply be -
cause a large amount of collateral was financed through 
additional cash advances. Cash advances and posted col -
lateral are likely to be subject to similar, very low interest 
rates.Deutsche Bundesbank

The current transfers made by state and local 
governments to enterprises rose by €200 per 
capita for the federal states as a whole (see the 
table on pp. 26 f., item 15). This was due pri -
marily to central government- funded corona -
virus aid, which was channelled to enterprises 
via the state government budgets. This also in -
cludes payments to hospitals for empty beds 
due to the pandemic. Most of the federal states 
recorded a relatively strong increase in these 
transfers. By far the highest per capita transfers 
to enterprises were in Hamburg, followed by Berlin and Brandenburg. The lowest figures 
were reported by Rhineland- Palatinate and 
North Rhine-  Westphalia. However, these and 
other very low figures elsewhere were due to 
differences in how pass- through coronavirus 
aid was posted. For example, this category 
stagnated in Rhineland- Palatinate because it 
classified central government-  funded aid of 
€150 per capita as capital transfers not tied to 
investment and of just over €110 per capita as 
transfers to social facilities. In North Rhine-  
Westphalia, too, transfers to enterprises saw 
only a relatively small rise. There, the central 
government- funded coronavirus aid of €360 
per capita was recorded as operating expend -
iture. As a result, North Rhine-  Westphalia also 
posted the highest per capita operating ex -
penditure among the non- city states. These dif -
ferences in the booking of coronavirus aid are 
questionable given the uniform classification in 
the government budgetary planning system for 
Germany, and make the data less meaningful.
Social benefits are the prime component of 
transfers to households (see the table on 
pp. 22 f., item 14). They increased significantly 
for the federal states as a whole but also varied 
widely from one state to the next. The lowest 
per capita spending was in Baden-  Württemberg 
and Saarland, the highest in Bremen and North 
Rhine-  Westphalia. However, the data do not 
reflect the states’ net burden. Central govern -
ment partly compensates state and local gov -
ernments for a number of social benefits, e.g. 
accommodation costs for recipients of un -
employment benefit II. As part of the govern -
ment stimulus package in summer 2020, cen -
tral government permanently increased the 
share of accommodation costs it covers from 
49% to 74%. In the case of the basic allowance 
for the elderly and for persons with reduced 
earning capacity, central government even re -
imburses the transfers in full. The net burden of 
a state government thus also depends on the 
weight of these subsidised social benefits in re -
lation to its total social benefits.Transfers to

Revenue from fees fell across Germany by €50 
per capita (see the table on pp. 26 f., item 19). 
One important reason for this was that numer -
ous fee- charging public institutions were closed 
over the course of the year and monthly contri -
butions were waived.
State government financial equalisation 
scheme in 2020
Last year, the new financial equalisation scheme 
based on financial capacity replaced the state 
government financial equalisation scheme in 
the narrower sense.11 Here, central govern -
ment provided the state governments with a 
degree of compensation by raising its compen -
sation payments and ceding VAT funds to the 
federal states. However, the special supple -
mentary central government grants for the 
eastern German states and the transfers com -
pensating for joint tasks phased out in 2006 
were both discontinued.
The varying financial capacity of the federal 
states is evened out in the new scheme via sur -
charges and discounts in the distribution of 
VAT (and no longer via direct payments by the 
state governments among themselves).12 In 
2020, this horizontal equalisation of financial 
capacity had a volume of just under €15 billion. 
The range of financial capacity13 thus narrowed 
by almost two- thirds from 50  percentage 
points to around 20 percentage points. States 
still considered to have low financial capacity 
after this equalisation receive further supple -
mentary central government grants dependent 
on financial capacity. Last year, these came to a 
combined figure of €8 billion. This further re -
duced the range of financial capacity by almost 
one- half to 10 percentage points. To some ex -
tent, the federal states’ rankings in terms of 
financial capacity also changed, e.g. via the 
supplementary central government grants for 
municipalities with particularly low financial 
capacity.
Ultimately, however, the tax revenue generated 
in 2020 still varied significantly among the fed -eral states (range of €560 among the non- city 
states and €1,900 including the city states; see 
also the table on pp. 22 f., item 19). Given the 
rules, this is because, first, financial capacity is 
not fully equalised. Second, the fact that local 
government taxes are not fully included in the 
financial equalisation scheme also plays a role. 
Third, the financial equalisation scheme takes 
account of special requirements, especially for 
the city states. Fourth, the rates for some of the 
state and local government taxes vary.
Hesse was the state whose financial capacity 
most clearly exceeded the reference figure for 
the non- city states (by 5½%). However, this 
was partly due to its above average real estate 
acquisition tax and relatively high multipliers for 
local government taxes. After adjustment for 
these factors,14 Bavaria exceeded Hesse’s finan -
cial capacity by 2½ percentage points. In Bran -
denburg, actual tax revenue was 6% lower 
than the reference figure for the non- city states. 
This was attributable, not least, to the state’s 
relatively low multipliers for local government 
non- personal taxes. Adjusted for this factor, 
though, it was only 1% lower. Defined in this 
way, the range among the states spanned from 
97.7% in Bremen to 108% in Bavaria.15Declining rev -

12 To calculate financial capacity, three- quarters of the tax 
revenue at the local government level is factored in (previ -
ously 64%). Adjustment is made for differences in the 
multipliers for real estate and local business tax, as well as 
for varying real estate acquisition tax rates among the fed -
eral states. As previously, the city states benefit from the 
practice of upgrading their numbers of inhabitants. See 
Federal Ministry of Finance (2021b) for the state govern -
ment financial equalisation scheme data.
13 Financial capacity as defined in the financial equalisa -
tion scheme is measured as a financial capacity index in re -
lation to the respective equalisation benchmark. The latter 
gives the per capita tax- raising capacity, with higher popu -
lation weighting factored in primarily in the calculation of 
city states’ financial capacity.

Ministry of Finance (2021b).
15 Defined in this way, tax revenue and the financial cap -
acity index include all supplementary central government 
grants with the exception of the special supplementary 
central government grants for structural unemployment in 
eastern Germany and for smaller states. The figures ad -
justed for divergent tax rates are given in relation to the 
equalisation benchmark (required value). The general sup -

State government debt brakes 
in 2020
Design of state government debt brakes 
varies
With effect from 2020, the federal states are 
obliged to fully comply with the requirements 
set out in Germany’s Basic Law ( Grundgesetz ) 
regarding the debt brake. Prior to this, all 16 
federal states had transposed the requirements 
into state law. Twelve of them enshrined the 
debt brakes in their constitutions. Berlin, North 
Rhine-  Westphalia, Saarland and Thuringia de -
cided not to write the debt brake rules into 
their constitutions. Non- constitutional legisla -
tion is easier to amend than the constitution of 
a federal state.16
The debt brake enshrined in the Basic Law 
places very tight constraints on net borrowing 
in the core budgets and off- budget entities of 
the state governments (excluding local govern -
ments). However, loans can be permitted in 
order to acquire financial assets (financial trans -
actions) and to bridge cyclical budgetary bur -
dens. In addition, an escape clause provides 
leeway for emergency borrowing. If it is in -
voked, a repayment schedule for the emer -
gency loans with an appropriate timeframe has 
to be adopted at the same time.
The federal states each passed their own spe -
cific rules for their debt brakes (see the over -
view on pp. 40 ff.). They differ, in particular, in 
the area of cyclical adjustment, with the federal 
states taking various approaches. In some 
cases, like central government, they employ a 
macroeconomic potential output method. In 
others, the methods are based on the tax trend 
or the tax level of the previous few years.17 
Only Bavaria’s rules generally do not envisage 
any cyclical adjustment.
The states’ treatment of financial transactions 
also varies. Most of the states factor them out 
of their debt brake. This means that they are 
allowed to fund financial asset purchases through borrowing. Financial assets include, 
for example, profit- yielding capital contribu -
tions in public undertakings. In some cases, 
however, loss compensation payments, e.g. for 
transport companies, are booked as capital 
contributions. The latter is not in the spirit of 
the debt brake. Bavaria and North Rhine-  
Westphalia, along with most of the eastern 
German federal states, do not give financial 
transactions special treatment. On the one 
hand, this means that they cannot acquire 
financial assets through borrowing. On the 
other, they can plug budgetary gaps by selling 
financial assets: this revenue is then not fac -
tored out of the debt brake.
The federal states all take a fairly similar ap -
proach to emergencies; they all have an escape 
clause built into their debt brakes. These clauses 
are based fairly closely on the requirements set 
out in the Basic Law. However, there are differ -
ences in the parliamentary majorities required 
to invoke the clauses and in the repayment 
schedules for emergency loans. In some states, 
repayment is required within a few years, whilst 
in others it can be stretched over a very long 
period.
The debt brakes in 2020
In 2020, central government and all of the 
state governments activated their debt brake 
escape clauses. Nonetheless, how they used 
the clauses varied widely. This was due, in par -
ticular, to differences in the debt brakes, the 
states’ initial financial position, their fiscal re -
sponses to the pandemic and their formation 
of reserves for the years ahead. However, a 
comprehensive overview of this information 
does not yet exist. To plug this gap, at least in 
part, the federal states were asked to provide 
various budgetary data for this article.Implemented in

Below, the available information is put further 
into context. To achieve this, a notional refer -
ence scenario of sorts for the federal states as 
a whole is first presented. This scenario does 
not yet take account of any state- specific ar -
rangements but is instead based on a stylised, 
uniform debt brake for federal states as a 
whole.
The reference scenario is based uniformly on 
the deficit for the core budgets and off- budget 
entities of the federal states as a whole (€34 bil -
lion, including a surplus of €7½ billion for the 
off- budget entities). It makes sense to include 
all off-  budget entities with their deficits in the 
debt brake; this means that the debt brake ap -
plies to the entire finances of the respective 
unit and maintains the principle of budgets op -
erating on an annual basis.18 In actual fact, 
however, the state governments’ debt brakes 
do not uniformly include their off- budget en -
tities. Above all, prefinanced off- budget entities 
are often factored out.Under the debt brake, state government 
budgets must normally be balanced or in sur -
plus, although they are allowed to factor out 
financial transactions and cyclical effects. 
Therefore, in the notional scenario, the total 
net burdens from financial transactions re -
ported in the government finance statistics 
(€4 billion) and the negative cyclical influence 
calculated for the federal states as a whole 
under the Bundesbank procedure (€12 billion) 
are deducted from the deficit. This results in a 
notional structural deficit approximate to the 
debt brake in the reference scenario (€19 bil -
lion). Based on the reference scenario, this 
would also give the rough volume of emer -
gency borrowing expected to be taken up Notional refer -

18 It would go against the spirit of the debt brake to ex -
clude off- budget entities with their own borrowing author -
isations from the debt brake. The same would be true of 
using core budget emergency loans to form reserves in off- 
budget entities and then use these for purposes other than 
crisis management. The local governments are factored out 
of this analysis because they are subject to their own debt 
rules.Deutsche Bundesbank

The reserves held by individual federal states
Last year, borrowing by the federal states as 
a whole exceeded current fi  nancing re-
quirements resulting from defi  cits. It would 
appear that, rather than being depleted, re-
serves were topped up on balance. How-
ever, budget accounts for 2020 that provide 
more precise information on this topic are 
currently only available for a few federal 
states. For this report, the federal states 
were therefore also asked about their re-
serve stocks as at the end of 2020. Rather 
than focusing simply on new reserves that 
were built up in the course of the corona-
virus crisis, they were also asked about vari-
ous reserves that pre- existed the pandemic 
and were possibly used only in part during 
the emergency period in 2020. The over-
view does not provide a full picture as some 
reports are missing. The ideal scenario 
would be for all federal states to report on 
their reserves in a prompt, standardised and 
comprehensive manner. The task of calling 
for such reports and preparing overviews 
would be conferred upon the Stability Coun-
cil as the central fi  scal surveillance body.
The responses provided by the federal states 
paint the following picture:
– The fi  gure reported for general reserves 
or funds that can be mobilised from 
prior- year surpluses amounts to €16 bil-
lion. However, this fi  gure does not factor 
in data from the states of Bavaria and 
Baden- Württemberg, which traditionally 
hold ample reserves. Particularly large 
relative to population size is the reserve 
in Berlin, where it appears that, in 2020, 
the entire reported reserve amount of 
€5½ billion was newly set aside in that 
year and fi  nanced on credit.– Furthermore, credit- fi  nanced surpluses of 
€11 billion were reported for coronavirus 
special funds (principally in Mecklenburg- 
West Pomerania, Lower Saxony and 
North Rhine- Westphalia). These funds 
are intended for spending on further 
coronavirus crisis- related tasks (e.g. to 
compensate for tax revenue shortfalls).
– Prefi  nanced off- budget entities for in-
vestment purposes account for further 
reserves of almost €9 billion. However, 
there was no response from Branden-
burg, which had set up a €1 billion re-
serve of this kind in 2019.
– Provisioning for civil servant pensions is 
extensive (and not connected to the 
coronavirus crisis). Reserves are built up 
to cover burdens related to civil servant 
pensions, and they are very large, espe-
cially in the western German federal 
states. The total provisioning amount 
reached €45 billion, with major differ-
ences across federal states. It was topped 
up by €2½ billion last year.
According to budget documents, some fed-
eral states also increased other reserves (for 
example, Schleswig-Holstein alone did so to 
the tune of €5½ billion).Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
October 2021  
32

under the escape clause – provided that state 
governments do not draw on reserves from the 
pre- crisis period.
The volume of emergency loans was in fact sig -
nificantly higher than the structural deficit ap -
proximate to the debt brake of €19 billion cal -
culated using this method. In response to the 
Bundesbank’s queries or in budget documents, 
the federal states reported that they had taken 
out emergency loans of €49 billion (including 
the loans of coronavirus off- budget entities 
that have to be repaid). There are various pos -
sible reasons for this much higher figure.
Differences may result from cyclical adjust -
ment. However, this cannot explain the clear 
overshooting by the federal states as an aggre -
gate. Although the cyclical components re -
ported by the individual states for their debt 
brakes vary widely (in per capita terms), the ag -
gregate figure from state government reports, 
at €13 billion, was very close to the Bundes -
bank estimate for all state governments 
(€12 billion).
For financial transactions, the state- specific 
rules also differ from the reference scenario. It 
is almost impossible to replicate the details of 
the rules using the government finance statis -
tics data. If the financial transactions reported 
in the government finance statistics were ad -
justed only for those states that generally neu -
tralise financial transactions, it still would not 
be possible to explain why net emergency bor -
rowing is so far above the structural deficit ap -
proximate to the debt brake. All in all, this 
would result in burdens of €2 billion stemming 
from financial transactions being factored out. 
In the reference scenario, a figure of €4 billion 
was deducted.
Overall, then, differing rules on cyclical adjust -
ment and financial transactions do not explain 
why so many more emergency loans were 
taken out than roughly derived from the refer -
ence scenario. This development was driven 
mainly by the fact that federal states used emergency loans not only to finance their on -
going deficits but also to build up sizeable re -
serves. For instance, reserves in the core budget 
were topped up and off- budget entities that 
are not included in the debt brake were prefi -
nanced through borrowing.
In order to shed greater light on this on a state- 
by- state basis, similar comparisons are now 
made for the individual federal states. The 
emergency loans actually taken out are com -
pared with state- specific structural deficits ap -
proximate to the debt brake (see the table on 
p. 31, columns 4 and 5). As in the reference 
scenario above, the deficits in the core budgets 
and off- budget entities of the individual federal 
states form the basis of these calculations.19 In 
order to obtain the values approximate to the 
debt brake, however, the specific cyclical com -
ponents reported by the respective federal 
states are now deducted. Financial transactions 
according to the government finance statistics 
data of the Federal Statistical Office are cor -
rected to only a limited extent: for federal 
states that do not generally omit these transac -
tions, no adjustment takes place at all. Devi -
ations resulting from different approaches in 
these categories thus remain within a relatively 
narrow range.
In terms of cyclical components, the federal 
states recorded an average burden of €150 per 
capita.20 Looked at individually, however, the 
figures differ considerably:

a rather high positive cyclical effect of €300 Reported emer -

19 As described above, off- budget entities can be included 
to differing degrees in the actual debt brakes. Nevertheless, 
they have been taken into account here. On the one hand, 
there is not enough differentiated information available. 
On the other hand, however, the building of reserves in 
off- budget entities, in particular, can be better captured 
this way.
20 The reference value based on the Bundesbank’s estima -
tion method also produces a cyclical burden of €140 per 
capita. If, by contrast, the central government procedure 
(output gap estimate from the second quarter combined 
with the budgetary semi- elasticity of the states receiving 
consolidation assistance) were used as a basis, this would 
be €260 per capita.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
October 2021  
33

per capita. Here, the key factor was that, in 
line with Hamburg’s commercial double-  
entry bookkeeping, transactions with no ef -
fect on the cash balance were also included 
in the cyclical component. Hamburg re -
versed substantial provisions, which was re -
corded as cyclical relief under its proced -
ure.21
– Bavaria dispensed with cyclical adjustment, 
as it generally does. So did North Rhine-  
Westphalia, as an exception. The need for 
emergency loans was thus greater in both 
federal states.22
– The restrictive tax level methods applied by 
Saxony and Mecklenburg-  West Pomerania 
did not produce a creditworthy cyclical bur -
den, either.23
– Lower Saxony capped its cyclical burden at 
€180 per capita in line with its legal require -
ments.– Out of the all non- city states, Brandenburg 
recorded the highest burden, at €380 per 
capita.
– At €620 per capita, the figure was signifi -
cantly higher still in the city state of Berlin. 
The fact that Berlin’s population is weighted 
35% higher in the financial equalisation 
scheme and that cyclical effects at the local 
government level are included for city states 
also had an impact here.
The burdens from financial transactions taken 
into account differ less substantially across fed -
eral states than cyclical effects (see the table on 
p. 31, column 2).
On the whole, it can be seen that the actual 
emergency loans taken out by many states sig -
nificantly exceed their notional deficits approxi -
mate to the debt brake (see the adjacent chart 
and the table on p. 31, column 6). This is – as 
described above – an indication that reserves 
have been built from emergency loans. Con -
versely, if the deficit approximate to the debt 
brake exceeds emergency loans, this implies 
that deficits have been covered by reserves pre -
viously built up. Looking at this difference be -
tween federal states’ emergency borrowing 
and deficits approximate to the debt brake, 
too, the picture is very mixed:

21 Provisions in Hamburg had been set aside in previous 
years for estimated reimbursement claims for advance pay -
ments of profit- related taxes. However, advance payments 
decreased due to the coronavirus pandemic, which re -
duced the need for such provisions. Subsequently, it was 
possible to significantly scale back the reserves.
22 This means that cyclical surpluses do not have to be 
generated during later upswings, with the result that 
greater room for manoeuvre remains.
23 Thuringia’s tax level procedure had a less restrictive ef -
fect last year: the reference value is derived on the basis of 
fewer preceding years and excludes supplementary central 
government grants that are dependent on financial cap -
acity. The latter were increased considerably in 2020. Fur -
thermore, no minimum undershooting of the reference 
value is required in order to be able to take out cyclically in -
duced loans.Deutsche Bundesbank

the debt brake is in surplus. In Saarland, this 
surplus was considerably higher still. In line 
with this, neither federal state took out any 
emergency loans during budget implemen -
tation.
– Saxony-  Anhalt and Rhineland- Palatinate re -
ported only small emergency loans. In these 
states, too, the estimated cyclical burdens 
were above average. In Rhineland- Palatinate, 
the unadjusted deficit was also relatively 
small. In Saxony-  Anhalt, the difference cal -
culation does not suggest that reserves were 
built up with emergency loans. In the case 
of Rhineland- Palatinate, this ultimately af -
fected off- budget entities – albeit to a rela -
tively moderate degree.
– Bavaria and North Rhine-  Westphalia did not 
factor out cyclical burdens. This in itself ex -
plains the greater need for emergency loans. 
Bavaria’s uptake of emergency loans re -
mained more or less limited to covering 
these burdens, and therefore does not 
indicate  reserve- building. North Rhine-  
West phalia, by contrast, also partially prefi -
nanced its coronavirus off- budget entity; 
consistent with this, the difference calcula -
tion performed here indicates a limited add -
itional reserve.
– Saxony’s restrictive cyclical adjustment pro -
cedure resulted in an increased need for 
emergency loans, too. In order to mitigate 
this, the federal state appears to have de -
ployed the reserves it built up in previous 
years. In Hamburg, too, emergency loans 
were considerably smaller than the struc -
tural deficit approximate to the debt brake.
– The largest emergency loans were reported 
by Schleswig- Holstein, Mecklenburg-  West 
Pomerania (€1,770 per capita in both states) 
and Berlin (€1,375 per capita). Berlin could 
have financed its deficit, including that of its 
off- budget entities, without emergency 
loans. The structural balance approximate to 
the debt brake, at least, is positive (on ac -count of ex post cyclical burdens). It there -
fore appears, on balance, that the escape 
clause was used for provisioning purposes 
only.24 Not least due to its restrictive cyclical 
adjustment procedure, Mecklenburg-  West 
Pomerania recorded a structural deficit ap -
proximate to the debt brake. However, its 
emergency loans were significantly higher 
(by €1,480 per capita). In Schleswig- Holstein, 
this difference was greater still (by €1,710 
per capita), which points to particularly ex -
tensive reserve- building.
It is understandable and in no way controver -
sial that the federal states made recourse to 
their escape clauses last year. However, they 
appear to have used a substantial portion of 
their emergency loans to build up their re -
serves. This does not seem consistent with the Limit emergency

debt brake, at least to the extent that the fed -
eral states are ultimately using emergency loans 
to finance measures that do not serve to com -
bat the crisis. It would thus be logical for on -
going authorisations for emergency loans to be 
phased out once the crisis ends.
Wide range of repayment paths
The debt brake requires the federal states to 
draw up repayment schedules for the emer -
gency loans they take out. The funds to repay 
these loans are to be generated in due course 
within the regular limits imposed by the debt 
brakes. As, in many cases, it is expected that 
further additional emergency loans will be 
taken out, the total repayment obligation re -
mains unknown. The apparently substantial 
level of provisioning from escape clause bor -
rowing makes it even more difficult to estimate 
the ultimate burden.The repayment schedules presented to date 
differ significantly from one federal state to the 
next. For instance, the repayment periods 
range from currently one year in Saxony-  Anhalt 
to 50 years in North Rhine-  Westphalia (see the 
table on p.  31, column 7 and the adjacent 
chart). Both very short and very long repay -
ment periods are questionable. Given short re -
payment deadlines, the annual repayment bur -
dens could be high. However, these would not 
be too ambitious if the federal states were able 
to deploy their reserves to cover them. With 
very long repayment deadlines, it becomes in -
creasingly likely that the next crisis will occur 
before the debt is fully repaid. Debt could then 
keep on accumulating – which is what the debt 
brake is supposed to prevent.
Concluding remarks
Since last year, fiscal policy has chiefly focused 
on responding to the coronavirus crisis and its 
consequences. Central government assumed 
the lion’s share of the financial burden. How -
ever, the state governments did contribute to 
various tax relief measures and made their own 
transfers to enterprises, amongst other things. 
They also administered central government 
measures. Central government’s substantial 
business aid, inter alia, passed through state 
government budgets. In addition, state govern -
ments stabilised the budgets of their local gov -
ernments by working with central government 
to jointly compensate them for expected lower 
revenue from local business tax. Above and be -
yond this, they provided additional assistance, 
e.g. to compensate for local governments’ 
lower receipts from fees. Overall, state govern -
ments made a significant contribution to the 
stabilisation of the macroeconomic situation 
last year.
Both central government and state govern -
ments face the challenge of stabilising the 
economy during times of nationwide crisis.

government is the one that is initially on the Reliable estima -

front line. This ensures that the effect of meas -
ures carries beyond the individual federal states. 
There is much to be said for uniform solutions 
put forward by central government. Further -
more, central government is best placed to ob -
tain even high volumes of funding on the cap -
ital market at short notice, cheaply and without 
friction. It therefore seems logical for central 
government to pay for the majority of corona -
virus measures passed at the federal level, at 
least initially. Going forward, it should be as -
sessed whether various levels have sufficient 
financial resources or whether they have ex -
perienced imbalances. If the distribution of 
funds between the central government and 
state government levels then had to be ad -
justed, shares in VAT revenue would be the 
lever intended for this purpose in the Basic 
Law. To the extent that the existing financial 
framework is deemed insufficient, central gov -
ernment and state governments could adjust 
their joint taxes together. Alternatively, in spe -
cial circumstances, central government has the 
option of levying a nationwide surtax such as 
the solidarity surcharge. The federal states’ ap -
proval in the Bundesrat (the legislative body 
representing the federal states) is not required 
for this. Federal states’ autonomy over their 
taxes is restricted to real estate acquisition tax, 
which is a smaller revenue item. At the same 
time, the federal states are fundamentally re -
sponsible for their municipalities. During the 
crisis, central government helped the federal 
states to support their municipalities on an ad 
hoc basis. However, the coronavirus crisis has 
demonstrated once again that local govern -
ment financing is in need of reform.25 A funda -
mental overhaul appears necessary in order to 
make local government budgets more resilient.
The debt brake enshrined in the Basic Law 
makes it possible to service cyclical burdens 
with debt. In addition, use can be made of es -
cape clauses in times of crisis. All of the federal 
states made use of such clauses in their budget 
acts or off- budget entities last year, as did cen -
tral government. This meant they were also 
able to finance non- cyclical burdens resulting from the pandemic by taking on new debt – 
particularly their own discretionary support 
measures. On balance, the state governments, 
including their local governments, registered a 
high deficit of €32 billion for 2020. Adjusted 
for financial transactions, cyclical burdens and 
temporary crisis measures, however, they still 
recorded a small structural surplus on aggre -
gate. The underlying situation is probably more 
favourable still, in fact, as coronavirus effects 
are likely to have had an additional temporary 
burdening impact. These were not factored out 
here and will tail off in due course. State and 
local government budgets were therefore still 
prepared in such a way in 2020 that consider -
able surpluses would still have been recorded 
overall if temporary coronavirus burdens had 
been excluded.
However, the situation still differs vastly from 
one federal state to the next. There may also 
be structural budget gaps in places. In particu -
lar, the underlying fiscal stance is likely to have 
been loosened further this year already. It must 
equally be taken into account that the emer -
gency loans result in repayment obligations. In 
light of the fact that the outlook remains un -
certain, caution is advised, particularly with re -Fine- tune

gard to decisions that will put structural strain 
on budgets.
Another reason for which multiple federal 
states used their escape clauses in 2020 was to 
establish sizeable reserves. Generally speaking, 
this is not especially compatible with an annual 
borrowing limit. In any case, such reserves 
should only be used to cover crisis- related ex -
penditure rather than creating any other form 
of budgetary leeway. The debt brake would 
otherwise fail in its key task of shielding future 
budgets from the burdens of excessive borrow -
ing. This also applies to central government.
There is a general expectation that the crisis 
will subside next year and that the economy 
will return to at least roughly its normal level of 
capacity utilisation. The current Joint Economic 
Forecast, from which the Federal Government’s 
upcoming projection generally deviates only 
moderately, confirms this picture. It would 
therefore make sense to stop using escape 
clauses as early as next year. This is made eas -
ier by the fact that reserves had already been 
built up from budgetary surpluses prior to the 
crisis – within the regular debt brake limit and 
with no escape clause activated. In many cases, 
these will make it possible to stretch the neces -
sary budgetary adjustments over a certain 
period of time.
It is still very difficult to obtain an overview of 
the need for action in the individual federal 
states. Even a retrospective analysis for the year 
2020 is challenging, be it with respect to 
budget developments, structural budgetary 
positions, reserve stocks or repayment obliga -tions. The speed at which consolidation has to 
happen after the crisis depends on the specific 
design of each state’s debt brake – the respect -
ive level of cyclical adjustment, for instance. 
Appropriate overviews are required for effect -
ive fiscal surveillance. To this end, data on re -
spective state government budget outturns 
and budgetary planning as well as on the need 
for action would need to be more meaningful. 
Here, a special role would be conferred upon 
the Stability Council, as Germany’s central insti -
tution for fiscal surveillance: it would be im -
portant to ensure that a rigorous and informa -
tive set of data is made publicly available in 
good time.26
It appears that the federal states are not at -
tempting to make their fiscal policies compar -
able by means of standardised data reporting. 
However, the Basic Law explicitly grants the 
federal states a strong position within the fed -
eral system. They can set their own policy 
agenda, make decisions regarding its imple -
mentation and independently devise good so -
lutions working in tandem with their municipal -
ities. This applies, for example, to education 
policy, a shift towards green local public trans -
port or digitalisation. To also make use of the 
benefits offered by a decentralised approach 
and thus play to the advantages of the federal 
system, it is important that the budget outturns 
of and public services rendered by the individ -
ual federal states can be compared on the basis 
of a robust set of data.Do not under -

The global economy during the coronavirus 
pandemic
From the beginning of 2020 onwards, the coronavirus pandemic has been shaping economic 
developments around the world. These have taken the form of an unprecedented downturn in 
advanced and emerging market economies, a raft of measures to prevent the spread of infection, 
and extensive monetary and fiscal policy support. Only once effective vaccines had been intro -
duced did a sustained recovery begin to take hold in many places. However, delivery delays and 
shortages of key intermediate inputs are preventing this recovery from progressing smoothly.
Despite the global nature of the pandemic, some economies have pulled through the crisis better 
than others. In a number of countries, such as the United States and China, economic output has 
already returned to – or even significantly exceeded – its pre- crisis level. Yet many economies, 
including the four largest euro area Member States, are still lagging behind.
This heterogeneity is largely down to differences in the pattern of the pandemic and the meas -
ures taken to combat it. This article presents several empirical studies that examine these relation -
ships. Estimates show that workplace closures and stay- at- home requirements, for example, 
strongly curbed mobility. Although this slowed the spread of the pandemic, it was accompanied 
by major economic losses. Euro area countries which were hit particularly hard by the pandemic 
and in which restrictions were stricter or in force for longer experienced sharper slumps in activ -
ity. Moreover, countries in which high- contact services sectors are an economic mainstay proved 
particularly vulnerable.
Policymakers did not limit themselves to directly combating the pandemic, but supported the 
economy in many and varied ways. In the industrial countries, in particular, monetary and fiscal 
policy accommodation significantly cushioned the immediate impact of the crisis. Simulation cal -
culations suggest that the cushioning effects were even greater in the United States than in the 
euro area. In many places, specific measures also protected jobs, averted corporate insolvencies 
and prevented turmoil in the financial system.
Since the beginning of this year, efforts to curb the pandemic in the long run have been focused 
on vaccination campaigns. This could go a long way towards keeping the longer- term damage 
from the pandemic fairly limited in the advanced economies. In many developing and emerging 
market economies, on the other hand, the recovery is being held back by slow progress in terms 
of vaccination efforts. Over the next few months, the priority will be to push ahead with vaccin -
ation campaigns around the world – and not only for humanitarian reasons. Global economic 
interconnectedness means that new waves of the pandemic in developing and emerging market 
economies would also damage the advanced economies. Another task will be to phase out the 
economic policy assistance measures as the pandemic recedes so as not to hamper the structural 
change that the pandemic has made necessary.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Almost two years after the outbreak of the 
coronavirus pandemic, large parts of the world 
remain firmly in its grip. The spread of the virus 
was first and foremost a humanitarian disaster. 
So far, over 240 million infections have been 
recorded around the world, with the real figure 
likely to be much higher. Almost 5 million 
people have lost their lives in connection with 
the virus.1 It is only thanks to the rapid develop -
ment of effective vaccines that recent waves of 
infection in the advanced economies have 
been less severe. The situation remains sub -
stantially more difficult in many emerging mar -
ket economies and developing countries, 
where a significant proportion of the popula -
tion will probably not be vaccinated until next 
year.
As long as vaccination coverage among the 
population is insufficient, reducing contact re -
mains the most effective way of curbing the 
spread of the highly infectious and dangerous 
virus. Only very few governments have relied 
completely on people adjusting their behaviour 
voluntarily, with most underpinning this with 
official measures instead. A kind of blueprint 
for such measures was provided by China, 
where the pandemic originated and where the 
rapid spread of the virus brought public life to 
a virtual standstill from as early as the end of 
January 2020. Just a few months later, coun -
tries all over the world were closing businesses 
and schools and imposing stay- at- home re -
quirements and travel restrictions. The upshot 
was a global economic downturn of historic 
proportions. In the second quarter of 2020, 
global real GDP was around 10% below its pre- 
crisis level. Even at the height of the global 
financial and economic crisis of 2008-09, losses 
had not been not nearly as severe.2
When the first wave of the pandemic receded 
in many countries, restrictions were undone to 
a degree over the course of the second quarter 
of 2020. This initially caused the economy to 
rebound strongly and at a more rapid pace than widely expected.3 Global industrial pro -
duction and world trade had already exceeded 
their pre- crisis levels by the end of 2020. High- 
contact services sectors, on the other hand, 
found it much harder to make up the ground 
they had lost. The sporadic recovery in indus -
tries such as food services, the events industry 
and tourism, in particular, was set back several 
times by measures to contain new waves of in -
fection. Even so, in many countries, the dip in 
general economic output for 2020 as a whole 
was much smaller than had been expected by 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in June 
2020, for example.4
No region of the world escaped the pandemic 
and its economic repercussions. Nonetheless, 
some economies appear to have pulled through 
the crisis better than others. Differences in the 
severity of the slump in economic output were 
already visible in the first half of 2020. The sub -
sequent recovery did not take place equally 
swiftly or steadily in all countries, either. In a 
number of countries, economic activity has al -
ready surpassed its pre- crisis level once again. 
This includes China, in particular, which has 
even returned to its original growth path. The

1 Figures are based on data from Johns Hopkins University, 
which analyses official national statistics on key data for 
the pandemic. The actual spread of the pandemic and the 
number of victims whose lives it has claimed is probably 
significantly underestimated. For instance, the World 
Health Organisation assumes that the number of 
coronavirus-  related deaths worldwide reported in 2020 
was around 40% too low. See Dong et al. (2020) and 
World Health Organisation (2021).
2 The GDP data are based on an aggregate of 48 econ -
omies using market exchange rates. Between the third 
quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, the GDP of 
this group of countries only fell by 4%.
3 For instance, according to the expert dating of business 
cycles, which is widely regarded as an official source, the 
recession in the United States came to an end as early as 
April 2020. In the history of all business cycles since 1854, 
this was by far the shortest economic downturn. See Na -
tional Bureau of Economic Research (2021).
4 At the time, the IMF’s forecast had predicted a decline of 
4.9% in global GDP for 2020 as a whole. The latest calcu -
lations revised the decrease downward to 3.1%, mainly 
owing to the rapid recovery in the second half of 2020. See

goods helped give its economy a major boost 
(for more information, see the box on pp. 46 f.). 
In the United States, real GDP is now back to 
just above its pre- crisis level. By contrast, in the 
largest euro area Member States, it is still some 
way off.
Impact of the pandemic 
on mobility and global 
 economic activity
One explanation for the mixed picture among 
countries could be differences in their re -
sponses to the pandemic in terms of the meas -
ures taken and their duration. In March and 
April 2020, many governments took swift ac -
tion against the spread of infection, imposing 
far- reaching restrictions on social and eco -
nomic life. Even until recently, some countries 
implemented drastic measures in an attempt to 
stop the virus from spreading. Others took a 
less tough stance, for example because the 
local infection figures allowed it, because they 
relied more strongly on voluntary changes in 
behaviour, or because additional restrictions 
appeared too costly in light of the economic 
situation. The complex interactions between 
the pandemic situation, the measures taken, 
changes in behaviour, and economic activity 
present a major challenge for empirical studies. 
Although it seems plausible to assume that the 
sharp drop in GDP in Germany in the second 
quarter of 2020 was the result of government 
measures, other countries that took a less strict 
stance also experienced considerable declines. 
Even in the absence of administrative meas -
ures, infection rates brought about noticeable 
changes in behaviour.5
One way to overcome these difficulties and 
identify cause- effect relationships is to analyse 
high- frequency data. In actual fact, daily infec -
tion figures are available for almost all coun -
tries. The scale of the constraints owing to gov -
ernment containment measures can be ap -
proximated using a stringency index developed 
by the University of Oxford.6 High- frequency mobility data are analysed as a chain in the 
causal link between government- imposed or 
self- imposed constraints, on the one hand, and 
economic output, on the other. For instance, 
the data on the movement patterns of mobile 
phone users show significant shifts around Influence of

lysed using high-

tive measures, relying instead on behavioural guidelines, 
GDP shrank by just over 8% in the second quarter of 2020 
and thus by only slightly less than Germany’s GDP .
6 Inputs to the index calculations include government re -
strictions on schools, businesses, public transport, events 
and gatherings as well as various restrictions on the mobil -
ity of citizens. Index values of zero indicate no containment 
measures, while values of 100 represent the strictest pos -
sible containment measures. For a description of the index,

The reasons for the Chinese economy’s comparatively good 
performance in the pandemic
China, the country in which the pandemic 
originated, had already endured a massive 
decline in economic activity at the begin-
ning of 2020. It recovered surprisingly 
quickly from this slump, which affected sev-
eral services sectors as well as the industrial 
sector. Whilst other countries’ economies 
were getting caught up in the downward 
spiral of the pandemic, China’s real gross 
domestic product had already returned to 
pre- crisis levels by the second quarter of 
2020. Shortly thereafter, it even returned to 
its original growth trajectory.
The Chinese authorities’ rigorous contain-
ment policy accounted for a material share 
of the dynamic recovery; it brought infec-
tion counts down quickly and sustainably. 
High- contact services, in particular, were 
the benefi  ciaries, whereas industrial pro-
duction recovered rapidly on the back of, 
above all, foreign business.1 In 2020, Chi-
na’s goods exports (on a US dollar basis) 
picked up by 3½% even though global im-
port expenditure dropped by around 6% in 
the same year.2The decisive reason why Chinese exports 
performed remarkably well lay in the ability 
of Chinese industry to deliver quickly and in 
large quantities those goods for which de-
mand picked up on account of the pan-
demic. Such goods initially included medical 
personal protective equipment. In addition, 
the transition of many employees to work-
ing from home caused a global spike in 
additional demand for IT equipment. More-
over, global consumer demand shifted as 
well: owing to containment measures or 
voluntary changes in behaviour, households 
strongly curbed their consumption of high- 
contact services but conversely increasingly 
acquired goods such as electronic devices 
or furniture. Chinese exporters, which are 
specialised in consumer goods, therefore 
benefi  ted enormously from this.
In order to quantify the signifi  cance of the 
product range effect for China’s successful 
export performance, we decompose Chi-
nese exports for the past two years into ap-
proximately 5,000 product groups and 
compare each to global exports.3 We then 
ask what China’s export revenues for 2020 
would have been if, in each product group, 
the country had participated in global trade 
growth at 2019 product- specifi  c global 
market shares. It turns out that the hypo-
thetical export value calculated in this fash-
ion for 2020 would have been merely 1.4% 
1 The considerable expansion in public investment ac-
tivity was an additional key reason.
2 China’s goods imports in 2020, on the other hand, 
did not quite sustain their 2019 levels in value. The 
sharp fall in commodity prices was the decisive factor, 
however. If these products are factored out, the result 
is an increase of just under 3%. German exporters, 
too, benefi  ted from China’s essentially quite strong im-
port demand (see Deutsche Bundesbank (2020)).
3 The disaggregation is based on the classifi  cation of 
goods in the Harmonized Commodity Description and 
Coding System (HS) at the six- digit level. Data were 
taken from the Trade Data Monitor database.China: pandemic-related windfalls in

times when waves of the pandemic occurred. 
Whilst infection rates were high, the time users 
spent at home generally increased consider -
ably; conversely, far fewer individuals were at 
the workplace, and consumers stayed away 
from restaurants and recreational facilities.
A Bundesbank empirical study based on work 
by the IMF on developments during the first 
few months of the pandemic analyses these re -
lationships using a broad- based measure of 
mobility7 for a large group of countries span -
ning 128 economies.8 One topic of particular 
interest is the mobility response to a tightening 
of government- imposed restrictions9 as well as 
to rising infection numbers, based on which 
voluntary changes in behaviour are assumed to 
have taken place.10 Owing to the high fre -
quency of data, assumptions about the incuba -
tion period and the length of political decision- 
making processes allow pandemic shocks to be 
identified.11Empirical esti -
mates for a 
large group 
of countriesbelow 2019 export revenues, whereas 
global trade contracted by 6%.
The product range effect therefore had a 
stabilising effect on Chinese exports in a dif-
fi  cult global economic environment. How-
ever, the fact that Chinese exports actually 
rose requires further explanation. In individ-
ual product groups, China gained consider-
able global export shares. This increase was 
particularly impressive for personal protect-
ive equipment products, which include, for 
instance, face masks, global demand for 
which veritably skyrocketed within just a 
few weeks after the outbreak of the pan-
demic. China succeeded in extremely ramp-
ing up its production capacity within a short 
period of time and was thus able to almost 
single- handedly accommodate the increase 
in global demand. On the whole, pandemic- 
related medical products contributed just 
over 2½ percentage points to Chinese ex-
port growth in the past year.4The aggregate economic upturn in China 
decelerated markedly in the fi  rst three quar-
ters of this year. Exports, in turn, were an 
important factor in this development, too. 
They continued to expand briskly in the fi  rst 
quarter. However, as the pandemic receded 
and goods consumption in the industrial 
countries began to return to normal, the 
export boom seems to have been dissipat-
ing since then.5 The Chinese economy is 
thus once again increasingly dependent on 
drivers of domestic growth.
4 These included not only face masks (HS code: 
630790) but also protective garments for medical use 
(621010), medical test kits (300215), disinfectants 
(380894) and diagnostic or laboratory reagents 
(382200).
5 Although revenue from goods exports was still up 
nearly 25% year- on- year in the third quarter of 2021, 
this was probably due in large part to price increases.
7 For each country, this can be calculated from the mean 
values of the following sub- indices of the national Google 
mobility reports: retail and recreation, grocery and phar -
macy, transit stations, and workplaces. Each sub- indicator 
taken by itself measures the percentage change in visitor 
numbers as compared to the reference date in January-  
February 2020. To reduce fluctuations over the course of 
the week, the mobility index is included in the estimates as 
a seven- day moving average. See Google LLC (2021).
8 See International Monetary Fund (2020b) and, for a 
more detailed discussion of the approach and results, 
Caselli  et al. (2021).
9 Measured using the stringency index of the Oxford 
COVID-  19 Government Response Tracker, adjusted for the 
influence of public information events.
10 Infection rates are captured using the number of new 
infections per 100,000 inhabitants within seven days, as 
taken from the data provided by Johns Hopkins University. 
The choice of indicator is based on the assumption that the 
population adapts its behaviour to current infection rates 
rather than on the basis of indicators which only provide a 
lagged picture of developments in the pandemic. Persistent 
differences in national testing strategies are taken into ac -
count in the estimates through country fixed effects. Speci -
fications that use death counts as pandemic indicators in -
stead produce results of similar quality.
11 Specifically, it is assumed that unexpected changes to 
government containment measures or unforeseen devel -
opments in infection rates directly affect mobility. Mobility 
shocks, on the other hand, are only assumed to have a 
lagged impact on the other variables.Deutsche Bundesbank

The impulse- response functions estimated 
using local projections for the period from 
January 2020 through June 2021 suggest that 
government restrictions did, in fact, strongly 
curb mobility.12 They show that the immediate 
introduction of the strictest containment meas -
ures, which involved nationwide stay- at- home 
requirements and extensive business closures, 
inter alia, reduced mobility by almost 35%.13,14 
After just over one week, the estimated effects 
gradually start to wear off, probably mainly due 
to the success of the measures in slowing 
down the rate of infection and a subsequent 
easing of the restrictions. The results also show 
that, in and of themselves, increasing infection 
rates caused a clear decline in mobility. In any 
case, after a doubling of the seven- day total of 
new infections per 100,000 inhabitants, mobil -
ity decreased by just under 5% on average, and 
had barely recovered even almost two months 
later. Given that government restrictions ini -
tially remained unchanged, this response was 
probably largely due to the public taking their 
own safety precautions.15 Because the number 
of infections not only doubled, but multiplied 
several times over in each of the last pandemic 
waves, voluntary changes in behaviour prob -
ably played a key role in the observed declines Higher infection 
rates and con -
tainment meas -
ures strongly 
curbed mobility
12 The impulse- response functions reflect the estimated 
coefficients of regressions that explain future develop -
ments in mobility using the pandemic and containment 
variables. The projection equations also take into account 
realisations of all variables (including the dependent vari -
ables) during the previous two weeks, as well as time and 
country fixed effects. This approach is therefore broadly 
equivalent to an estimate using a panel vector autoregres -
sion (VAR) model. See also Jordà (2005) as well as Plagborg- 
Møller and Wolf (2021).
13 Because the mobility indices capture the percentage de -
viation of mobility from a reference level in January-  
February 2020, the impulse- response functions reflect, 
strictly speaking, the responses attributable to the meas -
ures in percentage points. This is approximately equal to 
the percentage change in the mobility level. All responses 
described here are significantly different from zero at the 
10% level at least.
14 In countries such as Italy, where similarly strict rules 
were briefly in force in the second quarter of 2020, this 
corresponds to around half of the decline in mobility actu -
ally observed.
15 The effects, which initially increase over time, probably 
also reflect the lagged tightening of containment measures 
to at least some extent, however. A correlation of this kind 
is suggested, inter alia, by separately estimated impulse-  
response functions for the adjustment of containment 
measures after a doubling of infection numbers.Deutsche Bundesbank

the first few months of the pandemic as well as 
a large number of academic studies on this 
topic.16
A closer look at the individual containment 
measures reveals that they had very different ef -
fects on mobility and thus also on economic ac -
tivity and the course of the pandemic.17 For ex -
ample, although behavioural recommendations 
alone – such as those regarding on- site working 
or social distancing – also noticeably reduced 
mobility,18 mandatory measures such as 
government- imposed workplace closures or 
stay- at- home requirements had a much greater 
impact. This is also true in comparison to regu -
lations that encroached on other areas of pub -
lic and private life. While strict workplace clos -
ures and stay- at- home requirements by them -
selves reduced mobility by almost 10% and 8%, 
respectively, the impact of restrictions on gath -erings, international travel and public events 
was much smaller.19 All in all, the results there -
fore suggest that those measures that probably 
Strict bans, stay- 
at- home require -
ments and 
workplace clos -
ures particularly 
limiting16 Chernozhukov et al. (2021), for instance, confirm that 
stay- at- home orders and business closures were highly ef -
fective. However, other studies, including Gupta et al. 
(2020) and Goolsbee and Syverson (2021), note that con -
siderable changes in mobility behaviour were already visible 
before the tightening or easing of containment measures 
and highlight the role of self- imposed behavioural adjust -
ments. Even the strong deterioration in the US labour mar -
ket in the first few months of the pandemic can probably 
only partly be explained by government containment 
measures; see, for instance, Baek et al. (2021) as well as 
Kong and Prinz (2020).
17 In the following analyses, in addition to the respective 
measure in question for a given type of containment meas -
ure, the local projections incorporate a second indicator 
that summarises the stringency of the restrictions in all 
other categories.
18 This distinction takes advantage of the fact that, at the 
level of the components of the Oxford COVID-  19 Govern -
ment Response Tracker, behavioural recommendations are 
differentiated from mandatory measures of varying de -
grees of magnitude.
19 However, it also appears that measures – such as re -
strictions on international travel – that have become part of 
everyday life in many places since the outbreak of the pan -
demic were accompanied by mobility restrictions that per -
sisted for comparatively long periods.Deutsche Bundesbank

Because measures of economic activity are 
generally only available on a quarterly basis, 
analysing GDP losses using a high- frequency 
dataset is not entirely straightforward. How -
ever, the OECD evaluates internet search quer -
ies on key economic topics every week and 
tracks overall economic activity on this basis.20 
The resulting indicators, which are available for 
46 countries, provide at least a rough high-  
frequency picture of GDP trends since the start 
of 2020. Analysing local projections based 
on  these data confirms, for instance, that

were associated with considerable declines in 
activity. Taken in isolation, tightening govern -
ment containment measures to the greatest 
extent possible would directly reduce economic 
activity by around 6% below the expected 
baseline before the pandemic.21 The effects of a doubling of the infection rate are also statis -
tically significant. According to the estimation, 
they reduce GDP by up to 1%.
Differences in how the euro 
area countries’ economies 
were affected
The analysis up to now has largely excluded the 
heterogeneity between countries. However, 
the pandemic has weighed on the individual 
countries to differing degrees and at different 
times. A comparison of China with the rest of 
the world illustrates this in particular. In that 
country, many production plants came to a 
standstill as early as in January 2020. A few 
months later, economic activity then slumped 
elsewhere. A part was played by the disruption 
to international value chains as a result of sup -
ply shortfalls for Chinese products (see the box 
on pp. 52 ff.).
The euro area economies also pulled through 
the crisis very differently. This already became 
apparent in the first half of 2020. At the peak 
of the crisis in the second quarter, GDP losses 
(in each case compared with pre- crisis levels) 
ranged from 4½% in Lithuania to 22% in 
Spain.22 Even one year later, following a rapid 
but partly bumpy recovery, the situation has re -
mained mixed. While GDP in some Member 
States had exceeded its respective pre- crisis 
level once again as early as in the second quar -Economic activ -

21 This is a fairly conservative estimate. Identifying the ef -
fects of government containment measures in this study is 
made more difficult by the fact that many of the mostly ad -
vanced economies in the sample tightened or eased restric -
tions in the same week. Much of the variation is therefore 
explained by time fixed effects. If these are stripped out of 
the estimations, the calculated decline in economic activity 
after tightening government containment measures to the 
greatest extent possible is almost three times as large.
22 Ireland recorded only a slight decline in real GDP in the 
second quarter of 2020 and economic activity already ex -
ceeded its pre- crisis level in the following quarter. However, 
the statistical reporting of economic output in Ireland has 
been largely determined by the strategic planning of multi -
national enterprises for several years (see Deutsche Bun -
desbank (2018)). For this reason, Ireland is excluded from 
the following analyses.Deutsche Bundesbank

ter of 2021, in Spain it remained just over 8% 
lower. The backlogs were somewhat lower in 
Italy, at 4%, as well as in Germany and France, 
each at 3%.
The mixed picture across countries is partly at -
tributable to differences in infection rates. Sim -
ple correlation analyses indicate this, at least. 
Particularly in the first half of 2020, economic 
losses clearly coincided with the intensity of the 
pandemic.23 The stringency of government 
containment measures24 and the mobility indi -
cator25 turn out to be even more closely associ -
ated with GDP losses in the first half of 2020. 
Overall, the findings support the hypothesis 
that, above all, the countries which had to 
shoulder sharp declines in GDP were those that 
were hit particularly hard by the pandemic, in 
which stringent and/ or more protracted con -
tainment measures were in force, and whose 
residents restricted their mobility more sharply.
However, the relationship between pandemic 
developments and mobility, on the one hand, 
and economic developments, on the other, 
later weakened. The correlation of the indica -
tors with GDP losses cumulated since the onset 
of the pandemic fell. This is likely to be due, 
inter alia, to enterprises adapting better to the 
pandemic conditions through the deployment 
of hygiene measures and increased remote 
working, and households’ increased use of 
contactless distribution channels on account of 
the restrictions.
As contacts were reduced during the pan -
demic, economic sectors such as the food and 
beverage and accommodation sectors, but also 
transport services and cultural activities suf -
fered heavy losses. Economies for which these 
sectors play a key role were thus hit particularly 
hard. The correlation analysis suggests that the 
significance of the economic structure for GDP 
growth even increased over time. For instance, 
it reveals a close relationship between the share 
of the accommodation sector in aggregate 
gross value added26 and cumulative GDP losses 
up to the second quarter of 2021. A broadly Pandemic devel -

The role of the disruption of Chinese supply chains 
in production slumps in the United States and the EU 
in spring 2020
The government of the People’s Republic of 
China responded to the outbreak of the 
coronavirus pandemic as from the end 
January 2020 by ordering businesses to 
shut down and imposing extensive restric-
tions on labour mobility. Owing to the 
major importance of Chinese fi  rms for inter-
national goods trade, this disrupted numer-
ous supply chains. Many industrial fi  rms the 
world over cited this as a key factor limiting 
production in March and April 2020. How-
ever, in many places the burdens caused 
directly by the pandemic increased more or 
less simultaneously, too. This makes it all 
the more diffi   cult to identify the role played 
by those value chain disruptions that are at-
tributable to China in the global production 
slump in spring 2020.One way of approximating these effects is 
to compare developments in sectors which 
are dependent to varying degrees on inputs 
supplied by China. To this end, we use 
input- output tables to calculate a measure 
of dependence at a detailed level of break-
down of industries in the United States and 
the European Union.1 All sectors are broken 
down into more highly exposed and less 
highly exposed industrial sectors based on 
1 For the United States, we use the input- output tables 
of the Bureau of Economic Analysis for 2012 and cus-
toms values provided by the US Census Bureau for 
2019. Only intermediate inputs and capital goods are 
included in the calculation. For the EU, we use Euro-
stat’s supply and use tables for 2017 and customs val-
ues for 2019.

the cost shares of inputs from China.2 In a 
panel data analysis with monthly data on 
sectors’ production, employment and pro-
ducer prices, we can then gauge the impact 
of large dependence on Chinese inputs.3
The estimations show that, in industries 
that are highly dependent on Chinese input 
supplies, production dropped off signifi  -
cantly more sharply in March and April 
2020 than in other industries. The differ-
ence in April was nearly 10% for the United 
States and even approached 27% for the 
European Union. This discrepancy did not 
persist, however. As from July 2020, there 
have been no signifi  cant differences be-
tween industrial sectors that are more de-
pendent on or less dependent on Chinese 
inputs. This is likely to be due to the rapid 
lifting of restrictions in China, as a conse-
quence of which its foreign trade had al-
ready recovered fully in April.
In addition, the estimates show that produ-
cer prices in industries that are particularly 
dependent on Chinese inputs picked up 
slightly at the outbreak of the pandemic, 
whereas prices in less exposed industries 
fell. In April and May 2020, prices in par-
ticularly dependent sectors were 1% to 2% 
higher for the United States. In the EU, 
where developments were very similar, the 
corresponding price differential was around 
1%.4 Thus, shortfalls in intermediate goods 
imports from China probably resulted in 
supply- side disruptions in large parts of the 
US and EU manufacturing sector.5The role of China-specific import frictions

2 The median share of Chinese inputs in production 
costs is roughly 1% in both the United States and the 
EU. In those industries with above- median exposure to 
Chinese inputs, the average share is well above 2%.
3 For the United States, the analysis incorporates the 
four- digit NAICS manufacturing industries over the 
January 2019 to March 2021 period from the G.17 Re-
lease of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System. For the EU, data from Eurostat’s (primarily 
three- digit) NACE manufacturing sectors are available 
for the same period. The regression controls for time 
fi  xed effects and industry- specifi  c fi  xed effects. It also 
controls for general dependence on imported inputs 
and the degree of trade openness over time. Some 
sectors which could be particularly affected by domes-
tic restrictions were omitted from the analysis, such as 
transport goods and clothing production. See Khalil 
and Weber (2021). Meier and Pinto (2020) present a 
similar analysis for the role of international value chains 
at the beginning of the pandemic in the United States. 
In addition, Santacreu et al. (2021) also shed light on 
the role of large exposure to imported inputs.
4 The fuel and coal processing industries were omitted 
from the study in order to factor out energy price de-
velopments.
5 It can be shown for the United States, for which de-
tailed employment data are available, that increased 
dependence on China also considerably dampened 
employment in spring 2020. This indicates that there 
are complementarities between inputs and labour in 
the manufacturing sector, at least in the short term.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
October 2021  
53

Alongside the sector- level impact of Chi-
nese supply shortfalls, the macroeconomic 
effects are also of interest. An analysis using 
a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) 
model is a promising way of capturing 
these effects. Private goods consumption, 
manufacturing production, goods imports 
from the rest of the world (excluding China) 
and goods imports from China all feed into 
the model, which is estimated separately 
for the United States and the euro area.6
A historical shock decomposition based on 
the estimation results initially shows that 
the decline in US and euro area goods im-
ports from China in February and March 
2020 can be attributed to China- specifi  c 
trade frictions.7 This turmoil also contrib-
uted to the considerable production short-
falls in the US and euro area manufacturing 
industry in the spring months of 2020. 
These shortfalls subsided distinctly in both 
regions within just a few months. Accord-
ing to the shock decomposition, however, 
domestic economic developments in each 
of those regions constituted the more im-
portant factor accounting for the drop- off 
in industrial production.
To sum up, therefore, the analyses indicate 
that the disruptions to cross- border value 
chains resulting from the Chinese contain-
ment measures markedly weakened indus-
trial activity in the United States and the 
euro area at the outbreak of the pandemic. 
The disruptions in trade with China, how-
ever, were not the main reason for the 
slump in production at that time. Moreover, 
the strains were short- lived as China was 
able to ramp up the manufacture of inputs 
relatively quickly. Based on this experience, 
it also stands to reason that the latest pro-
duction disruptions caused by local fl  are- 
ups of the coronavirus in some emerging 
market economies will not result in any se-vere and lasting damage to the global econ-
omy.
6 All data for the United States are seasonally and 
price adjusted. For the euro area, private goods con-
sumption is approximated by retail sales in value terms 
(excluding private motor vehicles). All data for the euro 
area are seasonally adjusted. By ranking the variables 
and through recursive identifi  cation, it is assumed in 
the model that goods imports from China contempor-
aneously respond to unexpected disruptions in private 
consumption, industrial production and trade with 
third countries. China- specifi  c trade disruptions, in 
turn, impact directly only on goods imports from 
China; other variables respond with a time lag. The ap-
proach is based on Kilian et al. (2021) and is described 
in more detail by Khalil and Weber (2021). The Euro-
pean Central Bank’s BEAR toolbox was used for the 
estimations (see Dieppe et al. (2016)).
7 For both regions, the slump in imports from China 
can be explained almost entirely by China- specifi  c 
trade disruptions, whereas other shocks do not play 
any signifi  cant role.Deutsche Bundesbank

defined tourism indicator27 also correlates 
somewhat more strongly with the cumulative 
losses in activity than with the depth of the im -
mediate slump in the first half of 2020. This is 
probably a reflection of the fact that, in later 
waves of the pandemic, administrative contain -
ment measures were focused almost exclu -
sively on high- contact services sectors, whilst, 
in the first wave of the pandemic, even all eco -
nomic sectors seen as not directly essential 
were temporary shut down.
To cushion the economic fallout from the pan -
demic, the euro area countries took extensive 
fiscal measures. The deviation of the general 
government fiscal balance for 2020 from the 
value forecast in the last pre- crisis Eurosystem 
projection can be used as an indicator for the 
overall fiscal stimulus.28 It reveals a close rela -
tionship with economic development; that is, 
in countries with more pronounced GDP losses, 
the deficit widened even more. This is likely to 
reflect the fact that, in particularly hard hit 
countries, the automatic stabilisers responded 
robustly and governments took extensive fiscal 
measures.
Causes of the transatlantic 
growth differential
There were also considerable differences in 
economic developments between the euro 
area as a whole and the United States during 
the coronavirus crisis.29 Real GDP in the euro 
area contracted by 6.5% in 2020. In the United 
States, the decline was roughly half this 
amount. In addition, from the final quarter of 
2020 and the first quarter of 2021 onwards, re -
covery in the euro area was rather bumpy. In 
the second quarter of 2021, economic output 
in the euro area was still 3% lower than its pre- 
crisis level, whilst in the United States it already 
slightly exceeded its pre- crisis level. These dif -
ferences also remain when taking into account 
the stronger economic growth in the United 
States in the period prior to the crisis.The euro area’s relatively poor economic per -
formance was probably partly down to differ -
ences in the course of the pandemic and in the 
responses taken to it. Already in the first wave 
of infection, the self- imposed and government- 
mandated behavioural adjustments were more 
stringent in the euro area than in the United 
States. This also applied to the responses to the 
resurgence of the pandemic at the turn of 
2020-21. Economic policy might also have 
been a key factor. Although monetary policy 
was eased swiftly and decisively on both sides 
of the Atlantic, at the beginning of the crisis, 
there was greater scope for doing so in the 
United States. The sequence of extensive stimu -
lus packages in the United States also suggests 
that US fiscal policy might have supported the 
economy to a greater extent.30
These questions are addressed in our own em -
pirical analysis below. Structural vector autore -
gression (SVAR) models provide a framework 
for analysing the relative significance of the 
various explanatory factors.31 In the model

29 A number of institutions, including the European Cen -
tral Bank (2021), the International Monetary Fund (2021) 
and Banco de España (2021), as well as economists at the 
Banque de France (Chatelais (2021)), looked into the 
growth differential between the United States and the euro 
area or Europe. These partly descriptive, partly model-  
based analyses saw more stringent administrative and self- 
imposed restrictions in the euro area as the key factor be -
hind the transatlantic growth differential. In addition, dif -
ferences in fiscal support, the economic structure, the de -
gree of openness, and the underlying pace of growth also 
played a certain role.

ity, monetary and fiscal policy indicators32 and 
restrictions on behaviour33 during the pan -
demic are estimated separately for each eco -
nomic area. According to a historical shock de -
composition based on these estimations, the 
weaker economic development in the euro 
area overall since the outbreak of the corona -
virus crisis was primarily attributable to more 
stringent containment measures and behav -
ioural adjustments. It indicates that the extent 
of extraordinary fiscal and monetary policy 
measures did not play a major role. However, 
the model only shows those responses that go 
beyond the usual responses relative to the in -
tensity of the crisis as being fiscal or monetary 
policy shocks.34
In order to reflect the effects of monetary and 
fiscal policy responses in a more comprehen -
sive way, i.e. including automatic stabilisers and 
conventional policy responses, the NiGEM35 
global macroeconometric model is used. In this 
context, the impact of monetary and fiscal pol -icy is estimated based on counterfactual simu -
lations which assume a scenario where all 
forms of support provided by economic policy 
during the past one- and- a- half years are ex -
cluded and monetary policy interest rates, gov -
ernment expenditure and tax rates are set as 
expected before the crisis.36 According to the 
simulations, considerably stronger fiscal policy 
responses by the United States go a long way 
towards explaining its more favourable eco -
nomic development in comparison with the 
euro area.37 The relative explanatory contribu -
According to

tions, greater US 
fiscal expansion 
also significant32 The fiscal policy stance is approximated based on the 
cyclically adjusted primary balance as a percentage of po -
tential output, incorporating measures on the expenditure 
and revenue sides (such as tax cuts). Unexpected fiscal pol -
icy measures are identified with the help of sign restric -
tions. It is assumed that these reduce the cyclically adjusted 
primary balance and, at the same time, stimulate GDP 
growth. The monetary policy stance is approximated based 
on the shadow rate (according to estimates by Krippner 
(2013)). Monetary policy shocks lower the shadow rate 
and, at the same time, boost real GDP growth and con -
sumer price inflation. It is also assumed that they do not 
have an immediate impact on the cyclically adjusted fiscal 
primary balance.
33 On the basis of the Goldman Sachs Effective Lockdown 
Index, both government- mandated measures (according to 
the Oxford COVID-  19 Government Response Tracker) and 
self- imposed behavioural adjustments (according to Google 
mobility reports) are taken into account. See Hatzius et al. 
(2020).
34 The model takes into account not only the major role 
played by automatic stabilisers in the euro area owing to 
the social security systems (according to Dolls et al. (2012), 
automatic stabilisers in the euro area cushion around 49% 
of the idiosyncratic unemployment shock; in the United 
States the figure is only 34%), but also the fact that the 
United States frequently pursues an active stabilisation pol -
icy in times of crisis.
35 NiGEM is the global economic model developed by the 
UK- based National Institute of Economic and Social Re -
search (NIESR). It models economic interconnectedness be -
tween 60 economies and regions via foreign trade and the 
interest rate- exchange rate nexus. The model has New 
Keynesian features, especially forward- looking elements on 
the financial and labour markets. For further information, 
see https://nimodel.niesr.ac.uk
36 Here, six fiscal policy variables (government consump -
tion, public investment, transfers, income tax, corporation 
tax and VAT rates) and the short- term interest rates from 
the first quarter of 2020 onwards were replaced by values 
set by the NIESR in the NiGEM forecast baseline from Janu -
ary 2020.
37 For example, fiscal policy in the United States contrib -
uted around 3½ percentage points to the average quar -
terly growth rate since the beginning of the coronavirus cri -
sis, whilst in the euro area this effect was estimated to be 
1¾ percentage points. In the simulations for the euro area, 
the funds from the Next Generation EU programme were 
not yet taken into account as they have not yet been de -
ployed.Deutsche Bundesbank

Summary and economic 
 policy conclusions
All in all, the findings point to a series of im -
portant reasons why countries’ economies 
were affected to differing degrees by the 
coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic did not 
rage everywhere to the same extent. There 
were also differences in the containment meas -
ures taken by governments. Sectoral particular -
ities in individual economies likewise played a 
role. For example, the Chinese economy bene -
fited from its range of exports, which suited 
people’s needs particularly well during the pan -
demic. Conversely, the major importance of 
tourism not least in some euro area countries is 
likely to have contributed to the comparatively 
sharp contraction in economic output. Finally, 
both in the euro area and in the United States, 
the fiscal and monetary policy responses cush -
ioned the immediate impact of the crisis con -
siderably; in the United States the supporting 
effects were probably even greater.
The economic recovery has now made good 
progress in many places. The increasing per -
centage of the population that is fully vaccin -
ated has contributed significantly to this. In 
addition, households and enterprises have 
learned to deal with the challenges of the pan -
demic and government containment measures 
are being used in a more targeted manner and 
more sparingly. The recovery has not been en -
tirely smooth, however. Drags on growth in -
clude shortages of key intermediate inputs and 
delivery delays. Pandemic- induced shifts in de -
mand contributed significantly to this. The un -
expectedly rapid speed of the recovery itself 
was probably another reason.
While the short- term economic consequences 
of the pandemic are now better understood, its 
longer- term impact has only been able to be 
roughly estimated so far. The IMF recently an -ticipated that in 2024 global economic output 
would remain 2¼% below the level expected 
prior to the outbreak of the pandemic.39 As is 
already the case for the short- term effects, the 
picture is mixed across countries. For the ad -
vanced economies, the longer- term damage 
will tend to be fairly minor. By contrast, in many 
developing and emerging market economies 
where vaccination campaigns have often been 
progressing at only a sluggish pace, a compre -

different factors for economic development during the 
pandemic are subject to a particularly high degree of un -
certainty. First, the findings depend crucially on the challen -
ging measurement of economic policy drivers and 
pandemic- related restrictions. Second, it is not known to 
what extent experience from previous economic cycles 
which underlies all models can be applied to the excep -
tional situation of the past two years.

Remote working and its impact on labour productivity
The coronavirus pandemic has seen an in-
crease in remote working, meaning that 
there has been a surge in the use of associ-
ated digital technologies (such as video 
conferences and cloud services). This devel-
opment is frequently accompanied by the 
hope that it will prove sustainable and is 
potentially a sign of a broader push to-
wards digitalisation1 that could strengthen 
productivity growth over the coming years.
In the case of Germany, the results of a rep-
resentative survey of fi  rms conducted by 
the Bundesbank in May 2021 indicate that 
almost three- fi  fths of enterprises have made 
greater use of working from home arrange-
ments since the onset of the crisis.2 This 
ratio was signifi  cantly higher in some ser-
vices sectors, such as the fi  nancial and in-
surance activities sector or in the informa-
tion and communication sector, while nat-
urally far fewer enterprises made use of 
such arrangements in more contact-intensive 
sectors, including the accommodation and 
food service activities sector, the retail trade 
and also the construction sector. Larger en-
terprises, in particular, also made more ex-
tensive use of remote working.3 Very similar developments can be seen in other indus-
trial countries, too, in which remote work-
ing also increased broadly in response to 
the pandemic.4
The main reason for the sudden rise in 
working from home was the necessity to 
practise social distancing owing to the pan-
demic. Working from home arrangements 
are also likely to be used more frequently 
after the crisis than before on account of 
the investments made, learning and net-
work effects, as well as the wealth of posi-
1 Alongside remote working, the use of online distri-
bution channels (e- commerce) and digital payment 
systems, for example, has also received a boost. For in-
stance, online retailers’ sales have risen strongly in 
both the USA and the EU.
2 This is a regular survey of fi  rms conducted by the 
Deutsche Bundesbank. The participating enterprises 
make up a representative selection of Germany’s cor-
porate landscape; see Deutsche Bundesbank (2021b).
3 These fi  ndings are consistent with those of other 
studies; see, for example, Alipour et al. (2020).
4 For instance, according to Eurostat, the share of em-
ployees in the EU who worked at least partly from 
home increased by around one- half on the year to just 
under 23% in 2020. The American Time Use Survey re-
ported that this share increased from 22% in 2019 to 
42% in 2020 in the USA.

tive experiences with using this working 
model.5
It is still diffi   cult to predict what impact this 
development will have on labour productiv-
ity. However, a number of studies based on 
experiments or on corporate or employee 
surveys indicate that employees are at least 
as productive when working from home as 
they are when working in traditional offi   ces.6 
Amongst other factors, the possibility of 
structuring the working day more fl  exibly 
and also the time saved from not having to 
commute play a signifi  cant role in this con-
text. By contrast, other studies fi  nd evidence 
of productivity- reducing effects.7 This view is 
mainly supported by increased communica-
tion costs in some cases and potentially 
shortened periods of focused work. In add-
ition to these direct effects, however, in-
creased remote working could also lead to 
improved job matching in the longer run, 
with positions being fi  lled by qualifi  ed em-
ployees from other regions or even other 
countries, thereby enabling effi   ciency gains.8 
The use of remote working could likewise re-
duce expenditure on workplace infrastruc-
ture, for instance for offi   ce rents, and thus 
have a productivity-enhancing effect. In view 
of the reduction in spatial frictions, the trend 
towards remote working could also result in 
productivity- boosting reallocation effects be-
tween enterprises and sectors. It is conceiv-
able that the more productive members of 
the workforce will increasingly switch to more  
successful and attractive enterprises, which 
might bolster the success of these enter-
prises and augment aggregate productivity.9
The results of the Bundesbank’s survey of 
fi  rms support an optimistic assessment 
overall. The vast majority of the surveyed 
enterprises that relocated activities to a 
home working structure during the crisis 
expect this development to be conducive to 
their enterprise’s productivity.Overall, there is therefore some evidence to 
suggest that the surge in remote working 
seen since the outbreak of the crisis could 
have a moderate productivity- enhancing 
effect . However, a considerable amount of 
further research is still required with regard 
to this relationship. It also still remains to be 
seen whether the pandemic has triggered 
a  more extensive and broader- based 
productivity- boosting push towards digitali-
sation.
5 Studies supporting this assessment can be found, for 
example, in Ozimek (2020), Alipour et al. (2021), Bar-
rero et al. (2021), Erdsiek (2021) and OECD (2021b). 
Network effects in this context arise from the use of 
video conferencing applications, for example. If these 
applications are used by many people, then their use-
fulness increases for individual users.

9 In the longer term, however, the greater concentra-
tion of enterprises potentially associated with this de-
velopment could also reduce incentives to innovate 
and impair productivity growth.Expected impact of the increase in

In the industrial countries, longer- term damage 
is likely to also be limited by the rapid fiscal and 
monetary policy response. It boosted macro -
economic demand and employment,40 averted 
numerous corporate insolvencies41 and pre -
vented major turmoil in the banking and finan -
cial systems. This created an environment in 
which investment activity was able to hold up 
relatively well. Overall, government measures 
made a substantial contribution to containing 
the negative impact on labour and capital input 
and aggregate productivity.42
Certain developments could even provide the 
economy with additional momentum in future, 
including, in particular, the push towards digi -
talisation triggered by the pandemic. The pan -
demic conditions forced many enterprises to 
digitalise their processes or business models. 
This could fuel productivity growth over the 
next few years. This is also suggested by the 
expectations of enterprises in Germany with re -
gard to the increased use of remote working 
(see the box on pp. 58 f.).
A turning point in the pandemic was the devel -
opment of effective vaccines. A large part of 
the population is now vaccinated in the indus -
trial countries; however, in most cases vaccin -
ation rates are not high enough to enable all 
protective measures to be lifted. In many de -
veloping and emerging market economies, vac -
cines are still in scarce supply. In the world’s 
poorest countries, just 1½% of the population 
has been fully vaccinated so far. This not only 
means that millions of people have largely no 
protection against the virus but it is also en -
couraging more dangerous strains of the virus 
to develop. In addition, new waves of infection 
could trigger renewed economic setbacks in 
the developing and emerging market econ -
omies. This would also affect the industrial 
countries via international trade and the global 
financial system. It thus remains a priority issue for the international community to push ahead 
with vaccination campaigns around the world.
Economic policy in the industrial countries 
should support macroeconomic recovery until 
the end of the pandemic and thus try to avoid 
knock- on damage. Thereafter, however, fiscal 
consolidation needs to be tackled. Here, it is 
not just a question of avoiding overstimulating 
and thus “overheating” the economy. The past 
one- and- a- half years have also shown how im -
portant it is to have fiscal policy buffers in times 
of crisis.
Beyond this, thought should already be given 
today to the fact that the coronavirus crisis will 
probably result in longer- term changes to the 
economic structure. Certain business models 
might no longer be sustainable in the long term. 
However, many of the measures taken during 
the crisis were rightly targeted at keeping firms 
from going under in the light of the high degree 
of uncertainty. In this way, the number of mar -
ket exits has fallen distinctly since the onset of 
the crisis, not least on account of the insolvency 
moratoria adopted in many countries. As the 
pandemic is gradually overcome, these forms of 
assistance should be scaled back so that the ne -
cessary structural change is not hindered.… also owing

40 For example, during the crisis relatively few jobs were 
lost in the advanced economies. The unemployment rate, 
having been as low as 4.8% in 2019 for the group of ad -
vanced economies, rose to 6.6% in 2020 in the aftermath 
of the dramatic economic slump at the beginning of the 
pandemic. The increase was considerably smaller outside 
the United States, and there, too, the unemployment rate 
then began to go back down rapidly. As a result, the 
longer- term effects on the potential labour force are likely 
to be modest in the current crisis.
41 For example, in Germany in 2020, the number of cor -
porate insolvencies fell by around 15% compared with the 
previous year and was thus at its lowest level since the 
introduction of the current insolvency framework in 1999 
(see Federal Statistical Office (2021)). According to Eurostat 
data, the EU as a whole recorded a decline of around 23%. 
For the United States, too, Crane et al. (2021) find evidence 
of fairly low exit rates since the outbreak of the crisis.

Germany, see Hinterlang et al. (2021).Deutsche Bundesbank

What do households in Germany think 
about the digital euro? First results from 
surveys and interviews
Central banks around the world are looking into concepts for various forms of central bank digital 
currency (CBDC). Their investigations are progressing at different speeds and are motivated by dif -
ferent reasons. While some central banks are, for now, just analysing the need for CBDC and its 
potential benefits and drawbacks, others have already begun developing initial prototypes. CBDC 
would be another form of money, alongside cash and wholesale central bank deposits, that is 
issued by a central bank and would represent a direct liability against it. Most of the projects 
being run by central banks are geared towards a CBDC intended for use by households, firms and 
other non- banks. The Eurosystem is also discussing and exploring the possible issuance of CBDC 
for the euro area – the digital euro.
A digital euro would add another option to the choice of payment methods available in the euro 
area. It should therefore be designed in such a way as to meet the needs of the general public. 
This poses a whole series of questions which are of interest not least in light of the investigation 
phase now under way. What do individuals currently think of a possible digital euro? What needs 
could it satisfy? Could it really be designed as a type of digital cash? Or might it be more of a rival 
for the traditional cashless payment instruments? And what factors could ultimately shape its 
acceptance and use by consumers?
With these questions in mind, this article considers the relationship between cash, cashless pay -
ment instruments and a possible digital euro from the consumer perspective. By drawing on a 
representative public survey and research interviews, the investigation delivers some first insights 
into households’ attitudes towards a digital euro. One thing which becomes clear is that the dis -
cussion surrounding CBDC has not yet taken root among the general public. The findings also 
suggest that consumers do not regard a digital euro as a blanket substitute for cash, but instead 
see its potential as lying more in the context of cashless payment instruments. There are possible 
novel features which could render a digital euro especially attractive in comparison to private 
means of payment.Deutsche Bundesbank

The digital euro as a poten -
tial new means of payment
Central banks around the world have been 
looking into the concept of CBDC for a number 
of years now. The majority are focusing first on 
conceptual research, experimentation or proof- 
of- concept studies.1 To date, only a handful of 
central banks have taken CBDC forward into a 
pilot phase or are working towards issuing one 
in the very near future. The ongoing investiga -
tions centre more around assessing the poten -
tial benefits and drawbacks of a CBDC. Most of 
the projects being run by central banks are 
geared towards a central bank digital currency 
intended primarily for use by households. This 
CBDC would constitute a third variant of cen -
tral bank money alongside cash and wholesale 
central bank deposits.
October 2020 saw the Eurosystem publish a re -
port on the possible issuance of a CBDC for the 
euro area.2 The report considers scenarios 
which could warrant the issuance of such a 
digital euro. Some of the aspects discussed in -
clude the digital euro’s role as a catalyst for 
digitalisation, a response to a possible spread 
of other non- euro- denominated digital curren -
cies and private stablecoins, and in the context 
of a potential further decline in the use of cash. 
On 14 July 2021, the Governing Council of the 
European Central Bank decided to launch the 
investigation phase of a digital euro project. 
The idea is to investigate the conditions that 
would need to be in place if a digital euro were 
to be introduced. The decision as to whether a 
digital euro will actually be introduced will not 
be made until the conclusion of the two- year 
investigation phase, however. The time is to be 
spent, in particular, assessing and exploring the 
functional design and distribution of a possible 
digital euro, its economic ramifications as well 
as any amendments to the EU legislative frame -
work which might be needed.3
The possibility that the use of cash as a means 
of payment may wane further is one of a num -
ber of considerations playing into the discus -sion surrounding a digital euro.4 Cash use in 
payments in Germany has indeed recorded an -
other steep decline during the pandemic. While 
around 74% of point- of- sale payments5 by 
households in Germany were still settled using 
cash in 2017, that figure had dropped to around 
just 60% in 2020.6 The fact that, during the 
pandemic, consumers were unable to shop and 
travel as they normally would and also had to 
adapt how they spent their leisure time could 
possibly account for some of this decline. Over 
the course of 2020, many of the settings where 
people might traditionally use banknotes and 
coins –  retail, restaurants and fairs, for in -
stance – were either partially or entirely closed 
off to consumers. However, more granular ana -
lyses show that the proportion of cash- settled 
transactions was lower across almost all ex -
penditure types, meaning that we have to as -
sume that there was a lower inclination to -
wards using cash overall.7 It is not yet clear 
how the use of cash as a means of payment 
will evolve once the pandemic is over.
The declining use of cash as a means of pay -
ment could induce increasing dependence on 
private sector payment solutions. And even if 
Germany’s cash payments infrastructure is still 
in smooth working order, waning cash use 
could see constraints arise in future:8 declining 
cash use tends to push up the unit costs per 
cash transaction at ATMs and the point of sale. 
Commercial considerations could then drive 
credit institutions to respond by paring back 
their offering of cash services and merchants 
might restrict their acceptance of cash. If this 
were to happen, the public could end up being 
forced to switch to alternative modes of pay -
ment in individual cases, including when shop -Many central

ping in person. For a digital euro to be a re -
sponse to this challenge, it would need to meet 
the requirements that the public have of a 
means of payment in a similar way to cash.
At the moment, cash is the only way for house -
holds and other non- banks to hold central 
bank money. A digital euro would give these 
holders an additional, digital form of central 
bank money, which would probably share 
some of the characteristics of both cash and 
cashless payment instruments.
The extent to which a digital euro manages to 
gain a foothold is ultimately up to the potential 
users. This is why investigations into the user 
perspective are needed, in order to gain an 
idea of the market penetration that a digital 
euro might be expected to achieve in the pay -
ments space and to better understand the po -
tential repercussions of its introduction for 
existing cashless and cash payment instru -
ments. The present article seeks to do this by 
analysing the features of cash, cashless pay -
ment instruments and a possible digital euro 
on the basis of consumer research surveys.9
Expected features of forms 
of money and means 
of  payment
The existing body of research on payment be -
haviour shows that consumers take account of 
a host of different factors when evaluating 
forms of money and means of payment.10 
Generally  speaking, individuals take a utility-  
maximising approach when making decisions 
about holding and using different forms of 
money and payment instruments – that is to 
say, they use them in the way that best matches 
their needs. And when doing so, they take ac -
count of the associated costs and risks. This 
utility- driven analysis is particularly prevalent in 
respect of the payment and store of value func -
tions. The relative weighting accorded to indi -
vidual criteria, as well as the evaluation of the 
extent to which a given payment instrument satisfies a particular criterion, will vary accord -
ing to the subjective perception of the user.
Studies by the Bundesbank into the assessment 
of payment instruments suggest that, for con -
sumers, protection against loss, a clear over -
view of spending, ease of use and familiarity as 
well as the maintenance of privacy are among 
the most important factors when judging dif -
ferent forms of money. In consumers’ eyes, 
cash fulfils almost all of these criteria particu -
larly well. Only in terms of protection against 
financial loss do debit cards rate even more 
highly.11 And these judgements are also re -
flected in actual cash use. Despite the decline 
in cash use during the coronavirus pandemic, 
cash remains the most frequently used option 
for day- to- day payments, accounting for 60% 
of transactions.12 Demand for cash as a store of 
value is also high in Germany. According to the 
results of a Bundesbank survey, in 2018, indi -
viduals in Germany kept an average of around 
€1,364 in cash at home or in a safe deposit box 
(besides the cash in their wallets).13 The distri -
bution of these amounts among the popula -
tion was extremely uneven and highly concen -
trated. Older people, higher earners and self-  
employed people held the largest cash reserves 
on average. Half of the respondents hoarded 
€200 or less in cash (median). In particular, 
concerns about the security and reliability of 
technical systems appear to play a role in cash 
hoarding behaviour. The growth in demand for 
cash during the coronavirus pandemic also 
underscores the importance of cash as a store 
of value (see the box on pp. 69 f.).User perspective

Cashless payment instruments are mainly based 
on commercial bank deposits (book money) 
and – similarly to cash – are characterised by 
ease and comfort of use as well as speed and 
security. Examples include the girocard and the 
card products offered by international card sys -
tems, credit transfers and e- payment schemes.14 
By comparison with cash, using cashless pay -
ment instruments saves time and potential fees 
charged for withdrawal. Furthermore, it is al -
most impossible to pay with anything other 
than cashless payment instruments in e-  
commerce transactions. In some cases, provi -
sion and use of these means of payment is also 
associated with the offer of additional services, 
such as loans. Meanwhile, the need for innova -
tive cashless payment methods, such as via a 
mobile phone, remains low at present, accord -
ing to consumers. Many people still regard mo -
bile payments as too insecure or too compli -
cated.15 Cashless forms of money are also the 
key players when it comes to the store of value 
function: the vast majority of financial assets in 
Germany are held in the form of bank deposits.
Talk has recently been turning to crypto tokens, 
meaning units of value which are available only 
in digital format and are based on encryption 
technology (cryptography). In comparison to 
cash and cashless payment instruments based 
on book money, crypto tokens do much worse 
at serving as a means of payment and store of 
value.16 Low acceptance, the lengthy transac -
tion processing times and the need to have 
some technical know- how represent the major 
barriers to their use as a means of payment.17 
With respect to their suitability as a store of 
value, meanwhile, the large fluctuations in 
value are problematic.
The digital euro from 
a  consumer perspective – 
empirical research by the 
Bundesbank
Which factors in terms of utility and costs 
would consumers associate with a digital euro? And how might the benefits and costs attached 
to a digital euro compare with those of cash 
and commercial bank book money? Is the con -
cept of a digital euro already familiar among 
parts of the population? To answer these ques -
tions, the first step, in April 2021, was to carry 
out a representative opinion poll as part of the 
Bundesbank Online Panel Households survey 
(see the box on pp. 71ff.). The results revealed 
that the term “digital euro” was still largely un -
known among the general public at the time of 
the survey. Study participants were asked 
whether they had ever heard or read anything 
about the digital euro prior to the survey. Only 
23% of respondents said they had. The low fa -
miliarity with the digital euro could be one of 
the reasons why the vast majority of interview -
ees were still sceptical about the prospect of 
one being introduced. In April 2021, just 13% 
of those asked were in favour of a digital euro 
being introduced, though among those with 
some prior knowledge approval was almost 
twice as high, at 22%. Attitudes and percep -
tions surrounding the digital euro could yet 
evolve as time goes by and the general public 
becomes more informed.
The current lack of familiarity with the digital 
euro concept makes conducting quantitative 
surveys on the topic challenging. A digital euro 
would be a technological innovation whose 
exact design – assuming it is introduced – has 
also not yet been specified. The prior know -
ledge and opinions needed for a survey on the 
digital euro can therefore not be readily as -
sumed to exist among study participants. So as 
to nevertheless gain deeper insights into the 
criteria that might guide consumers’ decisions 
regarding the future use of a digital euro, a 
qualitative approach in the form of guided 
interviews was selected. A particular advantage 
of this method is that study participants can be 
introduced to the concept of the digital euro 
step by step. Qualitative interviews work with Cashless pay -

Demand for cash as a store of value during the coronavirus 
crisis
In total, the Bundesbank issued banknotes 
worth approximately €70 billion net in 
2020, while net issuance in 2019 was 
slightly lower, at around €60 billion. A con-
siderable portion of banknote demand, 
namely €21 billion, was concentrated at the 
beginning of the coronavirus crisis in March 
2020 (see the chart below). There is evi-
dence to suggest that the higher demand 
for banknotes can be attributed, in part, to 
domestic households’ motive to use cash as 
a store of value.1
In order to better gauge how this has infl  u-
enced banknote demand since the begin-
ning of the coronavirus crisis in March 
2020, participants of the Bundesbank On-
line Panel Households (BOP- HH)2 were, in 
February 2021, surveyed about the reserves 
they held in cash form. 44% of participants 
stated that they hold cash reserves. It was 
striking that the percentage of those ques-
tioned holding cash reserves declined with 
age: whereas 51% of respondents under 30 
years of age held cash reserves, this was the 
case for only 38% of those aged 65 and 
older. One potential explanation could be 
that younger people hold small cash re-
serves in terms of value, which cannot be 
regarded as cash hoarding in the strict 
sense, but as a back- up emergency cash re-
serve to fi  nance consumption. By contrast, 
the relatively smaller number of cash re-
serves held by people aged 65 and upwards could suggest that they are using up exist-
ing cash reserves at a later stage in life.
In a second step, respondents who affi   rmed 
having cash reserves were asked to specify 
how these reserves had changed since 
March 2020 (see results in the chart on 
p. 70). The increase in cash reserves was at-
tributable, in particular, to younger persons 
under 30 years of age (37%) and those with 
a net household income of more than 
€6,000 (45%). One possible motive for this 
increase could be that younger people 
feared being unable to access their usual 
cash withdrawal points during a lockdown 
combined with otherwise small cash re-
serves in terms of value. Looking at people 
with a high net household income, their 
larger freely disposable income in combin-
ation with fewer local consumption options 
could be one reason for higher cash hold-
ings. Further factors, for instance the “cus-
tody fees” credit institutions demand on 
large transferable deposits, can likewise not 
be ruled out as possible explanations.
1 In a telephone survey conducted in April 2020, one- 
quarter of those questioned stated that they had 
changed their payment behaviour since the beginning 
of the coronavirus crisis, with 90% saying that they 
used cash less frequently, see Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2020c). Elevated demand for banknotes in March 
2020 is consequently unlikely to be attributable to dir-
ect demand for cash for transaction purposes.

open- ended questions, giving interviewees the 
chance to express themselves in their own 
words. The dialogue is not structured com -
pletely by the interviewer and their questions; 
rather, it is partly shaped by the input of the 
interviewee. The idea is to gain a detailed and 
in- depth handle on the interviewees’ individual 
perspectives instead of just taking a superficial 
look.18
With the assistance of forsa, a market and pub -
lic opinion research institute, a total of 40 inter -
views were carried out with people in Germany 
between 11 March 2021 and 13 April 2021.19 
The interviews lasted an average of 45 to 60 
minutes. The target group for the study were 
people who had taken part in the 2020 study 
on payment behaviour and had given their 
consent to an in- depth follow- up survey.20 
While the sample size is typically small for quali -
tative surveys, a heterogeneous mix of partici -
pants was deliberately chosen so as to capture 
consumer perceptions around the digital euro as comprehensively as possible. The partici -
pants were selected to represent the broadest 
range possible in terms of current payment be -
haviour, affinity to cash and cashless means of 
payment as well as attitudes towards digitalisa -
tion and experience with digital payment 
methods. Attention was also paid to the age 
and gender profile of the sample when select -
ing interviewees.
All of the recorded conversations were tran -
scribed verbatim. The interviews were pro -
cessed using Mayring’s qualitative content an -
alysis.21 On the basis of a research question, 40 qualitative 
guided inter -
views carried 
out in spring 
2021By contrast, roughly one- sixth of those sur-
veyed stated having lower cash reserves, 
something that was particularly pronounced 
for those with a lower household income. 
This could be attributable primarily to a 
drop in income as a result of the crisis, for instance due to short- time work, meaning 
that existing cash reserves were utilised for 
spending. More than half of respondents, 
namely 54%, said that the level of their 
cash reserves had not changed. It is striking 
here that less than one- third of this group 
stated not having touched the cash reserve 
at all, while approximately 70% said they 
made active use of it. In this last subset, 
cash reserves therefore appear not to con-
stitute cash hoarding in the stricter sense 
but rather outsourced wallet holdings that 
are used for transaction purposes.
Overall, the results reaffi   rm the assumption 
that households’ store- of- value motives 
were a signifi  cant factor in demand for 
banknotes during the coronavirus crisis. 
This can likely be explained, in particular, by 
the function of cash as a crisis- resistant and 
default- proof means of payment and store 
of value that can be used at any time.Cash reserves since the beginning of the

generally conducted via video. The interviewers shared 
their screen with the respondents as a way of providing in -
formation on the digital euro. Five interviews were carried 
out over the telephone as the interviewees did not have 
internet access. These people received the material by post 
in advance.

Bundesbank household survey on the digital euro
Every month, the Bundesbank Online Panel 
Households (BOP- HH) surveys households 
in Germany on their economic expectations 
and behaviour.1 Survey participants are 
aged 16 or over, live in Germany and have 
access to the internet. Between 16 and 
27 April 2021, the panel included questions 
on the digital euro. To begin, the 2,718 re-
spondents were shown the following ex-
planatory text:
“A digital euro would be an electronic form 
of central bank money. Central bank money 
is money that can only be created by the 
central bank. Today, central bank money 
mainly exists in the form of cash, which the 
central bank brings into circulation. A digital 
euro would enable everyone to pay in cash-
less form with central bank money.
A digital euro is not the same as a crypto- 
asset, such as bitcoin. A digital euro would 
be protected and regulated by the Euro-
pean Central Bank. It would also be default- 
free as a central bank can never go bank-
rupt. Crypto- assets have so far been issued 
and traded without any state oversight. This means that there is no institution ensuring 
their values remain stable and, as a result, 
crypto- assets – unlike digital euro – may be 
subject to sharp, unexplained fl  uctuations 
in value.”
Next, participants were asked questions 
about their prior knowledge of and opinion 
on the digital euro.
The survey revealed that the digital euro 
was still largely unknown to the general 
public at the time of the survey. Only 23% 
of respondents said that they had already 
heard or read anything about the digital 
euro before taking the survey. 60% re-
ported that while they had not heard or 
read anything about the digital euro, they 
had heard or read about crypto tokens. By 
contrast, 17% had no knowledge of either 
term. Surveys on the digital euro are thus 
still being constrained by a relative lack of 
prior knowledge, which means that public

opinion is probably not yet fully formed. 
The survey provides a representative snap-
shot of the digital euro at the time of the 
survey. Over time, and as the general public 
becomes more informed, attitudes and per-
ceptions surrounding the digital euro may 
yet change.
Assuming the participants had read and 
understood the introductory explanatory 
text, they were then asked for their opinion 
on the digital euro. The table below shows 
that around 13% of respondents were in fa-
vour of introducing a digital euro and that 
more than half (56%) were not. Roughly 
one- third were undecided. The introduction 
of a digital euro was more popular among 
respondents who had already heard of or 
read about the digital euro, at around 22%. Acceptance of the digital euro might still 
evolve with the passage of time and in-
creasing awareness among households. In 
a repeat of this survey at the end of July, the 
proportion of respondents who said they 
had previously heard of or read about the 
digital euro had already gone up to 44%. 
Awareness levels appear to have increased 
following the decision of the Governing 
Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) 
to launch the digital euro project.
65% of those in favour of a digital euro saw 
it as a good alternative to cash and 63% 
saw it as a good alternative to commercial 
payment initiatives (see the chart on p. 71). 
In addition, around 61% of those in favour 
felt a digital euro belonged to a digitalised 
society. By contrast, the respondents who

were not in favour of introducing a digital 
euro reported that the existing payment in-
struments were suffi   cient (see the chart on 
p.  72). Therefore, the additional benefi  ts 
that a digital euro offers over existing pay-
ment instruments need to be clearly com-
municated for a launch to be a success. In 
addition, 61% of those not in favour feared 
that the digital euro would be the fi  rst step 
towards abolishing cash. This indicates that 
the general public is not yet entirely re-
assured that the digital euro would merely 
complement cash, not replace it.
40% of all respondents could generally im-
agine using a digital euro in the future (see 
the above table). Here again, the propor-
tion is slightly higher (47%) among re-
spondents who had already heard of or 
read about the digital euro. Last of all, re-
spondents rated the importance of the 
characteristics a digital euro might have. For 
them, it was particularly important for a 
digital euro to be free of charge, keep their 
payment information private and protect 
their data (see the results in the chart on 
p. 74).2
2 There is some overlap between these results and 
those of the ECB’s non- representative public consult-
ation on the digital euro, which was launched on 
12  October 2020 and ran until 12  January 2021. 
Roughly 8,200 responses were received in total, with 
most respondents (94%) identifying themselves as citi-
zens and the remainder being professionals, including 
banks, payment service providers, merchants and tech 
companies. The ECB public consultation found that 
what both the general public and professionals want 
most from a digital euro is privacy (43%), followed by 
security (18%), usability across the euro area (11%), the 
absence of additional costs (9%) and offl   ine use (8%);

this method aims to derive meaning from the 
answers through data- driven step- by- step cod -
ing.22 Unlike quantitative research, qualitative 
analysis does not strive to determine the statis -
tical significance of the findings. Qualitative 
content analysis allows the systematic decod -
ing of the content of texts and is an established 
method within the field of qualitative re -
search.23
Qualitative survey on the 
digital euro – interview 
guideline and theoretical 
structure
The qualitative interviews were based on an 
interview guideline that comprised extensive 
explanations about the concept of a digital 
euro as well as a structured list of open-ended 
questions for the participants.24 These ques -
tions had been determined prior to the survey 
based on the possible features of the digital euro and earlier surveys on the acceptance of 
payment instruments.25 A step- by- step ex -
planatory approach was used to introduce par -
ticipants to the idea of a digital euro (see the 
chart on p. 75). Furthermore, given the highly 
abstract nature of this topic, a variety of sym -
bols and illustrations were used to bring the 
subject matter to life (see the chart on p. 77). 
As the interviews progressed, the feedback 
provided confirmed the finding from the repre -
sentative opinion poll that the vast majority of 
participants had not yet heard of the digital 
euro or CBDC at the time of the survey. Study 
participants were therefore asked during the 
interviews to describe the digital euro in their 
own words. That way, the interviewers could

ations. Furthermore, the open-ended questions 
encouraged participants to express their opin -
ions and attitudes regarding the characteristics 
of a digital euro, as presented to them during 
the survey.
The presentation of the digital euro in the inter -
views was based on the Eurosystem’s Report on 
a digital euro from October 2020.26 At the time 
the qualitative survey was conducted, this re -
port was the Eurosystem’s most important and 
comprehensive publicly available publication on 
the potential characteristics and design of a 
digital euro. The following section presents the 
key aspects of the explanations on the digital 
euro, as contained in the interview guideline, 
and derives hypotheses from each of them for 
the purpose of analysing the interviews.
Step 1: What it is
A digital euro was presented to the respond -
ents as a new form of central bank money as 
follows: 
“Generally speaking, central bank money is 
money that can only be created by the central 
bank. Central bank money nowadays com -
prises the cash in circulation and wholesale 
central bank deposits. Central bank money is 
considered to be fail- safe as a central bank can -
not default. This money is not the same as 
book money, which comprises all the sight de -
posits held with commercial banks. Deposits 
held with commercial banks up to €100,000 
per customer and bank are protected by the 
statutory deposit guarantee scheme. To date, 
households have only been able to access cash 
and book money, but not electronic central 
bank money. A digital euro would be an elec -
tronic form of central bank money and would 
complement the supply of cash, not replace it. 
However, a digital euro has so far only existed 
in the preliminary considerations and technical 
experiments of the Eurosystem. The European 
Central Bank, the Bundesbank and the other 
national central banks in the euro area are con -sidering whether to introduce a digital euro, 
which could potentially be used by both indi -
viduals and firms across the euro area. A digital 
euro would be protected and regulated by the 
central bank and would also be fail- safe.”
Based on the definition of a digital euro pre -
sented to the respondents, it can be assumed 
that the intended use of the digital euro will 
determine how far consumers see its attribute 
as central bank money and thus as fail- safe as 
beneficial. In all likelihood, the fail- safe feature 
will probably play a fairly minor role when it Presentation of

comes to selecting a means of payment. In 
stable financial systems and in consideration of 
the statutory deposit guarantee scheme, a fail- 
safe form of money should not have any visible 
benefit over book money for consumers. This 
feature is likely to be viewed as more attractive 
in the context of storing value during times of 
crisis. Indeed, being fail- safe is a feature that 
clearly sets cash apart, particularly in times of 
crisis when people are looking for a safe and 
reliable form of money.
Step 2: What it can be used for
After the general definition and key features of 
a digital euro were outlined, its potential uses 
were explained in more detail:
“A digital euro would offer broader potential 
for additional services than cash.27 For instance, 
a digital euro could be used in situations where 
people do not wish to, or are unable to, pay 
with cash. It would also provide an alternative 
to other cashless payment instruments at the 
point of sale, in e- commerce as well as be -
tween individuals. At the same time, a digital 
euro would establish a basis for the digital 
economy of the future. It could also potentially 
be conferred legal tender status.28 In practice, 
this might mean that a digital euro would be 
usable in any place and under all conditions.”
Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in 
the euro area. Furthermore, since people in the 
euro area prefer to pay smaller amounts in 
cash, it is vital for the payment system that 
cash is universally accepted as legal tender, not 
least because it enables people without access 
to electronic payment instruments to partici -
pate in economic life. Retailers and other busi -
nesses are not allowed to refuse cash pay -
ments, except where both parties have agreed 
beforehand to use a different means of pay -
ment. If a digital euro were legal tender as 
well, consumers would likely consider its wide -
spread usability as a particular benefit.Step 3: How it can be  obtained
In a third step, the respondents were presented 
with different ways of obtaining digital euro:
“One conceivable way of obtaining digital euro 
would be to exchange book money via a bank 
account; another would be to load and unload 
digital euro, for example in exchange for cash 
at physical loading devices29” (the end- user ac -
cess and usability solutions offered by a digital 
euro are also visualised in the chart on p. 77).
Based on the ways of obtaining digital euro 
presented to the respondents, it can be as -
sumed that the convenience of each way of 
obtaining the digital euro will determine how 
far consumers consider it to be beneficial. Thus, 
obtaining digital euro via a physical loading de -
vice could be considered less attractive if the 
physical loading device infrastructure were not 
satisfactorily expanded, if long distances had to 
be travelled to reach devices, or if frequent 
trips to loading devices were required because 
of limits on the amount of digital euro that can 
be held. By contrast, obtaining digital euro via 
a bank account – a way which is perceived as 
easy and convenient – could favour the use of 
digital euro.
Step 4: How it can be used
Respondents were presented with two possible 
ways of using a digital euro that could also be 
combined:Consideration:

27 The article does not examine the use of a wholesale 
variant of the digital euro. In a wholesale variant of the 
digital euro, the central bank would issue a digital euro 
only to a limited set of users, ideally to commercial banks. 
Furthermore, this article does not specify a potential use 
case of a digital euro for programmable payments. These 
are payments where the timing, amount and/ or type of 
transfer are determined by pre- specified conditions rather 
than ad hoc during the payment process. Programmable 
payments include, for instance, machine- to- machine pay -
ments where devices (on behalf of their owners) automat -
ically settle and pay for services with each other.

“First, they could be transferred using a web-  
based service (possibly involving an app). In this 
case, a broad range of devices could be used, 
such as computers, smartphones or smart 
watches. A digital euro could also be trans -
ferred between devices over long distances. 
Second, they could be transferred directly from 
one physical device to another. To do this, the 
payer and payee would need to have specific 
compatible physical devices which can store 
digital euro. One such device could be a smart -
card that is used at the point of sale or held up 
to a smartphone to transfer money. The de -
vices could be paired contactlessly for the 
transfer, which would mean that a payment 
could also be initiated without an internet con -
nection.”
Both ways of using the digital euro presented 
in the interviews are particularly similar to the 
ways cashless payment instruments are used. 
Respondents could associate using digital euro 
via an app with using mobile payment methods, while using digital euro stored on a smartcard 
closely resembles traditional card payments. By 
its very definition, digital euro cannot recreate 
the touch and feel of physical cash, however. 
Another key feature of cash is that it can be 
used to make offline payments. This character -
istic could be replicated by a digital euro if 
device- to- device transfers were made pos -
sible.30
Step 5: How it can be stored
Respondents were presented with two ap -
proaches for storing and transferring a digital 
euro: 
“A centralised approach would see digital euro 
being recorded in the central bank’s ledger. 
Transfers between accounts would always be 
made via the central bank. However, payments Consideration:

could be initiated via a commercial bank’s app 
or that of another supervised intermediary, for 
example. A decentralised approach could in -
volve digital euro being recorded directly on a 
physical device, for instance on a payment 
card, mobile phone or other smart device. The 
central bank or commercial banks, or suitably 
authorised service providers, would not be in -
volved in the verification of every single pay -
ment. A combination of the centralised and de -
centralised approach would also be generally 
possible.”
In the final application of a digital euro, con -
sumers will probably barely notice whether a 
digital euro is based on centralised or decen -
tralised infrastructure, to begin with. Even so, 
there are differences between the two ap -
proaches that could have a bearing on how 
consumers see a digital euro. Transactions 
using traditional cashless payment instruments, 
such as credit transfers, currently take place 
centrally and therefore require the involvement 
of intermediaries. A functioning payment sys -
tem requires a certain degree of trust in inter -
mediaries; however, intermediaries can also be 
a source of uncertainty.31 By contrast, transac -
tions in decentralised infrastructures are settled 
without the involvement of third parties. For 
people who have little trust in the existing pay -
ment service providers, then, a digital euro de -
signed as a decentralised means of payment 
will probably constitute an attractive alternative 
to the traditional cashless payment instru -
ments. At the same time, a decentralised digital 
euro could more closely resemble cash than a 
centralised variant in terms of its properties, as 
cash can also be transferred without intermedi -
ary involvement. But even where it is stored 
centrally, a digital euro would probably offer 
consumers some advantages over cashless pay -
ment instruments because the central bank 
would be the intermediary, not a private pay -
ment service provider.Additional features
To conclude the interviews, additional key fea -
tures of a digital euro were discussed with re -
spondents:
“Differing degrees of anonymity would be con -
ceivable when using a digital euro. However, in 
order to effectively prevent misuse for criminal 
purposes, such as money laundering and ter -
rorism financing, complete anonymity is prob -
ably unlikely.32 It is nevertheless conceivable 
that device- to- device transfers up to a certain 
amount would not be traceable. Data protec -
tion when using a digital euro should be in line 
with the current standards and guaranteed 
using state- of- the- art technological resources. 
It thus already looks like a digital euro could 
offer a greater degree of privacy than some 
cashless payment methods, but not as much as 
cash.
A digital euro should be easily accessible for 
everyone – including individuals who currently 
do not participate in the financial system – in 
order to ensure it can be used by the greatest 
possible number of households. The use of a 
digital euro would generally be free of charge 
for individuals. Ideally, it would only take a few 
seconds for the payee to be credited with 
digital euro on an account or physical device.”
Lastly, respondents were asked for their views 
on the holding limit for a digital euro under de -
bate in the Eurosystem (e.g. €3,000),33 but 
were not given details about the background 
behind the limit. The idea behind a holding 
limit of this kind is to mainly limit a digital euro 
to its function as a means of payment and to 
make it unattractive as a form of investment. 
Cash and book money should therefore remain 
in demand as a store of value.Consideration:

Results of the qualitative 
 survey on the digital euro
Significance of the central 
bank money feature
The fact that the digital euro would be a form 
of central bank money and therefore a fail- safe 
means of payment appears not to be a key ad -
vantage over the traditional payment instru -
ments for the majority of participants in the 
qualitative study. The vast majority of respond -
ents are unfamiliar with the term “central bank 
money”. Study participants also reported that 
the central bank money feature has hardly any 
practical relevance in daily life. This feature is 
barely given any consideration when choosing 
a means of payment and therefore also does 
not influence payment behaviour. Furthermore, 
most respondents said it was new and surpris -
ing to learn that cash is the only way for indi -
viduals to access central bank money.
Unlike book money, central bank money is, by 
definition, a fail- safe form of money. However, 
the interviews revealed that, for most respond -
ents, the fail- safe feature of the digital euro 
plays only a minor role in daily life. How much 
importance respondents attached to the fail-  
safe feature varies in particular according to 
their current wealth level. Some respondents 
perceived book money to be just as fail- safe as 
central bank money as long as the value of 
existing investments remains below the amount 
of €100,000 protected under the statutory de -
posit protection scheme. Overall, the fail- safe 
feature of a digital euro presented is therefore 
no more than an abstract advantage for study 
participants.
Attitude towards digitalisation
Participants’ attitude towards a digital euro is 
largely shaped by their view of digitalisation in 
general. Respondents are generally more open 
to a digital euro if they think digitalisation will 
deliver more advantages and opportunities than disadvantages and risks in the future. In 
particular, people with an optimistic and hope -
ful outlook on the future functionalities and 
capabilities of digitalisation tend to have a 
greater affinity towards the digital euro. For 
these respondents, a digital euro is an essential 
and innate part of a digitalised society, with 
some even viewing it as a necessary and, in 
part, overdue step towards a digital future.
By contrast, the qualitative investigation found 
that respondents with pessimistic or sceptical 
views on digitalisation tend to reject a digital 
euro. Some respondents also said they fear a 
loss of control. For them, transactions with a 
digital euro would be far too transparent, in -
creasing their concerns that more details about 
their lives will be laid bare. Respondents who 
see digitalisation more as a source of draw -
backs and risks than benefits and opportunities 
in the future are sceptical about a digital euro; 
moreover, they also suspect hidden pitfalls, 
such as surveillance, loss of control over their 
personal data, restrictions in use or other draw -
backs. Another concern some study partici -
pants mentioned in this regard is that they 
might lose track of their finances if they have a 
second account for everyday transactions, in 
particular if they are using three forms of 
money in parallel – a digital euro, cash and 
book money.
Current payment behaviour 
and behaviour routines
Respondents’ previous behaviour generally has 
a bearing on their attitudes towards using tech -
nological innovations, and the payments land -
scape is proving to be no exception. The inter -
views conducted with the participants reveal 
that their previous payment behaviour has an 
impact on their attitudes towards the digital 
euro.

methods have a more positive and open atti -Central bank

tude towards a digital euro. Having an affinity 
with digital payment instruments, then, makes 
it easier to approach a digital euro. Some re -
spondents see key parallels between the vari -
ous ways of using a digital euro, such as with a 
smartcard or online with a PC, laptop or smart -
phone, and the use of traditional payment in -
struments. This means the respondents would 
need no additional knowledge to use a digital 
euro. Clearly, the more experienced study par -
ticipants are in using cashless payment 
methods, the more open they are to using a 
digital euro. Furthermore, previous experience 
with mobile payments, familiarity with the use 
of e- payment schemes and a basic understand -
ing of crypto tokens increase respondents’ will -
ingness to use a digital euro to a particularly 
strong extent. Another interesting observation 
is that especially committed users of cashless 
payment instruments see little appeal in the 
possibility of using a digital euro with a smart -
card. This group of respondents already ap -
pears to consider the use of traditional pay -
ment cards (as used nowadays for payments 
with commercial bank deposits) outdated – un -
like the use of mobile devices, which they see 
as becoming increasingly important.
For committed cash users – that is, respond -
ents who mainly use cash to pay – the step to -
wards using a digital euro is clearly a larger 
one. Study participants who use cash more 
than cashless payment methods are more con -
cerned and uncertain about the prospect of an -
other cashless form of money. Specifically, 
some of them said they do not trust the tech -
nical functionality and expressed fears about 
security risks and misuse of data. There were 
also some who stressed that their existing pay -
ment routine is working fine at the moment, 
which was why they do not feel any direct psy -
chological pressure that might motivate them 
to switch to using a new form of money. Com -
mitted cash users, furthermore, display deeply 
entrenched behaviour routines which are not 
expected to change much.Individuals who to this day still pay for everyday 
purchases almost exclusively in cash are a long 
way from using a digital euro. They do not see 
it as an alternative to cash, nor do they regard 
the use of a smartcard as a replacement for the 
touch and feel of physical banknotes and coins. 
Users of cashless payment instruments, on the 
other hand, see the website- or app- based use 
of a digital euro in particular as a further refine -
ment of mobile payments. The results of the in -
vestigation therefore suggest that a digital euro 
would not be a close substitute for cash from 
the consumer perspective.
Assessment of other digital 
euro features
According to the respondents, the most im -
portant characteristics of a digital euro include 
free and simple use, privacy, security with re -
gard to data protection and universal usability. 
The representative online survey makes the 
same findings (see the box on pp. 71ff.). These 
requirements relate to both how transactions 
are carried out with a digital euro and the man -
ner in which users obtain digital euro.
The majority of respondents in the qualitative 
study expect a digital euro to meet much the 
same security requirements as those already 
placed on traditional cashless payment instru -
ments. These notably include avoiding possible 
incorrect bookings and the loss or misuse of 
the payment medium and thus of transaction 
data. Most of the respondents made a point of 
saying that they do not want full anonymity, 
however. On the contrary, some stressed that 
the central bank, in its capacity as a trusted 
intermediary, should indeed be allowed to in -
spect transactions in the event of an unex -
pected incident (e.g. incorrect credit transfer or 
fraud). In addition, multiple respondents em -
phasised that the central bank presumably pur -
sues different interests than private payment 
service providers. For many respondents, then,

vent private sector players from using personal 
data for commercial purposes.
The vast majority of respondents furthermore 
expect a digital euro to be easily accessible and 
universal. Opinions differ as to which of the 
ways to use a digital euro discussed above, be 
it in the form of a smartcard or a smartphone 
app, will guarantee easy access. Experienced 
users of cashless payment instruments in par -
ticular reported that using a digital euro via a 
website or app, as described above, and with 
the possible end- user devices would be con -
venient. The surveyed cash users, on the other 
hand, felt that the smartcard would offer the 
best potential for use. Although a smartcard is 
not directly associated with cash in spite of its 
physical form, respondents see it as a lower 
hurdle than using a website or app.
Respondents also expect to be able to use a 
digital euro in as many situations as possible. 
Many study respondents see the greatest po -
tential in the context of e-commerce, where 
there have often been calls for a payment op -
tion which allows control over personal data to 
be maintained in order to prevent private pro -
viders having access to user data for commer -
cial purposes. Only a small number of respond -
ents find that the possibility of being able to 
use a digital euro also for payments to private 
persons or in situations where cash is typically 
used (e.g. weekly market) has an edge over 
existing payment methods.
The possibility of using a digital euro without 
an active internet connection is viewed posi -
tively by the majority of respondents. However, 
it is clear that respondents associate an offline 
functionality not with cash but with the exist -
ing cashless payment instruments. This is per -
ceived as a potential advantage particularly in 
situations in which respondents have already 
experienced internet connectivity issues in the 
past when settling a cashless payment. Even 
so, a number of respondents expressed con -
cerns about how far the offline use of a digital 
euro can be aligned with privacy consider -ations. As a result, most respondents view off-
line use of a digital euro as a welcome feature, 
but not one that is essential in the future.
Use as a store of value
Some respondents can indeed imagine con -
verting larger amounts of cash or bank de -
posits into digital euro. These credit balances of 
digital euro would be held either for precau -
tionary reasons or as a store of value or as re -
serves, eliminating the need to frequently con -
vert book money into digital euro. However, 
the holding limits for a digital euro currently 
being discussed would discourage most re -
spondents from using a digital euro in this way. 
For some respondents, a digital euro’s function 
as a means of payment is clearly its predomin -
ant feature, while the low or zero remuner -
ation it would probably offer makes it un -
attractive compared with other forms of invest -
ment.
However, some respondents also view the 
holding limit of €3,000 that is currently under 
discussion as a barrier to using a digital euro as 
a means of payment. Higher earners, in par -
ticular, say this amount is too low to cover their 
day- to- day spending. Keeping a mental ac -
count of transactions in commercial bank de -
posit accounts and central bank money ac -
counts, on the other hand, is described as com -
plicated and inconvenient. Only lower earners 
do not regard the potential €3,000 holding 
limit as a hindrance for shifting the amount 
they use for day- to- day transactions into digital 
euro.

driving and impeding acceptance of a digital 
euro. Overall, there are still many questions sur -
rounding the design of a digital euro. The stud -
ies carried out underscore how important it is 
to factor consumer opinion into future discus -
sions on the potential features of a digital euro.
The analysis of the potential features of a 
digital euro shows that some of the user re -
quirements for cash and pre- existing cashless 
payment instruments apply equally to a digital 
euro. The most important features of a digital 
euro include free and simple use, privacy, secur -
ity with regard to data protection and universal 
usability. A digital euro is recognised as offering 
great potential with regard to data protection 
in particular. Individuals place great trust in the 
central bank when it comes to their data being 
handled transparently and securely. Particularly 
in the context of e-commerce, the ability to 
avoid private payment service providers is re -
garded as a major feature of the digital euro. 
By contrast, the fact that a digital euro is cen -
tral bank money, and thus its key feature as a 
fail- safe means of payment, has little relevance 
for many people’s daily lives. Furthermore, peo -
ple’s existing payment behaviour, behaviour 
routines and general attitude towards digitali -
sation have a major bearing on preferences 
with regard to a digital euro. In particular, com -
mitted cash users tend to be more sceptical 
about the digital euro. A digital euro is unlikely 
to be able to offer the same level of privacy as 
cash, which is why fears of surveillance, exces -
sive data transparency and, more generally, 
data misuse are major drivers of the scepticism 
prevailing in this group.The interviewees see a digital euro more as a 
form of money that will complement cash than 
replace it outright. This reinforces the Eurosys -
tem’s intention to offer the digital euro along -
side and not instead of cash, should a decision 
be taken to launch it. A digital euro would be a 
new supplementary payment instrument with 
proprietary features, which would be offered 
alongside cash and traditional cashless pay -
ment instruments. Its usability would be more 
universal than physical currency, meaning that 
users would also be able to pay with central 
bank- issued money in a digital setting, counter -
balancing a growing reliance on private pay -
ment systems. From a user perspective, a digital 
euro could offer a useful complement to cash 
but could not replace it in this respect. Very 
much in keeping with this approach, the Euro -
system cash strategy34 adopted by the Govern -
ing Council of the European Central Bank aims 
to ensure that euro banknotes and coins will 
continue to be available and generally accepted 
as a means of payment and store of value in 
the future. Thus, for cash to be able to carry on 
performing its role in society, access to cash 
– be it via ATMs or from other sources – must 
be guaranteed and cash must remain widely 
accepted and usable as a means of payment. 
The general public will then be free to choose 
between cash, cashless payment instruments 
and perhaps also a digital euro in the future.Summary of

The regulation of remuneration at credit 
institutions
Following the global financial crisis of 2007-08, the incentive systems at major financial institu -
tions were one of the areas to come under scrutiny from regulatory and supervisory authorities. 
The financial crisis highlighted how incentive systems that primarily reward short- term success 
and that focus exclusively on financial performance targets can result in risks for individual finan -
cial institutions as well as for the financial sector as a whole. However, if these systems are based 
on long- term performance metrics and take sufficient consideration of both risk exposure and 
non- financial performance, they can make an important contribution to the long- term success of 
a financial institution and thus bolster financial stability. Here, particular focus is placed on vari -
able remuneration, commonly referred to as bonuses.
This led to the development of dedicated remuneration requirements, which, since the end of 
2010, have applied not only to major credit institutions, but to all credit institutions in the Euro -
pean Union (EU). In Germany, these form the basis of a comprehensive and detailed ruleset com -
prising directly applicable European regulations as well as national provisions enshrined in the 
German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz) and the Regulation on the Supervisory Requirements for 
Institutions’ Remuneration Systems (Remuneration Regulation for Institutions – Institutsvergü -
tungsverordnung).
In essence, these requirements ensure that credit institutions’ risk management must include 
remuneration systems that are appropriate, transparent and oriented towards the institution’s 
sustainable economic development. More specifically, a distinction is made between require -
ments that apply to all members of staff and those that apply only to key decision- makers, or 
“risk takers”. Furthermore, for reasons of proportionality, there are also differences depending on 
whether or not the institution is a significant institution within the meaning of the Banking Act. 
Larger and more complex, and thus more systemically important, credit institutions are subject to 
more stringent regulatory and supervisory requirements with regard to their risk management 
and therefore also their remuneration systems. In this regard, the requirements comprise both 
material and procedural aspects.
Experience from supervisory practice shows that banks and savings banks have made significant 
progress in ensuring that their remuneration systems are appropriately designed and, in particu -
lar, have integrated their remuneration systems more closely with the other areas of their risk 
management. To ensure success over the long term, the rules contained in their remuneration 
policies must be applied consistently by the decision- makers at each credit institution. For this to 
be the case, changes to the European framework must only be made if they serve a supervisory 
purpose. This aims to help increase acceptance of the applicable rules among credit institutions 
and their staff, thus reducing the risk of these being circumvented. In this regard, following the 
principle of proportional regulation, it is important that smaller credit institutions with less com -
plex business models are exempted from the remuneration regulations to reduce their administra -
tive burdens as far as this is acceptable from a supervisory perspective.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The remuneration of staff at credit institutions 
is subject to comprehensive prudential regula -
tion, which largely dates back to an inter -
national initiative by the Financial Stability 
Forum (FSF, now the Financial Stability Board 
(FSB)) following the global financial crisis of 
2007-08. International regulatory and supervis -
ory authorities assessed the systems of financial 
incentives at major enterprises in the financial 
sector and ascertained that inappropriate re -
muneration systems led to undesirable risk-  
taking and thus contributed to instability in in -
dividual enterprises as well as the financial sys -
tem as a whole. This project resulted in the de -
velopment of the FSF Principles for Sound 
Compensation Practices, which were expanded 
the following year to include additional stand -
ards by the FSB.1 As they were approved for 
adoption in the respective jurisdictions of the 
G20 countries in April and September 2009, 
these FSB Principles and Standards (FSB P&S) 
represent a key milestone in the regulation of 
remuneration in the global financial sector. The 
FSB P&S focus on variable remuneration – i.e. 
bonuses – paid to what are known as “mater -
ial risk takers” at major enterprises in the finan -
cial sector. They are aimed not only at major 
banks, but also systemically important insur -
ance and investment companies. Risk takers 
are not limited just to members of manage -
ment, supervisory and administrative boards, 
but also include any staff members that have a 
material impact on the risk profile of their re -
spective enterprise.
The purpose of regulating remuneration is not 
to prohibit variable remuneration or to make 
variable remuneration unattractive. Offering 
variable remuneration can indeed have bene -
fits. Specifically, provided that the institution’s 
sustainable2 interests are taken into account 
and that inappropriate risk- taking is not incen -
tivised, variable remuneration can contribute to 
the good performance and sound develop -
ment of an institution by setting suitable incen -
tives whereby employees and decision- makers participate in both the success and failure of 
the business. At the same time, variable remu -
neration allows for cost flexibility and provides 
institutions the option of sanctioning undesir -
able behaviour, which helps to promote a sus -
tainable corporate culture.
While the core principles of the FSB P&S con -
tinue to apply today, international remuner -
ation regulation has evolved continually over 
the past 12 years, including in the EU and Ger -
many. In the EU, the Capital Requirements Dir -
ective (CRD)3 stipulates that credit institutions 
must have appropriate remuneration policies 
and practices.4 This general requirement is 
complemented by dedicated provisions regard -
ing the remuneration of persons with a mater -
ial impact on the risk profile of the institution, 
i.e. risk takers.5 In Germany, these requirements 
are implemented via the Banking Act ( Kredit -
wesengesetz ) and the Regulation on the Super -
visory Requirements for Institutions’ Remuner -
ation Systems (Remuneration Regulation for In -
stitutions – Institutsvergütungsverordnung ). 
After some of the CRD remuneration require -
ments were amended as part of the European 
banking package6 in the summer of 2017, the 
remuneration- specific provisions in the Banking 
Act were changed accordingly at the end of 
2020,7 and the Remuneration Regulation for 
Institutions was updated only recently.8 These 
provisions are complemented by disclosure re -Inappropriate

2 Within the context of remuneration regulation, the term 
“sustainability” was added to the Banking Act as early as 
2010. It was understood as referring to remuneration sys -
tems that are viable or demonstrably sound over the long 
term. Although this also covered non- financial aspects such 
as good conduct from the very beginning, the focus was 
by and large on long- term performance. In recent years, 
“sustainability” has been viewed more from an environ -
ment, social and governance (ESG) perspective; these as -
pects are now also being increasingly incorporated into re -
muneration systems.

quirements in the European Capital Require -
ments Regulation (CRR).9 As is the case for two 
remuneration- related regulations from the 
European Commission,10 the CRR applies to 
credit institutions directly and therefore does 
not need to be transposed into German law.11
Basic principles of regulating 
remuneration at credit 
institutions 
The most important basic principle of regulat -
ing remuneration at credit institutions in Ger -
many is found in Section 25a of the Banking 
Act, which stipulates that banks and savings 
banks must ensure, as part of proper business 
organisation, that they have appropriate and 
effective risk management that comprises, 
amongst other things, appropriate and trans -
parent remuneration systems for both manage -
ment board members and staff geared to the 
institution’s sustainable development.12 This 
core regulation is complemented by further 
provisions in the Banking Act and, in particular, 
in the Remuneration Regulation for Institutions. 
Here – in line with the notion of proportional 
regulation  – a distinction is drawn between 
general requirements that fundamentally apply 
to all institutions13 and their staff and members 
of their management boards, and special re -
quirements that only apply to larger institutions 
(known as “significant institutions”14) and their 
risk takers.15
The general requirements set out in the Bank -
ing Act include a restriction on variable remu -
neration, known as the bonus cap.16 This pro -
hibits banks and savings banks from paying 
their staff or members of their management 
boards variable remuneration totalling more 
than 100% of their fixed remuneration each 
year. Variable remuneration may total up to 
200% of fixed remuneration only with the ap -
proval of the shareholders and only if it is com -
patible with the requirement to maintain cap -
ital adequacy. This infringement on the free -
dom of contract is an EU- specific regulation for credit institutions and has been in effect since 
2014. Exemptions and/ or special calculation 
methods are only permissible in specific cases.17 
In the German implementation of the require -
ments, the bonus cap and the general require -
ments of the Remuneration Regulation for In -
stitutions apply to all of a credit institution’s 
staff members, even though most of the CRD 
remuneration requirements are directed only 
towards risk takers. However, in its guidelines 
on sound remuneration policies, the European 
Banking Authority (EBA)18 recommends that 
bonus caps should be applied to all members 
of staff.19
While a maximum ratio of 200% may seem 
high at first glance, the European bonus cap Remuneration

25  March 2021 and Commission Delegated Regulation 
(EU) No 527/ 2014 of 12 March 2014.
11 In addition, further requirements are set out, for ex -
ample, in Directive 2004/ 39/ EC of the European Parliament 
and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial 
instruments (MiFID) and also in generally applicable legisla -
tion such as labour law. These are not discussed here.
12 Section 25a(1) sentence 3 number 6 of the Banking Act.
13 Beyond credit institutions, financial services institutions 
are also considered “institutions” within the meaning of 
the Banking Act and the Remuneration Regulation for Insti -
tutions. However, some financial services institutions are 
partially or fully exempted from the remuneration require -
ments. Leasing and factoring enterprises, for example, are 
exempted by Section 2(7a) of the Banking Act and Section 
1(1) sentence 2 of the Remuneration Regulation for Institu -
tions.
14 An institution qualifies as significant, inter alia, if its total 
assets average at least €15 billion over the last four finan -
cial years (see Deutsche Bundesbank (2020), p. 52).
15 Deviating from this basic principle, the Third Regulation 
amending the Remuneration Regulation for Institutions 
amended Section 1(3) of the Remuneration Regulation for 
Institutions so that certain non- significant institutions are 
also subject to some of the special requirements pursuant 
to the Remuneration Regulation for Institutions.
16 Section 25a(5) of the Banking Act.
17 For example, certain severance payments are exempted 
by Section 5(6) sentence 5 of the Remuneration Regulation 
for Institutions, and sign- on bonuses and similar payments 
are exempted by Section 5(5) sentence 3 of the Remuner -
ation Regulation for Institutions. In the case of multi- year 
retention bonuses, institutions can choose how to take ac -
count of these payments with regard to the bonus cap 
(Section 5(7) sentence 3 of the Remuneration Regulation 
for Institutions).

for banks in fact represents a significant in -
fringement on their remuneration practices 
when compared with other financial services 
sectors and other jurisdictions. For example, 
much higher ratios of variable to fixed remu -
neration can typically be seen in the area of 
asset management, in particular. Among the 
banks inspected by European supervisors on 
behalf of the EBA, this business area had the 
highest ratio of variable to fixed remuneration 
at more than 300% on average of all banks.20 
For subordinated investment management 
companies, the only remuneration require -
ments that apply are those from the sector-  
specific Directives,21,22 which do not contain 
any requirements equivalent to the bonus cap.
Due to the special oversight functions of ad -
ministrative and supervisory boards, the Bank -
ing Act has completely forbidden variable com -
ponents of remuneration for members of these 
boards since the end of 2016.23 Even before 
that time, the remuneration of board members 
was not allowed to cause any conflicts of inter -
est with respect to their oversight functions. 
Furthermore, as members of administrative and 
supervisory boards are considered risk takers, 
they are subject to disclosure and reporting re -
quirements. However, the Remuneration Regu -
lation for Institutions is not applicable to these 
persons. As most of the provisions in that regu -
lation relate to variable remuneration, there 
would be almost no scope for application in 
any case.
General requirements  
for the appropriate design 
of  remuneration systems 
in the Remuneration 
 Regulation for Institutions
The general requirements of the Remuneration 
Regulation for Institutions contain a compre -
hensive list of definitions. This is intended to 
help ensure clarity and legal certainty, and thus 
also reduce the risk that the rules will be cir -cumvented. First, the Remuneration Regulation 
for Institutions sets out which payments and 
benefits must be considered remuneration and 
are thus subject to its provisions.24 Remuner -
ation within the meaning of the Remuneration 
Regulation for Institutions is not only the salary 
paid out via payroll accounting, but also in -
cludes all financial and non- financial benefits 
received by a staff member or member of the 
management board in respect of their profes -
sional activities for the institution. This means 
that, fundamentally, all ancillary benefits – such 
as benefits in kind, including the use of a com -
pany car or pension benefits – also fall under 
the definition of remuneration.25 This also ap -
plies if the benefits are provided by a third 
party. In this context, all components of remu -
neration must be allocated to either fixed or 
variable remuneration; in cases of doubt, remu -
neration components must be allocated to vari -
able remuneration.26 Any remuneration estab -
lished in a collective agreement or on the basis 
of a collective agreement is exempt from the 
requirements of the Remuneration Regulation 
for Institutions. Only the disclosure require -
ments apply in these cases.27Prohibition of 
variable remu -
neration for 
members of 
administrative 
and supervisory 
boards
“Remuneration” 
is not only salar -
ies, but all bene -
fits received by 
staff in respect 
of their profes -
sional activities20 See European Banking Authority (2021a).
21 These are Council Directive 85/ 611/ EEC of 20 December 
1985 on the coordination of laws, regulations and admin -
istrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective in -
vestment in transferable securities (UCITS Directive) and 
Directive 2011/  61/ EU of the European Parliament and of 
the Council of 8 June 2011 on Alternative Investment Fund 
Managers and amending Directives 2003/ 41/ EC and 2009/ 
65/ EC and Regulations (EC) No  1060/ 2009 and (EU) 
No 1095/ 2010 (AIFM Directive).
22 Since 2019, a corresponding explicit exemption has 
been included in Article 109(4) of Directive 2013/ 36/ EU. In -
dividual Member States – including Germany – had already 
provided for equivalent exemptions for subordinated in -
vestment management companies.

Risk takers
Unlike the Financial Stability Board (FSB),1 
whose principles and standards provide no 
more than general guidance on identifying 
what it calls “material risk takers”, the Euro-
pean Union has had uniform provisions for 
the identifi  cation of these individuals in 
place since 2014. The European Commis-
sion has issued a Delegated Regulation to 
supplement the provisions set out in the 
Capital Requirements Directive (CRD).2 This 
Commission Delegated Regulation formu-
lates quantitative and qualitative criteria be-
yond those of the CRD that institutions 
should apply when identifying risk takers – 
that is, “categories of staff whose profes-
sional activities have an impact on the insti-
tution’s risk profi  le”.3
In German law, the rules governing the 
identifi  cation of risk takers have been im-plemented in Section 25a(5b) in conjunc-
tion with Section 1(21) of the Banking Act 
(Kreditwesengesetz), taking into account 
considerations of proportionality. According 
to these provisions, only signifi  cant institu-
tions within the meaning of Section 1(3c) of 
the Banking Act4 are required to perform a 
complete identifi  cation of risk takers and 
thus apply the criteria laid down in Commis-
1 See Financial Stability Board (2009a, 2009b).
2 See Directive 2013/ 36/ EU.
3 The CRD does not use the term “risk taker”, describ-
ing these individuals instead as “categories of staff 
whose professional activities have a material impact on 
the institution’s risk profi  le” (see Article 92(1) of the 
CRD). In the German legal context, “risk taker” is re-
garded as an equivalent term for this group of individ-
uals, while the European Banking Authority (EBA) calls 
them “identifi  ed staff”.
4 An institution qualifi  es as signifi  cant, inter alia, if its 
total assets average at least €15 billion over the last 
four fi  nancial years (see Section 1(3c) of the Banking 
Act).
Criteria for identifying risk takers
1 Section 1(3d) of the Banking Act defines CRR credit institutions as all credit institutions within the meaning of Article 4(1) point (1) of 
the CRR. 2 These terms are defined in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/923.
Deutsche BundesbankAll CRR credit institutions1 and all significant non-CRR credit institutions pursuant to Section 1(3c) 
of the Banking Act are required to identify the following persons as risk takers:
All significant institutions pursuant to Section 1(3c) of the Banking Act are furthermore required to 
perform a complete identification of their risk takers: Section 1(21) 
of the Banking Act:
Section 25a(5b) sentence 1
of the Banking Act:
Section 25a(5b) sentence 2
of the Banking Act:– Members of the management board within the meaning of Section 1(2) of 
the Banking Act
– Members of the administrative or supervisory board within the meaning of Section 25d 
of the Banking Act
Additional own risk analysis to identify risk takers based at least 
on the criteria of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/923– Staff members immediately below management board level (senior managers)
– Staff members with managerial responsibility2 for the control functions2 or material 
business units2 of the institution
– Staff members with remuneration in the previous year of at least €500,000, provided:
a) said remuneration equals at least the average remuneration of the members of the 
management board and of the administrative or supervisory board as well as of the 
institution’s staff members immediately below management board level 
(senior managers), and; 
b) the staff members carry out professional activities in a material business unit and 
said activities have a material impact on the risk profile of that business unit2.+Deutsche Bundesbank

sion Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/ 923.5 
By contrast, all other institutions are only 
expected to apply the criteria set out in the 
CRD, as implemented in the Banking Act. In 
addition, they are required to apply only the 
defi  nitions contained in Commission Dele-
gated Regulation (EU) 2021/ 923. The identi-
fi  cation criteria set out in the Banking Act 
thus already capture all major decision- 
makers, including those at smaller institu-
tions. These individuals include not only the 
members of management boards and ad-
ministrative or supervisory boards, but also 
staff members immediately below manage-
ment board level (senior managers) as well 
as individuals with managerial responsibility 
for material business units and internal con-
trol functions, amongst others.
For the vast majority of non- signifi  cant 
credit institutions, the sole implication of 
identifying their risk takers is that they have 
to comply with the disclosure requirements 
set out under Article 450 of the Capital Re-
quirements Regulation (CRR).6 Only for the 
handful of non- signifi  cant credit institutions 
that fall within the scope of the new Sec-
tion 1(3) of the Remuneration Regulation 
for Institutions (Institutsvergütungsverord-
nung)7 are the consequences material in na-
ture. This proportionate implementation of 
the CRD requirements is appropriate, par-
ticularly since most of the remuneration re-
quirements in Germany, including the bonus 
cap, have to be applied explicitly to all staff 
members.
Articles 5 and 6 of Commission Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2021/ 923 formulate more 
extensive qualitative and quantitative cri-
teria that have to be applied by signifi  cant 
institutions under Section 1(3c) of the Bank-
ing Act to identify additional staff members 
as risk takers.While Article 5 is based on the staff mem-
bers’ responsibilities, Article 6 focuses on 
individuals awarded particularly high 
amounts of annual remuneration. For these 
latter individuals, institutions must again 
examine whether their professional activ-
ities have a signifi  cant impact on the risk 
profi  le of a material business unit. If this is 
not the case, the members of staff con-
cerned do not need to be identifi  ed as risk 
takers. For members of staff with annual re-
muneration above the threshold of 
€750,000, prior approval of the competent 
authority is required if the institution does 
not intend to identify these individuals as 
risk takers. For credit institutions with at 
least 1,000 staff members, this requirement 
also applies when the staff members in 
question earn less than €750,000 per year 
in absolute terms, but are within the 0.3% 
of staff members awarded the highest re-
muneration within the credit institution.

2021. The previous Commission Delegated Regulation

ingly.

Alongside the definition of remuneration, the 
definition of “staff members” is also key. The 
Remuneration Regulation for Institutions uses a 
broad definition of staff members.28 This means 
that staff members not only include persons 
directly employed by the credit institution, but 
also all natural persons the credit institution 
avails itself of in conducting banking business 
or providing financial services. This also covers 
intra- group secondments and outsourcing, for 
example. As a result, credit institutions must 
ensure in their outsourcing contracts that the 
external counterparties observe the prudential 
remuneration requirements. In practice, this re -
quirement sometimes makes it very challenging 
for banks and savings banks to find a suitable 
counterparty that is willing to accept such an 
obligation.
All banks and savings banks must ensure that 
their remuneration strategy and remuneration 
systems are aligned with their institution-  
specific business and risk strategies. Remuner -
ation systems also need to be geared towards 
the given credit institution’s corporate values 
and culture, including its risk culture, and be in 
line with its long- term interests. Amongst other 
things, this means that the remuneration par -
ameters29 have to support the achievement of 
strategic objectives. They also need to take in -
curred risks into account. Relying solely on 
metrics without appropriate risk adjustment for 
earnings, turnover figures or share values, for 
example, is not permitted.
Given this orientation towards institution-  
specific strategies, an “ideal” level of variable 
remuneration is not defined from a regulatory 
perspective. Rather, each credit institution is 
obliged to determine the maximum ratio be -
tween variable and fixed remuneration, i.e. the 
appropriate maximum level, for that institution 
specifically.30 This maximum level not only has 
to be in line with the aforementioned bonus 
cap pursuant to the Banking Act, it must also 
take account of the business activities and risks 
of the given credit institution or business area, 
and of the role of the given person and their in -fluence on the risk profile. This means that 
there may well be different maximum levels 
within a single credit institution.
In their remuneration practices, credit institu -
tions not only need to observe the previously 
defined maximum level, they also need to en -
sure that the amount of variable remuneration 
is determined on the basis of the previously de -
fined remuneration parameters. Furthermore, 
each credit institution must check how much 
of its “bonus pool”, i.e. the “total amount of 
variable remuneration within a financial year”, 
it can actually “afford”. While the FSB P&S and 
the CRD only contain rough guidelines on this, 
Section 7 of the Remuneration Regulation for 
Institutions stipulates various criteria that are to 
be checked when determining the bonus pool. 
First, the regulatory capital requirements must 
be adhered to. Second, the institution must 
also adopt a broadened economic perspective 
that takes internal capital adequacy, the profit 
situation and multi-  year capital planning into 
consideration. Ultimately, adequate liquidity re -
sources need to be ensured.
One of the lessons learned from the 2007-08 
financial crisis was that variable remuneration 
did not always adequately respond to poor 
performance or conduct. Since the reform of 
the provisions governing remuneration, vari -
able remuneration has therefore had to be de -
signed to be completely flexible. This means 
that it must be possible to reduce the variable 
remuneration up to the point of cancelling it 
completely in order to respond to changes in 
the performance of staff members or members 
of the management board, the business unit 
and/ or the credit institution. This not only ap -
plies if the aforementioned review pursuant to Remuneration

tions.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

Section 7 of the Remuneration Regulation for 
Institutions is negative, but also in the case of 
misconduct on the part of staff members or 
members of the management board. For ex -
ample, unethical or non- compliant behaviour, 
in particular, must lead to a reduction in the 
variable remuneration, or to its complete can -
cellation, and this may not be otherwise offset 
through positive performance.31 In this respect, 
guaranteed variable remuneration is generally 
not permissible.
The Remuneration Regulation for Institutions 
contains special provisions for certain forms of 
variable remuneration. For instance, guaran -
teed bonus payments within the first year of 
employment are excluded from the aforemen -
tioned ban on guarantees.32 These payments 
are typically a form of variable remuneration 
granted to staff members or members of 
the  management board on top of their 
performance-related variable remuneration as 
a sign-on bonus, or the guarantee of a min -
imum amount of variable remuneration for the 
first months of employment, irrespective of 
whether the agreed performance goals are ac -
tually achieved. Furthermore, the Remuner -
ation Regulation for Institutions permits reten -
tion bonuses in exceptional cases.33 These are a 
form of variable remuneration paid to staff 
members or members of the management 
board for the purpose of tying them to the 
credit institution for a specific period of time. 
This is conditional on the credit institution 
being able to justify its legitimate interest in 
awarding the bonus and to demonstrate that it 
is in line with its business strategy. Moreover, 
the retention bonuses need to be affordable 
for the credit institution and they must not be 
a vehicle for offsetting any cancellation of the 
ordinarily envisaged variable remuneration. Fi -
nally, the Remuneration Regulation for Institu -
tions also creates a framework for severance 
payments.34 Within the meaning of the Remu -
neration Regulation for Institutions, this refers 
to all remuneration payments that staff mem -
bers or members of the management board re -
ceive in connection with the early termination of the employment, agency or service contract. 
Credit institutions must therefore ensure, inter 
alia, that principles for severance payments are 
established that set out either a maximum 
amount or criteria for determining severance 
amounts, and that internal processes govern -
ing severance payments are put in place. Ultim -
ately, certain severance payments can be 
deemed appropriate a priori, meaning that 
they do not have to be counted towards the 
bonus cap and that other requirements under 
the Remuneration Regulation for Institutions 
can be waived. All other severance payments 
must be notified to the supervisory authority in 
advance, stating the reasons for awarding the 
payment and the appropriateness of the 
amount in order to claim this privilege.
Requirements for the 
 remuneration of certain 
 categories of staff
In addition to other general provisions, the Re -
muneration Regulation for Institutions also sets 
out additional provisions, applicable to all 
banks and savings banks, for certain categories 
of staff. For staff in control units, stricter rules 
apply, for example, regarding the maximum 
amount of variable remuneration. Because of 
their particular oversight functions and to en -
sure their independence, most of their remu -
neration must fall under the fixed component. 
In its interpretation guide on the Remuneration 
Regulation for Institutions, the Federal Financial 
Supervisory Authority (BaFin) explains that the 
variable component should typically not exceed 
one- third and under no circumstances should it 
exceed 50% of the total remuneration of the 
staff member concerned.35 Furthermore, con -Requirements

flicts of interest are also to be avoided by en -
suring that the remuneration parameters of the 
control units are not synchronised with those 
of the units they control. This also applies to 
the member of the management board respon -
sible for risk management. Conflicts of interest 
are also to be avoided in the remuneration of 
sales staff. Their remuneration systems are to 
be designed in such a way that consumer rights 
and interests are taken into account. In particu -
lar, the use of solely quantitative remuneration 
parameters – such as those geared exclusively 
towards sales – is not permissible. The require -
ments for staff members providing advisory 
services in connection with consumer credit 
agreements relating to immovable property are 
stricter still. In these cases, remuneration may 
not be linked in any way to sales targets for 
these agreements. The same also applies to 
staff members that perform the creditworthi -
ness assessment for consumer credit agree -
ments relating to immovable property.36
Special provisions are in place not least for the 
remuneration of members of management 
boards at all banks and savings banks.37 Their 
variable remuneration must be based on a 
multi- year assessment. According to BaFin’s in -
terpretation guide on the Remuneration Regu -
lation for Institutions, this means that the vari -
able remuneration participates in negative de -
velopments for a period of at least three 
years.38 This can be enabled through ex ante or 
ex post arrangements. Furthermore, two prin -
ciples in the Remuneration Regulation for Insti -
tutions have been taken from stock corpor -
ation legislation and thus apply to all credit in -
stitutions regardless of their legal form. First, 
the total remuneration must be commensurate 
with the corresponding tasks and performance 
of the respective members of the management 
board and with the credit institution’s situation. 
Second, the total remuneration may not ex -
ceed typical remuneration without special justi -
fication. It remains to be seen whether and to 
what extent the practical application of these 
principles in the supervision of institutions will 
have a restrictive effect.Special requirements  
for the appropriate design 
of  remuneration systems 
in the Remuneration 
 Regulation for Institutions
Unlike the general requirements mentioned 
above, the special requirements of the Remu -
neration Regulation for Institutions are to be 
applied specifically to the risk takers of signifi -
cant credit institutions within the meaning of 
Section 1(3c) of the Banking Act, and in some 
cases to certain other credit institutions that 
are not significant. Among the material re -
quirements, the main focus is on the ex ante 
and ex post risk adjustment of variable remu -
neration.
Ex ante risk adjustment refers to the determin -
ation of the amount of variable remuneration. 
This means that the risk taker’s performance at 
the time of the determination, including all cur -
rent and future risks incurred, needs to be 
taken into account. The performance measure -
ment includes both the risk taker’s perform -
ance contribution and that of the respective 
business unit, as well as the overall perform -
ance of the institution or group. The perform -
ance contribution is to be measured using spe -
cific, previously agreed targets. The perform -
ance measurement is to be based on quantita -
tive as well as qualitative, and financial as well 
as non- financial remuneration parameters. In 
general terms, the remuneration parameters 
used at all three levels should, in particular, be 
consistent with the objective of long- term suc -
cess. Above all, these parameters should take 
into account incurred risks and their associated 
time horizons, as well as capital and liquidity 
costs. Ultimately, as outlined above, the risk 
taker’s conduct should also be factored in, as Ex ante risk

improper conduct must at least lead to a re -
duction in the variable remuneration paid.
A comprehensive performance measurement 
of this kind is only effective if it covers a suffi -
ciently long accrual period. For risk takers 
below the level of the management board, this 
period must be a minimum of one year, while 
for members of the management board, it 
must cover at least three years. The perform -
ance or risk adjustment of risk takers’ variable 
remuneration is not yet finalised after this 
period, however, as it is then followed by the 
ex post risk adjustment, subject to a waiver 
threshold depending on the variable remuner -
ation.
Once variable remuneration has been deter -
mined, the period of ex post risk adjustment 
begins. This is based on three components: de -
ferral of variable remuneration in conjunction 
with malus arrangements, payment in the form 
of instruments and a clawback mechanism to 
reclaim any variable remuneration already paid 
out.
Deferral primarily means that risk takers cannot 
claim a portion of the calculated variable remu -
neration immediately, but only after a deferral 
period. This period must last at least four or five 
years. The minimum proportion of variable re -
muneration to be deferred varies from 40% to 
60% depending on the category of risk taker 
and the amount of variable remuneration.39 
During the deferral period, this amount may be 
paid out in linear instalments at most. Backtest -
ing is to be conducted before an instalment is 
paid out. This means that credit institutions 
have to check whether the original perform -
ance measurement still holds. Furthermore, the 
payment of the instalment has to be compat -
ible with the credit institution’s current situ -
ation after reviewing the criteria under Section 
7 of the Remuneration Regulation for Institu -
tions. If one of these criteria have not been 
met, a malus is applied, which means that the 
deferred component is reduced (explicit risk ad -
justment).For each instalment that is paid out, at least 
half of it must be paid out as an instrument 
that reflects the credit institution’s long- term 
growth (implicit risk adjustment). The choice of 
instrument depends largely on the credit insti -
tution’s legal form. As such, they are frequently 
not “financial instruments” in the traditional 
sense. Although listed credit institutions can 
make the payment in the form of shares or 
share- linked instruments (such as phantom 
stocks40), other credit institutions usually 
choose contractual arrangements. These are 
contracts which set the criteria for measuring 
long- term equity value and thus the “instru -
ment”, usually depending on the development 
of certain financial and regulatory ratios. Com -
mon to all instruments is that they are to be 
subject to a vesting period of at least one year 
upon being paid out. Although no malus is ap -
plied during the vesting period, the instrument 
is subject to fluctuations in value – in both di -
rections – during this period.
Since 2017, these components have been sup -
plemented by a clawback mechanism.41 This 
means that, in certain cases, variable remuner -
ation already paid out must be recalled. This 
applies for a period of two years beyond the 
respective total deferral period of granted vari -Ex post risk

ments in the

ments, risk

failure 
39 Depending on the position, duties and activities of a risk 
taker as well as the amount of variable remuneration and 
the risks that a risk taker may establish, the minimum 
length of the deferral period increases to up to five years 
and the proportion of variable remuneration to be deferred 
rises to at least 60% (Section 20(1) sentence 2 of the Re -
muneration Regulation for Institutions). In the case of 
members of the management board and members of the 
next lower management level, at least 60% of variable re -
muneration must be spread over a deferral period of at 
least five years (Section 20(2) of the Remuneration Regula -
tion for Institutions). The institution also has to set a thresh -
old value for “high variable remuneration”, above which 
the proportion of variable remuneration to be deferred 
rises to at least 60% (Section 20(3) of the Remuneration 
Regulation for Institutions).
40 With phantom stocks, staff members or members of 
the management board do not receive real shares, but only 
fictitious ones. Their value is, however, geared to the ex -
change price of the underlying share, e.g. to its average 
price over a certain period prior to the variable remuner -
ation being granted.

Risk adjustment of variable remuneration for a risk taker
The below chart shows the payment regime 
for a risk taker who is not a member of the 
management board or of the next lower man-
agement level. In such cases, the minimum 
deferral period is four years and the minimum 
proportion of variable remuneration to be de-
ferred is 40%.
An example: The variable remuneration calcu-
lated for the year t0 is €100,000.
Payment regime:
1. Of the €100,000, the risk taker is paid a 
maximum of €30,000 in cash at time t0+x, 
the date the variable remuneration is cal-
culated.
2. A further €30,000 is paid out in instru-
ments in accordance with Section 20(5) 
of the German Remuneration Regulation 
for Institutions (Institutsvergütungsverord-
nung), with a retention period of at least 
one year.
3. The remaining sum of €40,000 must then 
be deferred over a period of at least four 
years.
4. Should a linear pro rata payment structure 
be used, the risk taker receives €10,000 after the fi  rst year, at time t1+x, so long as 
backtesting does not produce a malus. Of 
this amount, €5,000 is paid in cash and 
€5,000 is paid in the aforementioned in-
struments with a retention period of at 
least one year. This is repeated after two, 
three and four years.
5. For at least six years after the calculation 
of the variable remuneration at time  t0+x, 
the institution must check whether the ac-
tions of the risk taker meet the criteria in 
Section 18(5) sentence 3 Nos 1 and 2 of 
the Remuneration Regulation and, where 
relevant, undertake to reclaim the entire 
amount of variable remuneration – includ-
ing any amounts already paid out  – 
through clawback and malus arrange-
ments.
One possible alternative to the payment 
model described under point 4 is cliff vesting. 
In this model, the risk taker only receives the 
deferred variable remuneration once the en-
tire deferral period is over, after successful 
backtesting. Half of this sum must still be paid 
out in instruments with a one- year retention 
period. Of course, other payment models are 
permitted, as long as they fall somewhere be-
tween the linear pro rata and cliff vesting vari-
ants.

able remuneration.42 This clawback arrange -
ment is only legally envisaged in cases of ser -
ious misconduct or in cases where conduct has 
resulted in material regulatory sanctions, ma -
terial supervisory measures or considerable 
losses.43 Clawbacks are still considered to be 
one of the most controversial requirements as 
they are difficult to implement under labour 
law. That said, regulators and supervisors are 
convinced of their usefulness because they act 
as a deterrent. Moreover, malus and clawback 
requirements force credit institutions to de -
velop specific concepts of what constitutes un -
acceptable behaviour.
In terms of the impact that the ex ante and ex 
post risk adjustment has on risk management 
at credit institutions, it should be noted that 
the requirements are complex and place a con -
siderable administrative burden on credit insti -
tutions. In this regard, the restriction of these 
requirements to risk takers at significant institu -
tions pursuant to Section 1(3c) of the Banking 
Act takes into account the principle of propor -
tionality. Extending the application of these re -
quirements to all credit institutions would, on 
account of the associated administrative costs, 
lead to greater restructuring of remuneration 
systems in favour of fixed remuneration com -
ponents. Since ex post risk adjustment, in par -
ticular, entails high administrative costs and at 
the same time can probably only take effect 
above a certain amount, the Remuneration 
Regulation for Institutions provides an exemp -
tion threshold depending on the amount of 
variable remuneration.
Corporate governance 
 requirements
The material requirements outlined above are 
augmented by rules relating to governance. In 
line with general corporate governance prin -
ciples, the management board is responsible 
for remuneration systems for staff members, 
while the administrative or supervisory board is 
responsible for remuneration systems for mem -bers of the management board.44 The adminis -
trative or supervisory board also monitors the 
remuneration systems for staff members. In 
practice, this means that important decisions 
require the explicit support of the management 
board and administrative or supervisory board. 
These include not only radically redesigning a 
remuneration system, but also the annual deci -
sion on the bonus pool or the variable remu -
neration of senior managers directly below the 
management board level.
To ensure that remuneration systems are ap -
propriately linked up with the other areas of 
risk management at a credit institution, the in -
ternal control units and the human resources 
function must be involved in decision- making 
processes, within the scope of their duties. For 
example, the risk control function should play a 
supporting role in defining appropriate risk-  
based remuneration parameters and provide 
information relevant to this.
As outlined above, the material and also 
governance- related requirements increase in 
line with the size and complexity of credit insti -
tutions. The administrative or supervisory board 
of a significant institution pursuant to Section 
1(3c) of the Banking Act is required to appoint 
from among its members a remuneration con -
trol committee.45 This committee prepares de -
cisions of the administrative or supervisory 
board on the remuneration of members of the 
management board and monitors the appro -
priateness of remuneration systems for staff 
members and for the management board. The 
intention behind this is to enable these issues 
to be addressed more deeply and in more de -
tail than would normally be possible within the 
administrative or supervisory board. However,

Third Regulation amending the Remuneration Regulation 
for Institutions of 20 September 2021
The Third Regulation amending the Remuner-
ation Regulation for Institutions (Institutsver-
gütungsverordnung) of 20  September 2021 
served the primary purpose of implementing 
changes resulting from the amendment of the 
Capital Requirements Directive (CRD)1 in 2019.2 
The amendments to the Remuneration Regu-
lation for Institutions supplement the amend-
ments to the Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz) 
that entered into force at the end of 2020.
These amendments largely concern the follow-
ing matters:
– extending some of the special requirements 
regarding risk adjustment pursuant to Section 
1(3) of the Remuneration Regulation for Insti-
tutions to cover those CRR institutions3 that 
do not qualify as signifi  cant institutions under 
Section 1(3c) of the Banking Act but none-
theless fulfi  l certain secondary conditions;4
– introducing the requirement to operate gen-
der neutral remuneration policies and prac-
tices for staff members and members of the 
management board in Section 5(1) number 6 
of the Remuneration Regulation for Institu-
tions – the corresponding arrangement for 
members of the supervisory or administrative 
board is governed by Section 25d(5) sentence 
3 of the Banking Act;
– adjusting the disclosure requirements in Sec-
tion 16(2) of the Remuneration Regulation for 
Institutions for institutions that do not qualify 
as signifi  cant institutions under Section 1(3c) 
of the Banking Act, in particular the abolition 
of additional disclosure requirements for un-
listed small and non- complex institutions;
– adjusting the threshold stated in Section 
18(1) of the Remuneration Regulation for In-
stitutions such that the annual variable remu-
neration of a risk taker is not only not permit-
ted to exceed the threshold of €50,000, but 
also does not represent more than one- third 
of the staff member’s total annual remuner-
ation so as to remain exempt from the re-
quirements of Sections 20 and 22 of the Re-
muneration Regulation for Institutions;– extending the minimum length of the defer-
ral period from three years to four years in 
Section 20(1) of the Remuneration Regulation 
for Institutions;
– adjusting the group- wide remuneration rules 
in Section 27 of the Remuneration Regulation 
for Institutions, in particular as regards the 
predominant non- inclusion of subordinated 
undertakings that are subject to sectoral re-
muneration rules (e.g. investment manage-
ment companies and investment institutions).
In amending the Remuneration Regulation for 
Institutions, BaFin – in its capacity as the author-
ity issuing this regulation – made full use of the 
available discretionary scope under the CRD to 
make allowances for the special features of the 
German banking market and proportionality 
considerations.
Besides being amended to implement the CRD, 
the Remuneration Regulation for Institutions 
was also adjusted to modify the duties of remu-
neration offi   cers in Section 24 of the Regulation. 
Furthermore, Section 1(1) sentence 2 of the Re-
muneration Regulation for Institutions exempts 
leasing and factoring undertakings from the re-
quirement to apply the Remuneration Regu-
lation for Institutions.
1 See Directive 2013/ 36/ EU.
2 See Directive (EU) 2019/ 878 amending Directive 
2013/ 36/ EU.
3 The Remuneration Regulation for Institutions con-
tinues to use the term “CRR institutions” to refer to 
those entities that qualify as institutions as defi  ned in 
Regulation (EU) No  575/ 2013 (Capital Requirements 
Regulation – CRR). With “CRR investment fi  rms” now 
no longer falling within the scope of the Banking Act, 
the amendment of the Banking Act of 26 June 2021 
replaced this term with “CRR credit institution” (see 
the Act implementing Directive (EU) 2019/ 2034 on the 
prudential supervision of investment institutions of 
12 May 2021 – Gesetz zur Beaufsichtigung von Wert-
papierinstituten, WpIG). This necessitated an amend-
ment to Section 1(3) of the Remuneration Regulation 
for Institutions, which BaFin put out for public consult-
ation in a draft umbrella regulation on the WpIG on 
4 May 2021 (see https://www.bafin.de/dok/15992230). 
Completion thereof is still pending.

the decisions are still made by the administra -
tive or supervisory board. To assist the remu -
neration control committee and thus the ad -
ministrative or supervisory board, significant in -
stitutions are required to appoint a remuner -
ation officer.46 The remuneration officer’s main 
tasks are to monitor on an ongoing basis the 
appropriateness of remuneration systems for 
staff members and prepare an annual remuner -
ation control report. This kind of function is 
unique to German regulation of remuneration, 
and stems from the fact that the remuneration 
control committee, in line with German corpor -
ate governance principles, has no dedicated 
staff resources at the institution.
Documentation and dis-
closure requirements
There are explicit documentation requirements 
for credit institutions designed to ensure that 
decisions relating to remuneration can be bet -
ter tracked, but also to restrict the discretionary 
scope of decision-  makers ex ante. Thus, the 
principles for the design of the remuneration 
systems and the composition of the remuner -
ation as well as the associated procedural rules 
along with the relevant responsibilities must be 
set out in organisational guidelines. In addition, 
actual decisions, such as performance meas -
urement/ evaluation or determination of the 
total bonus pool in a specific case, have to be 
documented appropriately. Not least, the 
amount of remuneration and its subdivision 
into fixed and variable components also has to 
be documented and disclosed as an aggregate.
To ensure that credit institutions disclose their 
remuneration practices consistently, the dis -
closure requirements were transposed from the 
CRD to the CRR in 2014. The latter contains ex -
tensive provisions on which quantitative and 
qualitative information relating to the remuner -
ation systems for risk takers has to be disclosed. 
The Remuneration Regulation for Institutions 
additionally requires the disclosure of certain 
information relating to the remuneration of all staff members depending on the size and com -
plexity of the credit institution. When the CRR 
was being revised in 2019, the issue of propor -
tionality was taken into account by stipulating 
that small and non- complex institutions, in par -
ticular, no longer need to disclose this informa -
tion if they are non- listed institutions within the 
meaning of the CRR.47 This approach is now 
also followed in Section 16(2) of the Remuner -
ation Regulation for Institutions, as last 
amended. In the interests of reducing bureau -
cracy, this is to be welcomed.
Supervision of remuneration 
systems by the Bundesbank, 
BaFin and the European 
 Central Bank
To monitor compliance with the remuneration 
requirements, the Bundesbank’s Regional Of -
fices work together with BaFin or – for signifi -
cant institutions within the meaning of Article 
6(4) subparagraph 2 of the SSM Regulation48 – 
with the European Central Bank (ECB). In add -
ition, on- site inspections are also carried out on 
a case- by- case basis at the request of BaFin or 
the ECB. Given that approximately 1,500 banks 
and savings banks currently fall within the 
scope of the Remuneration Regulation for Insti -
tutions, a risk- oriented supervisory approach is 
necessary. Thus, credit institutions considered 
to be potentially or actually systemically im -
portant receive particular attention. Equally, 
supervisors especially focus on higher levels of 
remuneration or high variable components, in -
cluding at smaller credit institutions. Since 
2010, the Bundesbank has conducted annual 
surveys of remuneration practices among Ger -
man credit institutions. The information is pro -
vided to the EBA, which publishes it in reports Credit institu -

“High earners” in the European Economic Area from 2010 
to 2019
Since 2010, banking supervisors in the Euro-
pean Economic Area (EEA) have collected 
information from “CRR institutions”1 re-
garding the members of their management 
board, the members of their supervisory 
board and staff who are active in the EEA 
and received remuneration of €1 million or 
more for a given reporting year (“high earn-
ers”). This information is published by the 
European Banking Authority (EBA) for each 
Member State – since 2014, including pay-
ment brackets with intervals of €1 million.
The fi  gures published by the EBA for the 
years from 2010 to 20192 reveal that the 
United Kingdom had the highest absolute 
number of high earners, with Germany fol-
lowing some way behind in second place. 
Data on high earners with the highest re-
muneration per Member State have also 
been available since 2014; the United King-
dom tops this list as well. Where a high 
earner in Germany has reached a fi  gure in 
the double- digit million euro range since 
2014, this has always been attributable in 
part to severance payments.
1 The term “CRR institutions” refers to those entities 
that qualify as institutions as defi  ned in Regulation (EU) 
No 575/ 2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation – CRR). 
Since 26 June 2021, “CRR investment fi  rms” no longer 
fall within the scope of the Banking Act (Kreditwesen-
gesetz) and so the reporting requirements pursuant to 
Section 24(1a) number 6 of the Banking Act will apply 
to “CRR credit institutions” in future.
2 Although the information for 2020 has already been 
collected by the national competent authorities, it has 
not yet been published by the EBA. As the data are col-
lected from superordinated institutions for the entire 
EEA, a complete picture for individual Member States 
can be obtained only once the data have been aggre-
gated by the EBA.High earners in the EEA*

prepared annually or every two years.49 It also 
feeds into the work of the supervisor respon -
sible for the respective credit institution. To -
gether with other information, particularly the 
audit reports compiled by the auditor of the 
annual accounts,50 the data are used to assess 
the appropriateness of remuneration systems 
as part of the supervisory review and evalu -
ation process (SREP).51
Any shortcomings of the remuneration systems 
feed into the assessment of the adequacy of in -
ternal governance. Based on a final score as 
part of an overall assessment, the SREP can re -
sult in a higher institution- specific capital add- 
on in accordance with Section 10(3) of the 
Banking Act or, for credit institutions directly 
supervised by the ECB, in accordance with Art -
icle 16(2) of the SSM Regulation, or to qualita -
tive requirements for the institution. Outside 
the SREP , too, formal or informal requests can 
be made for the rectification of any irregular -
ities. If serious irregularities in risk management 
are identified, the relevant supervisory author -
ity can not only issue an administrative fine, but 
ultimately also demand that members of the 
credit institution’s management board be re -
moved. Furthermore, the competent supervis -
ory authority – be it BaFin or the ECB – has the 
right to reduce a credit institution’s total vari -
able remuneration or get rid of it entirely if the 
institution is not fulfilling its obligations to en -
sure adequacy of own funds and/ or liquidity.52
Outlook
Variable remuneration at credit institutions is 
one of the most regulated and monitored in -
centive systems in the private sector. It is prob -
ably undisputed that regulation has contrib -
uted to deeper integration of remuneration 
systems into risk management as well as im -
proved risk adjustment for remuneration. FSB 
analyses show that financial institutions, espe -
cially credit institutions, have made great strides 
when it comes to refining their remuneration 
systems.53 For example, approaches involving the holistic inclusion of ESG risks54 are increas -
ingly being used when designing remuneration 
parameters, through the integration of non-  
financial criteria such as good conduct.
It is not yet possible to draw a final conclusion 
on how efficient malus and clawback arrange -
ments are, especially as these instruments tend 
to be seldom used. However, this does not ne -
cessarily mean that the relevant supervisory re -
quirements have no effect. Rather, institutions’ 
internal rules on these matters already create a 
positive incentive to develop a risk- appropriate 
corporate culture. Credit institutions must en -
sure, though, that consistent action is taken 
when staff members or members of the man -
agement board engage in misconduct.
Given the complexity of the issue and its im -
portance for corporate culture and risk man -
agement at financial institutions, an evaluation 
of the underlying FSB P&S would be a welcome 
move. This could examine the efficiency of the 
requirements and help optimise the regulation 
of remuneration.Supervisors have

financial services institutions as well as the reports to be 
drawn up on these (Audit Report Regulation ( Prüfungsbe -

Remuneration practices and trends at German credit 
 institutions from 2014 to 2019
On the basis of Section 24(1a) number 5 of 
the German Banking Act (Kreditwesen-
gesetz), the Bundesbank collects informa-
tion annually on remuneration practices 
and trends at signifi  cant institutions within 
the meaning of Section 1(3c) of the Banking 
Act. Since 2014, this data collection has 
been carried out in compliance with the 
current guidelines of the European Banking 
Authority (EBA),1 which require data to be 
collected at the consolidated level. When 
interpreting the following fi  gures it should 
be noted that the number of surveyed 
credit institutions fl  uctuates somewhat over 
time2 and that major institutions with large 
numbers of staff or high levels of remuner-
ation have a considerable impact on the ag-
gregate fi  gures.
On average, roughly 4% of the surveyed in-
stitutions’ total staff were risk takers in the 
fi  nancial year 2019. This share has remained 
largely unchanged since the data were fi  rst 
collected using the current format in 2014. 
Investment banking and retail banking each 
account for roughly one- quarter of all risk takers. Members of management boards 
and administrative or supervisory boards, 
who are automatically considered to be risk 
takers, account for around 15% of the total. 
The distribution of risk takers among the in-
dividual business areas fl  uctuated only mar-
ginally over time.
In 2019, the average remuneration for risk 
takers amounted to around four times the 
average of all staff members. The signifi  -
cance of variable remuneration is also con-
siderably higher for risk takers than for all 
staff on average. In 2019, the ratio of vari-
able to fi  xed remuneration amounted to 
45% on average for risk takers, compared 
to just 15% on average for all staff mem-
bers. However, from 2014 to 2019, a down-
ward trend can be observed in this regard 
for both risk takers and all staff members.

institutions in 2019.

The objective for the future should be regula -
tion of remuneration based on consistent prin -
ciples. Moreover, if any changes to the frame -
work are necessary, European legislators should 
ensure that the costs of the ensuing transition 
processes are as low as possible for credit insti -
tutions. This should help to boost understand -
ing of the meaning and purpose of the rules 
among the affected credit institutions and their 
staff members. Greater acceptance of the 
agreed rules may help minimise attempts to cir -
cumvent them.
At the same time, some thought should be 
given to whether the EU’s current remuner -ation regime is appropriate to the target group 
and objectives when it comes to small, non-  
complex institutions or whether they need 
even more proportional regulation. The amend -
ment of the CRD to introduce greater propor -
tionality of remuneration rules should be re -
garded as just the first step. The forthcoming 
transposition of the Basel III reform package 
into European law provides an opportunity to 
further exempt small, non- complex institutions 
from the administrative burden of remuner -
ation rules, where they are not required by 
supervisors.
List of references
Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/ 2013 of 15 October 2013 conferring specific tasks on the Euro -
pean Central Bank concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions.Overall, in 2019, credit institutions paid out 
roughly 45% of risk takers’ variable remu-
neration in the form of instruments that are 
linked to the institution’s performance (such 
as shares in the institution). Instances where 
the 50% minimum requirement was not 
met at individual credit institutions were 
largely attributable to the €50,0003 waiver 
threshold for variable remuneration.4
In 2019, roughly 60% of risk takers’ variable 
remuneration was deferred on average. The 
current fi  gures show that credit institutions 
sometimes perform an explicit ex post risk 
adjustment (malus)5 for deferred remuner-
ation. The amounts of the adjustments vary 
considerably between credit institutions 
and from year to year, depending on the 
circumstances. With a few exceptions, the 
amounts involved are only small.3 Section 18(1) of the Remuneration Regulation for In-
stitutions (Institutsvergütungsverordnung).
4 When collecting the data, the item “variable remu-
neration” also encompasses privileged severance pay-
ments pursuant to Section 5(6) of the Remuneration 
Regulation for Institutions. These are not subject to the 
requirements of Sections 7 and 20 of the Remuner-
ation Regulation for Institutions and do not have to be 
taken into account when calculating the ratio of vari-
able to fi  xed remuneration pursuant to Section 25a(5) 
of the Banking Act.
5 The reasons for ex post risk adjustments are not cap-
tured when collecting the data. Possible reasons may, 
for example, arise from Section 7(2) and Section 20(5) 
of the Remuneration Regulation for Institutions or 
from additional performance criteria in the case of 
long- term incentive plans.Deutsche Bundesbank

* Monetary financial institutions (MFIs) comprise banks (including building and loan
associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.
3 Excluding holdings of MFIs; for the German contribution, excluding German MFIs'
portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI
participations.  7 The German contributions to the Eurosystem's monetary aggregates
should on no account be interpreted as national monetary aggregates and are
therefore not comparable with the erstwhile German money stocks M1, M2 or M3.
8 Including DEM banknotes still in circulation (see also footnote 4 on p. 10●). 9 For
the German contribution, the difference between the volume of euro banknotes

Discrepancies may arise from rounding.  * The banking system's liquidity position is
defined as the current account holdings in euro of euro area credit institutions with the
Eurosystem. Amounts are derived from the consolidated financial statement of the
Eurosystem and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  1 Figures are daily averages
for the reserve maintenance period ending in the month indicated. Following the
changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the
Eurosystem's asset purchase programmes.  4 From August 2009 includes liquidity
absorbed as a result of the Eurosystem's foreign exchange swap operations.  5 From
2002 euro banknotes and other banknotes which have been issued by the national cen-
tral banks of the Eurosystem and which are still in circulation. In accordance with the
accounting procedure chosen by the Eurosystem for the issue of euro banknotes, a

under “Other factors”. The remaining 92% of the value of the euro banknotes in
circulation is allocated, likewise on a monthly basis, to the NCBs, with each NCB
showing in its balance sheet the share of the euro banknotes issued corresponding to
its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-
system and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  7 Equal to the difference bet-
ween the sum of liquidity-pro viding factors and the sum of liquidity-absorbing factors.

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

Exchange which publish IFRS consolidated financial statements on a quarterly or
half-yearly basis and make a noteworthy contribution to value added in Germany. Ex-
cluding groups engaged in real estate activities.  1 Earnings before interest, taxes, de-
preciation and amortisation.  2 Quantile data are based on the groups' unweighted re-
turn on sales.  3 Annual figures do not always match the sum of the two half-year fig-ures. See Quality report on consolidated financial statement statistics, p. 3.  4 Adjusted

wards: significant changes in IFRS standards, impairing comparability with previous pe-
riods.

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the
currency concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's
price competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective
exchange rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitive-
ness. The weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more
detailed information on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the
Deutsche Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1  The
calculations are based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral
exchange rates of the euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following countries: Australia,
Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan,
Norway, Poland, Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United
Kingdom and the United States. Where current price and wage indices were not avai-lable, estimates were used.  2 ECB calculations. Includes countries belonging to the
