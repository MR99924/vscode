Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The German economy is likely to have remained 
on its strong growth path in the second quarter 
of 2017. Driven by the buoyant demand for German products worldwide, the brisk indus -
trial activity is increasingly becoming a mainstay 
of economic growth. Industrial output con -
tinued to grow sharply of late. Construction ac -
tivity also remained very brisk. The excellent 
state of the German economy is also reflected in the sentiment indicators. In June, the Ifo In -
stitute’s business climate index for trade and industry reached a new record high for Ger -
many as a whole. Consumers are also very op -
timistic. Consumer sentiment, as surveyed by the Gesellschaft für Konsumforschung (GfK) 
market research institution, and consumer in -
come expectations, in particular, are at a very 
high level. This, together with the favourable labour market developments and the signifi -
cant rise in retail sales, suggests that private 
consumption is still on a clear upward trajec -
tory.
Industry
After some ups and downs in the past year, in -
dustrial output moved onto a clear growth 
path after the turn of the year. In May, it also 
grew by a strong seasonally adjusted 1¼% on 
the month. On an average of April and May, 
industrial output also increased sharply on the 
first quarter of 2017 (+1½%). The buoyant in -
dustrial activity benefited manufacturers of 
intermediate goods, in particular, who posted 
considerable growth in output (+2%). Manu -
facturers of electrical equipment stood out 
here in particular. Producers of capital goods 
and consumer goods likewise recorded sub -
stantial gains in output (+1½% and +1¼% re -
spectively).Industrial orders rose considerably in May by a seasonally adjusted 1% compared with the pre -
vious month. Nevertheless, on an average of 
April and May, the volume of orders was up 
only slightly from the first quarter of 2017 
(+¼%). Growth was driven by new orders from 
the euro area (+2¾%), whereas the volume of 
orders from non-  eur o-area countries showed 
no change on the quarter. German industrial 
enterprises even saw significant declines in do -
mestic orders (-1%). Developments within indi-
vidual sectors were also heterogeneous. Con -
sumer goods producers recorded the strongest 
growth in demand (2¼%), whereas the inflow of intermediate and capital goods orders stag-
nated. Excluding large-  s cale orders, however, 
manufacturers of these goods also recorded a 
considerable increase in orders. Also across 
sectors, the inflow of new orders on an aver -
age of April and May was stronger than in the 
first quarter if large orders are factored out 
(+¾%).
Industrial sales in May remained broadly un -
changed on the month after adjustment for 
seasonal variations. Taking the average of April 
and May, however, they were up considerably 
from the level of the first quarter of 2017 
(+1¾%). The strongest growth in sales was re-
corded by manufacturers of consumer goods 
(+3%). Intermediate goods producers likewise 
posted substantial sales growth (+2¼%), 
whereas turnover in the capital goods sector 
was somewhat more moderate (+1%). In re-
gional terms, the development in sales was 
quite broadly based. German industrial enter -
prises saw a sharp increase in demand, not 
only domestically but also from other euro-area 
and non-  eur o-area countries. Unlike in the case 
of industrial sales, nominal exports of goods re -
mained on an expansionary course in May and 
rose sharply on the month (+1½%). On an average of April and May, they were up even 
more dynamically, by +2¼% (in both nominal 
and price-  adju sted terms) compared with the German econ-
omy continued on strong growth path in Q2

first quarter of 2017. Imports of goods also re -
mained on their upward trajectory in May and 
grew substantially on the month (+1½%). On 
an average of April and May, 2¾% more goods 
were imported than in the first quarter of 2017. After adjustment for price effects, the increase 
amounted to as much as 3½%, which was due 
to the drop in energy prices.
Construction
Construction output in May declined percep -
tibly on the month after adjustment for sea-
sonal variations (-1%). That said, construction 
output is still holding steady at an exceptionally 
high level. On an average of April and May, 
construction output was also up significantly 
on the level of the first quarter of 2017 (+3¼%). 
Given that the finishing trades stagnated, this 
development was solely attributable to the considerably higher output in the main con -
struction sector (+6%). The particularly strong 
statistical break in the first quarter played a 
major role in this development.1 New orders in 
the main construction sector in April –  the 
period up until which statistical data are cur -
rently available  – increased again on the al -
ready very high level of the first quarter. Ac-
cording to the Ifo Institute, the assessment of 
the business situation in the construction sec -
tor in June was down only slightly on the previ-
ously reached all-  time high. Against this back -
drop, the booming construction activity is likely 
to have continued during the course of the 
second quarter.Construction

Deutsche Bundesbank1 Although the adjustment to the reporting group already 
occurred at the beginning of 2017, the fact that the in -
crease in the number of hours worked, and thus also in 
production, is concentrated on February is – according to 
the Federal Statistical Office – due to technical reasons re-
sulting from the way that data are collected. For more in -

Labour market
Employment saw further considerable growth 
in May 2017 despite the weaker employment 
dynamics compared with the final quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. The total 
number of persons in work in Germany in May 
rose by a seasonally adjusted 36,000 on the 
month. The year-  on-  year r ate of increase, at 
1.5% or 648,000 persons, was very strong. The 
favourable overall development was due pre -
dominantly to the substantial expansion in em-
ployment subject to social security contribu -
tions. Within the last twelve months – here, the 
most recent, still provisional dataset is from April 2017  – this figure grew more strongly (+727,000) than overall employment. By con -
trast, the number of persons working exclu -
sively in low-  paid part-  time jobs fel l distinctly. 
The number of self-  employed persons also de -
clined somewhat. The leading indicators of em -
ployment demand, notably the Ifo employment 
barometer and the labour market barometer of 
the Institute for Employment Research (IAB), 
suggest that a similar trend in employment is 
also to be expected for the coming months. 
The rise in the number of reported job vacan -
cies, which has been visible for quite some 
time, showed no signs of abating in June.
After seasonal adjustment, unemployment rose 
slightly in June 2017 compared with the previ -
ous month. 2.55 million persons were regis -
tered with the Federal Employment Agency as 
unemployed. The unemployment rate remained 
at 5.7%. The increase was not due to cyclical 
reasons, but is likely to be primarily the result of 
the spring pick-  up in the labour market, which 
started earlier this year and has now also ended 
earlier than usual. Compared with the same 
month one year earlier, 142,000 fewer persons 
were out of work, and the unemployment rate 
was 0.4 percentage point lower. Total under -
employment (excluding short-  time work),  
which also includes persons taking part in la -
bour market policy measures, grew by the 
same amount as registered unemployment, 
which would indicate that the active labour market policy measures had a neutral impact in June. According to the IAB’s labour market bar -
ometer, the downward trend in unemployment is likely to continue in the coming months.
Prices
Crude oil prices continued on their downward 
trend path in June 2017 and fell by around 7% 
on the month. This was due mainly to the high level of inventories worldwide and higher pro-
duction volumes in a number of oil-  p roducing 
countries. In the first three weeks of July, oil 
prices stabilised. As this report went to press, 
the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil stood at 
US$50. The premium on crude oil futures was 
US$1¼ for deliveries six months ahead and 
US$2 for deliveries 12 months ahead.
The price of imports fell quite significantly over -
all in May. Lower energy prices were one rea -
son. Another, however, was a decline in the 
prices of other goods, probably as a result of 
the appreciation of the euro. By contrast, in -
dustrial producer prices, which are already 
available for June, declined on an average of 
May and June taken together, albeit solely as a 
result of the drop in energy prices. Excluding energy, industrial producer prices largely 
treaded water. The year-  o n-  y ear figure in -
creased by just over 4% of late in the case of 
import prices and by 2½% in the case of indus -
trial producer prices.
Consumer prices –  as measured by the Har -
monised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)  – 
rose again slightly in June. The impact of the 
decline in crude oil prices on consumer prices 
for energy was dampened as a result of the 
widening of margins by refineries. The prices of 
food and industrial goods (excluding energy) 
barely showed any increase. By contrast, the prices of services also rose perceptibly, partly 
due to anticipatory price adjustments for travel 
and holiday services. Rents went up only mar -
ginally, however. Annual headline HICP infla -
tion went up from +1.4% to +1.5% overall (CPI Significant rise in

+1.6%, following +1.5%). The inflation rate ex-
cluding energy and food increased from +1.1% 
to +1.5%, owing in part to the late timing of 
Whitsun this year. In July, both headline infla -
tion and inflation excluding energy and food 
are again likely to be somewhat lower.
Public finances2
Local government finances
According to the cash statistics, local govern -
ment saw a €1 billion year-  on-  year decline in  
its deficit in the first quarter of 2017, taking it to 
€5 billion. At 5½% (or €3 billion), growth in 
expenditure was significantly lower than that in revenue, which came to 7½% (or just under €4 
billion). Revenue developments were influ -
enced to a great extent by the sharp rise in cur -
rent transfers from public administrations 
(+7½%, or €1½ billion), which also include the 
increased central government funds forwarded 
to municipalities by the state governments,3 
and by tax revenue (+5½%, or €1 billion). There was a surge in receipts from fees (+16%, or €1 
billion), largely on account of off-  budget en -
tities in North Rhine-  W estphalia. On the ex -
penditure side, growth in personnel expend -
iture (6%, or €1 billion) was exceptionally 
strong, particularly because the second adjust -
ment stage under the latest collective wage 
agreement, which was not yet in force a year 
earlier, took effect in February 2017. Other op -
erating expenditure likewise rose very sharply 
(+8%, or €1 billion).4 By contrast, spending on 
social benefits increased only moderately 
(+1½%), eased by the significant fall in expend -
iture on benefits for asylum seekers. This re -
flects the fact that, after the strong refugee-  
related rise in expenses a year earlier, a larger 
portion of these costs were transferred to cen -
tral government as a result of successful asylum 
applications, while numbers of incoming refu -
gees were relatively subdued towards the end 
of the period under review. Fixed asset forma-
tion decreased – albeit after a relatively sharp increase in the same period last year  – and 
there was also a fall in interest expenditure.
For the year as a whole, in view of the moder -
ate improvement at the start of the year and 
exceptionally strong growth in the fourth quar -
ter of 2016, local government’s surplus is likely 
to be a similar size to that recorded for 2016 
(€5½ billion). Factoring in the effects of court 
rulings made some time ago, local government 
tax revenue, bolstered by the €½ billion trans -
fer of central government turnover tax revenue, 
is set, overall, to grow only somewhat more 
slowly than at the beginning of the year. If as -
sistance payments to cover refugee-  r elated ex -
penses remain subdued, the rise in transfers from state government should be less pro -
nounced than at the beginning of the year. The increase in personnel expenditure will ease off due to the terms of the collective wage agree-
ment, and growth in other operating expend -
iture connected with support for refugees is also likely to weaken somewhat. However, given the favourable financial developments 
and increased assistance from central govern -
ment, part of which is earmarked for more ex -
tensive investment in schools, investment is 
likely to expand much more strongly in the re -
mainder of the year. Social spending is ex -
pected to climb somewhat more sharply again once the dampening impact of falling expend -
iture on incoming refugees has tailed off. In 
view of the additional €2½ billion in budgetary assistance from central government from 2018 
onwards and the prospect of solid growth in 
tax revenue, local government appears likely to continue posting surpluses in the medium term Lower deficit in

2 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter.

debt, see the statistical section of this report.

and, at the same time, to have funds available 
to boost investment.
Following the strong final quarter of 2016, many municipalities were able to go beyond funding the usual seasonal deficit from re-serves, meaning that local government debt
5 
fell by €½ billion to €147 billion between the 
end of 2016 and the end of March this year. 
The decline in regular credit market debt (to 
just over €93½ billion) more than offset the in -
crease of €1 billion in cash advances, which 
rose in all federal states – with higher absolute 
increases in Hesse, Rhineland-  P alatinate and 
Lower Saxony – except North Rhine-  W estphalia 
and Saarland. These advances, which are actu -
ally only intended to bridge intra-  annual liquid -
ity fluctuations, reached a total of €49 billion, 
or one-  thir d of the total debt. Saarland (€2,160) 
still accounts for the highest volume of cash 
advances per capita,  followed by North Rhine-  
Westphalia and Rhineland-  P alatinate (around 
€1,500 each) and Hesse (€1,050).
In view of the unwelcome developments of the 
past and the fact that the volume of cash ad -
vances is still on the rise in some local author -
ities, the Independent Advisory Board of the 
Stability Council has now also proposed that, in 
future, local authorities should only be permit -
ted to obtain cash advances, at least those 
spanning more than one year, from their home 
state government and that these advances should then be counted towards that state’s borrowing allowance under the debt brake.
6 
Given the financial difficulties faced by its local 
authorities, the state government of Hesse is 
planning, effectively, to assume all of their debt from cash advances (€6½ billion at last report) 
as of mid-2018;7 this move comes on top of 
the partial debt assumption programme that 
has already been launched for around one-  
quarter of its local authorities. The plan involves 
very long-  term loans binding the interest repay -
ments to a low level and the interest costs being passed on to the state government of Hesse. The respective municipality is to make half of the principal repayments (with an an -nual contribution of €25 per capita ), with the 
state government of Hesse covering the other 
half. Any outstanding principal repayments still 
owed by individual local authorities after 30 
years will be waived by the state government. At the same time, the budgetary rules for local 
government are to be tightened with the ob -
jective of regulating and monitoring the issu -
ance of cash advances more stringently in Overall decline

future  . Multi-  year cash advances wil l no longer 
be permitted. Generally speaking, measures to 
counteract the high volume of cash advances 
are a welcome move. In this specific case, the 
details have yet to be worked out and the plans implemented. Given that the planned debt as -
sumption is so extensive, it would be advisable to impose strict limits on the debt burden to be 
assumed by state government8 and tie this to 
stringent conditions.Statutory health insurance 
scheme
According to preliminary data, the statutory 
health insurance (SHI) scheme – comprising the 
health insurance institutions and the health 
fund – posted a deficit of €2 billion in the first 
quarter of 2017. As is usual for this time of year, 
the first-  qu arter result was negative and was 
around the same level as it was a year earlier. 
The health fund’s deficit remained unchanged 
at €2½ billion, although, as planned, it had to 
make additional reserve-  funded tr ansfers total -
ling €½ billion to the health insurance institu -
tions9 and the innovation fund. The health in -
surance institutions increased their surplus (€½ billion) slightly.
The health insurance institutions’ revenue, which stems mainly from transfers from the 
health fund, grew by just over 4%, with add -
itional contribution rates remaining virtually un-changed on average. By comparison, the rise in expenditure was somewhat lower (4%). Above 
all, growth in spending on hospital treatment, 
a particularly large expenditure item, was below average (+3½%) even though it had 
been lower a year earlier because of a one-  off 
effect and a stronger increase had seemed likely in view of the benefits expansion intro -
duced under the Hospital Structures Act (Kran-
kenhausstrukturgesetz ). Spending on pharma -
ceuticals rose by almost 4%, with higher cost 
increases recorded for outpatient medical treat -
ments (4½%), a similarly large expenditure 
item, and for sickness benefit (+7½%), which is less significant.
The health fund recorded strong revenue 
growth of just over 4½%. This was essentially 
due to ongoing positive employment develop -
ments and higher per capita  earnings subject Financial

to compulsory insurance contributions. Contri-
bution receipts from members in employment 
rose by 4½%. At 6%, growth in pension contri -
butions was even stronger, particularly after 
the large pension increase in mid-2016.10 The 
increase in the central government grant (of 
€½ billion for the year as a whole, bringing it 
to a total of €14½ billion, or +3½%) had a positive impact on other revenue. The rise in 
the health fund’s expenditure (which largely 
comprises transfers to the health insurance in-
stitutions), including the forwarded higher 
funds from central government and the special 
transfer, came to 4½%.
For 2017 as a whole, the health fund looks 
likely to post a deficit. This is because, accord -
ing to plans, the special transfer of €1½ billion 
to the health insurance institutions and pay -
ments of around €½ billion to the structural 
and innovation fund are to be drawn from the reserves. However, if contribution receipts from 
members in employment maintain their pace of 
growth in the remainder of the year, the deficit 
will probably be perceptibly lower than pro -
jected in November 2016 by the group of statutory health insurance estimators (-€2 bil -
lion). The statutory health insurance institu -
tions’ expenditure growth could accelerate over the course of 2017, primarily because of 
new benefits in the area of remedies and thera -
peutic appliances but also as a result of the ex -
panded hospital benefits generally envisaged 
since last year. All in all, however, the expend -
iture growth projected by the group of statu -
tory health insurance estimators (+5%) looks 
likely to have been overestimated again. The 
health insurance institutions would thus record 
a surplus for the year as a whole again, and 
their financial reserves would continue to grow. 
Yet large reserves make it difficult for legislators 
to resist calls from providers to increase spend-ing.
11 If health insurance institutions with large 
reserves were to use their capacity to lower 
additional contribution rates, however, this 
would lighten the burden shouldered by contri-
bution payers.Public long-  term car e 
 insurance scheme
In the first quarter of 2017, the public long-  
term care insurance scheme’s core area12 
posted a deficit of €½ billion. This €½ billion 
deterioration on the year was essentially due to 
the second Act to Strengthen Long-  term C are 
(Pflegestärkungsgesetz  II), which brought 
sweeping reforms to the scheme’s range of 
benefits. On the revenue side, the contribution 
rate was raised by 0.2  percentage point to 
2.55% (plus 0.25 percentage point for childless 
persons).13 However, the additional revenue 
that this generated (€½ billion in the first quar -
ter) was not sufficient to cover the substantial 
cost increases that these reforms entail.
The increase in total revenue was very sharp, at 
12½%. After adjustment for the contribution 
rate rise, it went up by a still-  sizeable 4 %. How -
ever, growth in expenditure was even stronger, 
reaching 20%. The second Act to Strengthen 
Long-  term C are has led to substantial add -
itional spending in all areas. The very large ex-
penditure item benefits in kind, which increased by 15½%, and the less significant item monet -
ary benefits, which climbed by 37%, made 
similar-  sized contributions to the overall rise.Only moderate

10 For information on the reasons for the large pension 
increase, see Deutsche Bundesbank, Public finances, 
Monthly Report, May 2016, p 72. For 2017 as a whole, the 
lower pension increase in mid-2017 means that slower 
growth of just over 4% in pension expenditure can be ex -
pected, and thus a weaker rise in pension contributions 
than in the first quarter. As adjustments to the additional 
contribution rates are passed on to pensioners with a two-  
month time lag (pursuant to section 247 of the Fifth Book of the Social Security Code), the impact of the average in -
crease of 0.25 percentage point at the beginning of 2016 initially remained small but boosted the growth rate in the first quarter of 2017.11 See also Deutsche Bundesbank, Public finances, Monthly 
Report, March 2017, pp 9-10.12 The developments outlined here and below exclude the 
long-  term car e provident fund. Since 2015, the core area 
has taken the receipts from 0.1 percentage point of the contribution rate (€½ billion in the first quarter of 2017) 
and transferred them to this fund.
13 At the beginning of 2015, following an expansion of 
benefits, the contribution rate had already been raised by 
0.3 percentage point.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

A sharp rise in spending on benefits had been 
expected in connection with the reforms to 
long-  term car e. The already substantial increase 
in benefits in kind at the beginning of the year 
differed from the situation following previous 
reforms, when the financial impact of newly 
introduced benefits was delayed. If the growth 
rates for spending on benefits remain similarly 
high in the remainder of the year, a perceptible 
deficit should be expected for the year as a 
whole, and the long-  term car e insurance insti -
tutions will have to draw on their operational 
reserves. Additional strong cost pressures are already on the horizon because of demo -
graphic change, and the public long-  term care insurance scheme, with its pay-  as-  you-  go  
model, is thus set to require additional contri -
bution rate increases. From 2035 onwards, 
such rate increases are to be dampened for an interim period by dissolving the reserves of the 
long-  term car e provident fund that will have 
been built up by then.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €93.8 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in May 2017 was marginally lower 
than the previous month’s figure (€94.1 billion). After deducting the significantly lower redemp-tions and taking account of changes in issuers’ holdings of their own debt securities, net sales 
of domestic debt securities came to €28.5 bil-
lion. The outstanding volume of foreign debt 
securities in Germany rose by €10.7 billion dur -
ing the reporting month, which meant that the 
outstanding volume of debt instruments in the 
German market increased by €39.1 billion over -
all.
In May, the public sector issued debt securities 
worth €16.6 billion net (following repayments 
of €9.0 billion in April). Central government 
was the main issuer of new securities (€14.7 
billion), particularly in the medium and long-  
term segment. As well as issuing two-  year F ed-
eral Treasury notes (Schätze) worth €5.1 billion 
and five-  year F ederal notes (Bobls) worth €3.1 
billion, in net terms it also placed ten and 30-year Federal bonds (Bunds) on the market 
worth €4.3 billion and €2.6 billion respectively. The state governments issued their own bonds to the value of €1.9 billion in net terms.
Domestic credit institutions raised their capital 
market debt by €10.8 billion net in May, fol -
lowing net redemptions of €5.9 billion in April. 
Increases were seen primarily in the outstand -
ing volume of debt securities issued by special -
ised credit institutions (€12.7 billion), which in-
clude, for example, public promotional banks. Deficit likely for

Other bank debt securities which can be struc -
tured flexibly were also placed on the market, 
albeit on a much smaller scale (€0.5 billion). 
This contrasted with net redemptions of mort -
gage Pfandbriefe and public Pfandbriefe (€1.3 
billion and €1.1 billion respectively).
Domestic enterprises issued bonds with a net 
value of €1.1 billion in the reporting month, 
compared with slight net redemptions of €0.3 billion one month earlier. Viewed in net terms, 
the issuances were predominantly attributable 
to non-  financial corpor ations, while other fi -
nancial intermediaries redeemed bonds on bal-
ance.
Foreign investors were the main buyers of 
bonds in May (€21.3 billion). The Bundesbank 
also bought bonds (€12.8 billion), predomin -
antly in the context of the asset purchase pro -
grammes. The bulk of these purchases were 
made up of domestic securities issued by public 
sector entities. Domestic banks added interest-  
bearing paper worth a net €3.9 billion to their 
portfolios, acquiring mainly foreign debt secur -
ities (€2.2 billion). Domestic non-  banks pur -
chased debt securities to the tune of €1.1 bil -
lion net, with the key focus being on foreign 
instruments.
Equity market
In the month under review, domestic enter -
prises issued new shares totalling €0.1 billion 
net in the German equity market. The volume 
of foreign equities in the German market rose 
by €3.2 billion over the same period. On bal -
ance, shares were purchased by domestic non-  
banks (€1.6 billion), foreign investors (€1.3 bil -
lion) and domestic credit institutions (€0.5 bil -
lion).
Mutual funds
In May, German mutual funds recorded net in -
flows of €5.7 billion (April: €6.5 billion). On bal -ance, retail funds were the chief beneficiaries 
(€3.1 billion). Among the fund providers, mixed 
securities-  based funds wer e the main issuers of 
new shares (€3.9 billion), but share-  based  
funds also placed new shares on the market 
(€1.2 billion). Bond-  based funds, on the other 
hand, recorded outflows of funds amounting 
to €1.1 billion. The outstanding volume of for -
eign mutual fund units sold in Germany rose by 
€0.4 billion in the reporting month. Domestic 
non- banks wer e the main buyers of mutual 
fund shares in May (€5.0 billion). On balance, 
the vast majority of these were domestic secur -
ities. Mutual fund shares were also acquired by 
foreign investors and German credit institu -
tions, whose purchases came to a net €0.6 bil -
lion and €0.4 billion respectively.

lion above the April level. This was attributable 
to an increase in the goods account surplus, 
which outweighed the expanded deficit in the 
invisible current transactions balance compris -
ing services as well as primary and secondary 
income.
In May, the surplus on the goods account was 
up on the month by €4.7 billion to €24.4 bil -
lion, with exports rising more strongly than im -
ports.
The deficit on invisible current transactions 
widened by €2.3 billion to €7.1 billion, mainly 
on account of the reversal in the primary in -
come balance from net receipts in April (€4.2 
billion) to net expenditure (totalling €3.6 bil -
lion) in May. This was due, in particular, to 
higher dividend payments to non-  r esidents. In 
addition, the deficit in the services account rose 
by €1.2 billion to €2.0 billion, not least as a re-
sult of the increase in travel expenditure. By 
contrast, the deficit in the secondary income 
account narrowed by €6.8 billion to €1.5 bil -
lion on the back of higher receipts and lower 
expenditure, but not by a large enough margin 
to substantially offset developments in the 
other two sub-  accounts.
In May, the international financial markets were 
caught between a basically stabilised world 
economy on the one hand and volatile political influences on the other. Against this backdrop, 
German cross-  bor der portfolio investment gen -
erated net capital imports of €11.4 billion. This was above all a consequence of net purchases 
of domestic securities by non-  r esident investors 
(€23.2 billion), mostly in the form of – primarily 
public – bonds (€12.9 billion) and money mar -
ket paper (€8.5 billion). Aside from this, they 
also acquired shares (€1.3 billion) and mutual 
fund shares (€0.6 billion). Domestic investors 
likewise increased their holdings of foreign se-
curities (€11.8 billion), chiefly focussing on 
– mainly euro-  denominated  – bonds (€11.5 bil -
lion). They also engaged in purchases of shares

lion), while parting with money market paper 
(€0.8 billion) in the period under review.
Unlike in portfolio investment, direct invest -
ment generated net capital exports to the tune 
of €4.8 billion in May. In large part, this was 
due to domestic firms making new investments 
abroad (€9.2 billion) through which they were able to bolster their equity capital (€5.6 billion) 
and increase lending to affiliated enterprises (€3.6 billion). With regard to credit transac -
tions, loans granted by domestic parents to subsidiaries abroad played a prominent role. 
Foreign enterprises likewise injected funds into 
their affiliates in Germany (€4.4 billion), 
achieved exclusively by means of intra-  gr oup 
loans (€6.7 billion). Lending in the shape of fi -
nancial loans from foreign subsidiaries to their German parent companies played a key role in this context. By contrast, foreign owners with -
drew equity holdings in the amount of €2.3 bil -
lion.
Other statistically recorded investment, which 
comprises both loans and trade credits (where these do not constitute direct investment) as 
well as bank deposits and other assets, yielded 
net capital exports totalling €10.8 billion in May. In this context, at €21.9 billion, German liabilities to the rest of the world fell more sharply than the respective claims (€11.2 bil -
lion). Both the banking system (€5.7 billion) 
and non-  banks (€5 .1 billion) generated out -
flows of funds. While transactions on the part 
of the monetary financial institutions (MFIs) led to net imports worth €6.3 billion, both general government and enterprises and individuals re-
corded net capital exports amounting to €3.8 
billion and €1.3 billion respectively. The Bun -
desbank accounted for the vast majority of 
these exports (€12.0 billion), with its TARGET2 
claims increasing by a total of €13.8 billion.

ally by €1.5 billion.

The market for corporate bonds  
in the low-  inter est-  r ate environment
The market for bonds of non-  financial c orporations in the euro area has grown strongly in recent 
years amid falling yields. This article examines the causes of this development, looking in particu-
lar at the period since the start of 2011, which encompasses structural changes in the banking 
sector, the impact of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area and the accompanying low-  
interest-  r ate environment. The analysis therefore focuses on a period subsequent to the height of 
the severe financial and economic crisis in which the market for bonds of non-  financial corpor -
ations had stagnated and was thus untypical.
The market for bonds of non-  financial corporations has been subject to strong supply-  side and 
demand-  side for ces in recent years. On the supply side, enterprises active in the capital market 
are likely to have replaced bank loans with bonds as a consequence of the crisis years, thus 
increasing the bond supply. In addition, the more favourable financing conditions brought about 
by the low-  inter est-  r ate environment have boosted enterprises’ issuance activity. At the same 
time, on the demand side, falling risk-  fr ee interest rates have led to avid interest among investors, 
who have increasingly shifted their investments to higher-  yielding, risky instruments suc h as cor -
porate bonds in their search for yield. Since June 2016, the Eurosystem’s corporate sector pur -
chase programme (CSPP) has also boosted demand for bonds of non-  financial corporations.
Prices predominantly reflect the pressure of high demand, which is probably partly attributable to 
the above-  aver age level of risk appetite seen of late. Despite the increase in supply, the yields on 
bonds of non-  financial c orporations as well as the spreads over risk-  fr ee bonds – which had both 
reached a relatively high level during the sovereign debt crisis – have fallen significantly on bal -
ance. The decline in yields is a reflection of the receding sovereign debt crisis, an increasingly 
favourable capital market setting and the announcement of the CSPP. In addition, through falling 
short-  term inter est rates and a flatter yield curve, accommodative monetary policy has made a 
key contribution to the falling returns on bonds, and thus to the search for yield.
Furthermore, the period since 2011 is of particular interest with regard to the functioning and 
stability of the market for corporate bonds. While yields have fallen on balance over the reporting 
period, they rose temporarily on several occasions. Three phases of increased yield fluctuations 
reflecting (abrupt) reassessments by investors can be identified. In addition, this study indicates 
that the importance of sector-  specific information for the movement of c orporate bond yields has 
diminished in recent years, which may have something to do with investors differentiating less 
between individual bonds. This points to a higher risk of the whole market being affected if there is a reassessment of corporate bonds in future. From a central banking perspective, it is essential that this risk be continuously monitored, particularly after the end of the CSPP.Deutsche Bundesbank

Market trends
The market for bonds of non- financial corpor -
ations1 in the euro area has seen strong growth 
in recent years. After an initial growth surge at 
the start of monetary union and a short period 
of stagnation in the wake of the severe eco -
nomic crisis at the end of the last decade, 
growth once again accelerated following the 
financial and sovereign debt crisis when the 
availability of bank loans became limited in 
some member states and the financial markets 
subsequently experienced falling risk- free yields 
on benchmark paper. On the supply side, 
bonds presented enterprises with an alternative 
source of funding to bank loans in this environ -
ment, and enterprises used the more favour -
able financing conditions brought about by the 
low- interest- rate setting to increasingly raise 
funds by issuing debt securities. At the same 
time, on the demand side, non- financial cor -
porate bonds, which mostly offered a positive 
yield due to their risk premium vis- à- vis risk- free 
government bonds, elicited avid interest among 
many (institutional) investors. According to the 
ECB’s capital market statistics, from the start of 
2011 to the end of the reporting period the 
outstanding volume of (euro- denominated) 
bonds issued by non- financial corporations 
domiciled in the euro area increased on bal -
ance by just under 50% to €1,020.4 billion.
The above figures do not include bonds issued 
via (foreign) financing subsidiaries. Many non-  
financial corporations do not tap the bond 
market directly, but via a financing subsidiary 
which then passes on the funds raised from the 
bond issuance to the parent company.2 While 
securities issued by financing subsidiaries domi -
ciled in the euro area are included in the ECB’s 
capital market statistics, they are attributed 
there to financial enterprises. This makes it dif -
ficult to infer the issuance activity of non-  
financial corporations, which are the focus of 
this article. If a different classification were 
used and bonds issued by financing subsidiaries 
were also counted, the outstanding volume of 
non- financial corporte bonds in the reporting period would also have risen,3 but market 
growth would have been significantly lower.
In contrast to non-  financial corporate bonds, 
financial  bonds have been redeemed in net 
terms since the start of 2011. The falling 
market- based borrowing by financial enter -
prises is attributable to significantly lower issu -
ing activity by credit institutions, which are 
traditionally the most active enterprises in the 
bond market. Insurance companies and pen -
sion funds, by contrast, have stepped up their 
bond market borrowing. The change seen 
among banks is probably a reflection, among 
other things, of favourable financing via de -
posits, the unlimited access to collateralised 
central bank liquidity, ongoing balance sheet 
consolidation at many banks, and regulatory 
changes since the financial crisis.
By international standards, non- financial cor -
porate bonds play a rather minor role as a fi -
nancing and investment vehicle in the euro 
area, despite market growth. This can be seen 
in the market volume of these bonds in relation 
to gross domestic product (GDP), which stood 
at 11% in the euro area at the end of 2016 and 
was thus significantly lower than, say, in the 
United Kingdom or the United States (20% and 
31%, respectively),4 where corporate bonds 
have a long- standing tradition as an important 
source of corporate financing.
The regional breakdown within the euro area 
shows that since the start of 2011, French en -
terprises, in particular, have issued bonds on a 
large scale in net terms (see the table on Strong growth

1 Non- financial corporate bonds are bonds whose issuer is 
a private corporation that belongs neither to the banking 
sector nor to the insurance sector and is not a financial 
 enterprise. Non-  financial corporate bonds are therefore 
typically issued by enterprises in the real economy.
2 Possible advantages of issuing bonds via a foreign finan -
cing subsidiary include a lower tax burden or lower regula -
tory requirements of the foreign capital market.
3 According to data of the Bank for International Settle -
ments (BIS), between the beginning of 2011 and March 
2017 the outstanding volume of euro- denominated bonds 
of non- financial corporations domiciled in the euro area

page 19). In France, the bond market tradition -
ally plays an important role for enterprises. Ital -
ian, German and –  starting at a relative low 
level  – Spanish enterprises have also made a 
considerable contribution to (absolute) market 
growth. Dutch enterprises have expanded their 
net bond issuance only moderately.
The figures in the adjacent table do not include 
borrowers’ notes, which are an established al -
ternative financing instrument for German en -
terprises, in particular. Borrowers’ notes are 
geared to a relatively small group of selected 
investors such as banks and insurance com -
panies. They thus assume an intermediary pos-ition between bonds and syndicated loans, im-plying lower costs for enterprises than issuing a bond. While bond financing usually entails me-
dium to large volumes, borrowers’ notes are 
more suitable for small to medium financing 
needs. According to market observers, the sup -
ply of capital on the borrowers’ note market 
has grown recently. In the current market envir -
onment, it would appear that access to this 
market is also available to companies that had not previously tapped into it. Measured in rela -
tion to the market size, the rather moderate 
growth in the importance of bond financing for 
German companies is probably at least partly 
attributable to the intensified use of borrowers’ 
notes.
In terms of their maturity, the overwhelming bulk of the outstanding volume of corporate 
bonds over the entire reporting period were 
long-  term instruments with an original maturity 
of more than one year. As enterprises have re -
cently issued relatively few money market in -
struments while the issuance of long-  term  
bonds has risen, this has further boosted the 
dominance of long-  t erm bonds. At last count, 
long-  t erm bonds made up  92% of the out -
standing volume of debt securities.
Broken down by qualitative criteria, roughly 
three-  q uarters of outstanding bonds have an 
investment-  gr ade rating (see the chart on 
page 20). However, the outstanding volume of non- investment-  gr ade bonds has seen above-  
average growth in recent years. Since the start 
of 2011, the share of high-  yield bonds in r ela-
tion to all outstanding bonds has risen to just 
under one-  fifth. The shar e of bonds not as -
sessed by rating agencies has also gone up.
A contributing factor to the higher share of non-  
investment-  gr ade bonds could be that in recent 
years – also in the light of the poorer ratings 
assigned to some euro-area member states  – more outstanding bonds have been down -
graded than upgraded. Moreover, data from the 
private data provider Dealogic show that issu -
ance in the bond market by non-  investment-  
grade enterprises has been above average. For 
example, since 2011, high-  yield bonds have ac -
counted for 26% of all bond issuance (net), 
which is considerably more than their 17% share (based on latest figures) of all outstanding bonds 
(see the chart on page 20). This suggests that the attractiveness of bond financing has risen 
particularly strongly for enterprises with a lower credit rating in comparison to alternative finan -
cing solutions. French enterprises in particular, 
but also those in Germany and – to a lesser ex -
tent – Italy and Spain, have contributed to the 
lively issuance of high-  yield bonds.
The largest purchasers of non-  financial corpor -
ate bonds are institutional investors, namely in -Borrowers’ notes

surance companies (including pension funds) 
and other financial intermediaries (OFIs) such 
as investment funds, which hold European cor -
porate bonds to a similar extent.5 These two 
investor groups have significantly expanded 
their exposure in recent years. The increase in 
these holdings is at least partly related to port -
folio reallocations involving a shift away from 
debt instruments of monetary financial institu -
tions. This is likely to reflect, on the one hand, 
supply-  side factors, such as the efforts of many 
banks to consolidate their balance sheets. On 
the other hand, demand-  r elated effects are 
also likely to have played a role, with institu -
tional investors also parting with covered 
bonds, selling them to the Eurosystem under the covered bond purchase programme.
6 The 
freed-  up funds have subsequently been in -
vested in bonds of non-  financial corpor ations 
instead.
Besides insurance companies and OFIs, credit institutions (excluding central banks) and 
households (including non-  pr ofit institutions 
serving households) also hold a significant vol -
ume of corporate bonds, although they have markedly reduced their holdings in recent 
years. The Eurosystem also became a major in-vestor in corporate bonds with the launch of its 
corporate bond purchases in June 2016 under 
the CSPP (see the box on pages 22 to 24).Important causes of market 
growth
Substitution of bank loans boosts supply of corporate bonds
Results of the financial accounts and the na -
tional accounts show that earnings retained by 
non- financial corpor ations in the euro area 
swiftly recovered following the financial and 
sovereign debt crisis. In this environment, fi -
nancing via retained earnings (internal finan -
cing) grew in relevance compared, say, to 
financing   v ia bank loans and bonds (external 
financing). In terms of external financing, loans 
from non-  banks, loans fr om abroad, and equity 
issuance dominated in the crisis years, while 
bank loans were scaled back on balance. Enter -
prises also increasingly turned to bond finan -
cing. This indicates that enterprises with capital 
market access partially substituted bank loans 
with debt instruments, thus supporting a higher volume of corporate bonds on the supply side.
In the years dominated by the sovereign debt 
crisis, an important reason for such a substitu-tion is likely to have been that bank loans were 
available on a reduced scale or at less favour -
able conditions.7 In periphery countries with 
closely intertwined public and banking sectors, such as Italy and Spain, banks’ financing costs Insurance

6 The reporting period chosen here, which started at the 
beginning of 2011, covers the CBPP2, which was launched 
in November 2011 with a nominal purchase volume of 
€16.4 billion, and the CBPP3, which was launched in Octo -
ber 2014 without a stipulated overall purchase volume and 
under which the Eurosystem has thus far purchased 
covered bonds totalling €223.9 billion.
7 This conclusion is consistent with a study by Beschwitz 
and Howells. Their results indicate that enterprises issued 
more bonds after the financial crisis when their access to 
bank loans worsened. See B von Beschwitz and C  T  How-
ells (2016), Are euro area corporate bond markets irrele -
vant? The effect of bond market access on investment, International Finance Discussion Papers 1176, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Some studies 
show that the possibility of substituting bank loans through the issuance of corporate bonds was at least partially able to mitigate the negative effect of loan supply shocks on the real economy. See F de Fiore and H Uhlig (2015), Corporate 
debt structure and the financial crisis, Journal of Money, 
Credit and Banking, Vol 47 (8), 1571-1598.Deutsche Bundesbank

increased significantly, dampening the loan 
supply in these countries. Data on bank loan 
standards collected by the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) via the Bank Lending Sur -
vey (BLS) confirm that these standards did 
worsen markedly at the time for large corpor -
ations – for which bond financing is conceiv -
able. Assuming that credit standards impact 
net issuance of corporate bonds with a half-  
year delay, it can be shown that there was a close positive correlation between tightened 
credit standards and (net) issuance of corporate 
bonds from 2011 to 2014 (see the adjacent 
chart). In this period, enterprises increased the 
supply of bonds, which were evidently a rela -
tively attractive source of funds despite the fact 
that market-  based financing costs had also  
risen. Once credit standards then improved in a calmer financial market setting, the motivation 
for substituting bank loans with bonds is likely 
to have lost relevance. Bond issuance neverthe-
less continued to increase as of 2014, probably 
as a result, in particular, of the falling risk-  fr ee 
interest rates, the increasing search for yield 
among investors, and, more recently, also the 
CSPP (see pages 21 to 26).
Developments in bank lending volume support 
this presumption. While the lending volume to 
non- financial corpor ations in the euro area was 
scaled back between 2011 and 2014, in par -
ticular, and, after a period of stabilisation, 
began to nudge upwards again only recently, 
the volume of outstanding corporate bonds 
has grown continuously. In relative terms, the 
significance of market-  based debt financing via 
corporate bonds has therefore increased mark -
edly.
The increased importance of bond financing in 
relation to financing via bank loans can be 
shown not only for the euro area as a whole, 
but also for the four largest euro-area coun -
tries. It can be seen above all for enterprises in 
France, but also for those in Germany, Italy, 
and, to a lesser extent, Spain. The substitution 
of bank loans with bonds is likely to have 
played a role for firms in periphery countries, in particular, where supply-  s ide conditions for 
bank loans have tightened. For French and Ger -
man enterprises, by contrast, which on balance 
have expanded their volume of bank loans, the 
main driving factor is likely to have been the more favourable financing conditions on the corporate bond market compared with loan 
interest rates.
Impact of low-  interest-  rate 
 environment and CSPP
With the sovereign debt crisis receding into the background and a very accommodative monet -
ary policy in place not just in the euro area but 
worldwide, yields on European government debt securities have fallen markedly in recent 
years. Yields on ten-  year Federal bonds (Bunds), 
which had already fallen to just under 2% at 
the end of 2013, saw an accelerated fall start -
ing in 2014 (see the chart on page 26), dipping to historical lows on several occasions and even Credit volume

The corporate bond purchase programme
On 10 March 2016, the Governing Council 
of the European Central Bank (ECB) adopted 
the corporate sector purchase programme 
(CSPP). The CSPP , under which corporate 
bonds of issuers domiciled in the euro area have been bought since 8 June 2016, there-
fore expanded the existing asset purchase programme which comprised the public sector purchase programme (PSPP), the covered bond purchase programme 3 (CBPP3) and the asset- backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP). The object-
ive of the CSPP is to improve the fi  nancing conditions of the real economy and provide 
additional monetary accommodation, thus 
contributing to an infl  ation rate of below, 
but close to, 2% over the medium term.
Six national central banks make the pur-chases on behalf of the Eurosystem. Each 
national central bank is responsible, with no 
overlap, for market segments that are de-
fi  ned by region according to the location of 
the respective issuer’s domicile (see the 
table on page 23). Accordingly, the Bundes-
bank purchases bonds of German enter-
prises and of enterprises domiciled in Ger-
many as well as bonds of their Dutch fi  nan-cing subsidiaries. As such securities are gen-erally risky, the central banks take risks onto 
their balance sheets when they purchase these bonds. Both the income as well as 
potential losses are distributed among all of 
the Eurosystem national central banks in proportion to their respective ECB capital 
shares.
Quality criteria for the purchase programme 
were defi  ned which securities must meet to qualify for purchase. The bonds have to be eligible as collateral for monetary policy op-erations, have minimum ratings from exter-nal credit rating agencies that are accepted by the Eurosystem and be denominated in 
euro. They must also satisfy further criteria 
such as minimum requirements for the re-
maining maturity. The criteria are checked before the purchases are made and apply 
to bonds purchased by the Bundesbank and by all other Eurosystem central banks which 
purchase corporate bonds under the CSPP . 
Additional precautions such as issue share 
limits are designed to mitigate the risks as-
sociated with the CSPP . Specifi  cally, under the CSPP the Eurosystem purchases only 
fi  xed- income securities with an investment-grade rating,
1 with a remaining maturity of 
more than six months and less than 31 years, which are denominated in euro, whose yield at the time of purchase is above the deposit facility rate and which were issued by an enterprise domiciled in 
the euro area. Not more than 70% of any 
issue may be purchased. The buyable uni-
verse includes bonds of issuers domiciled in the euro area, even if these are subsidiaries 
of enterprises that are domiciled outside the euro area. On the other hand, bank bonds and bonds issued by enterprises whose parent company is a bank are ex-cluded. Bonds issued by investment com-
panies are likewise not eligible for the pro-gramme.
2 Under the CSPP the Eurosystem is 
active in both the primary and the second-ary market. However, as with the PSPP , par-ticipation in primary market issues of public 
enterprises is not allowed, as purchases of 
this kind come under the prohibition of 
monetary fi  nancing pursuant to Article 123 
1 First- best rating of BBB- or better.
2 This includes, for example, resolution agencies, also known as “bad banks”.Deutsche Bundesbank

of the Treaty on the Functioning of the 
European Union.3
On 20 July 2017, the Eurosystem’s holdings 
under the CSPP reached a book value of 
€102.0 billion. Purchases by the Bundes-bank together accounted for around 24% 
of this amount. The actual purchase volume 
was somewhat higher, however, as re-
demptions during the life of the programme 
are reinvested in full. Holdings saw a fairly 
steady increase, rising by an average of 
around €7 billion per month. Seasonal fl  uc-
tuations in market liquidity, especially over 
the summer months and towards the end 
of the year, were taken into account when making purchases, however. This is because purchases are to be implemented with min-imal market impact.
Up to 20 July 2017, the Eurosystem had pur-
chased bonds worth €15.3 billion in the pri-
mary market. The Bundesbank accounted 
for €4.0 billion of that amount. The Bank’s 
share of primary market purchases was 16%, which was in line with the share for the Eu-
rosystem as a whole. Seasonal fl  uctuations in enterprises’ issuance behaviour are like-
wise taken into account when making pur-
chases. The fi  rst months of each year and 
the months following the summer break are 
considered to be the most active in enter-
prises’ issuance calendar. In addition, enter-
prises are subject to bond issuance restric-
tions in connection with the announcement 
of their quarterly results. Thus, the share of 
corporate bonds purchased in the primary market as a percentage of the overall vol-
ume of CSPP purchases during the summer 
months of 2016 was between 4% and 8%, but in September 2016 stood at 20%.
In order to minimise the potential negative 
liquidity effects, the Bundesbank as a gen-
eral principle makes holdings it has pur-
chased under the monetary policy pro-grammes available for securities lending. The Bundesbank has been a participant in Clearstream Banking Luxembourg’s (CBL) Automated Securities Lending (ASL) pro-
gramme since the beginning of April 2015. The ASL programme includes a fails lending 
service, which ensures that borrowers’ 
trades do not fail. Since 18 July 2016, CSPP holdings have been available through both 
ASL and CBL’s strategic lending facility 
ASLplus. ASLplus allows market participants 
to borrow these securities at a minimum spread above the current rate for general collateral. Lending transactions concluded under ASLplus are always cash- neutral, as 
collateral is only accepted in the form of se-curities. The maximum maturity of a secur-ities lending transaction is 35 days.

3 In this context, public undertakings are defi  ned in 
accordance with Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) 
No 3603/ 93 of 13 December 1993, under which all undertakings are deemed to be public in which the 
state, including regional and local authorities, may dir-ectly or indirectly exercise a dominant infl  uence. Such infl  uence may be wielded through ownership, fi  nancial participation or legal provisions. In addition to the ban on primary market activity, other provisions of the PSPP 
also apply such as a reduced maximum issue share 
limit of 33%.4 The list of purchased corporate bonds and of corpor-
ate bonds made available through the lending facility 
may be found at https:// www.bundesbank.de/ Redak-

falling into negative territory for a while. In the 
second quarter of 2015 (“Bund tantrum”) and 
in the second half of 2016 there were certain 
countermovements, but ultimately they did not 
last. Yields also rose again slightly towards the 
end of the reporting period. At roughly 0.4%, 
they are again above their record lows, but re-
main extraordinarily low by historical stand -
ards.
In the market for corporate bonds the decline 
in yields is likely to have influenced both supply-  
side and demand-  side factors. In order to check 
the extent to which the falling risk-  fr ee yields 
were accompanied by an increasing search for 
yield and thus an increase in demand, we 
examine the development of investors’ risk ap -
petite in the following. To this end, a principal component analysis is used to calculate an indi -
cator that extracts a common time-  variable de -
terminant from several individual indicators presumed to be relevant for estimating risk.
8 
This common factor can then be interpreted as a measure of risk aversion, which is set to the 
value of zero for the average of the reporting 
period – a period largely characterised by the 
financial and sovereign debt crisis as well as the 
low- interest-  rate policy.
According to the indicator, in 2011 and 2012, 
in an environment dominated by the sovereign 
debt crisis, investors demonstrated very high risk aversion, though this subsequently sub-sided (see the chart on page  26). Since the 
fourth quarter of 2013 there has been below-

corporate bondsPurchases should be as market- neutral as 
possible in order to minimise monetary policy- induced distortions. The purchases 
therefore take their bearings from both the 
liquidity of individual bonds in the second-
ary market and the structure of the market segment assigned to the Bundesbank. Here, the automotive sector makes up the largest share of the overall permissible market; this is refl  ected in the Bank’s CSPP portfolio. The 
next- largest sectors comprise the enter-
prises of the chemical industry and utilities. 
The three main sectors have a combined 
market share of around 60% of the permis-sible market as a whole.
As CSPP holdings grow, so too does the im-
portance of the Eurosystem as creditor. One 
important issue in this respect is the Euro-
system’s behaviour with regard to creditors’ meetings.
5 If the Eurosystem – in its role as 
creditor – were to exercise infl  uence on a fi  rm’s business policy, this would violate the principle of neutrality in implementing mon-etary policy. The Eurosystem is therefore at 
pains to remain as neutral as possible in 
such cases.
5 At a creditors’ meetings the issuer solicits the credit-
ors’ consent to amend key terms of a bond issue.

ent analysis, see the box in Deutsche Bundesbank, Con -
structing an aggregate risk appetite indicator with a princi -
pal component analysis, Monthly Report, August 2008, 
pp 38-39. The following individual indicators were factored 
into the analysis: the implied volatility of European shares 
(VSTOXX), the time-  varying corr elation between the returns 
on long-  term Bunds and the Euro Stoxx, the spreads of 
European BBB-  r ated corporate bonds, CDS spreads of 
European investment-  gr ade enterprises (iTraxx Europe) and

tite) for the vast majority of the time, with risk 
aversion exhibiting mostly sideways move -
ments during this period. The development of 
risk appetite measured in this way indicates 
that the search for yield may have played an important role for investors since roughly the 
fourth quarter of 2013. Together with the fall -
ing risk-  fr ee interest rates, this points to 
stronger demand for risky investments that 
offer a higher return than safe government 
bonds. In the case of corporate bonds, this additional demand is likely to be attributable, 
above all, to key institutional investors such as insurance companies and investment funds.
The finding of greater risk appetite is consistent 
with the market development described on 
pages 18 to 20. For example, the comparatively 
large proportion of high-  yield instruments  
among all outstanding bonds since 2014 points 
to a higher risk acceptance among investors. A 
further indication of this is the increasing will -
ingness in recent years to invest in long-  term  
bonds, which imply a higher interest rate risk 
than bonds with a short maturity.
By also leading to lower market-  based finan -
cing conditions for enterprises (see page 26) 
and thus more favourable conditions for invest -
ment, the falling risk-  fr ee interest rates are also 
likely to have had a positive impact on the sup-
ply of corporate bonds. Following the height of 
the sovereign debt crisis, corporate mergers 
and acquisitions again picked up as of 2014 in 
a capital market environment that was once 
again more favourable on the whole. In this 
context, there was advancing consolidation 
both within industries and across sectors. The 
financing needs associated with this were met partially through the issuance of bonds.
Issuing activity in the market for corporate 
bonds was also influenced by the CSPP (see the box on pages 22 to 24). Since 8 June 2016, the 
Eurosystem has purchased up to 70% of the issue volume of eligible corporate bonds. The 
programme, which is meant to positively influ-
ence economic activity and inflation develop -ments, contributed to falling yields and a de -
cline in risk premiums in the corporate bond market, particularly immediately following its 
announcement on 10 March 2016. Above all, 
however, it created additional scope for the is-
suance of bonds. In any case, it suggests that 
the subsequent rise in net issuance of non-  
financial corporate bonds is at least partly at -
tributable to the CSPP .
Admittedly, the CSPP was implemented in the 
knowledge that there could possibly be un -
desirable side effects, one of which – irrespect -
ive of the currently relatively favourable bank 
lending terms – is the risk of a bias in favour of 
companies that are active on the capital mar -
kets. This is because, for a firm’s bonds to be 
eligible for purchase under the CSPP , the firm has to be rated by an external credit assess -
ment institution (ECAI) that is licensed to oper -
ate in the euro area. For large firms which are 
already active in the international capital mar -
kets, this is generally not an additional burden. Further indica-

However, for smaller and medium-  sized enter -
prises which need lower funding volumes, the 
considerable costs of such an assessment are 
often not worthwhile. They therefore obtain 
most of their funding through bank loans and less in the capital markets. The Eurosystem thus 
influences firms’ funding opportunities in this 
manner more than it does using conventional 
monetary policy instruments. As a creditor to 
firms, it also takes on a new role when changes 
to material bond issuing terms are to be 
adopted at creditors’ meetings. This role can be 
at loggerheads with the principle that monet -
ary policy should retain a maximum of neutral -
ity, ie it should not impact on a firm’s business 
policy. In addition, there are risks to the Euro -
system’s balance sheet which, despite the en -
visaged risk mitigation measures, are greater 
than those involved in typical refinancing oper -
ations with credit institutions. Potential price 
distortions in the corporate bond markets are 
yet another undesirable effect, wherever cen -
tral bank purchases do not affect all bond prices equally and the prices that materialise no 
longer adequately reflect the risk inherent in 
the bonds.
Price aspects of market 
trends
The sale and acquisition of corporate bonds 
described above are closely intertwined with 
other market parameters such as yields, spreads 
and market liquidity. An estimate based on a 
regression analysis will therefore be performed 
to study the extent to which relevant financial 
market variables contribute to explaining yield 
movements. This study, which centres on the average change in yields over the reporting period, is subsequently augmented by a vari -
ance analysis which examines how strongly 
yields fluctuated over time and what these fluc -
tuations were attributable to.
Movements in yields, spreads 
and market liquidity
Non-  financial and financial corpor ate bond 
yields in the euro area fell sharply in the report -
ing period, mainly between autumn 2011 and 
spring 2015. Measured in terms of the Barclays 
broad indices, it was particularly yields on high-  
yield bonds, which had risen sharply in the cri -
sis period, which went back down. However, 
yields on investment-  gr ade bonds, having been 
as high as over 5% at the end of 2011, have 
likewise dipped perceptibly (see the chart on 
page 27).9 Factoring in the effects of the CSPP , 
among other things, yields have changed very 
little on balance since the spring of 2015; at last 
report, they stood at around 3.4% (high-  yield  
bonds) and 0.8% (investment-  gr ade bonds). 
These are exceptionally low yields by historical 
standards.Corporate bond

However, since yields on Bunds have likewise 
been falling and were negative up to the six-  
year segment at the end of the reporting 
period, the yield spreads of non-  financial and  
financial corporate bonds over Bunds of the 
same maturity dropped less sharply than cor -
porate bond yields. However, these spreads have also dipped perceptibly from their high 
levels of 2011, likewise particularly up until the 
spring of 2015. They currently stand at around 
390 basis points for high-  yield bonds and 9 5 
basis points for investment-  gr ade bonds. Along 
with the diminishing spreads for government 
bonds, the spreads of financial corporate bonds 
diminished more strongly than those of non-  
financial corporate bonds, leading to a percep -
tible narrowing of the yield gap between the 
two sectors. Both the spreads on investment-  
grade bonds and those on high-  yield bonds  
were, at last report, below their respective five-  
year averages – a sign of relatively high valu -
ation. All the same, the spreads are still above 
their respective early-2007, pre-  c risis levels, 
which at the time had narrowed comparatively 
sharply in the light of much higher risk-  fr ee 
interest rates.
Another way to find out more about the rela -
tive valuation level of corporate bonds is to 
compare their valuation trajectory with that of 
a model-  theor etical replicating portfolio com -
posed of the enterprise’s shares and risk-  fr ee 
bonds.10 Although such a comparison should 
be interpreted with caution because, among 
other things, the uncertainty of the model used 
needs to be factored in and some simplifying 
assumptions are made for calculating the repli -
cating portfolio,11 even despite this proviso, the 
relatively strong movements of the corporate 
bond valuations compared to a replicating 
portfolio (based on the Merton model) indicate that the relative valuation is more on the high side.
Given a high valuation, it is impossible to rule 
out the fact that particularly cautious private in -
vestors could be crowded out of the market if 
they no longer find such bonds attractive be -cause of the low level of yields. On the whole, 
this crowding-  out manifests itself in a growing 
appetite for risk on the part of the remaining 
market participants. Market liquidity, too, ie the simplicity of trading without major price volatil-
ity, could tend to have been impaired by the 
crowding-  out of some private investors. This  
could diminish the efficiency of capital alloca -
tion if less-relevant information were to be fac -
tored into prices as a result.Narrowing of

10 Such a replicating portfolio can be identified under the 
assumptions of the simple Merton (1974) model. In this 
model framework, the expected yield on a corporate bond corresponds to the safe yield, plus the equity risk premium 
weighted with the so-  cal led hedge ratio. The hedge ratio is 
the sensitivity of the enterprise’s debt to equity. For more 
on the relationship between corporate bonds, equities and 
safe bonds in the Merton model framework, see N Dötz, 
Decomposition of country-  specific corpor ate bond spreads, 
Deutsche Bundesbank Discussion Paper No 37/  2 014.
11 The model uncertainty results, for instance, from the 
(unrealistic) assumption that the markets for safe bonds, corporate bonds and equities are perfectly integrated. In 
addition, the Merton model only looks at the credit risk on a corporate bond, neglecting other empirically relevant fac -
tors such as liquidity premiums.Deutsche Bundesbank

Corporate bond bid-  ask spr eads have been 
moving largely in sync with yield spreads (see 
the chart above). Bid-  as k spreads are com -
monly interpreted as a measure of trading costs 
and an indicator of market liquidity. Seen in 
those terms, corporate bonds issued by 
euro-area enterprises appear considerably more 
liquid than in mid-2011, albeit somewhat less 
liquid than prior to the outbreak of the finan -
cial crisis in 2008.
However, when interpreting bid-  ask spr eads by 
historical standards, one must take into ac -
count the Eurosystem’s recent asset purchase 
programmes, which have made up a substan -
tial portion of the demand for corporate bonds – directly via the CSPP and indirectly via invest -
ors’ portfolio shifts from safe government 
bonds to higher-  risk instruments. The Eur osys-
tem’s demand is being driven in particular by the desire to enlarge its balance sheet and is 
therefore more price-  inelastic than demand on 
the part of private investors. This could have 
potentially contributed to compressing bid-  ask 
spreads in those cases where dealers, confident that they could sell instruments to the Eurosys -
tem, took them into their portfolios (temporar -
ily) even at relatively narrow spreads. Such be-haviour is plausible from an economic point of 
view because the asset purchase programmes 
mitigate the dealers’ resale risk. What this im -plies is that the currently relatively low bid-  ask 
spreads could be painting a comparatively posi -
tive picture of market liquidity which, however, 
might vanish quickly at the end of the asset purchase programmes and under market stress.
12 Thus, for instance, there are indica -
tions that specialised bond dealers, known as 
“market makers”, cut back their trading activ -
ities following the financial crisis. Market liquid -
ity could, in the process, have shifted away 
from relatively illiquid corporate bonds to liquid 
instruments such as benchmark sovereign 
bonds.13
Determinants of yield 
 movements
Corporate bond yields and relevant financial 
market variables (risk-  fr ee interest, interest rate 
uncertainty, European equity prices, sovereign 
CDS premiums, liquidity premiums, CSPP an -
nouncement) share a certain relationship with 
one another. This relationship can be captured statistically by means of a regression. The pro -
cedure therefore provides information on im -
portant reasons for yield movements over the 
reporting period. The yields on investment-  
grade bonds and high-  yield bonds ar e esti -
mated separately. For risk-  f ree interest rates, 
two alternative measures which are a standard 
feature in the literature are used: EONIA swap 
rates and Bund yields.14 Both the short-  term  
two- year inter est rate and the slope of the yield 
curve are incorporated into the regression.Corporate bond

For both investment-  gr ade bonds and high-  
yield bonds, the results of the estimations show 
that the falling yields can be explained in key 
measure by the following important factors: the diminishing effects of the sovereign debt crisis (falling sovereign CDS premiums), an in -
creasingly favourable capital market environ -
ment (rising equity prices and falling interest 
rate uncertainty) and the announcement of the 
CSPP . For instance, the announcement of the CSPP in March 2016 was enough to dampen 
yields by an estimated 7 to 9 basis points (see 
the adjacent table).15 The impact of the risk-  
free interest rate on yields was particularly 
strong. This applies to both measures of the 
risk- fr ee interest rate: EONIA swap rates (esti -
mation 1 in the adjacent table) and Bund yields 
(estimation 2). In this context, the overall im -
pact encompasses the significant positive ef -
fects exerted, separately, by the short-  term  
interest rate and the slope of the yield curve.
According to the results, the expansionary monetary policy contributed to more favour -
able market-  based funding conditions thr ough 
two channels: falling short-  term inter est rates 
and a flatter yield curve for all observed enter -
prises. The falling slope of the yield curve re -
flects, to a degree, the Eurosystem’s sovereign 
bond purchases. At the same time, it also re -
flects the economic outlook and international 
interest rate linkages such as the transatlantic 
interest rate relationship. The yield-  r educing ef -
fect of the CSPP on high-  yield bonds, which  
were exempted from this asset purchase pro -
gramme, could have been caused by substitu -
tion effects (portfolio rebalancing) on the part 
of investors, which also put pressure on the 
yields of assets that were not eligible for pur -
chase.
For investment-  gr ade corporate bonds, more -
over, a particularly good way of explaining their 
yields is in terms of the risk-  fr ee Bund yield as 
opposed to EONIA swap rates. This is reflected 
by the fact that the adjusted coefficient of de -
termination of Estimation 2 is higher than for 
Estimation 1.16 Corporate bond market invest -ors are apparently favouring Bunds, a low-  risk  
alternative investment vehicle, as a benchmark 
of the risk-  fr ee interest rate. This underlines the 
Bunds’ prominent role in the valuation of these

o The regression (estimated in differences) is based on daily data 
from 3 January 2011 to 7 July 2017. The dependent variable, the corporate bond yield, is measured in a broad index (Barclays 
Euro- Aggregate Corporates). EONIA_2y and Bund_2y are the 
two- year EONIA swap rates and 2-year Bund yields, respectively. Slope_EONIA and Slope_Bund denote the respective slope of the yield curve, calculated as the ten- year interest rate minus the two- year interest rate. European stock prices and interest uncer-tainty are measured, respectively, by the Euro Stoxx (Euro_Stoxx) and the implied volatility of options on the Bund future (Vola_
Bund). A GDP- weighted value of CDS premiums for key 
euro-area member states (Sovereign_CDS) functions as a meas-ure of sovereign CDS premiums. The announcement of the CSPP is captured through a dummy variable (CSPP). The liquidity pre-mium is measured as the yield spread between AAA bonds is-sued by European public sector authorities (Agencies) and Bunds (Spread_Agencies). * Signifi  cant at the 5% level.

15 This estimated impact on yields relates only to the an -
nouncement of the CSPP , excluding any additional effects 
of the actual corporate bond purchases.
16 An additional estimation provides further evidence of 
Bund yields’ greater explanatory power. This involves aug -
menting Estimation 1 with two regressors which reflect the 
difference between short-  t erm EONIA swap rates and 
Bund yields and the difference between the EONIA swap 
rate- r elated and Bund yield-  based slope of the yield curve. 
In this expanded estimation equation, both additional 
regressors   ar e significant, and the adjusted coefficient of 
determination rises to 0.52.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

itional estimations appear to indicate that this 
could also be the case for bonds issued by Ger -
man, French, Italian and Spanish enterprises.17 
The choice of metric for the risk-  fr ee interest 
rate, however, is of only minor relevance to ex -
plaining the yields on high-  yielding corpor ate 
bonds. This might reflect the fact that credit 
risk is a much more important factor in the 
valuation of these bonds.
Analysis of the yield variance 
in the corporate bond market
The period following 2011, characterised over -
all by falling yields, also encompasses episodes 
in which yields spiked multiple times, often se-
verely. Although these phases were ultimately 
only temporary, such yield fluctuations, which 
manifest themselves in the yield variance, do 
indicate the possibility of abrupt repricing. Ana -
lysing this variance can therefore provide key information on the functional viability and sta-bility of the corporate bond market.
In the analysis below, the yield variance of a 
broad index of financial and non-  financial Eur o-
pean corporate bonds will be estimated in a 
time-  varying manner . This index (source: 
BofA  Merrill Lynch Euro Corporate Index) is 
composed of 18 sector-  specific sub-  indices.18 
In order to identify key drivers of variance 
trends, it will also be decomposed into individ -
ual components based on the sub-  indices of  
the overall index.
At last report, yield variance was relatively low 
(see the adjacent chart). Throughout the refer -
ence period, three phases of heightened vari -
ance were identified: autumn to winter 2011, summer 2013 and summer 2015 to March 2016, reflecting temporary (abrupt) repricing. 
Higher liquidity premiums may have also played a role in the rising yields at the time. One sign 
of this is that bid-  ask spr eads moved largely in 
sync with yields (see the chart on page 28). An initial decomposition is run in order to ascertain to what degree the (weighted) variances of the 
individual sectors and the (weighted) covari -
ances between these sectors each contributed to the increase in variance.

to which bond price movements in a sector or 
a small group of sectors can affect the entire 
market.
The decomposition shows that the covariances 
between the sectors consistently made the 
greatest contribution to explaining overall vari -
ance. Although they made only a relatively 
minor contribution to the phase of high volatil -
ity between autumn and winter 2011-2012, 
which especially reflected higher volatility of bank bonds, they subsequently made a rela-
tively large contribution to explaining the 
periods of high volatility in summer 2013 and 
between summer 2015 and March 2016. The 
increased correlation between corporate bonds 
from various sectors reflected in these two epi -
sodes indicates, first of all, that sector-  specific  
information, such as economic and profit ex -
pectations, have receded into the background 
with regard to price movements in the sub-  in-
dices. One possible cause is that the import -
ance of sector-  specific developments took a 
back seat to aggregate economic develop -
ments. What it also indicates, however, is that 
investors have become less discriminating in 
their investment decisions. This could have 
been caused by a search for yield given the 
low- inter est-  r ate setting and market-  wide “safe 
haven” flows during periods of heightened un -
certainty. Price spreads between real sector 
corporate bonds could, lastly, also have been 
caused by the Eurosystem’s CSPP .
A further decomposition of the overall variance 
into contributions by financial and non-  financial 
enterprises shows that financial corporate 
bonds made a significant contribution to the 
high-  v olatility period between autumn and 
winter 2011. Their explanatory contribution to 
the overall variance, however, has been dimin -
ishing distinctly since mid-2012. On that note, 
the high-  volatility periods in summer 2 013 and 
especially between summer 2015 and March 
2016 are more readily attributable to real sector 
corporate bonds. This implies a declining im -
pact of financial corporate bonds on the overall 
variance and thus a lower probability that risks in the financial sector will spill over to the mar -
ket as a whole.
On the whole, however, the rise in the correl -
ation between corporate bonds from various 
sectors reflects a higher risk that a potential re -
pricing of corporate bonds could result in the 
entire market being affected. It is essential that this risk be continuously monitored, particularly 
after the end of the CSPP .
Summary and conclusions
Both supply and demand factors contributed to 
the strong growth in the market for European corporate bonds over the past few years. One 
of the supply factors is that, particularly in 
some periphery countries, a host of non-  
financial corporations probably diversified their 
sources of funding during the crisis years by substituting bank loans with bonds. This was 
one way in which the bond market helped to 
cushion the adverse impact of the financial and 
sovereign debt crisis for the real economy. As 
the crisis subsided, enterprises continued their 
brisk bond issuance activity; one key reason for 
this was that, as risk-  fr ee interest rates fell, 
market-  based funding conditions impr oved sig -
nificantly. On the demand side, there are some signs that investors’ risk appetite has been ris -
ing in the past few years. This, along with the 
corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) launched by the Eurosystem in 2016, has 
stoked demand for corporate bonds.
As the sovereign debt crisis has faded into the 
background, risk-  fr ee interest rates have fallen 
and the capital market environment have be -
come increasingly favourable, yields and 
spreads have diminished considerably and are 
currently indicating a relatively high valuation 
level. At the same time, the correlation be -
tween corporate bond yields from a variety of 
sectors has increased, which could be a sign that investors are being less discriminating in 
how they choose individual bonds. From a cen -
tral bank perspective, the risk that this behav -Overall variance

iour will ultimately impact negatively on the 
efficiency of the capital markets and capital al -
location will require ongoing analysis.
There are some factors which point to further 
market growth going forward. For instance, 
enterprises which went to the trouble – such as 
by creating the conditions for a rating – for the first time to issue a bond in the past few years could be encouraged to replace bank lending 
by bonds in the long haul. Ongoing balance 
sheet consolidation in the banking sector could 
amplify such disintermediation. In addition, political efforts by the EU, such as moves to 
dismantle barriers to European bond market in -
tegration and to improve transparency be -
tween different sets of national rules, could 
also support market growth.Market could

The development of government interest 
expenditure in Germany and other 
 euro-area countries
Interest rate developments in recent years have been a major source of relief for government 
budgets in the euro-area countries. Most of them saw their interest burdens contract on the back 
of cheaper borrowing terms despite some having substantially increased their debt ratios. The 
average rate of interest on government debt has hit a low, including for countries whose risk pre -
miums surged for a time in the wake of the financial and economic crisis. If the average interest 
rate were, for example, still at its pre-  crisis level, inter est expenditure, viewed in isolation, for the 
past year alone would have been higher by almost 2% of nominal gross domestic product (GDP) 
for the euro area. Since 2008, this downturn in interest charges has yielded savings of almost €1 trillion, or a little short of 9% of euro-area GDP.
The very advantageous borrowing terms available currently will probably provide continued relief 
for government budgets for a time. Yet fiscal policymakers would nonetheless be wise to make provisions for when interest rates bounce back. One fundamental objective anchored in the Sta -
bility and Growth Pact is that governments be required to achieve structural budgetary positions 
which are at least close to balance. Achieving that goal swiftly would go a long way towards 
reining in what are still very high debt ratios overall and trimming both interest burdens and any risk premiums. However, the most recent figures show that consolidation progress (measured in terms of the structural primary balance) has largely ground to a halt – probably partly because of the sustained favourable borrowing terms. But high debt ratios represent a lingering threat for public finances, given the mounting risk that a rate reversal might erode confidence in the sus -
tainability of individual countries’ public finances, and not least that monetary policymakers 
might then be pressured to respond.
Germany’s public finances are in a relatively advantageous position. Yet it is nonetheless appro -
priate for the country to run moderate structural surpluses in light of its still-  high debt ratio and 
the demographic outlook. The unusually favourable financing terms should not be expected to 
persist indefinitely; it is worth noting that central and state government have already made pro -
visions for an uptick in interest rates in their medium-  term plans. One notable risk factor facing 
the Federal budget is the current convention of fully netting premiums and discounts directly 
against interest expenditure when issuing Federal securities. This causes considerable volatility during budget implementation and is incompatible with the European fiscal accounting rules. 
One option here would be to switch to the accrual accounting method. In light of factors includ -
ing the looming burden of pension costs, state and local government would be wise to pursue an ambitious fiscal path until budgetary solidity has been achieved at both these levels of govern-
ment. Otherwise, mounting interest rates might expose debt-  ridden entities in particular to the  
risk of resurgent fiscal imbalances.Deutsche Bundesbank

Low rates provide relief 
for government budgets
Government debt levels increased substantially 
in the wake of the financial and economic cri -
sis, and also peaked relative to GDP , with ad -
verse cyclical factors, an expansionary fiscal policy stance in many countries, and govern-ment measures designed to stabilise financial 
markets all playing a part in this rise. While Ger -
many saw its debt ratio decline distinctly after 
2010, levels have yet to recede noticeably in a 
number of other euro-area countries. In spite 
of that, the exceptionally low interest rates of 
the past few years, which are partly down to 
the crisis, have substantially reduced the cost of 
servicing debt, giving governments crucial as -
sistance in scaling back their deficits. For the majority of countries, borrowing costs, the average rate of interest on government debt, 
and government interest expenditure as a ratio 
of GDP are the lowest they have ever been in 
the history of the monetary union.
Definitions and selected 
 statistical and economic 
 aspects
The main variables which determine the level of government interest expenditure are the 
debt level and the interest payable on that debt 
(see the box on pages  35 and 36 for defin -
itions).1 One notable factor for determining the 
interest burden is the effective average interest rate for each individual debt instrument. In the -
ory, that rate can be subdivided into a risk-  fr ee 
real interest rate, an inflation component 
(which also comprises expectations) as well as 
maturity and risk premiums. Following this 
logic, bonds with a longer maturity and a lower trading volume, say, will normally be remuner -
ated at a higher rate of interest because invest -
ors expect to be compensated for a higher risk of changes in value and limited market liquidity. The borrower’s expected ability and willingness to repay the debt have a major bearing on the 
credit quality assessment and the size of any risk premium. Indicators for this include the ex -
pected (structural) fiscal deficit, the borrowing 
requirement and the debt level (including con -
tingent liabilities), but it is also worth gauging a 
sovereign’s macroeconomic and political pro -
spects. Other potential indicators include the 
credibility of fiscal rules and the expectation of assistance being provided by third parties.
Interest rate terms for current government bor -
rowing are normally driven by supply and de -
mand conditions in the capital market. Yet the 
overall interest burden of government in a 
given year is determined not by the prevailing 
interest rate but by the average rate of interest 
resulting from past borrowing in relation to the 
aggregate debt stock. The average rate of 
interest and interest expenditure show a lagged 
response to interest rate developments in the 
capital markets. The higher the gross borrow -
ing requirement, which is to say, the shorter 
the residual maturity and the higher the deficits 
which need funding, then the quicker expend -
iture will respond to rate changes. In the case 
of floating rate agreements, expenditure will 
always adjust quite promptly to changes in the 
relevant reference rate, regardless of maturity.
One notable yardstick for measuring how much 
of a burden interest expenditure is for public 
finances is the ratio of interest expenditure to 
GDP (known as the interest expenditure ratio). 
Economic output is ultimately also the basis for 
government (tax) revenue, from which debts 
need to be serviced. It is important to note that a high level of government debt not only auto -
matically implies larger interest charges for 
government, but that it also has a bearing on 
macroeconomic developments themselves.2 
On the one hand, a high level of government 
debt can, for instance, give rise to risk pre -
miums and uncertainties on the whole. When Only some

Defi  nitions of general government debt and interest 
 expenditure in the statistics for Germany
Defi  nition of the general government 
sector
The general government sector is defi  ned in 
almost identical terms in the harmonised 
European System of Accounts (national ac-
counts) and the national government fi  nance 
statistics (budgetary statistics1). It not only 
comprises the core budgets of central, state 
and local governments as well as the social 
security funds (which are not generally per-
mitted to borrow), but also their off- budget 
entities, such as bad banks, which count as 
part of the general government sector.
Defi  nition of debtAccording to the national accounts and the 
government fi  nance statistics, government 
debt comprises, in the fi  rst instance, short 
and long- term debt securities and loans for 
budget fi  nancing, as well as bridging loans 
(cash or liquidity advances). The consoli-
dated general government debt is adjusted for the securities holdings of other govern-ment units and for intra- government credit 
operations. The “Maastricht debt level”, 
which is relevant to budgetary surveillance 
in the euro area, also includes liabilities 
from circulation coins (issued as currency by 
general government) and from other de-posits with general government. Liabilities 
such as those arising from holding arrange-
ments with Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau 
(KfW)2 or for public- private partnerships 
(PPPs) are also included if it is assumed that 
general government bears the majority of the associated opportunities and risks or exerts a signifi  cant infl  uence. Liabilities for 
assistance loans to euro-area countries such as Greece that are backed by German guar-
antees and were paid out formally by KfW or the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) also count towards the Maastricht 
debt level.3 This also applies to certain loans 
granted by public promotional banks 
where, in particular, central government or 
state governments directly bear the major-
ity of the risks and set the framework con-
ditions of the transactions. The Maastricht 
debt level likewise encompasses the cash collateral provided to general government under derivatives contracts,
4 the payment 
obligations (to offset infl  ation) connected with infl  ation- linked securities and also, under certain conditions, accounts pay-
able.5 By contrast, premiums received in as-
sociation with new issues of securities, for 
example, which are to be paid back over 
time through higher coupon amounts, are

counts is converted into data showing payment fl  ows.
2 These types of agreement were concluded by central 
government to sell shares in its public limited com-
panies. Although KfW paid an acquisition price, central 
government retained the right to any additional rev-
enue generated from the later, fi  nal sale to the private sector. In the national accounts, this is booked as cen-tral government borrowing from KfW (which is not as-signed to the government sector). Not only the associ-
ated interest expenditure, but at the same time the 
dividend income from the public limited companies, is allocated to central government.3 By comparison, loans issued via the European Stabil-ity Mechanism (ESM) are not allocated to the member 
states, particularly because it is deemed to have its own risk- bearing capacity on the basis of the capital paid in by the creditor countries. See Deutsche Bun-
desbank, The development of government interest ex-
penditure in Germany, Monthly Report, September 
2013, pp 47-67.4 In addition, potential credit components (which, for 
instance, provide for an infl  ow of funds when the agreement is concluded, to be paid back at a later 
date) contained in derivatives contracts are included in the debt level.
5 Accounts payable arise through the acceptance of 
payment terms for purchases of goods or services. However, they only count as debt under the Maas-
tricht rules if, say, important payment conditions have 
been renegotiated or if they have been sold on through factoring without recourse. Likewise, long- term fi  nancing agreements should be recorded as 
credit liabilities.Deutsche Bundesbank

excluded from the debt amount – which is 
actually inconsistent with the basic ap-
proach adopted.6
Other liabilities, such as outstanding tax re-
funds or entitlements to pension benefi  ts, 
are not taken into account in the debt level. 
As long as general government has scope 
to make adjustments with respect to such 
obligations, for example by changing the 
statutory retirement age or benefi  t level, 
this type of approach seems reasonable.
Maastricht debt is recorded at redemption 
value (nominal value). A rise in the market 
value of outstanding debt instruments 
caused by a considerable decline in interest 
rates is thus not refl  ected in the level of 
debt. This is also different from the proced-
ure usually otherwise adopted in the na-tional accounts. In the fi  nancial accounts, 
for instance, securities liabilities are reported at market value.
Defi  nition of interest expenditure
Interest expenditure in the government fi  -
nance statistics refers to current debt ser-
vicing expenditure. This encompasses pay-
ments to central, state and local govern-ments and special funds, which are to be consolidated for the general government 
overview, as well as payments to the capital 
market.7 In addition to the regular interest 
payments on loans or securities, issue pre-
miums or discounts for newly issued secur-
ities, accrued interest to be paid on issues 
after the coupon date, as well as payments 
relating to interest rate swaps or other de-
rivatives contracts have, to date, also gener-ally been recorded in full at the time of pay-ment under the relevant item in the govern-
ment fi  nance statistics and have an effect 
on the fi  scal balance.The national accounts, on the other hand, 
are based on the accrual principle. Whereas, 
for example, coupon payments for secur-ities issued at the beginning of the year with annual interest payments would not result in any costs in the government fi  -
nance statistics to begin with, the national 
accounts already attribute the claims arising over the course of the year to this period.
8 
Losses or gains from swaps are generally 
classifi  ed as fi  nancial transactions in the na-
tional accounts and thus do not have an 
impact on the fi  scal balance. Accrued inter-
est received does not affect the fi  scal bal-
ance either. The infl  ows are treated as liabil-
ities, and the counter effect at the time of 
the next coupon payment retains a neutral 
effect on the balance in the form of a re-
payment. Premiums and discounts are dis-
tributed over the years to maturity on an 
accrual basis in the national accounts.
There are further differences to interest ex-
penditure in the government fi  nance statis-
tics owing to the fact that, in the national 
accounts, some of the interest costs are con-
sidered fi  nancial intermediation services in-
directly measured (FISM) in connection with lending. These are not taken into account in 
property income paid, but are assigned to the category “intermediate consumption”. 
They thus have an effect on GDP . To provide 
a comprehensive overview of the burden 
created by debt servicing, this item is there-fore also included here for Germany.
6 According to this approach, discounts would have to 
be recognised as a reduction because they refl  ect 
lower future coupon payments in comparison to the issue yield. Upon payment of these coupons, the 
shortfalls compared to market conditions would have 
to be factored in as increasing the debt level.7 However, this also includes interest to social security 
funds, which are allocated in full to the general gov-
ernment sector, and to public- sector enterprises and institutions of which selected entities (attributable to 
the general government sector) are to be consolidated but are not recorded separately in the publications.8 In the national accounts, interest costs are recorded under property income paid.Deutsche Bundesbank

an economy has a generally higher level of 
interest rates, private investment may be 
crowded out, which would have a negative im -
pact on potential growth, especially. Should additional tax revenue be needed to cover 
higher interest charges, the distortions this pro-
duces can further dent that economy’s growth. 
On the other hand, borrowing to steady macro -
economic developments (owing to the effect 
of automatic stabilisers) or to overcome a se -
vere crisis can stimulate growth as long as the 
capital markets do not lose faith in the general 
robustness of the country’s public finances.
A more detailed picture of the impact of 
changes in interest rates on the government 
budget and other variables can be obtained by 
factoring in property income received on the revenue side. Financial assets such as partici -
pating interests in enterprises or loan claims are 
a source of profit distributions or interest in -
come3 – and this is an area where central bank 
profits also come into play. However, generat -
ing streams of financial income is not normally the main reason why governments accumulate 
financial assets: returns are sometimes low (eg 
those on development loans or assets acquired 
as part of financial market support measures) 
and often bear little relation to capital market 
developments. Besides property income, rev -
enue from the taxation of interest income also 
offsets interest expenditure to a degree. All 
told, these factors normally soften the impact 
of changes in interest rates on public finances. 
Nonetheless, their effect is mostly relatively 
muted at present because of the very high debt 
levels.
Development of government 
interest expenditure 
in  Germany
General government4
Germany’s general government debt ratio has 
risen significantly in recent decades, first 
breaching the 60% Maastricht debt ceiling in 2003. Peaking at 81% in 2010 in the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis, it then fell back sharply on the back of favourable macro -
economic and fiscal developments
5 and the re -
duction of the portfolios acquired to stabilise 
the financial markets. Even so, Germany’s debt 
level at the end of 2016, under the Maastricht 
definition, still lingered at 68¼% of GDP .
Government interest expenditure as a ratio of 
GDP , meanwhile, peaked back in the mid-1990s at 3½%, before gradually working its way back 
to 2¾% by the middle of the last decade. After 
remaining stable for a brief period, the decline 
continued in 2010, accelerating in the past few 
years. At last count, the ratio stood at 1½%.
The fact that the interest expenditure ratio di -
minished noticeably after 1999, even though 
the debt ratio continued to show trend growth 
initially, is due to the significant drop in the 
average interest rate. Pushed in part by higher 
expected inflation and growth to 8% in the 
early 1990s, the average rate of interest then 
began to chart a distinct decline. This under -
lying trend was weakened for a time by higher 
borrowing costs during upbeat economic spells 
(like at the turn of the millennium), and the 
average interest rate hovered at around 4¼% 
for a number of years from the middle of the 
last decade. But the downward motion re -
sumed in 2009, bringing the average interest 
rate on Germany’s Maastricht debt level down 
to just 2% last year.Interest expend-
iture offset at least in part by government property income

3 The bulk of non-  financial assets, such as r oads and 
schools, do not generate any property income. Where they do generate specific receipts, these are chiefly fee income flows.4 Government interest expenditure is presented for general 
government in Germany following the national accounts approach, plus financial intermediation services indirectly 
measured (FISIM) (see the box on pp 35-36). While FISIM 
had a magnitude of €5¾ billion, or nearly 0.3% of GDP , in 
1999, a trend decline into the middle of the last decade 
reduced that figure to €¾ billion (0.02% of GDP) in 2016.5 During this period, the fiscal policy stance tended to be 
neutral overall, while the economic recovery, strong tax 
revenue growth, healthy labour market developments and 
dwindling interest burdens ultimately made it possible to 
achieve the current surplus.Deutsche Bundesbank

To get an idea of just how much arithmetical 
fiscal relief the lower interest rates have yielded 
in recent years, one need only look at the im-
pact of the shrinking average interest rate6 in 
isolation. This decline meant that interest ex -
penditure in 2016 was half of what it had been 
in the pre-  crisis year of 2 007.7 Last year alone, 
the savings this yielded for general govern -
ment, calculated on the basis of the current 
debt level, came to €47 billion, or 1½% of GDP . 
In cumulative terms, the interest expenditure 
relief generated since 2008 comes to €240 bil -
lion, which equates to 7½% of last year’s GDP .
Only a rough estimate of the future path of 
government interest expenditure – eg depend -
ing on various interest rate scenarios – is pos -
sible because the available information is in -
complete, notably on the scale and the terms 
for rolling over maturing debt instruments and 
interest rate adjustment clauses.8 However, 
since issue yields have so far fallen well short of 
the remuneration on maturing identical-  maturity securities, the average interest rate 
looks set to recede further until interest rates 
go perceptibly into reverse. The German stabil -
ity programme from April 2017 expects the interest expenditure ratio to decrease again 
next year before moving more or less sideways. 
Assuming a fall in the debt-  to-  GDP ratio, this 
would mean that the average interest rate, 
after slipping back one final time this year, will 
gradually start picking up again, albeit to a 
limited extent overall, in 2019, rising to roughly 2% at the end of the projection period in 2021. 
The stability programme thus assumes that capital market rates will climb distinctly from 
their current very low levels, which means that 
discernible provision has been made for rising 
interest rates.
The sensitivity of government finances to inter -
est rates can be gauged by simulating how 
spending would increase if capital market rates 
were one percentage point higher, say, than in 
a benchmark scenario. In this situation, the 
additional costs, in cash terms, would normally come to bear one year later on the next inter -
est due date of newly issued paper. Initially, 
these costs are particularly high year-on-year 
because short-  term debt is quickly r olled over. 
Given a one-  p ercentage-  p oint interest rate in -
crease, the additional outlay, in cash terms, for 
general government (assuming annual coupon 
payments) is thus estimated9 to come to just 
over €5 billion in the following year, rising by 
slightly more than €2 billion again a year later 
and by just over €1½ billion annually after that.

remain unchanged) would run up additional Drop in average

8 Debt statistics on the maturity of debt instruments for 
the general government budget are currently only available 
as at year-  e nd 2015. Furthermore, these data provide no 
information on local government cash advances, for ex -
ample, which have interest rate lock-  in periods of up to ten 
years. The terms of maturing liabilities are another signifi -
cant factor, but these are unknown for loans.9 Based on figures from the debt statistics for 2015.Deutsche Bundesbank

annual spending of €21½ billion. Almost all the 
debt would have been rolled over at the new 
terms after ten years. However, the majority of 
the 30-year Federal bonds, which make up 
some 10% of general government debt, would 
then still need to be rolled over.10
However, it is not only government’s interest spending which has been dampened by the 
lower interest rates, but also property income 
on the revenue side. Stock changes are a major factor for the latter as well, given that a num -
ber of bad banks were established in the wake 
of the financial crisis. Their liabilities count to -
wards the Maastricht debt level, so the corres -
ponding assets are also recognised as govern -
ment financial assets, sending their level signifi -
cantly higher. The still ongoing process of 
winding up the bad banks, and repayments of 
capital which government injected into banks 
in the crisis have pushed government financial 
assets (and debt) down again in recent years, 
however. All in all, government financial assets 
(at market prices) as a ratio of GDP climbed 
from 23½% in the middle of the last decade to 
38½% by 2012, partly due to the establishment 
of the resolution entities, before falling back to 
the current level of 36½%. Income from finan -
cial assets (defined here as meaning property 
income received excluding rental receipts) rose 
initially, but has fallen back noticeably of late, 
partly on account of dwindling Bundesbank11 
profit distributions. All told, this property in -
come as a ratio of GDP first increased from al -
most ¾% in the pre-  crisis year of 2007 to just 
shy of 1% in 2011, before falling back to a little more than ½% last year. Property income set in 
relation to interest expenditure, meanwhile, 
climbed until 2014, and levelled off recently at 
just over two-  fifths of interest paid.Dwindling prop-

As multiple factors (such as the declining profits 
of power supply companies or special depreci-
ation) feed into government property income 
received, this item is normally less correlated to changes in capital market rates than is the case with interest expenditure. What this would also 
suggest, going forward, is that the Bundesbank 
profit, for instance, will no longer be positively 
correlated to rising interest rates for a time, 
given the implementation of non-  s tandard 
monetary policy measures (see also the box on pages 58 to 60).
12 All things considered, while 
the impact of interest rate volatility on interest 
expenditure will probably continue to meet 
with countervailing developments on the rev -
enue side, the latter look set to be a much less 
weighty factor in terms of volume.
Selected aspects of central 
government’s interest 
 expenditure
Among the levels of government, the most de-
tailed information on financing terms is avail -
able for central government, which, together 
with its off-  budget entities, accounts for six-  
tenths of general government interest expend-
iture.13 Based on the Federal Ministry of Fi -
nance’s annual borrowing reports, various as -
pects of the decline in the interest expenditure 
of central government (including the off-  
budget entities it funds14) can be presented in 
more detail. A glance at the average yields on 
newly issued debt instruments, for example, 
shows how pronounced the decreases were in 
the past few years. In 2007, before the onset of 
the financial and economic crisis, these yields still stood at a little over 4% on average, 
whereas over the following years they dropped 
to around ¾% from 2012. As in many western 
countries, a key contributor to this was the 
trend decline in the general interest rate level, 
which itself was down to a variety of factors. 
Furthermore, in 2015, after the launch of the 
ESCB’s expanded asset purchase programme, 
interest rates even entered negative territory in 
some cases, extending into the medium-  term  maturity range. On average in 2015, a figure of 
just under ¼% was reached – very beneficial 
for the government coffers – and was even fol -
lowed in 2016 by a negative value. Afterwards, 
too, yields on Federal securities remained ex -
ceptionally low. In the June auction of Treasury 
discount paper with a maturity of six months, 
for example, a negative issue yield of a little 
under -0.7% was achieved. Five-  year F ederal 
notes were issued with a -0.5% yield this 
spring, while in July the reported yield was as 
little as -0.1%. For 30-year Federal bonds, a low 
of 0.5% was reached last year. In June 2017, 
the issue yield stood at 1.0%.
Since 2006, central government has also offered 
inflation-  linked debt instruments, which cur -
rently run to a total volume of €70 billion. For 
these instruments, the coupon and repayment 
amount are adjusted for inflation as measured 
by a consumer price index for the euro area as a 
whole.15 The unexpectedly low rates overall in 
the past few years have thus provided distinct 
relief to the Federal budget. To make provision 
for the inflation-  adjusted final payments, centr al 
government set up a special fund in 2009 to 
which – after a back payment for the preceding 
years – the relevant transfers are made on an 
accrual basis.16 These are recorded in the budget 
as interest expenditure in the relevant years, … but less 
 
correlated to capital market rates than debt servicing

linked 
debt instruments helped ease pressure
12 Tax revenue from interest income is positively correl -
ated, ceteris paribus, to general interest rate developments, 
but they are only correlated up to a point with Germany‘s 
general government interest expenditure. Receipts from withholding tax on interest income and capital gains 
shrunk from 0.5% of GDP in 2009, the year that tax was 
introduced, to 0.2% of GDP in 2016.
13 Of the remainder, just over three-  quarters is accounted 
for by state government and just under one-  quarter by  
local government.
14 Particularly the investment and repayment fund (with 
outstanding liabilities in the region of €20 billion, or just 
under 2% of central government debt), but excluding the 
bad bank set up while rescuing Hypo Real Estate, which 
accounts for roughly one-  tenth of total centr al government 
debt.
15 Investor protection against higher inflation remains in -
complete, however, insofar as the settlement payment 
upon redemption (like nominal coupon payments, which 
for conventional bonds contain a lump-  sum inflation adjust -
ment) is taxed as interest income (see also the article en -
titled “Return on private financial assets taking into account 
inflation and taxes” in this Monthly Report, pp 69-75).
16 In 2015, however, the Federal budget received a repay -
ment on balance, as the reference index fell.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

which is the correct economic approach and 
conforms with reporting of these figures in the 
national accounts. According to the budget 
plan, a transfer of just under €¼ billion will suf -
fice for this year. For the next few years, inflation 
rates are expected to remain moderate in the 
financial markets, judging by issue yields. Over -
all, the share of outstanding central government 
debt accounted for by inflation-  linked instru -
ments has grown distinctly over the past few 
years, but still remained within limits at around 
6% at the end of 2016. Provisioning for redemp -
tions amounted to €2½ billion. Settlement pay -
ments of €3½ billion had been made from the 
special fund in the meantime, however.
Against the backdrop of reduced issue yields, 
the average rate of interest on central govern -
ment debt, as defined in the national accounts, 
also contracted significantly. From a starting 
point of just over 4% in 2007, the last year be -
fore the crisis, the rate fell rapidly, especially at 
the end of the last decade, to just over 3%, 
which was followed by a relatively even further 
decline up to the current end. In 2016, the 
average rate of interest was no higher than al -
most 2%. Central government’s interest ex -
penditure (including the off-  budget entities)  
came to €26½ billion last year. Given an aver -
age interest rate at the pre-  crisis level, centr al 
government’s interest expenditure would have 
been €30 billion (1% of GDP) higher last year. 
Calculated in this way, the cumulative saving 
since 2008 runs to €155 billion.
On balance, the declining average interest rate 
was not helped by a reduction in the average 
interest rate lock-  in period, which, taken in isol -
ation, generally (for an upward-  pointing yield 
curve) facilitates lower average yields. Instead, 
the lock-  in period rose over the past few years. 
Having stood at just over 5¾ years in 2007 (pre-  
crisis), the lock-  in period hit almost 6 ¾ years in 
2016,17 a high level by historical standards. Cen -
tral government is evidently trying to lock in the 
extraordinarily low interest rates for a longer 
period, after having temporarily shortened the 
lock- in period marked ly in 2009, during the crisis.For the Federal budget (including the off-  
budget entities funded by central government, 
the interest expenditure of which recently came 
to only around one-  twentieth of that in the  
core budget), future developments in total 
interest expenditure can be roughly estimated 
for a variety of financing assumptions on the basis of the maturities and terms and condi -
tions of listed securities. If current capital mar -
ket conditions were to persist – as a hypothet-
ical reference line of largely interest-  fr ee finan -
cing  – interest expenses would continue to 
shrink in subsequent years, under the assump -
tion of an unchanged level of debt18 and of re -
financing obtained with the same original ma -
turity. Based on a 2016 starting level of around Clearly falling

17 Both figures factor in the limited effects, on balance, of 
swap agreements on this. The cost or saving these entail 
for the budget cannot be quantified on the basis of the data published by central government, however. In the 
Federal budget, for example, the effects of swaps are only 
reported together with the interest payments for the re -
spective debt instruments. In the national accounts, swaps 
generally have no impact on the fiscal balance. Payments 
resulting from swaps are categorised as financial transac -
tions and thus are excluded here.18 The plan for a balanced budget, ie no net borrowing in 
the budget, only relates to the core Federal budget. How-
ever, the planned deficits in the off-  budget entities, which 
are counted towards the debt brake, are offset by sur-
pluses in the precautionary special fund for pension costs. 
Depleting the reserves in order to finance the budget 
would, however, drive up debt – after the debt level was

be roughly halved successively up until 2022.
A deterioration from today’s financing terms, however, would slow down or even reverse 
this process. By way of example, a one percent -
age point increase in financing costs from the 
middle of this year would roughly halve the 
aforementioned annual additional saving from 
the first coupon payments for the new – higher-  
yielding – debt instruments (ie basically with a 
one- y ear delay). A rise of two percentage 
points would lead to slightly increasing add -
itional expenditure, although even in 2021 (the final year of the financial plan) interest expend -
iture would be only moderately higher, rela -
tively, than the actual 2016 figure (adjusted for 
premiums). The benchmark figures for central 
government’s financial plan (excluding the off-  
budget special funds) adopted in March 2017 
indicate an estimate for 2021 that is roughly €2 
billion lower than the actual figure for 2016, 
adjusted for premiums.19 Thus, discernible pro -
vision has been made for interest rate rises in 
the capital markets. However, any discounts 
that arise in this connection when issuing debt instruments could, because they are accounted for immediately as expenditure, lead to consid-
erable budgetary strains in the short term. For 
fundamental reasons, it would be advisable to change the current convention for recording discounts and premiums in the budget (for more information, see the box on pages  43 
and 44).
Selected aspects of state and 
local government interest 
 expenditure
For both state and local government, national 
accounts data on interest expenditure are avail-
able at the aggregate level only. However, the 
development of average interest rates over the 
last decade (for both levels of government to -
gether) differs only immaterially from that of 
central government; since 2007, the last year 
before the crisis, there has been a contraction 
from 4¼% to just over 2% recently. The (Maas-
tricht) debt ratio of state and local government 
initially rose from just over 25% to a little more 
than 30% by 2012 (partly in connection with 
the establishment of a government resolution 
agency for WestLB). Thereafter, the ratio slid 
back to the pre-  crisis level by the end of 2016.
On balance, state and local government have 
also benefited considerably from the very fa -
vourable interest rate level, and the interest burden has fallen sharply. Against an average 
interest rate unchanged since 2007, nearly €17 
billion in interest expenditure was saved, cor -
responding to just under 3½% of total expend-
iture in 2016. The strong savings were a consid-
erable aid to the consolidation of state and 
local government finances.20 Under these con-… reveal essen-

19 Besides interest payments, the debt servicing section 
contained in the Federal budget also includes calls on guar -
antees, for which major fluctuations are not normally en -
visaged (but which are not presented separately in the 
benchmark figures). For premiums and discounts on issu -
ance, usually only minor amounts are budgeted.
20 In a commercial (double-  entry) bookkeeping system,  
however, a counter effect on profit/loss in the pension pro -
visions also has to be recognised. When interest rates are 
low, future   bur dens are much heavier from today‘s per -
spective, which means that greater precautions have to be 
taken by building up provisions. For local government at 
least, which largely uses double-  entry bookkeeping, this  
entails expenses which are substantial in some cases (but 
which are not visible in the national accounts data).Deutsche Bundesbank

Distortive accounting of premiums and discounts
in the Federal budget
The way that interest expenditure is cur-
rently recorded in the Federal budget means 
that this budgetary position is volatile and 
diffi   cult to accurately forecast. The secur-
ities issued have regular coupon payments 
that are spread evenly over the term. If the 
coupons are not in line with the current 
market interest rates when the bonds are issued, this results in corresponding pre-miums or discounts on the issue price. These are recorded in the budget in full when the instrument is issued as negative 
or positive interest expenditure. A premium 
thus effectively eases pressure on the cur-rent budget at the expense of budgets in 
subsequent years in which, all other things 
being equal, higher interest payments are to be made (in line with the higher cou-
pons). Discounts have the opposite effect.
There are generally not too many premiums 
and discounts on new issuances if these are 
made at market rates. However, the desire 
for greater market liquidity for individual series of debt instruments requires high outstanding volumes, which typically can-
not be achieved by a one-off issue. If mar-
ket yields have changed when the bonds are subsequently tapped, these bonds will 
have the same coupon as the fi  rst issuance 
but the issue price will deviate from the 
nominal value despite the coupons initially 
having been in line with market rates. Gen-
erally, these deviations are positive when yields are declining and negative when yields are increasing. Furthermore, pre-
miums regularly occur in a negative- interest- 
rate environment because there are no 
negative coupons.
Over the past year, for example, premiums 
totalling €6 billion were received (following 
€4 billion and €1½ billion in 2014 and 2015, respectively) on account of the low- interest- 
rate environment. Their deduction from 
interest expenditure contributed signifi  cantly 
to the fact that, for example, the budget 
outturn for interest expenditure in 2016 was 
almost €6½ billion lower than originally planned and therefore down by a quarter. 
The high premiums primarily arose because 
the yield on 30-year Bunds had, at times, 
fallen to as little as ½%, while coupons had 
been set in line with market rates at 2½% 
when initially issued. At their peak, issue pre-miums of almost 60% on the nominal value were paid when these bonds were tapped.
Ultimately, the current method of recording 
premiums and discounts results in interest 
expenditure in the Federal budget fre-quently departing considerably from the 
planned fi  gures. The budget outturn there-
fore does not refl  ect fi  nancing conditions. 
This would require premiums and discounts 
to be distributed over the term of the bonds. An additional cause for concern is 
that recording premiums in full in the year 
of issue may give the false impression that 
there is budgetary scope. Ultimately, secur-ities with high coupons might be issued de-
liberately in order to exploit the fact that 
premiums have an immediate effect on the 
balance sheet so as to ensure compliance with budgetary requirements in the short 
term in spite of fi  nancial diffi   culties. In eco-nomic terms, however, this is the equivalent of borrowing and would make it possible to 
circumvent the debt brake. By the same token, the current accounting method 
could jeopardise the achievement of budget 
targets when implementing the budget should interest rate policy be reversed be-
cause the debt service charges for discounts 
are overstated at the current end. Thus when the bonds are tapped, considerable Deutsche Bundesbank

ditions, compliance with the debt brake, which 
envisages (structurally) balanced budgets for all 
state governments from 2020, is also much 
easier than was expected when the debt brake was adopted.
The major differences between individual state 
governments (each including their local gov -
ernments in the following) remain obscured 
when looking at the national accounts data. 
According to the more detailed figures of the 
government finance statistics, debt per capita 
at the end of last year was more than ten times 
higher in Bremen (€35,400) than in Saxony or 
Bavaria (see the table on page 62). In Saarland, 
the non-  city state with the highest debt per 
capita (€18,500), the figure was slightly better, 
but still nearly double the national average 
(€9,700). Particularly extensive debt entails sig -
nificantly higher interest burdens. Looking at the share of interest expenditure in overall 
spending, while the national average was 3½% 
last year, the figures ranged from just under 1½% in Saxony and Bavaria through as much 
as just under 5½% in Rhineland-  P alatinate and 
Berlin to 8% in Saarland and even 11½% in Bremen. In other words, interest expenditure 
per capita came to just over €1,000 in Bremen, 
whereas the same metric for Saarland and Hamburg was a little under €500. In Saxony and Bavaria, interest expenditure per capita  
stayed below €100.
These differences in interest expenditure de -
pend crucially on the level of debt, whereas the financing terms for borrowing are likely to dif -
fer moderately, at most, between the individual 
state governments on balance. For bonds is -
sued by the state governments, say, there are 
only very limited differences in yields,21 with Major differ-
ences across Federal states in debt service burden, …
… given virtu-ally identical financing termsdiscounts could accrue for longer maturities 
in particular and especially for 30-year se-
curities, thereby driving up interest expend-
iture.
A switch to an accruals- based allocation of 
interest costs would not mean venturing 
into new territory as such a process is al-
ready employed for infl  ation- linked bonds. 
Each year, an infl  ation-related provision is 
recognised in the Federal budget for subse-
quent compensation payments when re-deeming the infl  ation- linked debt instru-ments. This protects the budget against 
potentially erratic cost leaps when securities reach fi  nal maturity, and the costs are allo-cated to the economically relevant periods.
Another argument in favour of a change in 
accounting practice is that when recording 
interest expenditure in the national ac-
counts premiums and discounts are gener-ally distributed over the term of the bond and that the respective burdens affecting 
the fi  scal balance therefore match the mar-ket yields when the bonds were issued (and 
not necessarily the coupons). The national 
accounts and the general government fi  scal 
balances calculated therein are based on 
the European fi  scal rules. As national rules 
also aim not least to ensure compliance with these provisions, any discrepancies 
that are present should be reduced.1 All the 
more so given that this could provide a bet-
ter picture of economic reality and de-
cisively reduce the risks associated with ris-ing interest rates during budget implemen-tation.
1 For these reasons, it would be appropriate to alter 
the method of accounting for receipts and payments 
arising from derivative contracts, too. Like premiums 
and discounts, under the EU rules these are generally 
classed as fi  nancial transactions and thus not included 
in the fi  scal balance calculation.
21 For example, for a group of comparable bonds with a 
residual maturity of around 9 years and a similar coupon 
amount, the difference in yields (between Bavaria and 
North Rhine-  W estphalia) recently came to approximately 
¼  percentage point. Joint bonds (with pro rata liability) were issued by a number of state governments (“jumbo 
state government bonds”).Deutsche Bundesbank

the capital markets apparently assuming that 
financial support obligations will ultimately kick 
in, as they did for the budgetary hardship situ-ations identified in Bremen and Saarland by the 
Federal Constitutional Court in 1992. At the local government level, too, there are major 
differences in debt levels both within and be -
tween the non-  city states.22 Nonetheless, even 
highly indebted local governments (some with 
arithmetically negative equity capital) have to 
offer at most comparatively limited interest rate 
premiums for cash advances owing to the ex -
pectation that, where necessary, support pay-
ments would be provided from the relevant 
state government.
On the whole, the more highly indebted state 
and local governments, in particular, have en -
joyed major relief, and consolidation was aided 
considerably. Measured by total expenditure, 
the share accounted for by interest expenditure halved from 2007, going from just over 7% to 3½% on average. The greatest savings made in this connection were in Berlin (just over 6½ per -
centage points) as well as in Saxony-  Anhalt and 
Hamburg (roughly 5 percentage points each).
Changes in the shares of interest expenditure 
give only limited insight into the relief provided 
by lower interest rates, however, because this 
relief is also shaped by the differing debt and 
expenditure dynamics of the individual state governments (including local governments) 
over time. It is possible to arrive at a rough es -
timate of the gross savings provided by lower 
interest rates for each state government by ap -
plying the two-percentage-point decrease in the average interest rate uniformly calculated

using the national accounts data to the current 
levels of debt (see also the chart on page 45).23 
For Bremen, the Federal state with the highest 
debt per capita , this produces a saving of €½ 
billion (€750 per capita ) compared with 2007. 
For Saarland, the saving comes to just under 
€½ billion (€390 per capita ). In the case of 
North Rhine-  W estphalia, the estimated saving 
is more than €5 billion (€290 per capita ). In 
addition, besides the remaining city states, the 
other highly indebted states of Rhineland-  
Palatinate, Schleswig-  Holstein, Hesse and  
Saxony-  Anhalt also enjoyed especial ly strong 
savings.
Given the unabated major differences in debt 
levels, budget sensitivities to future interest rate 
changes also vary in strength. Like central gov-ernment, the state governments will still bene-
fit from the very favourable financing terms at 
present, and the average interest rate is likely 
to fall further initially. However, it would be a 
mistake to assume that the low interest level 
reached at this stage will be sustained into the 
long term and to ignore the possibility of an 
interest rate reversal in the medium and longer-  
term financial planning. When the debt brake 
enters into force, all state governments will be required to produce at least a (structurally) bal -
anced budget from 2020. Given the still largely 
aligned financial capacities and a virtual lack of 
tax- r aising autonomy, major debt servicing bur -
dens ultimately have to be offset by restricting 
the range of public services provided. More 
highly indebted Federal states, especially – and 
chiefly Bremen and Saarland – are particularly 
urged to rigorously pursue an ambitious 
budgetary stance, so as to also be equipped for resurgent interest rates.
Development of government 
interest expenditure24 
in euro-area countries
Following on from the detailed analysis of 
interest expenditure in Germany, this section 
outlines developments in selected euro-area countries.25 The low-  i nterest-  r ate environment 
has brought about favourable financing terms 
in the other euro-area countries, as well. In 
spite of rising debt ratios, the ratio of interest 
expenditure to GDP has declined in almost all 
countries. In a number of euro-area countries, 
average interest rates and interest expenditure 
ratios fell much more heavily than in Germany. 
This section illustrates developments for the 
founding members of the euro area from 1999 to 2016.
26
The launch of the euro intensified the conver -
gence in the member states’ government 
financing   te rms that had already been seen in 
the lead-  up (see the chart on page  47). The in -
flation and risk premiums that existed in some 
cases decreased significantly. Yields on ten-  year 
government bonds, for example, approached 
the German level to a very large extent. Even Highly indebted 
Federal states still urged on
Fiscal relief from 
lower financing costsInterest rate convergence at the start of monetary union
23 The arithmetical average interest rate for individual 
state governments calculated on the basis of the govern -
ment finance statistics is comparable to a limited extent 
only owing to classification problems. It is possible that 
debt and interest payments between core budgets and off-  
budget entities were not consolidated consistently. In order 
to simplify matters, the uniform calculation performed here 
on the basis of the national accounts data assumes that 
refinancing terms improved to the same extent and that 
differences in average interest rates arise mainly from dif -
ferences in debt management. Due to the lack of detailed 
information on numerous debt instruments and their ma -
turities in the individual Federal states, the effects related to these have to be disregarded here.
24 Government interest expenditure is described here at 
the general government level as per the national accounts. 
Unlike the analysis of interest expenditure in the preceding 
section about Germany, financial intermediation services 
indirectly measured (FISIM) are excluded owing to a lack of data in some cases.
25 To ensure comparability, this section disregards the 
countries that joined the euro area after 1999: Slovenia (accession: 2007), Malta and Cyprus (2008), Slovakia 
(2009), Estonia (2011), Latvia (2014) and Lithuania (2015). 
The founding member Luxembourg is likewise excluded 
owing to its very low debt ratio and its low absolute vol -
ume of debt throughout the period under review. Greece 
(2001), as a country that is still reliant on financial assis -
tance, is analysed separately (see the box on pp 52-54). 
Comprehensive comparative tables containing data on all 
euro-area countries can be found in the annex to this art -
icle; see pp 62-67.
26 To better illustrate the trends, the charts depict one 
group of countries which were hit especially hard by the 
financial and debt crisis and which have received support 
from fiscal and bank-  r elated rescue measures or the Euro -
system‘s SMP (Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland). The re -
maining countries (Austria, Belgium, Finland, France and 
the Netherlands) are analysed in a second group.Deutsche Bundesbank

though there was a temporary general increase 
in interest rates around the turn of the millen-
nium, average interest rates on government debt saw a continued trend decline (see the upper chart on page  48). As the yields con -
verged, most euro-area countries reported a 
stronger decrease in average interest rates than 
Germany – from a higher starting level. Since 
the debt ratios predominantly receded or sta -
bilised up to 2007, the interest expenditure ratio also went down markedly in almost all 
countries (see the lower chart on page 48 and 
the chart on page 50).
During the financial and economic crisis, a 
more differentiated risk assessment of the indi -
vidual euro-area countries re-  emer ged. As a 
consequence, yields rose sharply in the coun -
tries hit especially hard by the crisis. In Italy, 
Spain and Portugal, the average rates of inter -
est on government debt saw a marked interim 
rise (see the table on page 64).27 Issuance of 
bonds at the lower-  y ielding short end of the 
maturity structure was stepped up, which 
dampened the impact of the rising yields on 
the average issue yields. The rescue instruments 
in place since 2010, which today are bundled in 
the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), and 
also the Eurosystem’s programmes for purchas -
ing government bonds from certain countries 
(the activated SMP and the announced OMT 
programme) played a role in ensuring that even 
these countries that were hit especially hard by 
the crisis could again take on debt at signifi -
cantly better conditions as time progressed. For 
the other founding members, average interest 
rates continued to fall during the crisis, too, 
and interest expenditure ratios dropped or re -
mained broadly stable.
The average interest rate in all countries is now 
significantly lower than it was before the crisis. Financing terms have once more converged to a considerable extent. However, risk premiums 
can be identified for heavily-  indebted Italy , Por-
tugal and Spain in particular. The average inter -
est rate on government debt in these countries 
tends towards the upper end of the spectrum at roughly 3%, whereas Germany, Finland, France and the Netherlands are at the lower end with a figure of 2%. The divergence is therefore still greater than it was prior to the 
crisis. Although Germany regularly reported the most favourable financing terms on the capital market, the average interest rate in France, Fin -
land and the Netherlands was for the most part lower due to differences in the debt structure.
As the average interest rate reflects borrowing 
conditions in the past, changes to the current 
financing terms only gradually take effect (see 
also the chart on page 49). Consequently, the 
interest rate level, which has been very low for Disparities dur-

27 In Ireland, the average interest rate experienced a com -
paratively small increase during the crisis. The low starting 
level of government debt and sound fiscal policy history 
prior to the crisis are likely to have maintained the confi -
dence of the capital markets at first. The financial assis -
tance programme then reduced interest rate pressure from as early as the end of 2010, and in 2011 and 2012 interest

years, is currently still bringing down the aver -
age interest rate. As the observed very low 
issue yields are for the most part still below the 
remuneration level of maturing government 
bonds with comparable maturity, even at the 
longer end of the maturity spectrum, a further 
decline in the average interest rate in all coun -
tries appears likely unless there is a fundamen -
tal interest rate reversal or a marked lengthen -
ing of the maturity structure.
While debt instruments with a relatively short 
maturity were resorted to more often during 
the crisis as a result of higher risk premiums 
and uncertainty, an issuance strategy aimed at 
implementing a longer lock-  in period has es -
tablished itself at the current juncture, thereby 
anchoring the current historically-  low inter est 
rate level.28 This enables countries to shield 
themselves better against increasing financing 
costs in the years to come.29
Debt ratios experienced a strong initial increase 
in all countries during the crisis (see also the table on page 63). This increase was particu -
larly sharp in Ireland, but also in Portugal and 
Spain. In recent years, there has been a marked debt ratio decline in Germany, Ireland and the

the borrower‘s point of view, creditors may face risks. For 
instance, if banks have invested heavily in long-  dated gov-

shorter-  term funding, an incr ease in the interest rate will 
burden the balance sheet. To prevent risks being trans -

29 Alterations were also made to interest rate agreements. 
Since 2013, the proportion of variable-  inter est loans (in -
cluding inflation-  linked bonds) in Belgium, Finland, Ger -
many, Ireland and the Netherlands, which, similarly to 
short-  term liabilities, ar e associated with volatile interest 
charges, has decreased substantially. This is amplifying the effect of increased average bond times to maturity. By con -

slower increases and sideways movements 
were observed. Out of the countries under re-
view, Italy, Portugal and Belgium had debt 
ratios exceeding 100% at end-2016, standing 
at 133%, 130% and 106% respectively. Gov -
ernment debt ratios in Spain and France came 
in at just under 100%.
The ratio of interest expenditure to GDP tended 
to sink in most countries, albeit in some cases 
considerably more slowly in recent years than 
during the first few years of the monetary 
union (see the table on page 63). Only Ireland, 
Portugal and Spain experienced additional interest expenses on account of their sharply increased debt ratios, although a decline has 
since set in once more. In Italy, the downward 
trend following the onset of the crisis abated for several years. However, since 2014, the 
interest expenditure ratio there has fallen once 
again. At last count, the interest expenditure ratio ranged from around 1% in Finland and 
the Netherlands to roughly 4% in Portugal.The declining average interest rate has contrib-
uted substantially to the fact that the interest 
expenditure ratio in most countries is at its low -
est level since the launch of the monetary 
union, in spite of sharply increased debt ratios. 
Had the average interest rate remained un -
changed from its level in 2007, the year preced-
ing the crisis, interest expenditure would cur-
rently be significantly higher (see the chart on 
page  51). Alongside the declining average 
interest rate, such interest savings are particu-
larly dependent on the level of government 
debt. In this way, the greatest savings have 
been made in Italy, amounting to 2½% of GDP 
for 2016 alone and 10½% of GDP for the years 
2008 to 2016 cumulated. Savings were simi -
larly high in the Netherlands, Austria, France 
and Belgium, all of which have lower debt 
levels but have seen a fairly sharp decline in the 
average interest rate. Germany’s cumulative 
savings, by comparison, are 7½% lower, pla -
cing it in the middle of the countries under re-
view. However, even the countries which de -
pended on financial assistance during the crisis 
are set to make significant savings compared to 
the pre-  crisis interest rate level.30
Lower interest rates ease the pressure on cur -
rent government budgets, all other things 
being equal. Taken in isolation, they result in 
declining deficits and make existing debt levels 
more sustainable. However, the latter can be undermined by a simultaneously slackening

30 At end-2015, the average interest rate on ESM loans to 
Spain stood at 0.9%. In Portugal, the average interest rate 
on outstanding EFSM, IMF and EFSF loans is 2.6%. Repay -
ment of the IMF loans (interest rate of 4.6%) is envisaged, 
as Portugal is now able to borrow under more favourable capital market conditions. Ireland was able to refinance the majority of its IMF loans in the years 2014-2015 by means 
of low-  inter est government bonds, which reduced the 
average interest rate. The net interest burden faced by the 
Irish government is therefore lower than the figure re-
corded when the Irish central bank purchased a large vol -
ume of government bonds as part of the support given to 
the banking sector in 2013. The Irish central bank‘s net 
interest income is thus higher as related interest income is 
offset by significantly lower liabilities expenditure. This in -

pace of growth.31 Alongside the primary bal -
ance (ie the fiscal balance excluding interest ex -
penditure), the development of the govern -
ment debt ratio is dependent on the average 
interest rate and (nominal) growth. The interest 
rate- gr owth differential is derived from the last 
two factors.32
In the euro area as a whole, not only interest 
rates but also trend growth rates have declined 
over time. This means that for the most part, 
substantially falling real growth trends were 
observed over the past two decades, and price inflation was also lower in the aftermath of the 
crisis. In this respect, Germany is an exception 
to the rule, as its nominal GDP trend growth 
rates were already rather low prior to the crisis 
and did not decrease thereafter (see the chart 
on page 55). While Germany had the lowest 
nominal trend growth rate of all the countries 
under review at the start of the monetary union, its rate was relatively high last year. In 
the other countries, particularly those hit hard-
est by the crisis, declines were observed – some 
substantial. Following a sharp drop during the 
crisis, however, signs of recovery have recently been observed once more.
Viewed as a whole, this backdrop puts the eas -
ing of public finances due to subdued interest 
expenditure into perspective (see the top chart 
on page 56). In the wake of the crisis, therefore, 
almost all countries initially experienced a de-
terioration in their interest rate-  gr owth differen -
tial due to decreasing trend growth rates and, 
in the countries hit hardest by the crisis, to the 
temporary effect of increasing average interest 
rates. From the government’s perspective, how -
ever, the interest rate-  g rowth differential has 
improved recently by a combination of decreas -
ing interest rates and stable or increasing trend 
growth rates. In Germany, the interest rate-  
growth differential has declined more substan -
tially since 2007 than in most other countries. 
Viewed as a whole, reductions in interest ex -
penditure, taken in isolation, during the obser -
vation period provided significant relief for gov -
ernment budgets and are therefore making it easier to comply with the fiscal rules focused on 
the deficit. However, in most countries, the 
lower growth rate trend is restricting the scope 
for expenditure. The positive effects on debt dy -
namics are therefore being offset to a consider -
able extent, or indeed, outweighed in the coun -
tries hit hardest by the crisis.
Alongside the interest rate-  gr owth differential, 
the development of a country’s debt dynamics is dependent on the primary balance.

31 To the extent that lower capital market rates reflect 
worsening growth prospects, lagging average interest rate development even makes it possible to identify a (tempor -
ary) burden. GDP and tax revenue growth subsequently 
decrease   mor e quickly than interest payment growth, as a 
result of which the scope for other expenditure shrinks.32
 The interest rate-  gr owth differential is calculated below 
as the difference between the (nominal) average interest rate on government debt and the trend of nominal GDP 
growth. The trend is used in order to see beyond fluctu -
ations in real GDP or the price component. In principle, a 
positive interest rate-  gr owth rate differential necessitates a 
positive primary balance to prevent the debt ratio from ris -
ing. The higher the debt ratio and the interest rate-  gr owth 
differential, the larger the primary balance must be. For 
more information, see Deutsche Bundesbank, Government 
debt and interest payment burden in Germany, Monthly 
Report, April 2010, pp 15-33.

ance effect is disregarded hereinafter. If a country pur -

Greece: support programmes have sharply reduced interest 
expenditure
In 2001, Greece joined the euro area with a 
high debt- to- GDP ratio of over 100%. Inter-est expenditure had run up to nearly 6½% 
of gross domestic product (GDP), and the 
average rate of interest was at roughly the 
same level. Thereafter, funding terms were 
initially barely less unfavourable than those 
elsewhere in the euro area. The average 
rate of interest and the interest expenditure- 
to- GDP ratio therefore gradually fell to 
4½%.
During the fi  nancial crisis, a strong rise in 
the defi  cit and debt and the news that falsi-fi  ed statistics had been published were two major factors triggering a loss of confi  dence 
in Greek government fi  nances. Funding on 
the market no longer seemed possible. Sup-
port programmes were subsequently launched. Since the spring of 2010, the 
Greek government has been funded largely 
by support loans, for which primarily the 
other euro-area countries and, to a smaller degree, also the other member countries of 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are 
liable. The terms and conditions of the sup-
port loans are, all in all, extremely favour-able.
1 In addition, in 2012 private sector 
debt was restructured, including relief con-cerning the terms of interest and an exten-
sion of maturities. That enabled the pre-
cipitous increase in the interest expenditure 
ratio to over 7% between 2008 and 2011 
to be reversed.2 Despite the drastic spike in 
the debt- to- GDP ratio from just over 100% 
in 2007 to 180% in 2014, as early as in 
2013 the interest expenditure ratio had al-
ready fallen below its pre- crisis level and amounted to just over 3% last year. The average rate of interest on sovereign debt dropped from over 4% prior to 2010 to a 
recent fi  gure of below 2%. Greece’s interest 
payments- to- GDP ratio has thus, since 
2013, been well below that of Italy and Por-
tugal, two particularly highly indebted countries. If the average interest rate on Greek government debt were at its 2007 
(pre- crisis) level, in 2016 alone nearly 5% of 
GDP would have had to be additionally 
spent on debt service, and for the 2008 to 
2016 period additional expenses totalling, 
overall, €37 billion (around 21½% of GDP) 
would have been incurred.3 The support 
programmes have provided substantial debt relief, which turns out to be even more ex-tensive if based on alternative market terms and conditions.
4
Greece’s future burden of interest payments 
will depend on how successfully it reduces 
the debt ratio and on funding conditions. 
Since the terms of the support loans are, in 
most cases, locked in at the very low level 
over quite a long- term horizon, in this re-
spect Greece will be protected in large part 
from any unfavourable market conditions 
and risk premiums for many years to come. 
In order to minimise the burden when, es-
pecially in later years, funding in the capital 
1 The terms and conditions (interest and maturity) of 
the support loans have been repeatedly eased over 
time, but are not published for each individual tranche. 
According to information provided by the European 
Stability Mechanism (ESM), the average interest rate 
on ESM loans to Greece stood at 0.7% at the end of 2015. The funding terms for IMF support, by contrast, are perceptibly worse.2 The interest expenditure ratios being examined here are as defi  ned in the national accounts. The temporary 
reduction in the cash payment burden caused by ex-
tensive deferrals of interest payments is neglected 
here.
3 For more information on the calculation methods, 
see page 51.4 According to calculations by the ESM, for 2016 alone its loans will generate savings of 5.6% of GDP (€9.9 bil-lion). See ESM, Annual Report 2016, pp 48-49. These calculations compare the interest on ESM loans and on 
the loans under the European Financial Stabilisation Facility with the market yield on Greek government 
bonds, yet only inasmuch as the latter were below a 
selected threshold of 6.4%; otherwise, the relief is cal-culated based on the difference from this upper limit. 
The interest saving calculated using this method is, 
from this point of view, larger than if the average inter-
est rate of 2007 were used as a reference, even 
though this only takes account of borrowing from the ESM and not the entire debt level.Deutsche Bundesbank

market increases, future investors need to 
be convinced that Greece’s government 
fi  nances  are on a sound trajectory. Accord-ing to the underlying scenario of the Euro-
pean Commission’s current sustainability calculations, the average return on issues 
following the end of the programme will be 
around 5% and, by 2060, will drop below 
the 4½% mark.5 Against this background, 
the interest expenditure ratio is expected to gradually rise over the next few years up to just over 4½% of GDP and subsequently be 
in the area of 4% by 2060, corresponding 
roughly to the latest reported interest ex-penditure ratio in Portugal. Should market 
participants’ confi  dence return more quickly and strongly, this would dampen the inter-
est expenditure ratio and, in conjunction 
with a fall in the debt ratio, provide stronger 
relief. The higher Greece’s annual primary surplus (net lending/ net borrowing less interest payments), the more quickly its 
debt ratio will fall (at a given nominal GDP 
growth and interest rate terms). The same 
will apply to higher growth, especially on the back of successful structural reforms. 
Conversely, lower primary surpluses or less 
favourable growth rates would weigh on 
the debt- to- GDP ratio.
The requirements regarding the primary surplus were rewritten in connection with 
the programme review which ended in July; 
now Greece has to demonstrate a primary 
surplus of at least 3.5% of GDP by 2022. 
The Eurogroup stated in June 2017 that the 
European fi  scal rules should be complied 
with after that. According to the European Commission, this will require, as from 2023, a primary surplus of around 2% of GDP . In order to achieve a structural budget that is 
(close to) balanced, interest expenditure should thus hardly exceed 2% of GDP . As 
things now stand, this appears illusory, and 
higher interest expenditure should be ex-pected under the European Commission’s 
baseline scenario. It is therefore not beyond the realms of possibility that Greece will be permitted to get away with a less ambitious 
budget target than other countries. How-ever, reducing the requirements for the 
country with the EU’s highest debt- to- GDP 
ratio to a level below that in the Stability and Growth Pact would hardly be condu-cive to instilling confi  dence in sound gov-
ernment fi  nances, and the fi  scal rules would be weakened further.
5 These assumptions refl  ect expectations about a rise 
in the risk- free interest rate and a decrease in the risk premium. According to European Commission calcula-
tions, the debt- to- GDP ratio in 2020 will be around 160%, dropping to around 90% by 2060. See Euro-
pean Commission, Compliance Report, The Third Eco-nomic Adjustment Programme for Greece, Second Re-view, June 2017. The IMF appears to be, on the whole, more pessimistic about developments in Greece.Interest burden indicators in selected euro-area countries

Support programmes should be designed 
to put government budgets on a fi  rm foot-
ing, and structural reforms should create 
the conditions for sustainable, sound eco-
nomic growth. If programme conditionality and a structurally close to balanced budget are implemented credibly, it should be pos-sible to regain the confi  dence of the capital markets even in light of higher debt levels. 
If the reform process does not succeed, or 
programme agreements are not credible, 
even a further haircut – which the IMF has declared to be a precondition for providing further fi  nancial support – could also prove futile. With regard to fi  scal targets, it would 
be worrying if Greece were seen as not 
being able to deliver a considerable longer- 
term primary surplus. In other euro-area countries, the persistently high debt ratios mean that perceptible primary surpluses will  be necessary in order to achieve the 
medium- term budgetary objectives set out 
by the fi  scal rules, quickly reduce their high 
debt level and thus also create suffi   cient 
scope to cope with any future burdens. The current interest expenditure ratios of Portu-gal and Italy are around 4%, meaning that 
there, too, to achieve a structurally bal-
anced budget, appropriately high structural 
primary surpluses will be needed.6 Some 
countries have achieved these, and even far 
more ambitious, fi  scal positions and have 
maintained them for relatively long periods.7 
According to the assumptions in the Euro-
pean Commission’s baseline scenario, if 
Greece were to maintain a primary surplus 
of around 4% beyond 2022, it could 
achieve, without any further haircuts, an at least close to balanced budget and a steady, 
perceptible decline in the debt- to- GDP 
ratio.
However, the Eurogroup apparently regards 
a primary surplus of 3.5% of GDP for more 
than fi  ve years as being too ambitious for 
Greece – a far cry from the situation in June 
2016, when the objective was to maintain 
this level until 2028. On 15 June 2017, the 
Eurogroup reiterated its intent to examine 
whether, once the current programme ex-pires in 2018, further debt relief measures should be taken. One of the ideas pre-sented was that the maturity of the out-standing loans granted, ultimately, by the euro-area countries was to be once again 
postponed, and that interest and redemp-
tion payments on the EFSF loans were to be 
deferred once again. In accordance with 
this memorandum of understanding, these 
measures would be an option if Greece were to fully implement the current pro-gramme, yet debt sustainability, measured 
in terms of the gross funding ratio,8 is still 
not yet certain. These measures are appar-
ently designed to get around a formal hair-
cut. On the whole, further actions going 
forward should be taken with a view to not further eroding the credibility of future pro-gramme agreements. This is a genuine con-
cern if programme agreements do not ap-
pear to be binding and the impression is 
given that they will be softened later on if 
the political will to implement them evapor-ates. There is also a threat of a further ero-
sion of the European fi  scal framework if 
country- specifi  c exceptions are increasingly 
permitted. This would cause the rules to 
cease to act as an anchor of confi  dence in 
sound government fi  nances, which also 
helps keep risk premiums down.
6 Although interest expenditure could initially fall, it 
should also be possible to cope with resurging interest 
rates going forward.7 For instance, Belgium ran a primary surplus of mostly far above 4% of GDP from the 1990s up until the out-
break of the crisis. Similarly, in more than ten years 
Finland and also Denmark had a primary surplus that 
was, in some cases, signifi  cantly higher. Since 1995 Italy and Ireland were each able, in fi  ve years, to 
achieve a primary surplus of 4% or more.
8 The gross funding ratio is composed of annual net 
new borrowing and debt to be rolled over (each as a percentage of GDP). For Greece, the Eurogroup has set 
an initial threshold of not more than 15%, to go up 
later to 20%, as a measure of debt sustainability. In the baseline scenario for the European Commission’s debt 
sustainability analysis (excluding additional debt relief, 
with a long- term primary surplus of around 2% of 
GDP) the gross funding ratio is expected to exceed the 
threshold value somewhat after 2045, corresponding 
to a decline in the debt ratio to around 90% by 2060.Deutsche Bundesbank

budget balance, adjusted for cyclical effects,34 
in combination with the respective interest 
rate- gr owth differential, allowed a reduction of 
the debt ratio in most countries. During the cri-
sis, however, the metrics deteriorated, and the 
debt ratios increased markedly (see the upper 
chart on page 56).35 In recent years, both the 
primary balance and the interest rate-  gr owth 
differential have improved again in most coun-
tries. In 2016, therefore, with the exception of 
France, Italy and Spain, all the countries were 
suitably positioned to bring about reductions 
(albeit highly variable) in their debt ratios, 
viewed in isolation.
To ensure lasting debt sustainability, the Euro -
pean fiscal rules prescribe a scaling-  back of  
debt ratios. A relatively rapid reduction of the 
debt ratio could be achieved, particularly if the 
goal of structural budgetary positions that are 
at least close to balance were accomplished.36 
Although the average interest rate could fall further in the near future if bonds and loans 
which still bear relatively high rates of interest 
are refinanced more cheaply, it is likely to in -
crease again, looking ahead. Against this back-
ground, it would seem risky from a fiscal policy 
perspective to rely on the interest rate-  gr owth 
differential remaining negative in the longer term, for example. Should the trend of a de -
clining average interest rate reverse, interest 
burdens will increase once more, which is of 
even greater consequence in the context of a 
higher debt level. The long-  term str ains on gov -
ernment finances from demographic trends 
could also be better managed if the countries 
swiftly achieved balanced structural budget 
positions. The associated decline in debt ratios 
and interest burdens would make it easier to 
cover the foreseeable additional expenditure 
associated with an aging population.37
As changes in the interest rate do not solely 
affect government interest expenditure but are 
also reflected on the revenue side, interest rate-  
sensitive property income, including distributed 
central bank profits, also has to be taken into 
account, as a general rule. In relation to gov -ernment interest expenditure, government 
property income stood at just under 30% (28% at last count) for the euro-area member states Countries with

34 As the European Commission publishes no data for the 
structural primary balance (ie adjusted for cyclical and tem -
porary effects) for the years prior to 2010, the figures here are based on the cyclically adjusted primary balance.
35 Contributing to these were sometimes extensive sup-
port measures for credit institutions, which affected the 
debt level but (as financial transactions) were not reflected in the fiscal balance.36
 The medium-  term budget tar get is intended to support 
safety margins set below the agreed deficit ceiling of 3% of GDP (“minimum benchmark”) and ensure sustainable pub -
lic finances through a reduction of high government debt 
levels. To this end, the target is set every three years, taking 
into account general government budget burdens related 
to population aging. See European Commission, Vade Me-cum on the Stability and Growth Pact, 2017 Edition, Insti -

analyses compared with the long-  term scenario deemed  
plausible for Germany suggest that higher potential growth 
rates arising from stronger productivity growth, for ex -
ample, or lower interest rates, will change little in regard to 
the current German sustainability gap. See M  Werding, Modellrechnungen für den vierten Tragfähigkeitsbericht

in the period 2007 to 2016. The level of the 
arithmetical average yield on government fi -
nancial assets is lower than the level of the average interest rate on government debt, 
which is probably attributable to the fact that 
gains are not the priority here, or that less prof -
itable assets are involved, as is the case for resolution entities. The arithmetical average 
interest rate also decreased over time (see the 
chart on page 57),38 but less strongly than for 
government debt. Viewed as a whole, then, changes in governments’ property income 
compensate for interest-  r elated influences on 
the expenditure side to a certain, but still fairly 
minor, extent. However, such savings are likely 
to be lower than in previous cycles in the event 
of a future interest rate increase, since central 
bank profits will initially tend to react not posi -
tively but negatively to interest rate increases, 
as a result of the non-  standar d monetary policy 
measures (see the box on pages 58 to 60).
Conclusion
Government debt in the euro-area countries in -
creased substantially in the wake of the finan -
cial and economic crisis and, in most cases, is 
still near peak levels in relation to GDP . Com -
pared with the pre-  crisis year 2 007, however, 
the interest expenditure burden affecting gen-
eral government budgets has generally fallen 
almost continuously, with a few exceptions in 
cases of particularly strong debt growth. The

38 For a rough calculation of the average yield on govern -
ment property income, the received property income (less 
rental receipts) can be compared to financial assets in ac -
cordance with the financial accounts. If the ratio of prop -
erty income to interest expenditure were to be viewed as 
an indicator of the relative value of financial assets in rela -
tion to the debt level, this would produce a correspond -
ingly extrapolated average financial asset value of around 
25% of GDP in the euro area between 2007 and 2016 
(with the average debt ratio, at market prices, of 91%). Ac -
cording to the financial accounts, the value of financial   
assets amounted to 36% of GDP in the same period. Over -
all, financial assets are comparatively less significant in rela -
tion to gross debt. Notable exceptions are member states 
which record capital-  backed social security systems to a  
larger extent in the general government sector (eg Finland).Deutsche Bundesbank

cial factor. The average interest rate on govern-
ment debt has since reached a low in all coun -
tries. If the average interest rate had been that 
of 2007, interest expenditure in the euro area 
last year would have been higher by almost 2% of GDP (eg by nearly 2½% in Italy, by just over 
2% in France and by 1½% in Germany). This 
has generated savings of approximately €1 tril -
lion or just under 9% of total GDP in the euro 
area over the past nine years.
The very low interest rate level, also supported 
by the significant government bond purchases 
by the Eurosystem, gives reason in the first in-
stance to expect further decreases in average interest rates and interest expenditure ratios. 
However, building fiscal policy on the assump -
tion that financing terms for high levels of gov -
ernment debt will remain extremely favourable 
would be problematic. Instead, it is important 
to swiftly put public finances on a sound foot -
ing. If the goal of structural budgetary pos -
itions that are at least close to balance, en -
shrined in the Stability and Growth Pact, were 
to be achieved, the debt ratios, which are pre-
dominantly still very high, could be lowered 
relatively rapidly.
In actual fact, however, consolidation effects 
have faltered in the last three years. In the ma -
jority of member states, the structural primary 
balance has deteriorated yet further, or has 
barely improved. The persistent easing of fund -
ing conditions and the associated decline in 
interest costs are likely to have contributed to 
this. In view of the high debt ratios, however, 
public finances remain vulnerable to shocks, 
and an increase in the interest rate will have a stronger negative impact, all other things being 
equal. The fiscal consolidation requirements, 
which would then become more substantial 
again, are also likely to entail greater political 
costs. If, as a result, this risks eroding the confi-
dence of the financial markets in the sustain -
ability of public finances, monetary policy not 
least is likely to be pressured to respond.Fiscal policy not

Central bank profi  ts: the impact of changes in interest rates 
in the context of unconventional monetary policy
A central bank’s profi  t (or loss) and the subse-
quent transfer to the government are deter-
mined by a number of different factors.1 In a 
highly stylised and simplifi  ed approach, where 
a central bank balance sheet has a conven-
tional structure, a rise in key interest rates 
drives up net interest income and profi  t. This 
is because cash issued by a central bank does 
not bear interest (liability) and is offset by 
claims on credit institutions resulting from re-fi  nancing operations (assets) which bear inter-est at the main refi  nancing rate for monetary policy and thus yield higher income when key 
interest rates are raised. If this higher central 
bank profi  t is transferred to the government 
budget, it counteracts the impact of interest 
rate rises on government interest expenditure which, all other things being equal, increases in a phase of rising interest rates.
2
However, due to unconventional monetary 
policy measures and the resulting high excess 
liquidity, relationships are becoming much 
more complex and are tending to be reversed. Once monetary policy, and with it interest rate 
rises, return to normal, central bank profi  ts 
will initially fall markedly. If profi  t transfers also 
decline as a result, this – taken in isolation – 
will temporarily heighten the impact of inter-est rate rises on public fi  nances.
Central bank profi  ts in connection with 
unconventional monetary policy measures
As a result of the relationship described above 
(taken in isolation), cuts in key policy rates 
have lowered interest income and profi  ts in the Eurosystem. At the same time, in the 
wake of unconventional policy measures, the European banking system has built up a con-siderable amount of excess liquidity on central 
bank accounts. These increased Eurosystem liabilities are predominantly offset by exten-sive new assets from monetary policy pur-
chase programmes (used to purchase primar-ily government but also corporate bonds) and from the targeted longer- term refi  nancing op-erations (TLTRO).3 As interest on such central 
bank assets at present is usually higher than interest on excess liquidity (which currently 
bears interest at the negative deposit rate of 
-0.4%), this results in net interest income on 
balance.4
The positive effect of bond purchases under 
the current programme is thus relatively small 
for the Bundesbank as each national central bank (NCB) purchases government bonds of its own country and, while the exclusion of risk- sharing minimises risk for the Bundes-
bank, it means that interest earned is also only correspondingly low. In the previous securities 
markets programme, which ran from May 
2010 until September 2012, the focus was on 
bonds from countries where risk premiums 
rose particularly sharply. As a result of the fact 
that risk- sharing was agreed for this pro-
1 Including the structure and volume of the balance 
sheet, accounting rules, fi  scal regulations and provi-
sions governing profi  t transfer to the government or other shareholders. The Eurosystem has harmonised accounting rules (for valuation and income recogni-
tion). In addition, each national central bank has na-
tional (specifi  c) regulations on profi  t transfer, setting 
up reserves and general risk provisions.2 In this simplifi  ed approach, interest income equates 
to income from short- term investment in the amount 
of cash holdings (in accordance with the capital key, Germany’s share of cash holdings in the Eurosystem amounts to around €270 billion, or just over 8% of 
gross domestic product (GDP)). In the Eurosystem, cen-tral bank balances for minimum reserves bear interest at the main refi  nancing rate and thus have no impact here on net interest income. Excess liquidity (credit in-stitutions’ central bank balances that exceed the min-
imum reserve requirements), which bears interest at 
the deposit facility rate (which is lower than the main 
refi  nancing rate), should not play a notable role in a functioning money market (such as that prior to the 
fi  nancial crisis).
3 For more information on the Eurosystem’s non- 
standard measures since mid-2014, see Deutsche Bun-
desbank, The macroeconomic impact of quantitative easing in the euro area, Monthly Report, June 2016, 
pp 29-53.4 The TLTRO initially bear interest at the main refi  nan-cing rate (0%); however, if the bank in question issues 
suffi   cient loans, the rate is (retroactively) cut (at most 
to the deposit rate (-0.4%)). The respective rate is fi  xed 
for a period of four years. If the purchasing bank so 
desires, it can repay the transactions at an earlier date.Deutsche Bundesbank

gramme, interest income was also shared in 
accordance with the capital key. In the euro 
area as a whole, excess liquidity currently to-
tals around €1.6 trillion. By the end of the year, this could rise in line with the planned bond purchases to around €2 trillion, or ap-proximately 18% of euro-area nominal GDP . The NCBs’ net interest income from this un-conventional policy, all other things being 
equal, is thus likely to increase as the year pro-gresses – assuming returns on these purchases remain above the deposit rate.
In simplifi  ed terms, the signifi  cance of bond 
purchases for public fi  nances is as follows. An 
NCB ultimately uses the bond purchase pro-gramme to take medium to long- term na-tional bonds on to its balance sheet and fi  -nances this by creating short- term central 
bank deposits that bear interest at the deposit 
rate.5 If the resultant central bank profi  t or 
loss has a direct impact on the government 
budget, in economic terms this equates to the 
fi  nancial impact of switching a government’s 
fi  nancing modalities from longer- term debt 
(government bonds at current market condi-
tions) to debt at the short- term, standard monetary policy deposit rate. As described 
above, this generates additional relief for the 
government – at least initially – (in excess of 
the yield- reducing effect of purchases of newly issued government bonds) as long as 
the deposit rate remains below the return on 
the purchased bonds and, all other things 
being equal, the central bank’s profi  t and the subsequent transfer to government rise. How-ever, this also increases public fi  nances’ sensi-
tivity to changes in short- term interest rates 
(as is also the case when switching from long- term to short- term debt).
Impact of an interest rate riseIf, as part of the process to normalise monet-
ary policy, key policy rates in the Eurosystem 
are raised, net interest income and (taken in 
isolation) central bank profi  ts initially decline 
–  in contrast to the simplifi  ed conventional central bank balance sheet – and this could 
also result in losses. As the deposit rate rises, profi  tability declines in connection with excess liquidity due to interest payments to credit in-
stitutions, whereas interest income from the TLTRO (which do not reach maturity until 
2020/ 2021) and securities purchased (such as 
those under the public sector purchase pro-gramme, which have a weighted average term of around eight years for the Eurosys-
tem’s total portfolio) remains unchanged until maturity. Losses generally occur if the deposit rate is raised above the average return on the assets (bonds and refi  nancing operations).
6
Seen in this light, the unconventional central 
bank balance sheet means that interest rate 
rises no longer simply cause the government’s interest expenditure for newly issued bonds or 
fl  oating rate bonds to increase (as it would 
usually do in a phase of rising interest rates). 
In addition, a central bank’s profi  t initially de-clines (rather than rising, as it would do in the case of conventional monetary policy), mean-
ing that interest rate rises place a greater strain on public fi  nances (once the central 
bank’s profi  t has been factored in). This is also demonstrated by the above considerations on 
the impact of government bond purchases: 
when an NCB purchases such bonds, the net 
costs initially fall; however, any subsequent interest rate rise (starting from a favourable position) has a greater impact on public fi  -
nances. With excess liquidity at 18% of GDP 
in the euro area, a one percentage point rise 
in the deposit rate means, all other things 
being equal, a fall of 0.18% of GDP in the Eu-
rosystem’s net interest income (equivalent to 
around €6 billion for Germany).
The higher the return on the assets purchased, 
the greater the initial relief for public fi  nances 
from expanding the central bank balance sheet as described above. However, the ex-pected future deterioration in profi  tability 
when interest rates are raised would thus, all 
other things being equal, affect all countries 
5 The fi  nancial impact depends on the purchase vol-
ume and the return on the paper purchased. The ef-
fect is thus the same irrespective of whether govern-
ment bonds or corporate bonds are purchased – as-
suming returns on both are identical.

(starting from different positions) in approxi-
mately the amount at which they participate 
in the bond purchase programme.
The extent to which the above- mentioned ef-
fects have a concrete effect on public fi  nances in the individual years ultimately depends on a number of other factors. Central bank profi  ts 
and transfers are, for instance, subject to other infl  uences, some of them country- specifi  c. For example, profi  ts or losses may have an effect elsewhere or in connection with the bonds purchased under the pro-
gramme (say, if various risks were to material-ise). As far as the individual transfers are con-cerned, setting up or releasing reserves could also play a role, causing shifts in or changes to the time frame.
In the Bundesbank’s case, given the low risk 
premium, the German government bonds 
purchased yield very low – in some cases even negative – returns and, as a result, the contri-
bution to growth in the Bundesbank’s profi  t 
from these purchases is relatively small. With 
regard to interest rate risks, in last year’s an-
nual accounts additional reserves of just under 
€2 billion were set aside and similar plans 
have been announced for this year. These re-serves thus already spell a reduction in the 
profi  t transfer and make provisions for future losses from an interest rate rise. Given the fact 
that the Bundesbank’s profi  t transfer (of only 
€½ billion) at the beginning of this year was 
already low, it cannot fall all too sharply even if interest rates are raised in the future. How-ever, the profi  t transfer could be low, or even 
zero, for the medium to long term. Keeping 
to the past approach of factoring in €2½ bil-
lion in central government’s budgetary and 
fi  nancial planning would therefore be risky.
In some of the other euro-area countries, 
transfers of central bank profi  ts to the govern-ment (in relation to GDP) for the 2016 fi  nan-
cial year were higher than in Germany (see 
the table on this page7). Profi  tability inter alia 
is initially more favourable due to the fact that 
greater risks generally mean that interest earned on bonds purchased under the pro-
gramme is higher and, as purchases are set to continue, profi  tability is subsequently likely to 
improve in relative terms this year, too. If a 
central bank makes a large profi  t transfer, the 
potential for setbacks when monetary policy 
returns to normal is generally greater accord-ingly. The strain on public fi  nances from rising fi  nancing costs would be intensifi  ed further as 
a result of reduced central bank profi  t trans-
fers.
7 Governments’ investment income from central bank 
profi  ts reported in the national accounts may deviate 
from the fi  gures given here. Seigniorage in Ireland is 
particularly high as extensive government liabilities 
were transferred to the central bank balance sheet in 
connection with bank rescue measures. The above- 
mentioned effects of holding government bonds in the current environment are thus especially pronounced in Ireland. The profi  ts, but likewise the risks, of some cen-tral banks are also infl  ated by higher interest income in connection with the granting of ELA.Profi  ts of the euro-area national  central banks in the 2016 fi  nancial year

Borrowing in most countries is currently shift -
ing more strongly towards debt instruments 
with longer maturities, meaning that the impli -
cations of increasing interest rates in the future 
are delayed. Government property income 
could, in principle, benefit from a rising interest 
rate, thereby easing expenditure pressures. 
However, it is less significant in quantitative 
terms and is likely to be less responsive to inter -
est rate changes on the whole. Central banks’ 
profit distribution also usually increases with 
rising interest rates. In the light of the non-  
standard monetary policy measures and high excess liquidity, however, increased interest 
rates would initially burden the Eurosystem’s 
balance sheets and ultimately government fi -
nances. With regard to containing further fiscal risks resulting from increasing interest rates, it is 
also important that financial institutions make 
sufficient preparations for the event of an inter -
est rate reversal, and that, should financial dis -
tress occur, investors’ liability is enforced as en -
visaged within the banking union arrange -
ments.
Germany’s public finances are currently in a 
relatively favourable position. However, moder -
ate structural surpluses are also appropriate in 
light of the still-  high debt r atio and the demo -
graphic outlook. Moreover, it has proven bene -
ficial to ensure safety margins rather than run -
ning close to the limits set in the rules. It was 
thus possible to absorb the financial impact of refugee immigration in the budget plans with -
out counterfinancing measures. Low interest 
rates have aided the emergence of fiscal sur -
pluses in Germany considerably. If the average 
interest rate had remained at its pre-  crisis level 
of 2007, last year’s interest expenditure would 
have been €47 billion or 1½% of GDP higher. 
Even if interest expenditure continues to de -crease against a backdrop of ongoing favour -
able financing conditions, such terms should 
not be expected to remain the norm. The cen -
tral and state governments, however, have evi -
dently already made certain provisions for this 
in their medium-  term plans.
However, the current recording procedure for 
premiums and discounts when borrowing 
poses a risk to the Federal budget. Contrary to 
European accounting rules and the economic 
background, these are fully recorded upon ac -
crual as negative or positive interest expend -
iture, making the budgets highly volatile. It 
would be wise to distribute burdens and relief 
evenly over the life of the bond, as is already 
the case for inflation-  linked bonds.
The state and local governments also profit 
greatly from lower interest rates. This makes it 
easier for the very heavily-  i ndebted states to 
adhere to the national debt brake, which re -
quires all states to have (structurally) balanced 
budgets from 2020. Interest expenditure halved 
from 7% to 3½% during the period 2007 to 
2016 relative to budget volume, whereas debt-  
to- GDP levels bar ely changed. Even the very 
high debt levels of some local governments are 
becoming more affordable. This is also due to 
the significant fall in the burden arising from 
cash advances, which are a significant source 
of funding for local government and whose re-
muneration is generally fixed in the short term. 
As at the European level, however, an ambi -
tious fiscal stance should be pursued, particu -
larly given high debt levels, until a sound 
budgetary situation has been achieved. Other -
wise, mounting interest rates might expose 
heavily-  indebted entities in particular to the risk 
of resurgent fiscal imbalances in the event of 
an interest rate reversal.Longer matur-
ities for govern-ment debt, but dampening effect of central bank profits would cease if interest rates reversed

Return on private financial assets taking 
into account inflation and taxes
Nominal interest rates have fallen sharply in recent years, and the rate of return on new invest -
ments in interest-  bearing instruments is low fr om a longer-  term perspective. However , develop -
ments in Germany are much less pronounced when inflation and taxes are taken into account 
and after-  tax r eal interest rates, which are particularly relevant for private investments, are con -
sidered. After-  tax r eal interest rates are dependent on the interplay between nominal interest 
rates, the inflation rate and the tax rate.
Developments are heterogeneous for short and longer-  term investments. In the c ase of savings 
deposits with a short notice period, the nominal interest rate has declined significantly, and the 
real interest rate is also very low and has fallen into negative territory. Even in the past, however, the real interest rate was frequently negative, especially after tax, making a perceptible move into positive territory in only a small number of years. At the beginning of the 1980s and 1990s, for 
example, the after-  tax r eal interest rate was clearly negative for higher personal tax rates. Over -
all, the after-  tax r eal interest rate was supported over time by the fact that inflation rates tended 
to decrease and tax rates were also lowered. With regard to longer-  term investments in ten-  year 
bonds, a downward trend has been observed both in nominal and real returns since the early 
1980s. If tax is also taken into account, however, no clear trend (in the case of higher personal tax rates) is visible here up to the start of the current decade either. Over the past few years, real returns on new investments have fallen to a very low level, both before and after tax, and also stood in negative territory of late.
The statutory tax rates for (nominal) private interest income have been lowered perceptibly, espe -
cially since the introduction of the withholding tax. Private interest income is consequently taxed 
at a lower rate compared with the personal income tax rate on higher incomes. However, in the current debate about a possible reform or discontinuation of the withholding tax, it should also be noted that the compensation for inflation contained in nominal returns does not constitute a 
gain in financial capacity, but merely compensates for the inflation-  induc ed depreciation of sav -
ings. When real interest rates are low, even the lower rate of withholding tax results in high 
effective tax rates on real interest returns, even in combination with moderate inflation rates.Deutsche Bundesbank

Development of interest 
rates on private financial 
assets taking into account 
inflation and taxes
In recent years, (nominal) interest rates have 
declined significantly worldwide, including in Germany, and are now at a historically low 
level.1 This reduces the return on private finan -
cial assets and, all other things being equal, 
makes it less attractive to save. From the per -
spective of savers, the burden arising from in -
flation and taxes also has to be taken into ac -
count, however. For example, the development 
of short-  term r eal interest rates (nominal inter -
est rates adjusted for inflation)2 on financial 
assets with a short lock-  in period, which ar e 
often the preferred choice in Germany (savings 
accounts, for instance), has been less excep -
tional from a longer-  term perspective because  
inflation has also been lower over the past few 
years. This is even more so the case if after-  tax 
real interest rates are taken into account as 
these reflect the interplay between the rates of return, inflation and taxes. Reductions in statu-
tory (nominal) tax rates and, above all, the lower weight of taxation on the inflationary compensation when inflation rates are lower 
have, when viewed in isolation, supported the 
development of after-  tax r eal rates of return 
over time.
Taxation of private interest 
income
Since 2009, private investment income in Ger -
many is, as a general rule, subject to a with -
holding tax – provided that the interest income 
does not fall under the savers’ tax-  fr ee allow -
ance on capital gains3 – charged at a flat rate 
of 25%,4 in addition to the solidarity surcharge 
and, where applicable, church tax.5 Investment 
income, such as interest and dividends, but 
also capital gains are subject to taxation. Losses 
on sales can be offset against gains from the 
same asset class. Any negative interest is inter -
preted by the tax authorities as “custody and deposit fees” and thus as income-  r elated ex -
penses, which is deemed to be covered by the 
savers’ tax-  f ree allowance. At the enterprise 
level, dividends are subject to upstream charges 
of corporation tax (plus the solidarity surcharge) 
as well as local business tax, whereas interest 
remains largely untaxed at the corporate end.6 
Investment income incurred prior to 2009 used 
to be taxed together with other relevant in -
come as part of the (progressive) income tax 
scale, and account was taken (schematically) of 
upstream tax on dividends at the corporate 
level. The tax rates on nominal interest income 
were significantly reduced when the income 
tax rate was lowered, especially at the turn of the millennium, and, for higher taxable income, by the introduction of withholding tax (see, for example, the upper chart on page 71).Inflation and

interest rates on deposits in Germany, Monthly Report, July 
2017, pp 101-103, in which the development for various types of deposits is shown over an extended period of 
time.2 Here, the actual rate of consumer price inflation is used. 
This is appropriate for the actual interest income earned 
after tax, whereas for questions relating to investment de-cisions, inflation expectations are more relevant.3
 In 2009, the lump-  sum allowance for income-  r elated ex -
penses and the previous savers’ tax allowance were con -
solidated into a standard savers’ tax-  fr ee allowance (€801 
for single persons and €1,602 for couples who are as -
sessed jointly for income tax purposes). Since then, it has 
not been possible to claim a tax deduction for actually in -
curred income-  r elated expenses in connection with invest -
ment income. Previously, the savers’ tax allowance was in some cases lower than the current standard allowance (up 
to 1992), but in some cases also significantly higher (eg 
DM 6,000 (€3,068) for single persons between 1993 and 1999).
4 It is possible to request that private investment income 
be taxed on the basis of the statutory income tax rate (to -
gether with other taxable income) if this results in the tax 
burden being lower on the whole (identification of more 
favourable tax treatment). For single persons, a tax rate of 
above 25% is currently applied to the portion of annual 
taxable income exceeding €16,071.5 Unless otherwise stated, the tax charges specified in the 
following include the solidarity surcharge, provided that 
this was levied in the year in question. Church tax and the associated reduction, on the other hand, are generally dis -
regarded as church tax is not attributable to federal income 
tax. Church tax rates differ depending on the respective 
state government.

interest payments are not fully deductible from the tax 
base in the case of local business tax.Deutsche Bundesbank

The importance of inflation  
and real interest rates  
for the taxation  
of real interest income
Income tax is, in principle, linked to financial 
capacity. In the case of interest-  bearing invest -
ments, inflation depresses the value of savings 
in real terms and part of the remuneration goes 
purely towards compensating for this loss. This 
inflationary compensation therefore does not 
increase the financial capacity, it merely main -
tains the purchasing power of the savings. Tax -
ation systems generally use the nominal rate of 
interest, however. In times of positive inflation, the relative tax charge on real income (herein-after referred to as the “real tax rate”) is there -
fore always greater than the relative tax charge on nominal income (“nominal tax rate”). For a 
given nominal tax rate, the real tax rate in -
creases in line with the relationship between 
inflation and real interest rates. In the event of 
low real interest rates, real burdens of over 100% can already occur even with the low 
withholding tax rate in combination with mod -
erate rates of inflation (see the lower adjacent 
chart).7 Conversely, for a given real interest 
rate, the after-  tax r eal rate of return declines as 
inflation rates rise (provided that the nominal 
interest rate is positive and thus taxes are pay -
able at all). With a given savers’ tax-  fr ee allow -
ance, higher and higher investment amounts 
generate tax-  fr ee income, the lower the nom -
inal interest rate.

of example, short-  t erm and longer-  t erm 
interest-  bearing investments ar e shown here 
for the period since 1980. For savings deposits 
with a notice period of up to three months, 
there is a downward tendency in nominal inter -
est rates (see also the chart above). They were 
at a low level in 2016 and decreased somewhat further in the first half of this year. In real terms, 
however, interest rates developed without a 
marked trend. Last year, real interest rates were 
slightly negative, although not exceptionally low. Given that the inflation rate has risen in the meantime, though, real interest rates de -
clined again distinctly in the first half of the cur -
rent year.
After-  tax r eal interest rates were lower in the 
past.8 Whenever personal tax rates were higher, 
these were negative in the vast majority of 
cases and distinctly positive in only a few years. 
As a result, they were less favourable in the early 1980s and 1990s than at the current 
juncture. In previous years, relatively high infla-tion rates and the tax burdens that accompan -
ied them played a particularly significant role in 
this context. While the tax burden did, to all intents and purposes, fall when withholding 
tax was introduced (provided that the relevant income tax rate was higher, as assumed in the 
stylised calculations presented here), the (after-  
tax) real interest rate was likewise negative –  markedly so in most cases  – in the period 
from 2011 to 2014. In 2015 and 2016, it 
hovered at around zero, close to the nominal 
rate, due to the low inflation rate. In terms of 
the tax burden on households’ savings de -
posits, the combination of low nominal interest rates with low inflation was therefore not espe -
cially unfavourable in 2015 and 2016 compared 
with previous years. This is all the more true 
when taking the savers’ tax-  fr ee allowance into 
account, which exempts a greater volume of 
savings from tax when interest rates are low. In the first few months of this year, however, real 
interest rates before and after tax returned to 
significantly more negative territory in the light 
of higher inflation rates. That said, given that 
the nominal interest rate is close to zero, tax -
ation still plays only a minor role when it comes 
to interest rates. The difference between the 
real interest rates before and after tax all but 
disappeared in the period from 1980 (when it 
amounted to around 2.5 percentage points) to 2016.

8 As described above, for the purpose of determining the 
after-  tax r eal rate of return here, a stylised assumption of 
the relevant top tax rate is made for the period prior to the 
introduction of withholding tax in 2009. Given the rela -
tively high income thresholds, the additional top-  income  
tax bracket (tax rate of 45% on income above €256,304 at present for single persons) that was introduced in 2007 is 
excluded. For the sake of simplicity, standard allowances 
(as well as income-  r elated expenses) are factored out. If, 
instead of the top tax rate, it were always, for example, the 
starting tax rate that was of relevance (see also the chart 
on p 71), the burdens would lie somewhere between the 
before-  tax and after-  tax real rates of return depicted in the 
charts on this page and p 73. If investment income were to undershoot the thresholds for standard allowances, or if no tax were to be paid when identifying the more favourable 
tax treatment, the before-  tax r eal interest rate would equal 
the after-  tax real interest rate.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

real tax rate. The real tax rate was usually well 
above the statutory tax burden. Despite nega-
tive before-  tax r eal rates of return, tax pay -
ments were still incurred in a number of years. 
The lowest real tax rate for the other years was over 30%, which was recorded in 2009. How-
ever, in terms of saving incentives, a bigger role is played by the absolute differences in returns 
owing to tax payments – in combination with 
low inflation rates (despite potentially very high tax rates), at least, these tend to be small when returns are low.
9 If the nominal interest rate is 
zero or less, there is ultimately no tax payment 
due (and the tax rates are zero, accordingly). 
The effect of standard allowances, which are 
becoming more important in the low-  inter est- 
rate environment in that higher investment vol -
umes remain tax-  exempt, is disregarded. For 
example, at a nominal interest rate of ¼% and 
taking into account the savers’ tax-  fr ee allow -
ance of €801, the income on an investment 
amount of €320,000 would currently be tax-  
exempt for single persons.10
The development of 
after-tax    real rates of return  
on  ten-year bonds
Longer-  term investments in fixed-  income se -
curities figure less prominently than instru -
ments such as short-  term bank deposits in the 
average financial asset portfolio in Germany.11 
However, in order to illustrate the range of re -
turn patterns, developments ought to also be 
described here using the example of long-  
dated bonds. The starting point for these calcu-
lations is the nominal average yield on out -
standing ten-  y ear German debt securities that 
are held to maturity (see the above chart). To 
determine the real rate of return, payments are 
adjusted for purchasing power using the con -
sumer price inflation realised over the bond’s 
holding period. In the case of investments 
made from 2007 onwards, the end of the hold -
ing period lies in the future. For the years from 
2017 onwards, therefore, inflation is approxi -
mated by current inflation forecasts.12 To deter -mine the after-  tax r eal rate of return, nominal 
coupon payments received are taxed at the tax 
rate applicable at the time of payment.13 The 
real return on a nominal bond that will actually 
be generated in future for investments made 
from 2007 onwards is therefore uncertain and Real tax rates

The real returns are calculated using the inflation rates realised during the maturity period (up until 2016 the consumer price index, from 2017 to 2019 the Har-monised Index of Consumer Prices based on Bundesbank es-timates, and from 2020 Consensus Economics forecasts). The after-tax real rate of return is determined using the “highest tax rate” applicable during the maturity period (see the chart on p 71). An unchanged tax system is assumed as of 2017. The value for a given year therefore takes account of the nominal coupon from December of the previous year as well as the infla-tion rates and the tax framework of the current year and the following nine years.

11 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2015), op cit, p  20. The 
share of directly held longer-  term debt securities is much  
lower than the share of bank deposits. At just under 40%, households’ claims on insurance corporations are weighty, 
and insurance corporations hold a significant share of 
longer-  term bonds. That said, the taxation described her e 
often does not apply to the taxation of these bonds, and 
they do not form the main focus of this article.12 The Bundesbank’s estimate for the Harmonised Index of 
Consumer Prices is used for this purpose for 2017 to 2019, 
with survey data from Consensus Economics being used

hinges on the future path of inflation as well as 
any changes to tax legislation (the last point 
only applying with respect to the after-  tax r eal 
rate of return). The later the investment was 
made, the greater the extent to which this ap -
plies.
The before-  tax r eal rates of return on ten-  year 
bonds are usually higher than those on short-  
term investments, which means not least that 
the relative significance of taxing the inflation -
ary compensation is lower. Overall, before-  t ax 
nominal and real rates of return run more in 
parallel for these forms of investment. Unlike 
savings deposits, real rates of return on these 
bonds have fallen significantly over time, start-ing in the early 1980s. They have been negative 
since 2015. By contrast, the after-  tax r eal rate 
of return displayed no clear tendency until the 
current decade, as the decline in real rates of 
return was cushioned by shrinking real tax bur -
dens (when personal income tax rates were 
higher) due to falling inflation rates and, fur -
thermore, as statutory tax rates were lowered. 
The after-  tax r eal rates of return fluctuated al -
most consistently between ½% and 2%. In the 
current decade and, in particular, over the last 
few years, however, the before-  tax r eal rates of 
return then dropped into negative territory and 
differed comparatively little from the after-  tax  
real rates of return in the period under review. 
This year, developments are virtually unchanged 
compared with 2016 and, provided inflation 
develops as forecast and tax legislation remains 
unchanged, the after-  tax r eal rate of return 
amounted to -1.2% at last report.
On the whole, it can be determined in the case 
of investments in ten-  year bonds as wel l that 
the decline in the nominal rate of return, which 
has been observed for some time, is much less 
pronounced when taking into account inflation and taxation. The effect of taxation, ie the dif -
ference between the before-  tax and after -  tax  
real rate of return, on ten-  year bonds has di -
minished, falling significantly between the early 
1980s (when the difference stood at around 
5 percentage points) and 2016 (0.1 percentage point). In the case of these long-  dated bonds, 
too, the relative real tax burden has been sig -
nificantly higher than the statutory tax rate on an annual average since 1980 – but, due to the higher and more stable real interest rate, it has also been lower and less volatile than the bur -
den associated with short-  term deposits. A t the 
current juncture, the rates of return on new in-
vestments are low by any measure (nominal, 
real and real after tax).
Concluding remarks
Nominal interest rates in Germany are currently 
historically low. Thus, on the one hand, finan -
cing conditions are highly favourable over the 
entire maturity and risk spectrum. This applies 
not only to government financing but also, for 
example, to financing for enterprises, house -
holds and banks. The low interest rates are at -
tributable to a number of structural and cyclical 
factors. In addition to the highly accommoda -
tive monetary policy still being pursued on ac -
count of persistently low inflation in the euro 
area, an important role is also being played by 
a decline in potential growth and a high pro -
pensity to save, partly in the face of demo -
graphic change. On the other hand, the low 
interest paid by borrowers also means that 
savers are generating low returns on their fi -
nancial assets.
When assessing interest rate movements from 
the savers’ perspective, a distinction should be 
made between nominal interest rates, which 
are often at the heart of the debate, real inter -
est rates and after-  tax r eal interest rates. For 
instance, all in all, the decline in interest rates is 
weaker and less remarkable when looking at 
real interest rates before and after tax. For sav -
ings deposits terminable at short notice, for in -
stance, real interest rates after tax (in the case 
of higher personal tax rates) were frequently 
negative even in the past, making a perceptible move into positive territory in only a few years.

year bonds have also dropped markedly in the No clear ten-

period under review. The decline is somewhat 
weaker than in nominal terms. Looking at 
after-  tax r eal rates of return (at higher tax rates) 
up to the start of this decade, however, no 
clear tendency can be identified, with values 
fluctuating between ½% and 2%. As a result of 
receding inflation, real tax burdens shrank and, 
in addition, statutory tax rates were cut. Both 
of these factors counteracted the decline in 
before-  tax nominal inter est rates. In the past 
few years, however, the after-  t ax real rates of 
return on longer-  term bonds have also fal len 
significantly, moving into negative territory.
On the whole, taxation of interest income has 
been scaled back in Germany over the past few 
decades. The factors that have contributed to 
this are general income tax cuts and, in particu -
lar, the introduction of withholding tax in 2009. 
In terms of the tax system and the economic 
effect, it should be noted that the inflationary 
compensation contained in nominal returns 
does not constitute a gain in financial capacity, 
but merely compensates for the inflation-  
induced depreciation of the savings amount.14 
Taxing nominal interest income can lead, even 
when inflation rates are moderate, to a high tax burden on real interest income. For ex -
ample, if the inflation rate were close to 2% 
and the long-  term  real return on investment 
slightly above expected real potential growth 
of 1¼%, this would result in a nominal rate of return of around 3½%. Factoring in the with -
holding tax rate of 25%, this would produce a real tax rate in the order of 60%, which would 
still be markedly higher than the current top 
income tax rates of 42% and 45% respectively. 
When real interest rates are lower or inflation 
rates higher, the relative real tax burden is even higher.
Taxation of private interest income that is fully 
based on real values is not currently up for dis-
cussion and would probably be fraught with 
implementation issues in practice (eg when de -
termining tax-  r elevant annual returns or select -
ing inflation variables). Irrespective of that, it would be necessary to bear in mind the high 
real burden in some cases when taxing at nom -
inal rates in connection with a reform of with -
holding tax as discussed in some quarters and 
the advantages and drawbacks that this would 
entail. Since the introduction of withholding 
tax, nominal interest income is taxed at a lower 
rate than the personal income tax rate for 
higher incomes. However, even when inflation 
rates are moderate, low real interest rates re -
sult in high real tax rates on interest income.Real tax rate

14 The nominal principle set out in tax legislation tends to 
lead in some areas to the taxation of components that only 
compensate for inflation, eg also more generally in the 
case of income tax. However, the effect when taxing inter -
est is usually particularly great.Deutsche Bundesbank

The danger posed to the global economy 
by protectionist tendencies
Protectionism has reappeared on the international economic policy agenda. Calls for restrictions 
on cross-  bor der trade are typically heard in phases of major macroeconomic problems. During 
the global financial and economic crisis, however, the leading economic nations declared their 
common support for the rules-  based multilater al world trading system. Over the past years, 
global economic output has expanded steadily while unemployment in the group of industrial 
countries has receded.
Recent studies do point, though, to a negative impact of globalisation on local labour markets. 
In particular, low earners with limited geographical and sectoral mobility have suffered job and income losses. While trade liberalisation has yielded benefits on balance, their uneven distribution across sectors, regions and individuals is now threatening to weaken popular acceptance of glob -
alisation and is presenting a challenge to policymakers. The topic of so-called global imbalances 
has likewise attracted critical attention. Persistent large surplus and deficit positions in current 
account balances are sometimes cited as evidence of a supposed uneven distribution of the bene -
fits of the current world trading system.
Neither argument provides ammunition for attacking the existing trade system set-  up. The struc -
tural problems arising from globalisation resemble – and often accompany – those relating to 
technological progress. Current account balances reflect saving and investment decisions and 
cannot be labelled as either good or bad without first analysing their backgrounds. Moreover, 
global imbalances are currently substantially lower than they were prior to the global financial and economic crisis.
Protectionist measures harbour the risk of inflicting self-  harm even if they do not trigger r etali-
atory measures. As a rule, a country’s own export industry suffers, and higher prices may depress 
consumption. This is also suggested by simulations using various macroeconomic models. A country’s own economy would be negatively impacted at the latest when adversely affected 
partner countries took retaliatory action. The welfare losses for the world as a whole would then be even greater than before.
Protectionist tendencies pose a major danger to the global economy. There is thus a lot to be said 
in favour of defending and further developing the rules-  based multilater al trading system. In 
order to tackle problems that may emanate from structural change, suitable adjustments should 
be made, if necessary, to education and economic policies as well as to tax and transfer systems.Deutsche Bundesbank

Tendencies since the global 
financial and economic crisis
During the global financial and economic crisis, 
many feared that governments might be 
tempted to impose trade barriers in their quest 
to halt falling output and employment. Such a 
slide to protectionist measures probably ex -
acerbated the global economic crisis in the 
1930s.1 There was no repeat of this in 2009.2 
Subsequently, global trade recovered quickly 
from the sharp economic downturn.
Yet since 2012 global trade has grown slug -
gishly, also in relation to aggregate output, al -
though the latter has likewise expanded less 
dynamically. However, protectionist tendencies 
do not appear to have been driving this.3 This 
development probably owes more to the changed composition of global demand. In 
particular, global economic growth was largely fuelled during this period by the emerging mar -
kets, whose expansion is not as trade-  intensive 
as that of the advanced economies.4 In add -
ition, capital formation, which is likewise often 
accompanied by a high level of imports, was 
restrained in the past few years by adjustments in the commodities sector and the realignment of the Chinese economy.
5 This demand-  side ex -
planation for the sluggish development of world trade is supported by the fact that the 
global economy’s acceleration in recent quar -
ters was notably accompanied by a pick-  up in 
investment and in cross-  bor der trade in goods.6
Information from the World Trade Organization 
(WTO) suggests that protectionist tendencies 
have not intensified over the last few years.7,8 
Following a temporary increase in 2013, the number of new trade restrictions adopted in 
the G20 countries, which account for the bulk 
of world trade, has been relatively stable. Yet only a fraction of the trade barriers imposed 
since 2009 have since been terminated, which 
means that their stock has steadily increased. 
However, many of these restrictions were trade 
remedy actions such as anti-  dumping and  
countervailing investigations designed to coun -ter unfair trading practices and which WTO member states are fundamentally entitled to 
introduce. In addition, a number of trade-  
 facilitating measures were recorded. While the 
number of such trade-facilitating measures fell 
well short of the newly introduced trade re -
strictions, these figures should be interpreted with caution as the trade coverage of the 
measures may differ substantially.9 At 6½% at 
the end of 2016, the share of G20 imports sub -No slide to

ments since 2009 and has reported on them at regular 
intervals. For further information, see WTO, Report on G20

8 The WTO records traditional trade-restrictive measures, 
such as tariffs or anti-  dumping measur es. The Global Trade 
Alert (GTA) database, which is occasionally used as an al -
ternative, also covers protectionist measures that are not 
directly aimed at international trade but may be of a dis -
criminatory nature (“murky protectionism”), such as gov -
ernment aid for domestic companies. Bundesbank observa-
tions suggest that the GTA data are highly susceptible to 
revision, with corrections even being made to data from 
many years ago.
9 It should be noted that the information customarily in -
cluded in the regular WTO reports does not take into ac -
count the extensive effect of implementing the ITA Expan -
sion Agreement. This agreement aims to abolish tariffs on 
high-  tech pr oducts, which make up around 10% of global 
goods trade. The initial steps of this implementation (since 
July 2016) already affected goods flows in the amount of 
US$375 billion (3% of the G20 countries’ imports of 
goods). See WTO, Report on G20 trade measures, 10 No -

ject to the import restrictions recorded since 
October 2008 was rather low.10
Overall, the global economic setting in recent 
years did not seem to foster stronger protec -
tionist dangers. Global economic output ex -
panded steadily, albeit at a moderate pace. The 
industrial countries saw a gradual decline in un -
employment. Of late, the unemployment rate 
in some major economies has even dropped to 
lows that, in some cases, have not been 
reached in decades.
In the light of the above, it is all the more as -
tonishing that protectionism has recently been 
identified by many observers as one of the most significant downside risks to the global economy.
11,12 Moreover, the jump in corres -
ponding internet searches suggests that inter -
est in the topic of protectionism shot up at the turn of 2016-17.
13 While one factor in this may 
have been the outcome of the presidential 
election in the United States, it would be over-  
simplistic to narrow this problem down to the 
United States alone. Demands which could ul -
timately lead to greater isolation of a country’s 
economy have also been voiced in other ma -
ture economies.
Rationale behind protectionist  
measures 
The calls for more restrictive trade policies are 
essentially based on two arguments: the dis -
locations induced by globalisation, especially on domestic labour markets, and so-called 
global imbalances.
Employment losses in the 
manufacturing sector
The alleged adverse effects of globalisation are 
frequently cited in order to justify demands for 
restrictive trade policies. Some claim, for in -
stance, that the United States has suffered mas -
sive job losses in the industrial sector due to competition from cheap imports following Chi -
na’s entry into the market. In fact, the number 
of jobs in the manufacturing sector fell from 
17½ million in 1998 to just 11½ million in 2010 after essentially not having changed over more than three decades. Looking at the overall em -
ployment dynamics since the turn of the millen -
nium, which have been greatly dulled by demo -
graphic change, the share of manufacturing 
jobs in total non-  farm payr oll employment con -
tracted between 1998 and 2010 from 14% to 
just under 9%. While this contraction hardly

facturing employment in favour of jobs in the 
services sector,14 a breakdown of the main US 
manufacturing industries does reveal that the 
job losses that have occurred since 2000 tended 
to be higher when the competition from im -
ports, especially from China, was greater. This 
could be an indication that globalisation has ac -
celerated the underlying structural change.
Earlier studies predominantly identified techno -
logical progress as the driving force behind the 
relative employment haemorrhage in the US 
manufacturing sector. They additionally argued 
that job cuts in the sectors or regions affected 
could have been offset without much ado by new employment opportunities in other areas. However, recent studies draw a more nuanced 
picture.15 They state that a substantial part of 
industrial job losses were attributable to the in -
crease in Chinese imports.16 They also say that 
the job cuts that occurred in sectors in direct 
competition with imports and among the asso -
ciated suppliers then spilled over into other in -
dustries via income and demand losses.17 An-
other finding is that the increased competitive 
pressures prompted firms to invest in labour-  
saving technology, an effect that was amplified 
by US corporations’ offshore and outsourcing 
activities.18
The adverse labour market effects in the regions 
of the United States where the affected indus -
tries are concentrated were found to be com -
paratively persistent. Migration processes seem 
to have played an insufficient role as an offset -
ting mechanism.19 Low earners, in particular, re -
mained in their region and industry and suffered 
sizeable income losses. By contrast, those on a 
higher income –  most likely owing to their 
higher level of education – appeared better able

to Chinese import competition, increased from just under 
1 million (around half of which occurred in the industries 
directly affected and half in their upstream suppliers) to up 
to 2½ million. See D Acemoglu, D  H  Autor, G  H  Hanson

to find new jobs, also in a different industry, 
and to suffer virtually no income cuts.20
In Germany, on the other hand, it appears that 
globalisation tends to have boosted industrial 
workers’ earnings. The key factor was evidently 
that new opportunities in the export sector 
more than offset the dampening effect in the 
segments competing with imports. But for Ger -
many, too, noticeable distribution effects and 
dislocations are perceived on the labour mar -
ket.21
Such partial analyses, however, disregard po -
tential favourable effects of globalisation. Al -
though a general equilibrium analysis in the 
context of a dynamic trade model with regional 
labour markets confirmed the dampening ef -
fect of China’s integration into the global econ-
omy on employment in the US manufacturing 
sector,22 it was found that other economic sec -
tors created more extra jobs than were lost in 
industry. On the whole, the results indicate an increase in US welfare as especially consumers 
benefited from access to cheaper goods from 
China. There were, however, large differences 
in the labour market and welfare effects across regions.
23 This poses a potential danger to the 
popular acceptance of globalisation and presents policymakers with considerable chal -
lenges.24
Global imbalances
Calls for protectionist measures also point by 
way of justification to so-  cal led global imbal -
ances. These relate to persistent, large balances 
on national current accounts.25 Extensive sur -
plus and deficit positions are sometimes inter -
preted as a sign of an uneven distribution of the current world trading system’s benefits. 
However, such balances are ultimately the re -
sult of an economy’s saving and investment de -
cisions, with a deficit indicating the funding shortfall financed by the rest of the world. In 
the sense of an intertemporal trade analysis, an economy’s deficit enables it to take up funds to expand its potential output without having to 
restrict current consumption accordingly. Con -
versely, countries with a surplus are able to share in the growth potential of economies 
with current account deficits. However, exten -
sive balances may also reflect unsound devel -
opments (eg of a fiscal nature or in the ex -
change rate regime) that are not sustainable in the long term. A large deficit, for instance, har -
bours the risk that financial flows from other 
countries may suddenly dry up and thereby ne -
cessitate a painful adjustment.More favourable

Prior to the global financial and economic cri -
sis, the US current account deficit, in particular, 
was therefore deemed a downward risk for the 
global economy. Measured as the sum of na -
tional deficits, the global imbalances rose from 
around 1% of global economic output in the mid-1990s to 2½% ten years later.
26 Of this 
amount, the US deficit alone accounted for 1½ percentage points. Yet the feared abrupt 
adjustment via a sharp depreciation of the US 
dollar did not materialise. Instead, the imbal -
ances declined in the wake of the global reces -
sion and, since then, have held steady at a level 
of just over 1½% of global output.27 The US 
current account deficit fell from 6% of US gross domestic product (GDP) to 2½%.
Given this scale of global imbalances, both the 
direct threat of an escalating danger for the 
global economy and the urgency of further ad-
justments appear rather small. Moreover, indi -
vidual surplus countries would hardly be able 
to significantly reduce the US current account deficit by increasing their demand (see the box 
on pages 83 to 85).28 This is due first to the 
order of magnitude involved. Thus the US 
economy is over five times as large as the Ger -
man economy. A second obstacle is that in -
creased demand – for instance in Germany – 
would not just affect the United States. It 
would also stimulate domestic output and ex -
ports from other economies with which Ger -
many has close trade ties and, not least, from 
those countries that have surpluses them-
selves.29 Experience in the past few years in 
countries that export crude oil has shown that 
the reduction of individual economies’ current 
account surpluses has neither helped to re -
move global imbalances nor to eliminate the

26 In theory, the national current account balances should 
sum to zero. In practice, however, a statistical discrepancy is observable. Thus the size of the global imbalances differs slightly depending on whether it is calculated on the basis of the sum of all current account deficits or surpluses.
27 The sum of current account surpluses was slightly 
higher and fell from just under 3% of global economic out -
put in 2006 to around 2% in recent years.

30 The group of crude oil-  exporting countries (as defined 
by the International Monetary Fund) reported aggregate 
current account surpluses of almost 1% of global economic output in 2011. However, these surpluses had been almost entirely eroded by 2016. The fall in oil prices, which is likely to have played a key role in this contraction, concurrently 
contributed directly to improving the US current account

Possibilities for adjusting the US current account defi  cit
The US economy’s external position has re-
cently become a focus of public debate in 
connection with potential trade policy meas-
ures. Prior to the global fi  nancial and eco-
nomic crisis, a disorderly adjustment of the US current account defi  cit was considered one of 
the most signifi  cant risks to the global econ-
omy.1 In 2006, the defi  cit amounted to almost 
6% of US gross domestic product (GDP), caus-ing serious questions to be raised as to its sus-
tainability.2 However, the United States’ cur-
rent account balance then contracted consid-
erably in the wake of the recession of 2008-
09 and amounted to merely 2½% of US GDP 
in 2016, as in 2015. In addition, there was a 
marked shift in the sectoral structure of the defi  cit. Thus the current account defi  cit last year was solely attributable to government borrowing requirements, whereas ten years earlier households (including non-corporate 
business) had also recorded net borrowing.
In the light of this change, the adjustment 
need not only appears smaller than before but 
also less urgent. In addition, it is probably 
closely linked to the need to consolidate pub-
lic fi  nances. Nonetheless, the analysis below outlines possible options which could contrib-
ute to further narrowing the US current ac-
count defi  cit. The macroeconomic effects are 
determined via simulations using NiGEM, the 
global economic model developed by the 
National  Institute of Economic and Social Re-search (NIESR).
3
A current account defi  cit implies that an econ-
omy invests more than it saves; in other words, domestic absorption exceeds GDP . It therefore makes intuitive sense to reduce 
fi  nancing  needs vis- à- vis the rest of the world 
by curbing domestic demand. According to a calculation in NiGEM, a permanent reduction 
in domestic demand in the United States by 1% of GDP would improve the current ac-
count balance by ½ percentage point in the 
long run.4 Yet, at the same time, US economic 
output would be signifi  cantly dampened, es-
pecially in the short run.5
For this reason, there have been numerous calls for adjustment by boosting demand in 
surplus countries. While a permanent increase 
in German domestic demand by 1% of do-
mestic GDP would considerably worsen Ger-
many’s current account balance (by ¾  per-
centage point in relation to GDP in the long 
run), the positive effect on the external pos-
ition of the United States would be marginal.6 1 See for example International Monetary Fund, Global 
prospects and policy issues, World Economic Outlook, September 2006, pp 12-16.
2 This fi  gure was equivalent to more than half of 
global imbalances as measured by the sum of national current account defi  cits.
3 NiGEM models most OECD countries as well as 
major emerging markets and their economic intercon-
nectedness via foreign trade and the interest rate- exchange rate nexus. The model has New Keynesian features as well as forward- looking elements on the 
fi  nancial and labour markets. See https:// nimodel.niesr.ac.uk.4 To this end, public consumption is reduced exogen-ously (and with the fi  scal rule deactivated) so as not to affect the equations for private demand variables. The scenario can be interpreted as a general decline in de-mand, as imports are a function of aggregate demand 
in NiGEM. Monetary policy follows a conventional 
monetary policy rule here, as in the following simula-
tions.5 Real GDP would fall by ¾% relative to the baseline in the short term, and by ¼% in the long term.

This is due, not least, to the two economies’ 
relative sizes: measured at market exchange 
rates, US economic output last year was more 
than fi  ve times as high as that of Germany.
If, alternatively, China were to stimulate do-mestic demand on the same scale,
7 the im-
pact on the US current account balance would 
be somewhat larger but still small according 
to the model simulation. Even if seven major 
surplus countries were to simultaneously boost their demand by 1% of GDP ,
8 the US 
current account balance would improve by just ¼ percentage point in the longer term. 
This is because the additional demand would 
not be confi  ned to goods from the United States. Instead it would also encompass do-
mestic products and goods from other coun-tries, which in some cases likewise have a cur-rent account surplus.
In order to be sustainable, the stimulus must 
also have a permanent impact. If the expan-
sion in demand were generated by fi  scal 
measures, the related costs to public fi  nances would cumulate over time. This means that 
fi  scal sustainability should also be taken into 
consideration as a limiting factor. Overall, 
there seems little prospect that the mismatch between savings and investment in the United 
States could be resolved by steering demand 
in the surplus countries.
A fi  nal option to be considered for reducing the US current account defi  cit is a gradual 
fi  nancial  market- driven depreciation of the US 
dollar; such an exchange rate shift would occur via a higher risk premium for invest-
ments in the US currency.9 In contrast to the 
risk scenario of a sudden drying- up of capital 
fl  ows, fi  nancial investors would incrementally 
realign their portfolios in favour of other countries or currencies and thus enable the 
economies to adjust with fewer frictions. Even so, the model simulation shows that a gradual 
nominal depreciation of 10% (in effective 
terms) in the long term would improve the US 
current account balance by ¾  percentage 
point. The shift in relative prices would divert 
national and international demand and thus contribute to a steep decline in US real im-
ports and a considerable increase in exports.
The rebalancing of the US economy would go 
much deeper, however, since fi  nancing condi-tions would worsen in the context of the de-

8 China, Japan, Germany, South Korea, the Nether-
lands, Switzerland and Taiwan.9 The scenario is created in NiGEM by a staggered row of simulations in which within eight quarters a limited 
risk premium is permanently introduced in each case 
into the uncovered interest parity between the US dol-
lar and all other currencies such that, conversely, the 
United States’ trading partners’ currencies gradually 
appreciate. To this end the fi  xed exchange rates out-

pended. See also R Barrell, D Holland and I Hurst, Sus-tainable adjustment of global imbalances, in A Åslund

tual trade links. If, for example, the US deficit in 
trade in goods with Germany is set in relation 
to the value of bilateral trade, it is less elevated 
in international terms than the absolute num -
bers might suggest. In addition, consumers’ 
specific preferences and product specialisation 
may be important factors in the bilateral bal -
ance in the trade in goods.31 International pro-
duction chains mean that the reported amounts 
also contain value added from other econ -
omies.32 While the respective trade policy may 
play a role, it is hardly possible to infer the ex -
tent of protectionism from the bilateral trade 
balance alone. According to WTO data, the United States – along with India and Brazil – 
are among those G20 countries that have initi -
ated the most trade remedy investigations 
since 2008.33Simulations using 
 macro  economic models
Advocates of trade restrictions hope that these will increase national welfare, not least by rais-
ing output and employment. To estimate the 
macroeconomic effects of possible protection -
ist measures, the following section presents simulations using two macroeconomic struc -Various model-
ling approachespreciating currency. The real long- term inter-
est rate would be distinctly higher than in the 
baseline scenario.10 As a result, investment 
would plummet. In addition, households 
would rein in their real consumption signifi  -
cantly on the back of higher import and con-sumer prices. US GDP would consequently be 2½% lower in the long run. Mirroring the de-
velopment in the United States, other econ-
omies would benefi  t from the positive effects of appreciation and improved fi  nancing terms. 
Conversely, the simulation illustrates that, 
from this perspective, the United States could benefi  t considerably from a strong dollar and 
its current account defi  cit. Foreign investors’ preference for fi  nancial assets in the United 
States allows US citizens to increase their do-mestic absorption in excess of their incomes.
11 
A dollar depreciation resulting from a shift in 
risk premiums would not boost US GDP but 
rather reduce it, albeit not to the same extent as domestic demand.10 As a result of the United States’ position as a net 
external debtor, the interest rate increase also leads to 
increased payments to the rest of the world. This 
dampens the improvement in the US current account 
balance; it is smaller than the improvement in the 
trade balance. This implies that a current account ad-
justment via depreciation would not be as effective 
today as it would be in the case of a smaller net for-
eign debt. Nonetheless, the revaluation leads to a con-
siderable improvement in the net international invest-ment position.11 For the role played by the United States in the inter-
national capital markets and the implications for the  current account defi  cit, see also C C  Coughlin,

31 Balances in the trade in goods are normally the main 
feature of the current account balance. The trade balances 
for fuels and motor vehicles are particularly pronounced in 
relation to the respective trade values. The former may re -
flect the uneven geographical distribution of natural re -
sources and the latter differentiated product specialisation.

tural models that have been adapted for this 
purpose. The first is NiGEM, the global eco -
nomic model of the National Institute of Eco -
nomic and Social Research (NIESR). On the basis of empirically estimated error correction 
equations, this model aims to show the behav -
iour of key macroeconomic variables for a plur -
ality of countries.34 The second is a New 
Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilib -
rium model (DSGE model) designed by the 
Bundesbank for three global regions (here the 
United States, the euro area excluding Ger -
many, and Germany). The advantage of this 
model lies in its detailed microeconomic foun -
dation which also makes it possible to consider welfare aspects.35 In the examples, it is as -
sumed that the United States permanently im -
poses a general import duty of 20% on import prices.
NiGEM
In NiGEM, the assumed US import duty is de -
picted as a mark-  up on for eign firms’ prices of 
exports to the United States.36 From the US 
viewpoint, customs duties would directly result 
in a rise in import and consumer prices. The resulting appreciation of the US dollar could 
only mitigate this effect. Higher inflation would 
depress private consumption, with negative consequences for domestic economic activity. 
The macroeconomic effects of a general import duty would thus be similar to those of a nega -
tive technology shock which inflates prices and 
constrains economic output. US exports, too, would drop in real terms due to the appreci -
ation of the US dollar and a lower level of de -
mand abroad. Nevertheless, there would be a 
marked improvement in the US current account 
balance, not least because real imports would 
fall at a sharper rate as they would have be -
come more expensive.Higher prices

34 In NiGEM, most of the OECD countries and major emer -

as forward-  looking elements on the financial and labour  
markets. For further information on the model structure,

36 As NiGEM, in the form provided by NIESR, is unable to 
capture bilateral trade flows, extensive modifications are 
necessary. The focus on the prices of exports to the USA 
follows Ebell and Warren (2016) and Ebell et al (2016). 
However, they consider endogenous shocks, and the per -
sistence of the resulting effects is ultimately pre-  s pecified. 
By contrast, the approach adopted here makes it possible 
to study the endogenous adjustment mechanisms in re -
sponse to permanent exogenous shocks. Overall, the price 
systems of 18 US trading partners and three regions have 
been adjusted, which together account for around 90% of 
US foreign trade. See M Ebell and J Warren (2016), The

The magnitude of the United States’ bilateral trade balances
The political debate surrounding the United 
States’ persistent current account defi  cits 
has repeatedly centred on the large trade 
defi  cits it runs with individual partner coun-
tries. According to one line of argument, 
these bilateral balances could be seen as an 
indication of unfair trade practices. In the 
past, such accusations were levelled mainly at emerging market economies in Asia, but 
recently a number of other countries have 
also come under attack. Criticism has 
centred on China, as well as Mexico, Japan 
and Germany. In arithmetic terms, these four economies have accounted in recent years for around three- quarters of the United States’ overall trade defi  cit of just 
over 4% of gross domestic product.
Germany’s bilateral current account surplus 
with the United States amounted to €56 
billion in 2016 according to the Bundes-
bank’s balance of payments statistics. In the 
US balance of payments defi  cits with Ger-
many are reported as being slightly higher.1 
Such discrepancies, where two countries re-cord the data relating to their bilateral rela-tions somewhat differently, are termed stat-istical asymmetries and may be caused, for 
instance, by different data collection 
methods or data availability. Many of these diffi   culties result from the existence of third countries which may infl  uence the bilateral 
current account directly (as a trading part-
ner) or indirectly (as a transit country).2
However, bilateral current account balances 
are of limited meaningfulness not only be-
cause they disregard relations with third 
countries. Even where all countries’ current 
accounts are balanced, there may be con-
siderable positive or negative balances be-
tween individual partners, say because of 
different specialisation patterns.3 Given that 
the US balance of trade as a whole is in def-icit, the United States can, moreover, be ex-
pected to run a large defi  cit in absolute terms with any partner with which it con-
ducts a large volume of bilateral trade. Indi-vidual countries’ large surpluses often shrink 
into perspective once they are compared with the respective trade values. Thus the 
US trade defi  cit amounted to nearly 20% of 
the country’s total value of trade in the 
years 2014 to 2016. The trade defi  cit with 
1 In 2015, the difference totalled €4.6 billion, while it 
was €8.5 billion in 2016.
2 For example, the United States’ large trade surplus 
with the Netherlands could be seen as an indication 
that US products reach buyers in Germany via Dutch 
sea ports.
3 Divergent industrial specialisation patterns are re-
fl  ected in mismatches in the trading partners’ respect-
ive export profi  les and infl  uence bilateral trade bal-ances, in part via third- country effects. For instance, Germany is heavily reliant on commodity imports, 
while the United States is rich in natural resources. This means that Germany tends to have trade defi  cits with countries such as Russia. Even if, hypothetically speak-
ing, Germany’s overall trade account were perfectly 
balanced, these bilateral defi  cits would have to be off-
set by trade surpluses with other countries, such as the  United States. For this line of reasoning, see

Mexico, by contrast, was only roughly one- 
seventh of the bilateral value of trade. While the defi  cit with Germany was twice as high as the US average percentage, deviations of 
a similar magnitude are also observed for 
Japan and Italy. According to this criterion, 
the defi  cits with Vietnam, Ireland and China, amongst others, were even more 
striking.
But in addition to refl  ecting the value of 
trade and the US economy’s overall defi  cit, 
bilateral balances may also be affected by the respective partner country’s foreign 
trade profi  le. Thus large defi  cits are likely to 
accrue especially in trade relations with economies that are net exporters on the global markets. That includes China, Ger-many, Italy and Ireland. And indeed, the 
German balance in the transatlantic trade in goods is only slightly larger than one would expect given the opposite signs and relative magnitudes of the national trade balances.
4 At the macroeconomic level, the gap be-
tween exports and imports, as part of the 
current account, refl  ects national saving and investment decisions, which, in an 
open economy, can barely be infl  uenced by 
trade policy instruments. In any case, the 
United States’ trade balances with individ-
ual countries cannot be construed as direct 
evidence of supposed trade- distorting pol-
icy measures in the partner countries. This is 
also true of US- German trade links, al-though the euro’s current external value 
does give German exporters comparatively 
favourable price competitiveness.
All in all, bilateral balances in the cross- 
border exchange of goods are therefore not a reliable indicator of unfair trade practices. 
Hence caution is warranted when deriving 
consequences for economic policy such as 
the possible imposition of tariffs. There are, 
moreover, grounds for doubting the prop-
osition that the US foreign trade position could be improved noticeably by introdu-cing import barriers.
5 In actual fact, such 
steps are likely to weaken not only the part-ner countries but also the US economy itself 
and increase the risk of spiralling inter-
national trade disputes.
4 Notwithstanding some fairly large forecast errors, 
the national trade balances have, overall, considerable 
explanatory power for the sign and the level of the 
United States’ bilateral positions vis- à- vis major trading 
partners in recent years. For an earlier, more critical 
assessment of the approach, see D R  Davis and 
D E Weinstein (2002), The mystery of the excess trade 
(balances), American Economic Review, Vol  92, 
pp 170-174.

economics and in the New Keynesian model world, 
the introduction of tariffs may even result in a deterior-
ation of the balance of trade in the short term. See

In other countries this would not just adversely 
affect their exports. The relative depreciation of their currencies would also diminish purchasing 
power, causing private consumption and GDP 
to contract. In this model framework, imposing 
a duty on imports to the United States would 
therefore trigger symmetric effects both there 
and in its trading partners. And the closer an economy’s trade links with the United States, 
the greater these effects would tend to be in 
that partner country. Hence the GDP losses in-
curred in Canada and Mexico would be espe -
cially high. The repercussions for the euro area 
would be less severe.
The scale and persistence of the macroeco -
nomic effects would largely hinge on the price-  
setting behaviour of exporters in the individual trading partner countries. Inasmuch as export -
ers responded to the imposition of a duty by 
gradually lowering their net prices, the price 
shock would gradually wane.37 The adverse 
GDP effects in the United States would then be 
comparatively small from the outset, become 
less significant over time and ultimately reverse. 
However, if foreign firms adjusted the (dollar) 
prices of their exports to the USA only margin -
ally, the macroeconomic damage for the United 
States would be quite significant and persist-
ent. Real US  GDP would r emain 3% below the 
baseline in the third year of the model calcula -
tion, with private consumption falling over 4% 
short. At the same time, aggregate output in 
the rest of the world would be pushed down 
by almost 1%. Ultimately, the improvement in 
the US external trade position would likewise 
be less pronounced.
However, a new import duty would not only 
have a direct impact on prices and an indirect 
impact on output, it would also lead to a sig -
nificant increase in revenue for the US Treasury, 
which could be used to finance additional ex-
penditure. It is thus likely that increased gov -
ernment demand would mitigate the fall in 
output in the United States in the short to me -
dium term. That said, the contractionary forces at play on the supply side would later predom -inate. In this scenario, the US current account 
balance would actually deteriorate. If the USA’s 
trading partners resorted to retaliation, eg by 
likewise imposing a 20% tariff on imports from 
the United States, the GDP loss for the US economy would be considerably greater. A 
major factor in this would be the sharper de -
cline in US exports, which would also be re -
flected in an initially even larger current ac -
count deficit. However, in this model frame -
work retaliation on the part of trading partners 
would not necessarily put them in a better pos -
ition.38
DSGE model
Under the New Keynesian DSGE model, too, real GDP in both the United States and else -
where would contract upon the introduction of 
an import tariff owing to similar mechanisms to 
those operating in NiGEM. On the one hand, 
the burden imposed on imports by the tariff 
would likely dampen US demand for foreign 
goods, generating a drag on output in Europe; 
on the other hand, the demand for US-  
produced goods would fall on this side of the 
Atlantic owing to depressed incomes and 
higher prices in the wake of an appreciating 
dollar. In the long term, the economic output 
of the United States as well as of the world as 
a whole would shrink by 1½%. In view of the 
greater importance of foreign trade for the 
German economy, its GDP losses would be 
larger in percentage terms than in the rest of 
the euro area.… and in other

37 In turn, exporters’ price-  setting behaviour would pr ob-
ably depend crucially on how far they factor the demand 
effects of the import duty into their costing ex ante and how fast they adjust their own prices when these differ 
from those of their competitors. This is ultimately an empir -
ical question. With respect to a possible border tax adjust -
ment within corporation tax, Buiter (2017) likewise high -
lights the role of exporters’ price-  setting behaviour r egard -
ing tax inclusion (and currency choice). See W  H  Buiter 
(2017), Exchange rate implications of border tax adjust -

cussion Paper, No DP11885.38 This would at least be the case assuming that exporters 
barely adjust their net prices and disregarding fiscal aspects of retaliation.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report 
July 2017

If the revenues from the import duty were 
transferred in lump sums to US households, the 
latter’s scope for spending would barely be 
constrained. Moreover, the direct price shock 
would also be followed by a gradual reduction 
in the sales prices of foreign goods, and not 
just because of the appreciation of the US dol -
lar against the euro. Under this model frame -
work, European exporters would also lower their net prices in euro terms with a view to maximising their profits. Consequently, US households could benefit from an improve -
ment in the US economy’s terms of trade.39 In 
the rest of the world, the shift in relative prices would reduce real consumption options. In the long term, private consumption in Germany 
might contract by more than 3% according to 
the model simulations, and in other euro-area 
economies it could decrease by around 2%, 
while in the United States it would expand by 
just over 1%.
If the revenues from the US import duty were 
used to lower wage tax, the domestic labour 
supply would increase, and the GDP losses 
would be smaller. In the long term economic 
output in the United States would then not be 
impaired at all and employment could grow somewhat. Households would increase their 
consumption even more.
However, this benign outcome for the United 
States would only endure for as long as its trad -
ing partner countries refrained from taking re -
taliatory action. The introduction of an equal 
retaliatory tariff would significantly reduce the 
change in the terms of trade in favour of the 
United States, which would severely curtail the 
consumption effects in the USA compared with 
the scenario in which no retaliation occurs. 
Conversely, euro-area consumers would be 
placed in a better position. But the DSGE model 
simulation likewise indicates that, as a result of 
retaliatory action, global output losses (at al -
most 2%) would be higher in the long run.

39 The DSGE model thus confirms the finding of traditional 
foreign trade theory that a large country stands to benefit from imposing an import duty thanks to improved terms of trade. This was also shown earlier in a similar New Keynes -
ian model framework designed by Reitz and Slopek (2005).

tributional effects are ignored. Supply-  side link -
ages via global production chains are likewise 
not captured, and substitutional effects be -
tween products from different countries may 
be insufficiently taken into account. Longer-  
term interrelationships between an economy’s 
degree of openness and productivity dynamics 
are also left out of the equation. Moreover, the 
financial systems are modelled in only a rudi -
mentary fashion. However, protectionist meas -
ures could divert capital flows via their impact 
on exchange rates, triggering financial disloca -
tions, not least in emerging market economies, with potentially serious macroeconomic conse -
quences. All in all, there are some indications 
to suggest that the simulations presented here 
may understate the adverse effects of protec -
tionist measures.
Both models point to the possibility of consider -
able macroeconomic damage caused by the im -
position of import duties, including in the impos -
ing country.40 The aspired objective of reducing 
global imbalances is not achieved in realistic Ni -
GEM scenarios; the production of tradable 
goods in the United States is similarly dampened 
under the DGSE framework.41 Moreover, the 
DSGE analyses indicate that, although a clever 
combination of policy measures may boost do -
mestic wealth at the expense of other countries, 
retaliatory measures contain those countries’ 
losses and also harm the protectionist country. 
Similarly to the classic prisoner’s dilemma, opti -
misation strategies on both sides could therefore 
lead to a situation in which all parties levy tariffs 
and everybody is worse off in the end. Hence, 
even large economies cannot assume that they 
will gain an advantage by erecting trade barriers. 
Such a scenario would harbour particular dan -
gers for the German economy given its heavy 
reliance on foreign trade.
The illustrative and hypothetical focus on the 
United States in these simulations should not 
obscure the fact that protectionist tendencies 
also loom elsewhere in the world. In order to 
banish the dangers arising from escalating 
trade conflicts, it is necessary to defend and further develop the rules-  based multilater al 
trading system. This could also generate im-portant expansionary stimuli for the global economy.
42 The confidence-  building discus -
sions between representatives of the G20 
countries may be conducive to this objective. It 
was not least the common resolve of this group 
of nations that prevented a slide into protec -
tionism during the global financial and eco -
nomic crisis. In order to tackle problems that 
may emanate from structural change, suitable 
adjustments should be made, if necessary, to 
education and economic policies as well as to 
tax and transfer systems.43

with the findings of other studies. For instance, in a simu -
lation using the METRO model, the OECD (2016) finds that 
increasing trade costs in the United States, the European 
Union and China by 10 percentage points would markedly 
dampen GDP , first and foremost in these economies them -
selves. Using an experimental NiGEM version, Carreras and 
Ramina (2017) conclude that increasing the prices of Chi -
nese exports to the United States would negatively impact 
US private consumption and economic output. Anderson 
et al (2013) find that, using the GIMF model (the Inter -
national Monetary Fund’s DSGE model that incorporates 
several regions of the world), a permanent increase in US 
import duties by 10 percentage points leads to a 1% de -
cline in real GDP in the United States in the long run. In 
addition, deploying its GIMF model, the International Mon-
etary Fund (2016) confirms that partner countries would 
have an incentive to retaliate and that, ultimately, all parties 
would lose out. Felbermayr and Steininger (2016), using 
the ifo trade model, ascertain that a trade war arising from 
the imposition of import duties by the United States would primarily hurt the US economy itself. See OECD, The impact

Changes to the MFI interest rate statistics
The latest enhancements to the monetary financial institution (MFI) interest rate statistics have 
brought with them considerably more scope for data analysis in relation to monetary policy and 
financial stability. Renegotiated loans, for example, are now reported separately, meaning that 
the gross flow from bank loans issued to the real economy for the first time can now be esti -
mated. This change allows the financing conditions of households and non-  financial c orporations 
to be analysed in greater detail with respect to the categories included in the MFI interest rate 
statistics. In addition, the further breakdown of outstanding loan amounts by residual maturity 
and interest rate reset period provides for a more thorough examination of the transmission of 
monetary policy measures.
The quality assurance measures for the MFI interest rate statistics data were expanded and better 
harmonised across Europe, with changes made to the grossing-  up pr ocedure used in particular. 
In addition, a further criterion for regularly checking the sample quality was introduced.The MFI interest rate statistics data also serve as a basis for calculating the real interest rates on 
households’ bank deposits. Since 1967, nominal interest rates in this category have been below the inflation rate on a number of occasions, meaning real interest rates were negative. Negative real interest rates on the bank deposits of households in Germany are therefore not unusual.
The new MFI interest rate statistics data and calculations on real interest rates are now available 
in the time series databases.Deutsche Bundesbank

Content and purpose of the 
MFI interest rate statistics
The MFI interest rate statistics provide key data 
for the analysis of monetary developments and 
the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The latter depicts the transmission channels 
through which a monetary policy measure, typ -
ically a change in the official interest rate, im -
pacts economic variables such as output, em -
ployment and, finally, inflation. In theory, it is possible to identify a number of transmission 
channels in which bank interest rates frequently play a central role.
1 The MFI interest rate statis-
tics data are also applied in other fields relevant 
to central banking, such as financial stability analysis, banking supervision and studies on 
the integration of Europe’s financial markets.
The data collected comprise the interest rates 
applied by monetary financial institutions 
(banks) in Germany and the corresponding vol -
umes of new business and outstanding amounts for deposits and loans denominated 
in euro vis-  à-  vis non-  financial corpor ations and 
households2 in the euro-area member states. 
The aggregated interest rates are calculated as 
volume-  weighted aver ages across all new busi -
ness concluded during the reporting month or 
for all outstanding amounts at the end of the 
month. The German data are compiled based 
on a representative sample of financial institu -
tions with reporting obligations.
The euro-area national central banks collect the 
MFI interest rate statistics data for their re -
spective national banking sectors on a monthly 
basis following a common methodology. They 
also calculate the national aggregates and for -
ward these to the European Central Bank, 
where they are consolidated and the figures for 
the euro area as a whole are determined.
Since the collection of these data began in 2003, the regulation on the MFI interest rate 
statistics has been revised twice.3 For example, 
new reporting indicators were added in June 
2010. The sampling procedure was also refined and the group of reporting agents updated.4 
Four years later, further enhancements were 
introduced with regard to the data collected. In 
addition, the data quality assurance methods 
were expanded and data aggregation proced -
ures in the euro area better harmonised.5
Introduction of new data 
collection items to the MFI 
interest rate statistics
The new items introduced to the MFI interest 
rate statistics for reporting as from December 
2014 concerned both outstanding amounts 
and new business. In the case of outstanding 
amounts, loans were further broken down by 
residual maturity and next interest rate reset, 
while for new business, renegotiated loans 
were now to be reported separately.
Outstanding loan amounts 
by residual maturity and next interest rate reset
The new statistical breakdown of outstanding 
loan amounts by residual maturity and time to 
next interest rate reset is prepared in combin -
ation with the existing breakdown by agreed 
original maturity, with data on loans to both 
households and non-  financial corpor ations 
with an original maturity of over one year and over two years collected separately. These new 
items distinguish, first, between loans with a 
residual maturity of up to one year and up to 
two years and, second, between loans with a 
residual maturity of over one year and an inter -Source of infor-

est rate reset within the next 12 months and 
loans with a residual maturity of over two years 
and an interest rate reset within the next 24 
months. These new figures help to explain, for 
example, the extent to which monetary policy 
measures also have an effect on existing loans, 
where the interest rate is renegotiated upon 
expiry of the fixed interest period.
At the end of May 2017, the outstanding vol -
ume of loans to households in Germany was 
approximately twice as high as the outstanding 
volume of loans to non-  financial corporations. 
The vast majority of households’ outstanding 
loans have original maturities of over two 
years. Only in relatively few cases will the con -
tract end in the next two years or interest rates 
be adjusted in the next 24 months. A break -
down by purpose of the loan shows that out -
standing loans with an original maturity of up 
to two years are primarily consumer loans. The 
outstanding volumes of loans to households 
with an original maturity of over two years, by 
contrast, are mainly comprised of housing 
loans. While loans with an original maturity of over two years also make up the largest share 
of the total outstanding volume of loans to 
non- financial corpor ations, short-  term loans  
and loans with an interest rate reset within the 
next 24 months account for a significantly greater proportion of the total volume than 
they do for households.
These observations illustrate that loan parties in 
Germany tend to enter into contracts with a 
long period of fixed interest. As a result, there 
is some delay before interest rate changes are 
reflected in the average interest rates on out -
standing loans, with rate adjustments being 
visible sooner for loans to non-  financial corpor -
ations than for loans to households.
The respective interest rates on outstanding 
loan amounts have been drifting downwards. 
The latest figures show that interest rates on 
loans to non-  financial corpor ations with an ori -
ginal maturity and residual maturity of over 
two years and an interest rate reset within the 
next 24 months are, at just under 2%, signifi -
cantly lower than those for loans to non-  
financial corporations with an original maturity 
of over two years as a whole (2.3%). The inter -
est rate on loans with an original maturity of 
over two years and a residual maturity of up to two years is even higher, at around 2.4%.

within the next 24 months have remained vir -
tually unchanged at around 3.5% since Decem -
ber 2014, the rates on loans with a residual 
maturity of over two years have continually fallen as a whole, now standing at approxi -
mately 3.2%. Interest rates on loans with an original maturity of over two years and a re -sidual maturity of up to two years, on the other hand, are significantly higher and were roughly 
4.1% at last count. One reason for this is that 
this category comprises considerably more con -
sumer loans, which typically have shorter ma -
turities and higher interest rates than, for ex -
ample, long-  term housing loans.
New lending: differentiating 
between new and renegoti-ated loans
Besides the described changes to outstanding 
amounts, additional classifications have also 
been introduced for new business. In the MFI 
interest rate statistics, new business includes, 
by definition, all new and all renegotiated agreements between the reporting institution 
and households or non-  fi nancial corporations 
during the period under review.6 Since Decem -
ber 2014, interest rates and volumes of renego -
tiated loans are reported separately in every 
lending category. It is easier for reporting 
agents to collect data on renegotiated loans 
than to provide the corresponding information 
on new loans, which is now calculated and 
published by central banks.
The volume of new loans (vE) is calculated as 
the difference between the total credit volume 
(vG) and the volume of renegotiated loans  
(vNV):
vE=vG–vNV
The associated volume-  weighted aver age inter -
est rate on new loans (zE) can be calculated 
using the average interest rate for all new busi-
ness (zG) and the average interest rate on re-
negotiated loans (zNV):

The data on new loans can be used to measure 
the gross flow of new loans to the real econ -
omy. While growth in new lending that is in 
line with overall economic factors contributes to healthy economic expansion, significantly higher lending growth may be linked to the 
emergence of speculative asset bubbles.7
New loans make up the largest part in all items relating to new business volume, roughly 80% 
for loans to households for consumption and 
house purchase and around 65% for loans to 
non- financial corpor ations and other loans to 
households.8
The interest rate level for consumer credit is 
significantly higher than the interest rate level 
for other categories. At the same time, renego -
tiated loans for consumption are concluded on average at notably higher rates than new loan 
contracts. This is largely due to banks whose 
business model specialises in higher-  yielding in -
stalment loans. Because these institutions ac -
count for the majority of renegotiated loans in 
total new business, the interest rates for re -
negotiated loans are on the whole higher than for new loans.
Interest rates for renegotiated loans for house 
purchase are also slightly above the interest 
rates for new loans. This observation is system-atic and has occurred almost every month since the new reporting categories were introduced. 
Amongst other things, this is because the in -
tensity of competition when issuing new loans for house purchase is higher than for renegoti -
ated loans, and banks try to increase their mar -
ket share by offering attractive terms.
In the case of other loans to households and 
loans to non-  financial corpor ations, aggregate 
interest rates for new and renegotiated con -
tracts are largely at a similar level and display comparable trends. There is no indication of 
systematic divergences.

In addition to expanding the reporting items in 
the MFI interest rate statistics, the new rules 
further harmonise Europe-  wide data pr epar-

terion of regularly checking the sample quality 
introduced.
The MFI interest rate statistics are collected in 
Germany as a representative stratified sample that avoids the high costs of a complete sur -
vey.9 For this purpose, the reporting population 
of potential reporting institutions is divided into strata, with banks with similar business models 
being allocated to the same stratum.
10 In Ger -
many, the largest institutions within each stra -
tum were chosen so that, with approximately 
13% of credit institutions obliged to report, 
there is coverage of roughly 70% of the rele -
vant business and it was possible to achieve a 
significant reduction in the reporting burden of 
smaller banks. The data collected are grossed 
up in order to reflect the reporting population of all financial institutions.
This procedure, which has been the standard 
and recognised practice for some time now, is 
explicitly named in Guideline ECB/  2 014/  1 5. The 
guideline also includes a new formula for cal -
culating the expansion factors when applying this method.
11 There are now also detailed 
rules at the European level on the use of 
grossed-  up  volumes to calculate the national 
volume-  weighted average rates.
The synthetic mean absolute error was also introduced to check the sample quality regu -
larly. This indicator must not exceed a set 
threshold. Otherwise, measures to improve the sample quality must be taken, eg by expanding 
the number of reporting institutions.12 The 
sample quality of the German MFI interest rate statistics can be regarded as good based on the synthetic mean absolute error, too. There is no need for adjustment.Data pool for calculating the 
real rate of interest on the 
bank deposits of German 
households
In addition to the areas of use described above, 
the MFI interest rate statistics data are also 
used to calculate the real interest rate on households’ deposits in Germany. The real 
interest rate describes the rate of interest on a financial investment adjusted for developments in purchasing power. It is broadly calculated (in 
the case of low interest rates and relatively stable prices) as the difference between the 
nominal interest rate and the inflation rate. The Bundesbank’s calculation is based on the exact formulation of the Fisher equation (see the box on pages 101 to 103).
The required (nominal) interest rates on bank deposits are derived from reports for the MFI interest rate statistics. For outstanding house -

New grossing-up procedure for the MFI interest rate statistics
The new grossing-up procedure applies a 
two-step process to every reporting item. In 
a fi  rst step, grossing-up takes place at stra-tum level, with aggregate interest rates and 
volumes calculated in a second step. For 
each item, the interest rate for each stratum 
is calculated as the average interest rate weighted by the volume reported in the 
MFI interest rate statistics:
Ij=PI
i=1MV ij⇤IijPI
i=1MV ij
where
i index for banks in the actual report-
ing population,
j index for the strata,
Ij volume-weighted interest rate of 
stratum j,
MVij reported volume of bank i in stratum 
j,
Iij reported interest rate of bank i  in 
stratum j.
The stratum volume is grossed up based on 
the volumes recorded in the balance sheet 
statistics1  using the ratio of the volume re-
ported for all banks in a stratum to the vol-
ume reported for the banks in the actual 
reporting population in that stratum:
HFj=ˆBjPNj
i=1ˆBij
whereHF
j expansion factor of stratum j,
Bˆj total volume for all institutions 
within stratum j  as estimated from 
the balance sheet statistics,2
Bˆij volume within each stratum j  for 
sampled bank i  as estimated from 
the balance sheet statistics,2
Nj number of banks sampled in stratum j .The expansion factor thus indicates, for 
each stratum, the factor by which the total 
stratum volume as reported in the balance 
sheet statistics exceeds the volume that the 
actual reporting population of the MFI inter-est rate statistics reports in the balance sheet 
statistics. The volume reported in the MFI 
interest rate statistics must be increased by 
this factor. To this end, the reported volume 
for each stratum (MVj) is multiplied by a 
stratum-specifi  c factor in order to determine the grossed-up volume per stratum  (HV
j):
HVj = HFj * MVj
In the second step, aggregate interest rates and aggregate volumes are calculated. The aggregate volume of a reporting item (HV) is calculated as:
HV=JX
j=1HV j
Finally, the aggregate interest rate of an item (I) is calculated as the volume- 
weighted interest rate using the volume- 
weighted interest rate per stratum and the 
grossed-up stratum volume:
I=PJ
j=1HV j⇤Ij

1 The monthly balance sheet statistics give a compre-
hensive overview of the business of German banks 
(MFIs). The latter report their balance sheet data on a 
monthly basis, with annexes containing a more in- 
depth breakdown by sector and original maturity. The 
monthly balance sheet statistics are a key source of 
data for the consolidated balance sheet of the sector 
of monetary fi  nancial institutions in Germany and thus 
for the German contribution to the monetary aggre-
gates of the euro area.

and the balance sheet statistics do not match up 
exactly. For the grossing-up, the items from the bal-
ance sheet statistics that best fi  t the MFI interest rate

are used.14 The deposit categories in the MFI 
interest rate statistics are compared with those 
categories of the Bundesbank interest rate stat -
istics with the greatest similarities in terms of 
data collection method.
To measure developments in purchasing power, 
the Consumer Price Index (CPI) which is calcu -
lated monthly by the Federal Statistical Office is 
used. A distinction should be drawn between 
the CPI and the Harmonised Index of Con -
sumer Prices (HICP), which is calculated for 
each member state of the European Union on 
the basis of common standards. Both indica -
tors measure inflation for goods and services 
using the changing cost of a basket of goods. However, because the HICP was designed spe -
cifically to allow pan-  Eur opean comparisons 
and for the data to be aggregated into a Euro -
pean index, the CPI and the HICP differ from 
each other in certain fundamental aspects, 
such as the inclusion of equivalent rents for 
owner-  o ccupied housing in the basket of 
goods (included in the CPI, but not in the HICP). 
When it comes to the real deposit rates for 
households in Germany, savers are more con -
cerned with comparing the purchasing power 
of the interest they earn on bank deposits over time than with comparing real deposit rates 
across the European Union. The CPI was there-fore used to calculate the underlying real inter -
est rates.

14 The Bundesbank’s old interest rate statistics measured 
the interest rates most frequently agreed upon for new 
business with domestic non-  banks as wel l as extensions 
and changes to earlier interest rate agreements in a two-  
week (mid-  month) r eporting period. The average rates 
were calculated as the unweighted arithmetic mean of the 
reported interest rates within the spread. The spread was 
ascertained by eliminating the highest 5% and the lowest 
5% of interest rates.

Developments in real interest rates on deposits in Germany
Households in Germany traditionally hold a 
signifi  cant proportion of their fi  nancial 
assets in the form of bank deposits. Be-
cause the nominal interest rate on these de-
posits has been historically low in recent years, it has increasingly become the sub-
ject of public debate.1 However, of greater 
relevance to savers than the nominal inter-
est rate it is the purchasing power associ-
ated with the interest credited, and thus the 
real interest rate rt on deposits. According 
to the simplifi  ed Fisher equation,2 the real 
interest rate is approximately equal to the difference between the nominal interest 1 See Deutsche Bundesbank, German households’ sav-
ing and investment behaviour in light of the low- 
interest- rate environment, Monthly Report, October 
2015, pp 13-31.2 The simplifi  ed Fisher equation is based on the follow-
ing relationship between the nominal interest rate it, 
the real interest rate rt and the expected infl  ation rate 
⇡e
t+1 : (1+it) = (1+rt) (1+⇡e
t+1). Expanding the right- 
hand side of the equation and disregarding the cross- 
product, which is very minor in the case of low infl  a-
tion and nominal interest rates, yields the equation 
overleaf as a condition for equilibrium. This relationship was formally derived for the fi  rst time in I Fisher (1896), Appreciation and interest, Publications of the American Economic Association, pp 23-29 and pp 88-92.

investment period  ⇡e
t+1:
rt⇡it−⇡e

Fisher’s theory emphasises that depositors ultimately think in terms of real units of goods; that is to say, they look through changes in the price level over the invest-ment period. To refl  ect the expectations 
component, the term “ex ante real rate of 
interest” is used in this context. The “ex post real rate of interest”, on the other 
hand, is obtained by replacing the expected 
infl  ation rate with the actual infl  ation rate 
achieved over the investment period. It re-
fl  ects the real interest income that is actu-
ally generated by a bank deposit, ie the in-
crease in purchasing power resulting from the interest payment. From a saver’s per-
spective, this is the relevant variable for an 
ex post comparison of real interest rates. A 
precise determination of the ex post real rate of interest would require information 
about the actual length of time the deposit 
was held at the bank, the nominal interest 
rate paid and the actual infl  ation rate over 
this period. However, because no suffi   -
ciently robust data are available for this, the 
ex post real interest rate can only be ap-
proximated. For reasons of consistency, we 
use the annual infl  ation rate recorded for the relevant reporting month for each de-
posit category of the interest rate statistics.3
If the real interest rate is negative, the nom-
inal interest credited does not compensate 
for the infl  ation- based loss of the deposit’s purchasing power, and it loses value in real 
terms. Negative real interest rates on the bank deposits of households in Germany 
are not uncommon. Over the past fi  ve dec-ades, savings deposits in particular, of which 
there is a signifi  cant volume, have experi-
enced roughly as many phases of negative 
real interest rates as phases of positive real interest rates. In the fi  rst half of this period, 
negative real interest rates dominated, not 
least owing to the signifi  cantly higher infl  a-tion rates in this period.Looking at sight deposits, which are house-
holds’ most liquid form of investment, the 
interest rate statistics include data on inter-
est rates only from November 1996 on-
wards. On top of this, only higher- yielding 
segments of sight deposits had to be re-
ported until 2003, making long- term com-
parative analyses impossible.4 Since records 
on total holdings of sight deposits began (with the introduction of the MFI interest rate statistics in 2003), nominal interest rates in this segment have mostly been 
below the infl  ation rate, meaning that real 
interest rates were almost consistently negative, with developments in nominal interest rates closely mirroring movements 
in key monetary policy rates. However, low 
nominal interest rates on sight deposits 
should also be seen in the context of bank 
customers’ greater preference for liquidity, 
which has been refl  ected in a sharp rise in 
sight deposits at German banks since 2008. 
With the general interest rate level ap-
proaching zero, the nominal interest rate on sight deposits and the infl  ation rate drifted 
further apart, meaning that real rates of interest on this form of investment were 
strongly negative although the infl  ation rate was low by historical standards.
Compared with sight deposits and savings 
deposits, time deposits play a much smaller role as a form of investment for households in the aggregate balance sheet of the Ger-man banking sector. Their longer maturities mean that yields on these deposits are trad-itionally higher than those on sight and sav-ings deposits provided the yield curve is not inverted. Since the start of the 1990s, nom-

movements and determinants, Monthly Report, July

spective, see Deutsche Bundesbank, Return on private fi  nancial assets taking into account infl  ation and taxes, Monthly Report, July 2017, pp 69-75.
4 For the purposes of the Bundesbank’s interest rate 
statistics, interest rates on the sight deposits of em-
ployees had to be taken into account only if they were higher than the reporting institution’s standard condi-
tions. The statistics included accounts both with and 
without a payment function.Deutsche Bundesbank

inal interest rates for time deposits in new 
business have recorded a downward trend 
that cannot be explained by a reduction in 
the average investment horizon. All the 
same, interest rates have not generally 
fallen below the infl  ation rate. Although the real interest rate therefore fl  uctuated in line with the infl  ation rate, it remained, by and large, in positive territory until the fi  nancial 
crisis. The onset of the fi  nancial crisis changed the situation, however. The gen-eral interest rate level fell sharply, which also translated into a clear downturn in 
interest rates on new time deposits. These 
sank to historic lows and are currently 
negative.
The longer the low- interest- rate environ-ment persisted, the narrower the gap be-
came between the interest rates on longer- 
term deposits (time and savings deposits) 
and the interest rates on overnight deposits. 
This is due, amongst other things, to the 
fact that most German banks are trying to avoid introducing negative nominal interest 
rates on households’ bank deposits (the zero lower bound). On balance, all the nominal interest rates analysed here have fl  uctuated within a narrow corridor of be-tween 0% and 1% for more than 12 
months. At a nominal interest rate of 0%, 
however, a positive infl  ation rate leads to a 
negative real interest rate of identical size. 
This is why the fact that the infl  ation rate has edged back up towards the 2% mark 
over the last 12 months has been a key fac-tor driving the real interest rate in this defi  n-
ition into negative territory for all types of 
deposits. The overall picture of negative real 
interest rates for all the types of deposits under analysis remains essentially un-
changed even if the expected ex ante infl  a-tion rate according to the Consensus Fore-cast or the Survey of Professional Forecast-ers is used instead of the actual ex post in-fl  ation rate.Deutsche Bundesbank
