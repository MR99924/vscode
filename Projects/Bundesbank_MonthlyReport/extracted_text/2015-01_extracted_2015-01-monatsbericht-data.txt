Commentaries
Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The German economy appears to be overcom -
ing the cyclical lull, which had begun in spring 
last year, more quickly than widely expected. 
One major reason for this is the decidedly posi -
tive consumer climate, which is based on a fa -
vourable employment and income outlook and 
supported by falling energy prices. Sentiment 
in the corporate sector continued to improve in 
December. This is in line with an increase in in -
dustrial output in October and November and 
companies reporting a marked rise in new 
orders.
The decline in crude oil prices continued at the 
beginning of 2015. As this report went to press, 
they had dropped by more than 50% within 
the space of a year to US$49. Calculated in do -
mestic currency, the decrease was slightly 
smaller at around 46¾% due to the depreci -
ation of the euro during that period. Such a 
dramatic fall in oil prices brings considerable 
relief for energy budgets. This usually has a 
positive effect on the economic decisions of 
households and enterprises. As most of the de -
cline in crude oil prices has not yet been in -
corporated into the December forecast, there 
are distinct upside risks for its projections of 
economic growth in 2015 and 2016. By con -
trast, the inflation forecast is to be revised 
sharply downwards for 2015. If crude oil prices 
remain at the current level, consumer prices in 
Germany will probably rise only marginally this 
year, and the year- on- year rates might even be 
negative for a time.
Following weak growth of only 0.1% (0.2% 
after calendar adjustment) in 2013, real GDP in -
creased by 1.5% (after calendar adjustment at 
the same rate) in 2014 according to the provi -
sional calculations of the Federal Statistical Of -
fice. The stronger GDP growth came as exter -nal demand was sparked by the economic re -
covery in the euro area and in other major in -
dustrial and emerging market economies. This 
brought about a greater willingness to invest in 
tangible fixed assets. In addition, private hous -
ing construction and private consumption pro -
vided stronger impetus. These average annual 
figures do, however, conceal the fact that the 
economy picked up pace in the course of 2013 
and slowed down markedly during 2014, as 
 reflected in important GDP components.
Industry
Industrial output in November exceeded the 
October level, which had been revised upwards 
slightly, by ¼% in seasonally adjusted terms. 
The average for October and November 
climbed on a similar scale compared with the 
third quarter average. In sectoral terms, output 
picked up for capital and consumer goods 
(+½% in each case) and stagnated in the inter -
mediate goods sector.
Seasonally adjusted new German industrial 
orders in November were a substantial 2½% 
down on the previous month, but the October 
figures had been very high. Average orders for 
October and November recorded a distinct rise 
of 1% on the average for the third quarter. A 
key factor here was the extremely strong de -
mand for domestically produced motor vehicles 
(+7½%), from both Germany and abroad in 
equal measure. Demand for consumer goods 
also increased markedly (+1½%). By contrast, 
order volumes for capital goods excluding 
motor vehicles were much lower (-6½%), with 
demand contracting most substantially in non- 
euro- area countries, followed by euro- area 
countries and Germany. Demand for German 
industrial intermediate goods (+1½% in total) 
picked up mainly in non-  euro- area countries, 
but there was also growth from the euro area. 
It remained subdued in Germany, however.Signs of an

In November, industrial sales recorded a month- 
on- month decrease of ½% in seasonally ad -
justed terms, but on average both October and 
November were up slightly on the previous 
quarter (+¾%). The increase resulted from 
higher sales in non- euro- area countries (+2¼%) 
and in the euro area (+1%), while domestic 
sales barely changed (-¼%). Goods exports 
mainly maintained the high level of the third 
quarter, although there was a distinct decline 
from October to November (by a nominal and 
real -2%). Imports of goods rose markedly by 
1½% in nominal terms and by as much as 2¼% 
in real terms on the month, but on average Oc -
tober and November were only marginally up 
on the previous quarter.
Construction
Construction output in November was ½% 
down on the month in seasonally adjusted 
terms. Taking the average of October and No -
vember, it remained virtually unchanged com -
pared with the third quarter (-¼%). It should be 
noted that incorporating the total annual sur -
vey results in the main construction sector en -
tailed substantial upward revisions for the 
second and third quarter, which were only par -
tially offset by the downward revisions in the 
finishing trades. On an average of October and 
November, main construction output increased 
by ¾% on the third quarter, while declining 
distinctly in the finishing trades (-1¾%) accord -
ing to initial estimates. New orders in the main 
construction sector decreased by a seasonally 
adjusted 1¾% in October – figures are avail -
able up to then – compared with the third 
quarter. This was primarily due to the weaker 
demand from the corporate and public sectors, 
which was not offset by the very steep rise in 
housing construction.

ated in November. After seasonal adjustment, 
employment rose by no more than a slight 
11,000 persons in a month- on- month compari -
son. The year- on- year increase was 411,000, or 
1.0%. According to estimates by the Federal 
Employment Agency, the number of employees 
subject to social security contributions in Octo -
ber was up on the year by as much as 524,000 
or 1.7%. The latest leading indicators for the 
labour market suggest that the prospects for a 
continuation of the upward tendency have im -
proved. According to the Ifo survey, enter -
prises’ willingness to recruit new staff increased 
again in December in seasonally adjusted 
terms. The Federal Employment Agency’s BA-  X 
job index likewise advanced.
In seasonally adjusted terms, the number of 
persons officially registered as unemployed de -
clined further in December, shrinking by a dis -
tinct 27,000 compared with the previous 
month. Underemployment (excluding short-  
time work), which includes persons taking part 
in labour market policy measures, likewise de -
clined further. The unemployment rate de -
creased by 0.3 percentage point on the year to 
6.5%. The labour market barometer of the In -
stitute for Employment Research (IAB) rose 
again in December and points to a slight con -
traction in unemployment for the next few 
months.
Prices
The decline in crude oil prices intensified at the 
end of 2014. In December, the average US$ 
price per barrel of Brent crude oil had fallen by 
just over one- fifth on the previous month. Tak -
ing the average of the first two weeks of Janu -
ary, prices fell by a further 20¼% to US$50¾ per 
barrel. The premium on crude oil futures most 
recently was US$5½ for deliveries six months 
ahead and US$10 for purchases 12 months 
ahead.
Seasonally adjusted import prices in November 
decreased distinctly on the month. This was chiefly driven by the marked decline in energy 
prices on the back of plummeting crude oil 
prices. By contrast, energy producer prices rose 
due to deviating domestic price tendencies for 
gas and electricity. As a result, industrial produ -
cer prices increased slightly overall. Prices for 
other goods declined slightly for both imports 
and at the producer level despite the euro 
showing depreciation tendencies. The negative 
year-  on- year figures increased considerably to 
2.1% overall in the case of import prices and 
decreased slightly to 0.9% in the case of indus -
trial producer prices.
The steep reduction in energy prices diminished 
seasonally adjusted consumer prices in Decem -
ber by a marked 0.5% on the month. Food 
prices also fell somewhat in seasonally adjusted 
terms, but prices of industrial goods and of ser -
vices rose slightly and housing rents continued 
their moderate upward trend. Annual inflation 
as measured by the national consumer price 
index (CPI) and the Harmonised Index of Con -
sumer prices (HICP) showed a substantial de -
cline to 0.2% and 0.1% respectively. On an 
average for 2014, CPI inflation was 0.9% and 
HICP inflation 0.8%.

€½ billion.2 However, this marked a slowdown 
in the deterioration observed in preceding 
quarters. Total revenue grew by 3½% (or just 
under €2 billion) and was driven, not least, by 
the sharp rise in current transfers received 
(funds approved by central government and, in 
particular, a 7% increase in general grants from 
state government). By contrast, tax revenue 
rose only moderately by 1½% (or just under 
€½ billion) due to the sharp hike in shares of 
income tax being offset by diminishing revenue 
from property and local business taxes. Tax rev -
enue developments varied considerably from 
state to state. While there was a slight dip in 
the strong growth in expenditure observed in 
the first half of the year, it still amounted to a 
rise of almost 4% (or €2 billion). Personnel ex -
penditure was boosted even further by the im -
plementation of the first stage of the pay 
agreement that was concluded in spring 2014 
and, potentially, by increased staff numbers in 
areas such as childcare (+5%, or just over €½ 
billion). The annual growth rates for operating expenditure (+4%, or €½ billion), social bene -
fits (+4½%, or €½ billion, with significant rises 
in benefits for social assistance as well as as -
sistance for young people and for asylum seek -
ers, in particular) and especially expenditure on 
fixed asset formation (+2%) were down on the 
quarter. Interest expenditure continued to fall 
(-10%).
Local government recorded a deficit of €2½ 
billion for the first three quarters of 2014, re -
flecting a year-on-year increase of €1½ billion. 
Even factoring in the usual final-quarter sur -
plus, the result for 2014 as a whole is likely to 
only be broadly balanced and thus fall short of 
the €1 billion surplus recorded in 2013. At its 
meeting in December, the Stability Council an -
nounced that it now expected local govern -
ment core budgets to record only small sur -
pluses of €½ billion each year until 2017, which 
would likely be eroded by slight deficits on the 
part of off-budget entities. On the one hand, 
local government will be granted €1 billion (€½ 
billion towards spending on accommodation 
for the long-term unemployed and €½ billion 
from a higher share of turnover tax) in relief per 
annum  from 2015 to 2017 as set out in the 
Federal Government’s coalition agreement. In 
addition to these measures, there are also plans 
in place to make additional central government 
grants available to expand childcare and cush -
ion the impact of increased refugee numbers. 
On the other hand, however, the Council’s 
forecast included a moderate downward revi -
sion of tax revenue and increased expenditure, 
not least for fixed asset formation. Budgets are 
expected to bounce back significantly from Somewhat

ures taking full account of the expanded reporting group 
for the previous year, only a limited year-on-year compari -
son of the fiscal deficit/surplus and individual expenditure 
and revenue items is possible. The ongoing revision of the

2018 onwards thanks to plans announced by 
central government to provide additional relief 
for integration assistance (€5 billion per an -
num).
Debt attributable to local government core 
budgets and off-budget entities (including spe -
cial-purpose associations) at the end of the 
third quarter of 2014 was only marginally up 
on the quarter and totalled €143½ billion, with 
credit market debt accounting for just over 
€88½ billion, cash advances for €50½ billion 
and debt to other government sectors for €4 
billion. While credit market debt fell, cash ad -
vances – which are, in principle, only intended 
for bridging short-term liquidity shortfalls – 
continued their upward trend with an increase 
of almost €1 billion. According to Federal Stat -
istical Office data, Saarland recorded the high -
est local government debt per capita  (almost 
€3,700), closely followed by Hesse, Rhineland-
Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia, where 
figures exceeded €3,000. By contrast, local 
government debt per capita  was only roughly 
€700 in Baden-Württemberg. Of the four most 
heavily indebted federal states mentioned 
above, only the local governments in Hesse 
scaled back their outstanding cash advances, 
albeit following an increase in the preceding 
quarter. Local governments in Saarland, Rhine -
land-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia, 
however, recorded further increases at a state-
wide level. Previous – and to some extent con -
siderable – efforts to ease their budget situ -
ation notwithstanding, many local govern -
ments in these states, in particular, are still 
faced with a considerable need for consolida -
tion. Despite this, other local governments in 
these four states have balanced their budgets 
already.
Securities markets
Bond market
In November 2014, the issue volume in the 
German bond market stood at €105.7 billion in gross terms (previous month: €124.8 billion). 
After deducting redemptions and taking ac -
count of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own bonds, the volume of outstanding domes -
tic bonds rose by €2.2 billion. In addition, for -
eign debt securities worth €18.0 billion net 
were sold in the German market. As a result, 
funds raised from sales of domestic and foreign 
debt securities in the German market amounted 
to €20.2 billion.
The public sector issued bonds totalling €7.0 
billion net in the reporting month. This was at -
tributable primarily to central government, 
which issued mainly two- year Federal Treasury 
notes (Schätze) worth €4.7 billion, five- year 
Federal notes (Bobls) worth €3.5 billion and 
ten- year Federal bonds (Bunds) worth €2.8 bil -
lion. This contrasted with net redemptions of 
Federal Treasury discount paper (Bubills) total -
ling €5.0 billion. The federal states redeemed 
debt securities worth €0.5 billion net.
In November, domestic enterprises cut their 
capital market debt by €0.3 billion in net terms. 
On balance, these were chiefly bonds with a 
maturity of more than one year. The redemp -
tions were solely attributable to other financial 
institutions (€2.0 billion), whereas non- financial 
corporations issued bonds to the tune of €1.8 
billion net.
The outstanding amount of debt securities is -
sued by domestic credit institutions also de -
creased in the reporting month, falling by €4.6 
billion. There were net redemptions mainly of 
public Pfandbriefe (€3.1 billion) and other bank 
debt securities (€2.5 billion) but also, albeit to a 
lesser extent, of debt securities issued by spe -
cialised credit institutions (€0.2 billion). By con -
trast, mortgage Pfandbriefe worth €1.3 billion 
net were issued.
Domestic and foreign investors purchased debt 
securities in equal amounts in November. For -
eign investors added domestic bonds worth 
€10.2 billion net to their portfolios. On bal -
ance, their interest was primarily focused on Renewed rise in

securities issued by the public sector. Domestic 
investors purchased debt securities worth 
€10.0 billion. On balance, both domestic non- 
banks (€2.2 billion) and resident credit institu -
tions (€8.4 billion), in particular, increased their 
holdings of bonds. Both investor groups pur -
chased solely foreign debt securities on bal -
ance.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed €0.2 billion worth of new shares in the 
German equity market. The volume of foreign 
shares in the German market rose by €0.4 bil -
lion in the same period. Equities were pur -
chased mainly by domestic credit institutions 
(€2.0 billion) and foreign investors (€1.9 bil -
lion). By contrast, domestic non- banks parted 
with equity instruments in the amount of €3.3 
billion.Mutual funds
In November, domestic mutual funds sold 
shares totalling €12.9 billion net in the German 
market (€7.2 billion in the previous month). On 
balance, fresh funds were injected solely into 
specialised funds reserved for institutional in -
vestors (€13.1 billion), while mutual funds open 
to the general public redeemed shares to the 
value of €0.3 billion. Of the asset classes, it was 
principally mixed funds (€3.5 billion), equity-  
based funds (€2.4 billion) and mixed securities- 
based funds (€2.3 billion) which recorded in -
flows. Foreign mutual funds sold shares worth 
€4.8 billion in the German market in the re -
porting month. On balance, domestic non-  
banks were the sole net purchasers, adding 
mutual fund shares worth €18.6 billion net to 
their portfolios. Resident credit institutions and 
non- resident investors sold mutual fund shares 
to the tune of €0.4 billion and €0.6 billion net 
respectively.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus of €18.6 billion in November 2014. The re -
sult was €3.9 billion below the level of the pre -
vious month. This was caused by the fall in the 
goods account surplus which was greater than 
the upturn in the invisible current transactions 
balance comprising services as well as primary 
and secondary income.
The decreased surplus in the goods account 
was due primarily to the smaller foreign trade 
surplus which, according to the provisional cal -
culations of the Federal Statistical Office, con -
tracted by €4.3 billion to €17.9 billion. In this 
context, exports fell more sharply than imports. 
In addition, net exports of goods under mer -
chanting halved to stand at €1.3 billion.
Invisible current transactions recorded a €0.6 
billion surplus in November, compared with a 
deficit of €1.1 billion in October. This turn -
around was due mainly to the fact that the ser -Muted net

vices deficit narrowed by €3.0 billion to €2.5 
billion, largely on account of the decline in 
travel expenditure which is typical for this time 
of year. By contrast, the deficit in secondary in -
come grew by €1.2 billion to €3.6 billion, a de -
velopment in which Germany’s increased pay -
ments to the EU budget played a key role. Net 
receipts in the primary income balance re -
mained broadly unchanged at €6.8 billion.
In November, the financial markets were dom -
inated by uncertainty about the outlook for the 
economy along with greater expectations of 
heightened monetary policy easing accompan -
ied by declining bond yields. Against this back -
ground, German cross- border portfolio invest -
ment generated net capital exports of €12.2 
billion. Domestic investors added foreign secur -
ities worth €23.8 billion to their portfolios, 
mainly focussing on debt securities issued by 
non- residents (€18.0 billion), with a particular 
emphasis on euro- denominated bonds (€13.7 
billion). At the same time, they showed less 
interest in bonds denominated in other curren -
cies (€3.0 billion). In addition to this, they pur -
chased mutual fund shares to the tune of €4.8 
billion parallel to which foreign investors 
stepped up their investment in Germany (€11.6 
billion). The focus of their investment activity 
was on bonds (€20.3 billion), roughly two-  
thirds of which were German government 
bonds. On the other hand, they disposed of 
German money market instruments (€10.1 bil -
lion) while acquiring small quantities of Ger -
man shares (€2.0 billion).
Direct investment likewise generated net cap -
ital exports in November (€6.2 billion). This was 
largely attributable to the activities of enter -
prises domiciled in Germany which expanded 
their investment abroad by €7.3 billion. This en -
tailed raising their equity stakes by €8.9 billion, 
of which €4.4 billion constituted reinvested 
earnings. By contrast, internal credit transac -
tions resulted in small- scale withdrawals of 
funds from foreign affiliates (€1.6 billion). The

The role of trade in goods in the  
development of global imbalances
Current account balances, which are an indicator of global imbalances, continue to run through 
analyses conducted by international organisations as a major theme. The focus is often on the 
determinants of macroeconomic saving and investment decisions, of which current account bal -
ances are the mirror image. Domestic and foreign demand developments specific to individual 
countries have recently been coming increasingly under the spotlight. In the past, however, not 
enough attention has been paid to the role played by the structure of external trade, even though 
international trade in goods is a key determinant in the movement and size of current account 
balances.
A closer look at trade in individual categories of goods initially reveals relatively stable surpluses 
and deficits relative to the respective trade value. Nonetheless, in the past few decades trade 
imbalances have increased owing, not least, to the advance of globalisation. In energy trade, 
moreover, price swings have played a major role. Although capital goods trade has recently 
assumed a relatively prominent position, the decline in current account balances in the past few 
years can be explained less by specific developments in individual categories of goods; rather, 
shifts between deficit countries and surplus countries have been the driving factor.
A breakdown of trade in goods by exports and imports clearly shows that current account deficits 
are typically accompanied by relative export weakness. Among the advanced economies, the lat -
ter could also be a response to the growing importance of the emerging market economies 
(EMEs), whose increasing integration into global trade may well have put added competitive 
pressure on some industrial countries. Other countries may have benefited on balance from the 
growth and shifting composition of global demand. The export structure of each individual coun -
try is likely to have determined which of the countervailing effects has dominated. Empirical find -
ings suggest that such product range effects have also impacted on the movement of national 
current account balances, though not as much as other factors. In this context, however, it must 
also be noted that relevant characteristics, such as the quality of the exported products, are dif -
ficult to measure.
Despite the persistence of current account balances, which is also likely to be attributable to very 
slow change in export structures, experience over the past few years clearly shows that national 
positions are quite capable of switching over a long period. This has been demonstrated, for 
instance, by recent developments in some euro- area countries which, as a result of extensive 
adjustment processes, have not only reduced excessive domestic absorption but have also 
improved price and non- price competitiveness alike.Deutsche Bundesbank

Development of global 
 imbalances
An economy’s current account balance reflects 
income flows with the rest of the world. Put 
simply, it is in deficit if a country’s aggregate 
domestic demand exceeds output. This means 
more goods and services are being procured 
from abroad than provided to the country’s 
partners. At the same time, the economy is a 
net importer of foreign capital, which is used to 
cover the nation’s funding needs. Net borrow -
ing is equivalent to the difference between ag -
gregate investment and saving. Accordingly, a 
current account surplus, in which output is 
greater than demand or saving is greater than 
investment, is associated with net capital ex -
ports. The potential causes of current account 
surpluses or deficits are manifold, as they ultim -
ately reflect myriad individual decisions at home 
and abroad. Macroeconomically, they may en -
tail entirely desirable deficits (eg in an economic 
catching- up process) or surpluses (eg if popula -
tion aging is looming). However, various forms 
of market failure and potentially distortionary 
government measures can also influence cur -
rent account positions.
Analyses of national current account balances 
often focus on intertemporal determinants of 
macroeconomic saving and investment deci -
sions.1 Empirical studies on this basis look at 
the following factors as potential determinants 
of the current account balance: the net exter -
nal position, indicators of income levels and 
their expected future growth, demographic 
metrics, metrics which measure the quality of 
social security systems and the state of devel -
opment of the financial markets, and indicators 
of institutional and political risks.2 However, for 
many countries this approach only goes part of 
the way towards explaining the actual extent 
of their current account position.3 An alterna -
tive, complementary perspective focuses more 
on the determinants of cross- border trade 
flows. In its October 2014 edition of the World 
Economic Outlook (WEO), the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) shows that diverging trends in real domestic and foreign demand, in 
particular, explain a large part of annual change 
in current account balances.4
Not only the determinants of current account 
balances but also aspects of their sustainability 
are significant. The question here of whether 
there exists such a thing as a critical level at 
which a current account balance may be classi -
fied as disproportionately large or even system -
ically risky is difficult to answer. The IMF moni -
tors and assesses the path of current account 
balances at the global level.5 It uses the con -
cept of “global imbalances”, which is calcu -
lated as total surpluses or deficits of all coun -
tries over global gross domestic product (GDP). 
A country’s contribution is thus given by the 
balance of its current account (in absolute 
terms) over global GDP . Therefore, the impact 
of an economy on global imbalances hinges 
decisively on its size. This is particularly true of 
the United States, which in 2013 accounted for 
just under one- quarter of nominal global GDP 
(aggregated using market exchange rates). The 
expansion of the US current account deficit

5 In its “Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure”, the Euro -

– including the current account balance – to make an early 
diagnosis of potential macroeconomic imbalances in the 
EU. It analyses the current account balance as a percentage 
of national GDP in greater detail if the three- year back -
ward- moving average deficit of a member state has fallen 
below -4% or the surplus has risen above +6%. See Macro -

5¾% immediately preceding the outbreak of 
the global financial crisis had a correspondingly 
strong impact.6 The associated sharp increase 
in global imbalances was regarded prior to the 
financial crisis as a considerable threat to the 
global economy; with high deficits, there is the 
danger that interrupting financial flows (also 
known as a “sudden stop”) could trigger an ab -
rupt correction.7 The risk scenario of violent 
turmoil in the international foreign exchange 
and capital markets discussed frequently by the 
IMF and in the literature at the time, triggered 
by a sudden shift in foreign investors’ prefer -
ences away from US assets, failed to material -
ise even at the peak of the global financial crisis 
following the demise of Lehman Brothers.8
In the past few years, the focus was placed not 
only on the major deficit countries but also on 
the significant surplus countries. One of the 
issues addressed was China’s high level of sav -
ings, which prior to the financial and economic 
crisis had played a major role in the expansion 
of global imbalances.9 Japan, too, occasionally 
stood under particular scrutiny.10 Since 2011, 
however, Japan’s surplus has fallen consider -
ably, not least owing to increased energy im -
ports following the shutdown of nearly all nu -
clear power plants. Among the major industrial 
countries, Germany’s current account surplus, 
at 6¾% in 2013, is at the top of the table (see 
box on pages 16 and 17).11 Germany and China 
each contributed ¼ percentage point to the 
surplus side of the global imbalances in 2013, 
whereas the Japanese contribution, owing to 
the events described above, was recently virtu -
ally nil.
A look at current account balances relative to 
global GDP over a relatively long period of time 
shows different phases of development. After a 
period of continuous increase, global imbal -
ances appear to have peaked in 2006-07. Since 
then, numerous countries have seen a percep -
tible reduction in their current account sur -
pluses and deficits in absolute terms, which 
means that, on the whole, the dispersion of 
national positions has likewise diminished.12 All of the countries in the euro- area periphery, in 
particular, have succeeded in eliminating their 
deficit positions completely or for the most 
part. Moreover, the major importance of the 
oil- exporting countries, whose surpluses grew 
perceptibly in the aftermath of the rise in global 
energy prices at the time, is apparent; however, 
between 2006 and 2013 the contribution by 
this group of countries to global current ac -
count surpluses fell by one- third. On the whole, 
the latest figures show global imbalances ac -
counting for only around 2% of global GDP , 
putting them back close to their level at the 
turn of the millennium.13

reached a turning point. In a special chapter of

13 The data refer to the sum total of the balances of all 
countries running a current account surplus. If, alterna -
tively, global imbalances are measured on the deficit side, 
the result is much smaller, most recently amounting to a 
deficit of 1½% of global GDP . The difference between 
these two figures, known as the “statistical discrepancy”, is 
largely an expression of measurement error and recording 
problems. It has been positive every year since 2004. By 
contrast, however, aggregated current account deficits 
regularly exceeded global surpluses in earlier periods.Deutsche Bundesbank

 The German economy’s current account and 
goods trade surplus
Germany ran a current account surplus of 
€189 billion in 2013, which equates to 6¾% of gross domestic product (GDP). In recent decades, Germany has predomin-
antly recorded positive current account bal-
ances, one exception being the period fol-
lowing the country’s reunifi  cation. Substan-
tial domestic demand and high capital re-
quirements at that time drove Germany into 
the red for several years. Only in 2002 did 
the country return to positive territory, the 
current account surplus then climbing sharply until 2007 and, after contracting 
briefl  y on account of the crisis, reaching its current level.
1
In regional terms, the growth in Germany’s 
current account surplus was fuelled chiefl  y 
by relationships with euro- area countries 
and to a lesser extent by trade with emer-
ging market economies. However, since the 
onset of the fi  nancial and sovereign debt 
crisis, the composition of Germany’s surplus position has drifted more towards emerging 
market economies and advanced econ-omies outside the euro area, whereas its 
positive balance vis- à- vis euro- area partner 
countries has steadily diminished as a result of the adjustment processes there.
2
As in many other surplus countries, the bal-ance of trade in goods is the key compon-
ent of Germany’s current account balance. 
However, the balance of primary income, 
which predominantly refl  ects investment in-
come from net external assets (accumu-
lated through current account surpluses), is 
becoming increasingly signifi  cant for Ger-
many. By contrast, the country’s current ac-count surplus is being diminished by cross- border services (on account of the negative 
travel balance) and the persistent defi  cit in 
the secondary income item, which com-
prises inter alia government expenditure on 
contributions to the EU budget.
By international standards, Germany’s manu-
facturing sector contributes a relatively high share of value added to GDP . While develop-
ments such as the fi  ercer competitive pres-
sure from abroad or the increasing tendency 
among fi  rms to shift their production facil-ities to other countries have eroded other advanced economies’ industrial base, sub-
stantially so in some cases, over the past two 
decades, the German manufacturing sec-
tor’s contribution to total economic output 
has remained more or less constant. At the 
end of the day, an economy’s specialisation 
in specifi  c sectors and products refl  ects its 
factor endowment and comparative advan-
tages, both of which are infl  uenced by fac-
tors including path- dependent investment 
decisions by the private sector, government 
framework conditions and the skill structure 
of the working population. Furthermore, Germany’s economic structure should be 
viewed in the context of domestic demand 
and the focus of domestic enterprises on ex-
ports. For example, German enterprises re-sponded to the weak domestic demand in 
the late 1990s by stepping up their efforts in 
the export markets. The output of capital goods and motor vehicles in particular has since signifi  cantly outstripped domestic de-
mand. Correspondingly, the structure of the 
German economy is also refl  ected in its ex-
port portfolio, which is clearly distinct from 
that of other industrial countries in that 
these two categories account for a relatively large proportion of total exports.
One of the likely reasons for the strong per-
formance of German exporters is that their range of products dovetailed with the fast- growing demand in emerging market econ-
omies in recent decades. Another is that 
German enterprises knew how to seize the 
emerging opportunities offered by global-
isation in the early 1990s with the fall of the

Iron Curtain and how to harness cost ad-
vantages by creating international produc-
tion networks.3 The outcome was that Ger-
man exporters succeeded in holding their 
own in the foreign sales markets, notably so in real terms, whilst other advanced 
economies were increasingly forced to sur-render shares of the global market to emer-ging market economies.
4
The German economy’s supply- side struc-ture in recent decades has, in principle, 
helped the country to run up external sur-
pluses. But the positive current account bal-
ance also needs to be viewed in terms of 
the saving and investment behaviour in the domestic sectors. One noteworthy factor in 
this respect – leaving aside the corporate 
sector’s reluctance to invest, insofar as this 
reticence was motivated in recent years by 
uncertainties surrounding the euro- area cri-
sis – is Germany’s comparatively unfavour-
able demographics. General government defi  cits were pre- emptively pared back to 
allow for demographic trends, while retire-
ment provision considerations during a period of very restrained income growth 
have caused households to adjust their con-
sumption and savings behaviour in recent 
years. Non- fi  nancial corporations seized the 
upside potential which the favourable de-velopment in international demand has opened up in order to consolidate their capital base.
5 Furthermore, the at times muted growth in domestic consumption, along with the prospect of the ageing 
population diminishing the labour force, is 
likely to have sharpened businesses’ focus on the external sales markets and damp-
ened their investment at home.
In all likelihood, Germany will continue to run a positive current account balance for 
the foreseeable future. Indeed, the ongoing decline in oil prices will even have the effect of driving the surplus higher still at the cur-rent juncture. Nevertheless, the surplus will 
probably shrink in size over the medium 
term as savings in Germany decline because 
an increasing proportion of the population 
reach stages of their life when they have a lower propensity to save. The surplus is also likely to diminish when the economic recov-
ery gains pace, as expected, in key euro- area partner countries, which can be ex-
pected to be accompanied by lower uncer-tainty as well as a normalisation of domes-tic investment.

Fund has identified a sustained decline, which 
it attributes largely to non- cyclical factors.14 
The article states that national current account 
positions are increasingly in line with the fun -
damentals, and that the significance of policy- 
induced imbalances has tended to diminish. 
Therefore, by that reasoning, global imbalances 
are less likely to be a source of systemic risk.
Contribution of trade in 
goods to global imbalances
Existing explanations cannot completely ac -
count for the trends and determinants of cur -
rent account balances and thus of global im -
balances. However, little attention has been 
paid thus far to the sectoral aspects of cross-  
border transactions. The sub- accounts of the 
current account, which distinguish between 
trade in goods, trade in services and inter -
national primary and secondary income, shed 
light on the structure of the transactions.15
By aggregating national balances at this level 
separately for the countries running current ac -
count surpluses and deficits, global imbalances 
can be decomposed into sub- accounts. This 
calculation shows that international diver -
gences are largely located in trade in goods; for 
instance, when global imbalances peaked in 2006, the total nominal balances in trade in 
goods of the deficit countries even exceeded 
those of current account balances.16 Move -
ments in trade in goods also seem to have 
been determinants of the ups and downs over 
time.17 Trade in services, by contrast, tends to 
have had the effect of narrowing imbalances. 
China’s rising deficits in trade in services are a 
particularly prominent factor (see box on pages 
20 to 22). This is mirrored by net service ex -

15 According to the sixth edition of the Balance of Pay -
ments and International Investment Position Manual 
(BPM6), the current account is broken down into the fol -
lowing sub- accounts: trade in goods, trade in services, and 
primary and secondary income. In the fifth edition (BPM5), 
the two lattermost sub- accounts (merged here to form 
one) were still listed as the balance of income and the bal -
ance of current transfers. See Deutsche Bundesbank,

ance of payments and the international investment pos -
ition, Monthly Report, June 2014, pp 57-68.
16 For the group of surplus countries, net goods exports 
virtually matched the aggregated current account position. 
The causes for the differences between the two groups of 
countries are not economic in nature but go back instead 
to the statistical discrepancy in the current account statis -
tics.
17 The interpretation of the contributions by each sub-  
account over time is impaired by a statistical break in 2010. 
From that year onwards, the analysis is based on data pro -
vided by national statistics offices or the IMF according to 
the BPM6 guidelines. Data for earlier years are based on 
the BPM5 structure, which is not identical. At least for 
2010, for which the IMF Balance of Payment Statistics pro -
vides data according to both sets of definitions, the impact 
of the chosen accounting standard on the structure of 
global imbalances presented above is negligible, however.Deutsche Bundesbank

ports of countries running a current account 
deficit – including the United States and United 
Kingdom. By contrast, the other transactions 
increased global imbalances slightly.18
For a better understanding of global imbal -
ances, it therefore makes sense to examine 
international trade in goods more closely. One 
particular question is whether individual cat -
egories of goods can be isolated as the main 
components of global current account gaps. 
The first step will be to analyse balances more 
closely at the level of individual categories of 
goods.19 They are an expression of the differ -
ences between output and demand in each re -
spective category of goods across countries 
which, according to the theory of international 
trade, are the result of comparative advan -
tages. These balances are then divided by 
global GDP to identify their potential impact on 
global current account balances. This is not the 
same, however, as the actual contribution by a 
category of goods to global imbalances, which 
is the sum total of the respective positions of 
countries with current account surpluses or 
deficits. Both approaches match only if all 
economies with positive or negative net ex -
ports in the respective goods categories also 
have an identical sign in their overall current 
account balance. This would be the case, for 
instance, with respect to the category of motor 
vehicles if all net importers of motor vehicles 
were running current account deficits and all 
net exporters were running surpluses. How -
ever, in actual fact, the sign of trade balances 
at the level of the individual category of goods 
will never always match the sign of a country’s 
current account balance. That is why the actual 
contribution of a category of goods to global 
imbalances is generally considerably smaller 
than the potential contribution.
At the level of individual categories of goods, 
the ratio between total (absolute) next exports 
and the respective total market value yields in -
formation about the unequal distribution of 
supply and demand. These ratios are found to 
vary strongly in the individual categories whose definitions follow the structure of the system of 
national accounts. 20 The degree of concentra -
tion thus defined is particularly high for energy, Closer analysis

18 In mathematical terms, the balances of primary and sec -
ondary income caused the deficits of the countries with 
negative current account balances to increase somewhat. 
For this relatively stable negative position, however, the 
countries with a positive current account balance do not 
have a correspondingly- sized surplus, on the aggregate; 
the primary and secondary income recorded here therefore 
have made, on the whole, only a minor contribution to the 
size and movement of global imbalances. The relatively 
large statistical discrepancy is attributable in part to the 
omission of the current account balances of international 
organisations, which run large surpluses particularly in the 
balance of secondary income.

goods in Broad Economic Categories (BEC), which in turn

ital goods. In addition, from now on trade in motor spirit, 
which does not fit into a unique category, will be recorded

oil as an independent category (energy). See United Na -

Driving forces b ehind the Chinese current account
China was instrumental in contributing to 
the accumulation of global imbalances prior 
to the worldwide fi  nancial and economic 
crisis. Its current account surplus, which 
stood at just US$17 billion in 2001, had bal-looned to US$421 billion by 2008, the year 
in which China accounted for almost one 
quarter of the world’s total current account 
surplus. Relative to the country’s gross do-
mestic product (GDP), China’s current ac-
count balance reached its zenith at 10% in 2007.
The sharp increase in this fi  gure was mainly 
driven by expanded surpluses stemming 
from international trade in goods. These in 
turn were largely caused by the substantial 
jump in nominal goods exports between 
2001 and 2008, which averaged an annual 
27¼% (in US dollar terms).1 This export 
growth had been given an important boost when China joined the World Trade Organi-
zation (WTO) in 2001 and in so doing signed up for the liberalisation measures 
this entailed. Moreover, up to the middle of 
the last decade, China’s price competitive-
ness improved distinctly according to a range of indicators.2 This improvement was 
also facilitated by the strict pegging of the 
renminbi to the US dollar up to 2005 before 
the Chinese central bank allowed the cur-rency to gradually appreciate. Overall, in the period up to 2008, China’s exports 
grew at a much faster pace than did its ex-
port markets.3 This is also refl  ected in the 
fact that between 2001 and 2008 China more than doubled its (nominal) share of 
global goods exports from 4¼% to 9%.
In 2009, the high surplus on the Chinese goods account experienced a marked fall. 
This adjustment arose mainly from the fact 
that Chinese exports of goods dropped 
sharply in the wake of the global economic 
slump while its import fi  gures remained 
more stable, not least owing to a very ex-
tensive government investment pro-
gramme. Since 2012, however, the surplus 
on the goods account has been following a 
marked upward trajectory again and, at 
around US$450 billion, it may well have re-corded a new all- time high in 2014. Yet Chi-
nese goods exports have expanded at a 
much slower pace over the past three years than before the crisis, namely by an average 
of “just” 7¼% per annum. This moderate 
1 During the same period, goods imports (in terms of 
value) grew at a less lively pace, averaging an annual 
rate of 24½%. The sharp increase in international com-
modity prices seen over the years in question also 
helped bring about the nominal growth in imports.

growth rate resulted not just from the 
dampened (increase in) demand in major 
export markets, specifi  cally in a number of 
advanced economies, but also from China’s greatly reduced ability to boost its share of 
the market, compared with the period be-
fore the crisis. The fact that much higher 
labour costs have eroded the price advan-
tages which Chinese products enjoy may 
have a played a role in this.4
The renewed upturn in China’s trade bal-
ance since 2012 was instead primarily 
driven by the fact that the country’s nom-
inal growth in goods imports decelerated 
even more substantially than its nominal growth in exports, by 4% per annum  on 
average.
5 This modest growth in imports 
contrasts somewhat with China’s robustly expanded GDP , which increased at an an-
nual rate of around 7½% in real terms over 
the same period. A breakdown of Chinese 
imports by Broad Economic Categories (BECs) reveals that import momentum has slackened most in the case of transport equipment and other capital goods. With 
respect to transport equipment, this would appear to be down to the fact that foreign 
car manufacturers – including German 
ones – are now making greater use of local production facilities to cater for the Chinese passenger car market.
6 The slowed growth 
in other capital goods is less easy to explain. 
It might be that investment in machinery 
and equipment is now growing at a percep-tibly fl  atter pace. However, gaps in the Chi-nese statistics ultimately make it impossible to confi  rm this suspicion.
7
The surplus on trade in goods may have widened substantially since 2012, but its 
impact on the current account balance has 
been modest at best, with the effect that 
this fi  gure has remained distinctly below its 
peak fi  gure from 2008.8 This was mainly 
caused by a burgeoning defi  cit on the ser-4 See Deutsche Bundesbank, The development of 
 labour costs in China and their impact on consumer 
prices in the industrial countries, Monthly Report, May 
2013, pp 13-15.
5 In real terms, the increase would appear to have 
been slightly higher, largely on account of the down-
ward drift in commodity prices. Taking the offi   cial price 
measure for imports (which uses unit values) as the 
basis for calculations, prices for imported goods have 
fallen by 2% per annum in US dollar terms.
6 See Deutsche Bundesbank, Reasons for the recent 
slump in German goods exports to China, Monthly 
 Report, November 2013, pp 47-49.7 The national accounts presented by China’s National Bureau of Statistics do not contain any fi  gures on the 
country’s investment in machinery and equipment, 
only aggregate data on nominal gross fi  xed capital for-mation.8 At roughly 2% in 2014, the surplus as a share of GDP 
likewise remained far removed from its past all- time 
high.Chinese exports and export markets*

of which trade in crude oil and refined petrol -
eum products is the most important compon -
ent, and in the motor vehicles segment. Com -
pared to the high level of trade, net exports in 
the cross- border exchange of intermediate 
products and in trade in consumer and capital 
goods are, in nominal terms, much smaller.21 
What is also striking is that the ratios move 
relatively smoothly in all categories over time. 
Since the turn of the millennium, the degree of 
concentration has been declining slightly for 
energy and increasing for capital goods. Only 
negligible shifts can be seen for the other cat -
egories of goods.
Not only the degree of concentration but also 
the value of trade is important for the above-  
explained potential contributions by individual 
categories of goods to global imbalances. Div -
iding the aggregated balances by global GDP 
shows clearly that the importance of the motor 
vehicle segment is comparatively minor, 
whereas the potentially most important imbal -ance over the past few years is to be found in 
trade in energy. It must be taken into account 
that, in this case, variables in nominal terms are 
being compared with one another. Therefore, 
the movements of relative prices are important, 
specifically as regards energy. The sharp fluctu -
ations of the potential contributions relative to 
global GDP are likely to be attributable, in par -
ticular, to swings in crude oil prices. Looking at 
the other categories of goods, it is notable 
that, in the years prior to the international 
 financial and economic crisis, increasing global -
isation was causing aggregated foreign trade 
balances to grow faster than global GDP . In the 
capital goods segment, the percentage rise 
was particularly pronounced. Even in 2009, 
there was only a relatively small correction, and 
a temporary one at that. At last report, the 
 aggregated category- specific trade balances Energy makes 
potentially greatest  contribution  
to imbalancesvices sub- account which is likely to have 
risen to around US$180 billion in 2014.9 By 
international standards, China has been the 
country with the highest services defi  cit 
since as far back as 2012. This defi  cit is driven by a marked increase in imported services which more than doubled to US$331 billion between 2009 and 2013. The lion’s share of this amount, ie two- 
fi  fths, is accounted for by services relating 
to travel. According to information pro-
vided by the United Nations World Tourism 
Organization (UNWTO), Chinese citizens are 
now the world’s biggest spenders on tour-
ist travel abroad. Their increasing interest in 
tourism is chiefl  y the result of a growing middle class and the removal of travel re-
strictions.
The upward trajectory of the Chinese cur-rent account surplus observed since 2012 
will probably continue along the same path in the course of the current year. The latest price movements in the commodity markets are also likely to play a key role here. Over 
the past few months, crude oil prices, but 
also the price demanded for iron ore (which 
is of major signifi  cance for China) have 
plummeted. According to our estimates, if 
these lower price levels persist, the amount 
China has to spend on imports could turn 
out to be around US$80 billion less than in 
2014.10 Even so, the defi  cit on the services 
account will doubtless rise once again in 
2015 because of the expected further in-
crease in foreign tourism.
9 When comparing recent fi  gures with 2008, account 
should also be taken of the fall in the primary and sec-
ondary income balance (summarised here) that has 
arisen in the intervening period. This dip refl  ects inter 
alia a larger defi  cit on income from direct investment.
10 This rests on the assumption that China will con-
tinue to import the same quantities of crude oil and 
iron ore as in 2014.
21 The varying degrees of homogeneity within each re -
spective category of goods represent one of the problems 
with this approach. For instance, capital goods are prob -
ably more heterogeneous than energy.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
January 2015  
22

appear to have stabilised back at their high 
levels of 2008.
Actually, all categories of goods made relatively 
similar contributions to aggregated current 
 account balances. For instance, in the period 
between 1998 and 2012 those countries which 
had positive current account balances nearly 
every year also, on the whole, were running 
surpluses in trade in motor vehicles, energy, 
capital and consumer goods and intermediate 
products. It must be emphasised that energy’s 
actual contribution to current account sur -
pluses is relatively small compared to its poten -
tial significance. One factor is that the group of 
countries with current account surpluses also 
includes many countries which are recording 
large deficits in this particular category of 
goods.22 Over time, the contributions by the in -
dividual categories of goods followed the same 
pattern that has emerged at the category level, 
especially during the phase in which the global 
imbalances were built up, which ended in 
2006-07. The rise in global imbalances was sus -
tained through all categories of goods, though 
the growing significance of energy trading is 
particularly striking. Since then, however, espe -
cially in the areas of intermediate goods and 
motor vehicles, the contributions to the level of 
global imbalances shrank more markedly than 
was to be expected on the basis of the poten -
tial contributions.23 On the other hand, it is 
notable that, in the past few years, the actual 
contribution by capital goods was rather high 
in relation to its potential impact. Surpluses in 
trade in capital goods are apparently a charac -
teristic feature of countries with significantly 
positive current account balances, while def -
icits in this category are typical of countries 
with negative current account balances.
Heterogeneous developments  
in imports and  exports
The increase in imbalances in the international 
trade in goods prior to the global recession 
may, in principle, have been a reflection of di -verging developments on the import and ex -
port sides. In actual fact, those countries which 
had a current account deficit when global im -
balances were at their height in 2006 were dis -
tinguished by comparatively muted growth in 
exports from the second half of the 1990s on -
wards. In the period from 1998 to 2006, this Composition

22 In the other categories of goods, too, totalling across 
deficit and surplus countries masks at times major differ -
ences within the respective groups. For instance, in 2006, 
the ten deficit countries which made the greatest contribu -
tion to the level of global imbalances include significant net 
exporters of consumer goods (Turkey, Italy, Poland), motor 
vehicles (Turkey, Poland), capital goods (United Kingdom, 
Italy) and intermediate goods (Australia). Only three coun -
tries (United States, Portugal and Greece) reported deficits 
in all categories.
23 The background to this observation is that in 2006, for 
example, China – a country with a positive current account 
balance – ran the highest deficit of all countries relative to 
global GDP in intermediate goods, and that this deficit has 
increased further since then. By contrast, over the same 
period the United States, among other countries, reduced 
both its current account deficit and the negative gap be -
tween exports and imports of intermediate goods. The up -
shot of these developments is that, although imbalances at 
category level remained virtually unchanged, the contribu -
tions to the level of current account imbalances fell consid -
erably.Deutsche Bundesbank

group of countries increased its exports in rela -
tion to global GDP only from just under 7¼% 
to 8¼%, while the surplus countries’ ratio of 
exports to global GDP went up by more than 
4½ percentage points to 14¾%.24 By contrast, 
growth in imports in relation to global GDP 
was developing in a quite similar way for both 
groups of countries up to 2006. Starting from 
1998, it grew by 2¾ percentage points in the 
group of deficit countries and by 3 percentage 
points in the group of surplus countries. From 
2007, however, the decline in imports was 
sharper and more sustained in those countries 
which had previously shown current account 
deficits.
The recent sharp fall in imports in the countries 
with a negative current account balance like -
wise becomes obvious if the analysis is con -
fined to advanced economies. Adjustment of 
the excessive absorption in the economies of 
the European periphery countries is likely to 
have played a part in this. Moreover, the fact that growth in the exports of the deficit coun -
tries is lagging behind that of the surplus coun -
tries is likewise apparent for this more homoge -
neous group of countries; when the global im -
balances were at their height, they comprised 
at least half of the ten countries with the larg -
est contributions on both the deficit and sur -
plus sides. Thus, it was not just the EMEs that 
were responsible for the differences.
The discrepancies in export performance raise 
the question of whether they are not merely a 
reflection but also possibly a cause of the ob -
served increase in imbalances. Against this 
backdrop, the surge in globalisation that oc -
curred almost simultaneously with the expan -
sion of current account balances is of signifi -
cance. This led to a shift of supply and demand 
on the international goods markets, resulting in 
the steadily increasing importance of oil ex -
porters and EMEs in worldwide trade relation -
ships. While this group of countries accounted 
for no more than 22¼% of global trade in 
1998, their share had gone up to 30½% by 
2006 and continued on an upward trend there -
after. The growing importance of these groups 
of countries manifested itself in different ways, 
however. While emerging markets benefited to 
a greater extent from the expansion of manu -
facturing, the accompanying global increase in 
demand for raw materials led, especially in the 
oil- exporting countries, to higher exports (and 
consequently to rising imports of finished prod -
ucts).25 The ongoing economic catching- up 
process of the emerging market economies has 
also been reflected in a markedly different 
structure of global growth. Worldwide real

24 This is due to the fact that the percentage annual in -

which consists of somewhat more open economies, was 
significantly higher than that in the reference group

gross fixed capital formation increased by no 
less than 4% per year in the period from 1998 
to 2006, compared with only 2½% in the eight 
years before. In comparison, growth in real pri -
vate consumption accelerated less strongly 
from just 2¾% to 3¼%.26 The increasing influ -
ence of the emerging market economies might 
also be one key reason for the change in rela -
tive growth between world trade and global 
economic activity over the past few years (see 
box on pages 27 to 29).
In 1998, the oil- exporting countries and emer -
ging market economies still had a slightly nega -
tive current account balance in relation to 
global GDP .27 The steady process of their inte -
gration into the world economy led to the 
build- up of a surplus position of 1¼% of global 
GDP in 2006.28 This was admittedly accompan -
ied by increasing deficits in the aggregate of 
the other economies. Within this group, how -
ever, individual countries were affected to 
widely differing degrees. This is particularly true 
with regard to the exports of advanced econ -
omies. Although stronger competition on the 
global markets from emerging markets shifted 
market shares to the detriment of the industrial 
countries, competitive pressure is unlikely to 
have increased to the same extent for all the 
advanced economies. The increase is likely to 
have been considerably more noticeable for 
economies with a comparatively large share of 
less technology- intensive consumer goods ex -
ports. By contrast, countries that were able to 
respond to the rise in global demand with a 
complementary pattern of export goods ap -
pear in some cases to have gained considerably 
from the emerging markets’ growth in import -
ance.29 Particularly economies which have spe -
cialised in the manufacture of high- quality cap -
ital goods or which have a large export share 
of highly tradable industrial goods appear to 
have been in a better position to service the 
rapidly growing demand.30 Heightened de -
mand from EMEs is also likely to have been of 
importance for the trade balances of the oil-  
exporting countries, not only because of the 
increase in the volume of demand, but also owing to the associated increase in the price of 
oil. To the extent that the oil- producing coun -
tries used rising export revenues to buy prod -
ucts from third countries, they also influenced 
their trade balances.31… with differing

The possible role of the 
 export structure
The described differences in the effects of glob -
alisation on the advanced economies’ exports 
are predicated, among other things, on differ -
ences in the pattern of exported goods. A cat -
egorisation of exports based on the BEC classi -
fication reveals hardly any deviations between 
the industrial countries under focus here, how -
ever. Although a strong dispersion of (normal -
ised) measures of comparative advantage can 
be observed at national level, no obvious differ -
ences between later surplus and deficit coun -
tries are to be discerned.32 At the height of the 
global imbalances in 2006, for example, coun -
tries with a comparative advantage in the pro -
duction of motor vehicles can be found in both 
groups. In the case of the surplus countries, 
this was mainly Germany and Japan, and, on 
the deficit side, Spain and Portugal. A similar 
picture is presented by capital goods, in which 
the deficit countries Poland and Greece show a 
comparative disadvantage, as do the surplus 
countries Singapore and Norway. Over time it 
nevertheless becomes apparent that – starting 
with quite similar shares of exports in 1998 – 
the group of deficit countries shows a markedly 
weaker growth in exports in nearly all categor -
ies.
The rather rough classification used hitherto 
possibly masks a greater heterogeneity within 
the individual categories, which may be one 
factor that is responsible for export growth de -
viating over time. At this point, therefore, use is 
made of trade data that provide a more de -
tailed breakdown in line with the Harmonized 
Commodity Description and Coding System 
(HS).33 With the help of these data, information- 
aggregating indices can be calculated; specific -
ally, the Export Similarity Index (ESI), which is a 
measure for determining how similar two 
countries’ exports are, and the Trade Comple -
mentarity Index (TCI), which captures the ex -
tent to which a given country’s exports com -
plement the import demand of its trading part -
ners.34 Below, the advanced economies are compared with the rest of the world consisting 
of the oil- exporting countries and EMEs.35 For 
example, Italy having a higher ESI value than 
Japan in 2006 implies that Italian exporters 
were put under greater pressure by rising ex -
ports from the latter group of countries than 
Japanese enterprises were. As the TCI index fig -
ure for Japan was, at the same time, higher 
than the figure for Italy, this signifies that, ac -
cording to this indicator, the pattern of Japan -
ese exports was better matched to the in -
creased import demand of the oil- exporting 
countries and EMEs.Rough classifica-
tion shows no obvious differ-ences in the  export structure
Calculation  
of detailed 
 indicators …32 The revealed comparative advantage (RCA) is the meas -
ure calculated. This places a country’s share of exports in 
one sector j in relation to this sector’s share of global ex -
ports. The normalised real comparative advantage (NRCA) 
limits the lower and upper bounds to [-1, +1]. An NRCA 
greater than 0 implies a revealed comparative advantage of 
the country in sector j, ie the share of exports j in the 
country’s total exports is larger than the corresponding 
global share.
33 HS data are available for international comparison up to 
the six- digit level (HS6), which allows a distinction to be 
made between more than 5,000 different product categor -
ies. For example, cars are broken down at this level accord -
ing to four cylinder capacity classes as well as type of en -
gine (petrol or diesel). The data were also taken from UN 
Comtrade.
34 The ESI and the TCI between two countries a and b are 
calculated applying the formulas:  
 
 
 
and 
 
 
 
with Xi(z)  and Mi(z)  in the relevant nominators, respect -
ively, standing for the exports and imports of country z in 
product category i. The figures in the denominator X(z)  
and M(z) , in turn, denote the total exports and imports, 
respectively, of country z. Accordingly, the quotient repre -
sents the respective shares of exports and imports of a 
product category i in a country’s total exports and imports. 
Both the ESI and the TCI lie in the interval [0,100] and 
higher index values in both cases indicate that a country 
has a greater export similarity and a more complementary 
export pattern compared with the country used as a refer -
ence. See J Finger and M Kreinin (1979), A measure of “Ex -
port Similarity” and its possible uses, The Economic Journal, 
89 (356), pp 905-912, as well as M Michaely (1996), Trade 
preferential agreements in Latin America: an ex- ante as -
sessment, World Bank, Policy Research Working Paper 
No 1583.
35 To do this, both the ESI and the TCI are calculated indi -
vidually for each of the advanced economies in comparison 
with each country in the reference group, and a weighted 
average is formed from this. The individual country weights 
are, in turn, given by the respective countries’ export shares 
(ESI) and import shares (TCI) respectively in the total ex -
ports and imports of the oil- exporting countries and EMEs.Deutsche Bundesbank

 The decline in the elasticity of global trade 
to global economic activity
Economists once assumed that, over an ex-
tended period, the volume of global trade 
grew approximately twice as fast as eco-
nomic activity.1 The elasticity of global trade 
to global real gross domestic product (GDP) 
was therefore taken to be around two.2 It 
should be noted, however, that this fi  gure 
was no more than a long- term observation, 
not a correlation derived from theory. Based 
on data published by the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) in its World Economic 
Outlook (WEO) dated October 2014, the volume of global imports (goods and ser-vices) expanded by an annual average of 6% between 1980 and 2007. Over the 
same period, global economic activity, ag-
gregated using exchange rates based on es-
timated purchasing power parities (PPPs), 
increased by 3½% per year, with the result 
that elasticity, measured by mean growth rates, came in at 1.7. Between 2008 and 2014, PPP- weighted real GDP grew by 
3¼%, which was just short of the average 
observed in the previous period. Global trade momentum, by contrast, decreased 
quite substantially, such that the annual in-
crease of 2¾% even turned out to be 
weaker than the rise in global economic ac-
tivity; elasticity measured using the mean 
growth rates almost halved to 0.9.
A large number of economists fi  nd this con-
spicuous slowdown in global trade growth 
relative to the pace of global economic ac-
tivity a cause for concern. The debate 
centres on whether the observed decrease in elasticity is of a cyclical, and hence tem-
porary, nature or whether its causes are 
structural. Various explanations for a per-manent shift have been posited, fi  rst and 
foremost a fl  attening of the pace at which 
international production chains are expand-ing, the growing importance of trade in ser-vices or increased protectionism.
3
However, it should be borne in mind that 
global GDP in PPP terms, which is the IMF’s 
preferred indicator of global economic ac-
tivity, is not the best benchmark for global 
trade because PPP exchange rates are not relevant on international markets, nor are 
they used to measure trade variables. Using offi   cial or market exchange rates to aggre-
gate national data, however, attaches a smaller weighting to emerging market 
economies which have grown rapidly over 
the past few years. Consequently, this

measure would suggest that growth in 
global output slowed more signifi  cantly, namely from an average of 3% between 
1980 and 2007 to 2% in recent years. As a 
result, the elasticity of global trade based on these rates has fallen from 2.0 to 1.4. 
Thus the decline turns out to be noticeably 
smaller than it is when purchasing power 
parities are factored into the equation, but is nonetheless signifi  cant.
4
To date, little attention has been paid to the considerable differences between the elasti-city of imports of the advanced economies on the one hand and the emerging market 
and developing economies on the other. 
WEO data can be used to derive an elasti-
city of 2.0 for the industrial countries from 
the mean growth rates from 1980 to 2007, 
but of no more than 1.4 for the emerging 
market economies. For the period since the 
global recession, these fi  gures are 1.7 and 
1.1 respectively. The -0.3 decrease in import 
elasticities in terms of groups of countries, 
then, is signifi  cantly smaller still than the fi  gure of -0.6 resulting from global aggre-gation using market exchange rates.
5 Fur-
thermore, the elasticity of global trade to 
global GDP at PPPs – at a fi  gure of just 0.9 – is lower than the separate elasticities of im-
ports in both groups of countries (1.7 and 
1.1 respectively). How can these observa-
tions be explained?
The rate of growth in real global GDP is cal-
culated by adding the growth contributions 
of the individual countries or groups of countries. In turn, these contributions are 
derived from the growth rates at the subor-dinate level, weighted according to the cor-
responding shares of nominal global GDP . 
The rate of change in the global volume of imports is calculated using a similar method. 
Given the lower elasticity of imports in the 
emerging market and developing econ-omies, these countries’ growing share of 
the global aggregates could be one of the 
reasons why global trade elasticity has fallen over the past few years. However, 
these shares only shift slowly over time, so 
they are likely to have played little more 
than a minor role in the observed weaken-ing of elasticity.
In fact, the shift in growth rates between 
the groups of countries has been far more 
substantial than it has for their respective 
shares. Between 1980 and 2007, real GDP 
in the advanced economies grew by just 
under 3% a year on average, while output 
in the emerging market and developing 
economies advanced by 4½%. Weighted by market exchange rates, it was the industrial 
countries which made the substantially 
4 See Deutsche Bundesbank, The empirical relation-
ship between world trade and global economic out-
put, Monthly Report, November 2013, pp 13-17.
5 What must also be considered is that the IMF’s data on groups of countries are themselves aggregates that 
may contain composition effects. Above all, the IMF 
staff aggregated GDP growth for the groups of coun-
tries using PPP exchange rates. According to Bundes-
bank calculations, applying an alternative weighting based on market exchange rates for the advanced economies results in a smaller decrease in elasticity.

economies is confi  rmed, meanwhile.Global economic growth and contributions of groups of countries

more sizeable contributions to global eco-
nomic growth during that time. In the later 
period, however, growth in the advanced 
economies decelerated to a mean fi  gure of 
just ¾% per annum, while output in the 
rest of the world even pipped its earlier per-
formance with growth of 5¼%. Thus, from 
2008 to 2014, emerging market and de-veloping economies made a far greater contribution to global economic growth than in the past. Given the comparatively 
low elasticity of imports to real GDP in this group of countries, it comes as no surprise 
that, at the global level, the elasticity of 
trade has fallen noticeably as a result.
A rough calculation reveals that half of the 
decline in the ratio of global trade growth 
to global GDP growth (based on market ex-
change rates) from 2.0 to 1.4 is explained 
by a decrease in the elasticity of imports in 
the individual groups of countries. Of the 
other half, a third is attributable to the shift 
in the share of global aggregates towards 
emerging market and developing econ-
omies, while two- thirds is due to the shift in 
the focus of international growth. Looking 
at global activity in terms of purchasing power parities, the impact of the steeper drop in growth is more considerable still. 
This is due mainly to the interplay with the 
discrepancy between the groups of coun-
tries’ shares of world trade and aggregate 
economic output. For instance, the emer-ging market and developing economies’ share of global GDP in PPP terms has ex-
ceeded their share of global trade by far in 
recent years. The contributions of these groups of countries to global economic 
growth were correspondingly large, which 
dampens the elasticity of global trade. This 
means that it is also possible, statistically speaking, for global elasticity to be lower 
than the elasticity of imports in the individ-ual groups of countries.
Furthermore, the ratio of the average growth in imports to mean GDP growth 
provides only a rough measure of elasticity. Simple regressions of log levels suggest that the elasticity of imports might not have 
weakened in the advanced economies, but might have done so in the emerging market 
and developing economies. This is consist-
ent with the observation that import growth 
has been relatively muted recently, espe-
cially in China (see the box on pages 20 to 22). Nonetheless, it should be remembered that there are often defi  cits in the availabil-ity and quality of data for emerging market 
and developing economies, particularly for 
periods further back in time. But even in the 
United States, it is noticeable that imports 
have been relatively weak in recent years.6 
Given the previously large trade defi  cit, however, some may regard this as a wel-
come correction to the external imbalance.
So it is not a law of economics that the 
elasticity of global trade to global economic activity must remain the same. Marked de-
viations from a long- term value are also 
possible without any shift in the underlying correlations. One reason for this is the com-
paratively low sensitivity of imports in the emerging market and developing econ-omies. The growing importance of these 
countries, but, above all, the shift in focus 
of international growth towards the emer-
ging market economies, are likely to have 
distinctly dampened the elasticity of global 
trade in recent years. How long this easing will persist depends, then, on the durability of the current growth ratios. Nonetheless, it 
remains to be seen how far, and how sus-
tainably, the correlation between external trade and income has shifted in terms of groups of countries and individual econ-
omies.
6 Constantinescu et al (2014, 2015) underline that im-
port elasticity in China and the USA has decreased, 
while the correlation between external trade and in-come in the European Union has proven to be rela-
tively stable.Deutsche Bundesbank

All things considered, the two indicators at the 
height of the global imbalances in 2006 do not 
seem, at first sight, to present a good correl -
ation with the status of the respective coun -
tries’ current account balances. For example, 
Germany and the United States show quite 
similar ESI and TCI values despite having very 
different current account positions. Moreover, 
in the group of advanced economies posting a 
deficit there are countries which, according to 
the ESI, compete strongly with the rest of the 
world as well as countries with export struc -
tures that display little overlap. On an average 
of all the deficit countries, however, this indica -
tor is higher than that of the surplus countries 
throughout the period from 1999 to 2012 
under consideration. A mixed picture is also 
presented when looking at the complementar -
ity of the industrial countries’ export structure 
with regard to the import demand of the oil-  
exporting countries and EMEs. The major sur -
plus and deficit countries, in particular, are very 
close together in this respect. What is striking, however, is that, in comparison with the aver -
age of all the advanced economies, only seven 
of the 18 deficit countries achieve a TCI that is 
higher than the average, whereas, in the group 
of 15 surplus countries, 12 economies display 
an above- average complementarity in their ex -
port structure. Germany’s positioning is note -
worthy, too: among all the advanced econ -
omies, it shows the highest match between its 
exports and import demand from the rest of 
the world.
The impact of export similarity and comple -
mentarity on a country’s exports and/or bal -
ance of trade and the current account is likely 
to be masked by other factors as well. An 
econometric estimate taking account of these 
factors should provide deeper insights. The 
starting point for this is the aforementioned 
October 2014 IMF study which uses a panel 
model to analyse the determinants of changes 
in current account balances (in relation to na -
tional GDP). On the basis of this model, the 
two variables ESI and TCI are incorporated in 
addition to indicators of real external and do -
mestic demand as well as indicators of relative 
prices.36 The sample comprises 30 countries in 
the period from 1999 to 2012.37 The similarity

the current account. An increase in the ESI by 
one point is associated, two years later, with a 
deterioration of 0.2 percentage point in the 
current account balance relative to national 
GDP .38 The indicator of import complementar -
ity (approximated by the TCI) also shows the 
expected positive sign, but the statistical signifi -
cance is low. Very similar results to those re -
ported by the IMF are produced for the other 
variables. An increase in the growth rate of do -
mestic final demand amounting to 1 percent -
age point in one year is reflected in a lower 
current account surplus (or a higher deficit) 
relative to GDP of 0.5 percentage point within 
two years. Similarly, an increase in external final 
demand leads to an improvement in the cur -
rent account balance.
All in all, the analyses show that a country’s 
range of exports and its bilateral trading rela -
tionships can have an impact on the current 
account balance. When interpreting the re -
sults, certain conceptual difficulties neverthe -
less have to be taken into account. For in -
stance, a country’s export structure, as re -
flected in the ESI and TCI indices, should not be 
regarded over an extended period of time as 
an independent variable.39 Furthermore, in cal -
culating these measures, it was not possible to 
capture differences in quality within a single 
product category – despite the very high level 
of disaggregation in the trade data.40 How im -
portant this aspect is can be demonstrated by a 
comparison of mass- produced goods and high- 
quality versions of the same product. For ex -
ample, Switzerland still occupies an outstand -
ing position globally in the production of luxury 
watches, while the manufacture of standard 
watches has in most cases long since migrated 
from Switzerland to lower- wage countries.41 
One reason for this is that the promise of qual -
ity associated with luxury goods can often be 
communicated credibly to the customer only if 
the product has been manufactured in certain 
countries – Switzerland in the case of watches 
(or, in the case of premium- segment cars, for 
example, in Japan and Germany).… but concep-

38 In this calculation, the estimated coefficients of the 
lagged variables are also taken at face value. Leaving aside 
non- significant factors, the aggregate effect amounts to 
just under 0.3 percentage point.
39 The ESI and TCI also merely model whether two coun -
tries, with regard to their export goods, are potentially in 
competition with each other or whether they are natural 
trading partners, since transport costs, tariff and non- tariff 
barriers to trade likewise have an impact on actual trading 
relationships.

Outlook and summary
According to the IMF’s medium- term forecast, 
global imbalances could continue to recede 
over the next few years.42 The decline in the 
surpluses of the oil- exporting countries, which 
was projected in the autumn, is playing a key 
part in this. In all probability, this process will 
become even stronger if the steep fall in oil 
prices since the IMF’s October forecast con -
tinues for a long period.43
Despite their persistence, developments in cur -
rent account balances over an extended period 
highlight the fact that widening deficits and 
surpluses are not a reflection of irreversible pro -
cesses and that national positions do indeed 
change. The dynamics and level of current ac -
count balances are essentially determined by 
international flows of goods. In this context, 
trade in crude oil and refined petroleum prod -
ucts occupies a somewhat special position, as 
short- term fluctuations in prices have a strong 
influence on imports and exports in terms of 
their value. Imbalances in international trade in 
other goods are less prone to fluctuations and 
are characterised more by longer- term trends, 
although, recently, these have not been stand -
ing in the way of a reduction in global current 
 account balances. Moreover, it is apparent that 
there has been a relative increase in the import -
ance of imbalances in trade in capital goods.
Taking a closer look, it is possible to confirm 
the hypothesis that global developments in 
conjunction with national supply structures 
have played a part in the industrial countries 
showing diverging current account positions. 
However, the additional explanatory power of 
the econometric model tends to be modest. 
This should be qualified by taking into account 
the fact that individual countries’ specific struc -
tural features (above all, with regard to product 
quality) can be captured only inadequately in 
the statistics. Above and beyond that, enter -
prises are likely to pursue quite different inter -nationalisation strategies. They can, for ex -
ample, step up domestic production as a re -
sponse to a rise in global demand. Alternatively, 
they can expand their production capacities 
abroad.44
The advanced economies have experienced 
varying degrees of success in terms of main -
taining their position in global markets in the 
wake of heightened competitive pressure from 
the EMEs. In this connection, it is striking that 
the deficit countries, in particular, display 
weaker growth in their exports than the surplus 
countries. In the period under review, this con -
tributed to an expansion of global imbalances. 
However, the adjustment process in a number 
of euro- area periphery countries illustrates that, 
along with a reduction of excessive absorption, 
primarily improvements in price and non- price 
competitiveness can achieve a turnaround in 
the current account within a relatively short 
space of time. In global terms, enhancing com -
petitiveness remains on the agenda not only 
for countries that are still posting high – and, in 
the long term, unsustainable – current account 
deficits, but also for those countries that have 
been able to improve their position over the 
past few years. With waning enthusiasm for re -
form, there does indeed exist the danger for 
some countries that pronounced deficit pos -
itions – believed to be a thing of the past – will 
re- emerge.International

43 According to the Bundesbank’s studies, this effect 
might be quite minor, however. The outcome should be a 
considerable decline in the current account surpluses of the 
oil- exporting countries. On the whole, the oil-  importing 
countries will benefit from the lower import value. Never -
theless, these also include some surplus countries that will 
expand their current account positions and this will run 
counter to a major reduction in global imbalances. Added 
to this are the effects of adjustments to exchange rates and 
real demand in the individual groups of countries due to 
the fall in oil prices.

The Common Credit Assessment System for 
assessing the eligibility of enterprises
Under the Eurosystem’s decentralised monetary policy framework, national central banks (NCBs) 
grant liquidity- providing refinancing and intraday credit to resident credit institutions. Sufficient 
eligible assets must be submitted as collateral for all Eurosystem lending operations. In order to 
protect the Eurosystem from financial risk, this collateral has to meet high credit quality stand -
ards. Eligible collateral for refinancing includes not only securities but also credit claims against 
non- financial corporations. This broad collateral framework promotes the equal treatment of 
counterparties throughout the euro area.
In order to establish whether credit claims meet the required high standard of credit quality, the 
Eurosystem relies, amongst other things, on NCBs’ internal credit assessment systems (ICASs). The 
Bundesbank also operates a credit assessment system to measure enterprises’ default risk, thereby 
expanding and simplifying the potential uses of corporate loans as collateral for monetary policy 
operations. Small and medium- sized institutions without an approved internal ratings- based (IRB) 
approach, in particular, can thus access central bank lending more easily. They can also submit 
credit claims against small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) as collateral, even when the 
enterprises concerned do not have an external rating.
The Bundesbank’s use of credit claims as collateral at the beginning of the European monetary 
union (EMU) is rooted in the long tradition of rediscount business. With the introduction of the 
“single list” of collateral for monetary policy operations, corporate loans became eligible collat -
eral throughout the euro area from 2007 onwards. During the financial crisis, banks’ funding 
requirements rose, as did their interest in using credit claims as collateral. In order to assess the 
credit quality of SMEs as well, some of the Eurosystem’s NCBs have built up new internal credit 
assessment systems.
The Bundesbank has recently redesigned its credit assessment system and transferred the model- 
based rating functionality to the Common Credit Assessment System (CoCAS) developed jointly by 
the Oesterreichische Nationalbank and the Bundesbank. CoCAS can also be used by other Euro -
system NCBs for their credit assessment procedures and thus forms a basis for harmonising the 
procedures for assessing credit risk in the Eurosystem. In addition, the Bundesbank has modern -
ised the underlying mathematical models. Whereas at the beginning of EMU a distinction was 
made only between eligible and ineligible enterprises, a master scale similar in granularity to 
those used by external credit assessment institutions (ECAIs) is now in use.Deutsche Bundesbank

Motivation for the Bundes -
bank’s credit assessment 
 system
The Bundesbank uses its credit assessment sys -
tem to estimate non- financial corporations’ de -
fault risk.1 Each bucket of the rating scale cor -
responds to an expected one- year probability 
of default. On the one hand, this credit assess -
ment dictates whether credit institutions can 
pledge credit claims against these enterprises 
as collateral for monetary policy operations 
with the Bundesbank. On the other hand, in 
the case of eligible credit claims, the size of the 
haircut is based on the credit rating.
As an added benefit, the data collected for 
credit assessments also have a statistical use 
and are entered into the Bundesbank’s finan -
cial statement data pool.2 Macro and micro -
economic studies are often based on the data 
collected in this way, including, for example, 
studies on monetary policy transmission3 as 
well as the regular article in the Bundesbank’s 
Monthly Report entitled “German enterprises’ 
profitability and financing”.
In some European countries, there is a long 
tradition of using credit claims as collateral in 
central bank refinancing operations. At the be -
ginning of EMU, the Bundesbank’s use of tier 
two assets, the eligibility of which it established 
itself, for monetary policy operations4 repre -
sented a continuation of its rediscount busi -
ness, in which credit institutions could use 
trade bills as collateral for monetary policy op -
erations.5 With the transition to the single list 
of collateral, credit claims replaced trade bills as 
eligible collateral.
Allowing credit claims to be submitted to the 
central bank as collateral widens the pool of 
eligible collateral for credit institutions. From 
the central bank’s perspective, accepting credit 
claims can also have a positive effect if it means 
that, in total, banks are able to submit more 
– and more diversified – collateral as a counter -
weight to the volume of refinancing granted. Compared with marketable assets, credit claims 
are less liquid6 and, as a rule, are not accepted 
between commercial banks as collateral for 
 secured money market transactions. From the 
institutions’ point of view, the opportunity 
costs of using credit claims as collateral for 
monetary policy refinancing operations are 
therefore low. On the other hand, it is easier to 
trade marketable assets on securities trading 
platforms or convert them into liquidity in the 
repo market, which is why their use as collat -
eral for refinancing operations with the central 
bank is associated with higher opportunity 
costs for credit institutions than credit claims. 
This is particularly the case when the Eurosys -
tem’s monetary policy refinancing operations 
are conducted with full allotment, which leads 
to excess liquidity in the banking system and in 
the interbank money market.7
Between the start of 2007 and end of 2009, 
the collateral value of the credit claims submit -
ted to the Bundesbank increased approximately 
sevenfold. The creation of the Bundesbank’s 
electronic platform “Credit claims – submission 
and administration” (Kreditforderungen – Ein -
reichung und Verwaltung,  or KEV) in 2007 
boosted this growth. The increase is likely to Purpose of the

2 Besides data from the Bundesbank’s credit assessment 
system, the financial statement data pool also comprises 
data from other suppliers.

sion in Germany: New Perspectives on Financial Constraints

sion Paper, No 19/ 2001.

5 The basic idea behind this was to mobilise capital for cor -
porate financing and to anchor the monetary policy trans -
mission mechanism in the real economy by monetary pol -
icy stimuli being passed on directly to enterprises through 
the refinancing channel.
6 Since central banks also find it more difficult to convert 
credit claims into liquidity in the event of insolvency, they 
are subject to larger haircuts than marketable assets.
7 Interest rates in the repo market are often lower than the 
key interest rate applied to the Eurosystem’s refinancing 
operations. The repo market gained significance in the 
 financial crisis, while the scale of unsecured money market 
transactions between banks is still very much smaller than 
was previously normal because of increased risk percep -
tion. See Deutsche Bundesbank, The financial system in

Th e Eurosystem collateral framework
Equal treatment of counterparties
In the context of monetary policy oper-
ations in the Eurosystem, national central banks (NCBs) grant liquidity- providing refi  -nancing and intraday credit to domestic credit institutions. Pursuant to Article 18.1 of the Statute of the European System of 
Central Banks and of the European Central 
Bank (ESCB Statute), all Eurosystem credit 
operations must be based on adequate eli-
gible collateral. This is especially designed 
to ensure that the Eurosystem is protected 
against losses. As a rule, eligible monetary 
policy counterparties have access to Euro-
system monetary policy operations on equal 
terms if they have suffi   cient eligible collat-
eral. In this respect, the Eurosystem remains 
competitively neutral towards banks when 
implementing monetary policy operations.
Neutrality with regard to institutions’ 
business models
The Eurosystem accepts a wide range of 
marketable (interest- bearing securities) and 
non- marketable assets (eg credit claims). To-gether with the broad group of counterpar-ties, the extensive collateral framework pro-motes the equal treatment of counterparties throughout the euro area. The fundamental 
neutrality of the Eurosystem with regard to 
the type of collateral accepted enables 
banks with different business models to par-
ticipate in monetary policy operations – 
without the banks having to acquire or hold certain eligible assets in order to do this.
“High credit standards” for eligible 
 collateral
The monetary policy framework1 describes 
the acceptance criteria for eligible collateral in detail. One of the most important require-ments is that the collateral must meet “high 
credit standards”. These are determined using the expected probability of default 
(over a one- year horizon) of the credit claim 
obligor, issuer of a security or, where rele-vant, a guarantor. Currently, the probability 
of default must not exceed 40 basis points, which is equivalent to a long- term rating of at least BBB– by Fitch or Standard & Poor’s, 
Baa3 by Moody’s or BBBL by DBRS (invest-
ment grade). The defi  nition of default in the monetary policy framework encompasses all defaults pursuant to Article 178 of the Cap-ital Requirements Regulation (CRR).
2 The Eu-
rosystem’s credit quality steps (CQS) are 
broken down into eight different grades. Eli-
gible collateral is usually graded in the fi  rst 
three CQSs, with these being subject to vari-ous haircuts.
3
Single list
Since 2007, the eligibility criteria for collat-
eral submitted for monetary policy oper-ations and intraday credit have been har-
monised across the Eurosystem in a single 
framework for eligible assets known as the “single list”. The single list replaced the for-
mer two- tier system which had been in 
place since the start of Economic and Mon-etary Union.
4
Expansion of collateral framework
The collateral framework experienced 
 several – sometimes far- reaching – changes 
1 See ECB (2011), The implementation of monetary 
policy in the euro area: General documentation on 
Euro system monetary policy instruments and proced-
ures, valid from 1 January 2012, Chapter 6, available 
online at www.ecb.eu.
2 See Offi   cial Journal of the European Union L 176/ 112 of 27 June 2013, available online at eur- lex.europa.eu.3 The size of the current haircuts according to risk cat-
egory and residual maturity is published on the ECB’s 
website (www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/assets/risk/
liquidity/html/index.en.html).4 Collateral was previously divided into two tiers. Tier one consisted of collateral that fulfi  lled euro- area- wide eligibility criteria. Tier two comprised collateral deemed 
to be of particular importance for national fi  nancial markets, which could only be submitted to the re-
spective NCB. At the start of monetary union, tier two encompassed trade bills, credit claims and commercial 
paper, amongst others. See Deutsche Bundesbank, The creation of a single list of eligible collateral 
throughout the euro area, Monthly Report, April 2006, pp 29-38.Deutsche Bundesbank

in the course of the fi  nancial crisis and sub-
sequent sovereign debt crisis. In particular, 
the Governing Council cut the general 
credit quality threshold for eligible collateral 
at the beginning of the fi  nancial crisis, ini-
tially temporarily but later permanently, 
from A– to BBB–. As the sovereign debt cri-
sis progressed, the Governing Council also 
approved specifi  c national eligibility criteria 
for credit claims enabling the NCBs in ques-
tion, at their own risk, to temporarily accept 
additional credit claims which do not have 
to meet the general eligibility criteria and 
which may also have a higher probability of 
default.5 Not least for this reason, the sig-
nifi  cance of credit claims as collateral for Eurosystem refi  nancing operations has grown markedly compared with that of marketable assets since the beginning of 
the crisis.
Credit claims currently account for around 
one- fi  fth of the total collateral volume of the assets submitted to the Eurosystem 
NCBs. The share of credit claims in the col-lateral volume of assets pledged to the Bun-
desbank is currently 13%, with loans to public debtors accounting for around half 
of this fi  gure. These are not classifi  ed using the Bundesbank’s credit assessment system 
but by credit rating agencies. The credit-worthiness of business enterprises is pri-
marily determined using the Bundesbank’s 
credit assessment system.Framework for credit assessments
Together with the single list, a new frame-
work for credit assessments (Eurosystem 
credit assessment framework: ECAF) entered into force in 2007. It defi  nes the procedures, rules and techniques which ensure that the 
Eurosystem requirement of high credit 
standards for all eligible assets is met.
The ECAF is rooted in the principles of ac-
curacy, consistency and comparability be-
tween the eligible credit assessment sources in the Eurosystem. It envisages four possible credit assessment sources for the evaluation 
of the credit standard of eligible assets. 
These are external credit assessment institu-
tions (ECAIs), credit institutions’ internal 
ratings- based (IRB) systems, third- party pro-
viders’ rating tools and NCBs’ in- house 
credit assessment systems (ICASs).6 Besides 
the Bundesbank and the  Oesterreichische 
Nationalbank, the NCBs of Belgium, Spain, 
France, Italy and Slovenia also have an ac-
cepted ICAS to assess non- fi  nancial corpor-ations.
5 The Bundesbank is not making use of this option. 
See the ECB’s press release of 9 February 2012.
6 The monetary policy framework contains a detailed description of all ECAF rating sources, their respective eligibility criteria and characteristics. See also Deutsche Bundesbank, The creation of a single list of eligible col-
lateral throughout the euro area, Monthly Report, 
April 2006, pp 29-38.

also be linked to institutions’ growing liquidity 
needs during the liquidity and financial crisis 
and the higher quality requirements for collat -
eral in the repo market. The subsequent slight 
decline in the collateral value of credit claims 
submitted to the Bundesbank is probably par -
ticularly attributable to the fact that the Bun -
desbank’s counterparties then used monetary 
policy refinancing operations on a far smaller 
scale than at the height of the financial crisis. 
The share of credit claims in the collateral sub -
mitted to the Bundesbank by German counter -
parties rose continuously, however, from 5% in 
2007 to 12% in 2010 and 13% in 2014 (see the 
chart on page 38).
The NCBs’ in- house credit assessment systems 
increase the availability of assessment sources 
in the Eurosystem and allow benchmarking of 
rating results. The growing number of internal 
credit assessment systems employed by NCBs 
shows that the Eurosystem is striving to expand 
capacity for internal ratings.8 The increasing 
 diversification of credit assessment systems 
 authorised by the Eurosystem is pushing up the 
volume of potentially eligible collateral.
The Bundesbank’s credit assessment system 
makes it easier for small and medium- sized 
credit institutions in Germany which do not use 
IRB approaches or external rating tools to also 
submit their loans to small and medium- sized 
non- financial corporations as collateral for refi -
nancing operations with the Bundesbank. Since 
all enterprises can have themselves assessed by 
the Bundesbank, SMEs also have access to an 
assessment system, whereas typically only large 
enterprises can afford to be rated by an ECAI or 
need such a rating for capital market purposes. 
In fact, 54% of the enterprises assessed by the 
Bundesbank are small or micro- enterprises.9 
Just 0.3% of the enterprises undergoing a 
credit assessment have a rating from an ECAI 
authorised within the Eurosystem credit assess -
ment framework (ECAF).
Unlike ECAIs, the Bundesbank does not publish 
the results of its credit assessments because they only serve internal Eurosystem purposes; 
the corporate data used in the process are 
treated as strictly confidential. Only the enter -
prise involved is informed of the results. The 
Bundesbank’s monetary policy counterparties 
can find out which enterprises are eligible. The 
Bundesbank remains neutral and has no direct 
influence on the market for corporate loans.10
Credit assessment procedure
The Bundesbank’s credit assessment procedure 
consists of two stages. The first stage is based 
on the annual accounts of the enterprises con -
cerned. After financial ratios have been calcu -
lated from the annual accounts, statistical 
models derive a proposal for the enterprise’s 
credit rating from these ratios. The second 
stage comprises expert analysis; Bundesbank 
analysts identify and examine additional quan -
titative and qualitative information that can 
have a material impact on the credit rating but 
that cannot be analysed sufficiently, or at all, in 
the first stage. Only after this is the final credit 
rating (notch) specified, which may correspond 
to the model proposal but which can also differ 
from it. The scope for deviating from the model 
proposal in favour of a better credit rating is 
limited, however.
Operational credit assessments are conducted 
at the Bundesbank’s Regional Offices, while 
Central Office is responsible for conceptual 
issues and manages the mathematical model 
and the technical system in particular. The de -
centralised structure of the credit risk assess -
ment procedure facilitates closer contact with 
the enterprises, which may be intensified by NCBs’ internal

8 See the ECB’s press release of 8 December 2011. In the 
last three years, three Eurosystem NCBs – the Italian, Slo -
venian and Belgian central banks – have set up their own 
internal credit assessment systems. At the same time, the 
number of IRB approaches approved for Eurosystem pur -
poses has approximately tripled.

conducting an on- site interview with the man -
agement of the relevant enterprise.
If a credit institution wishes to submit credit 
claims against an enterprise to the Bundesbank 
as collateral, it can do so using the Bundes -
bank’s KEV platform. If the Bundesbank does 
not have a current, valid rating for the enter -
prise from its credit assessment system, the re -
sponsible Regional Office contacts the enter -
prise concerned. By submitting its annual 
 accounts for the last two years as well as add -
itional information, the enterprise agrees both 
to the credit assessment being conducted and 
to the required data being used.11 An enterprise 
can also approach the Bundesbank itself and 
request to receive a credit assessment.12
Once the annual accounts have been received, 
the analysts at the Bundesbank’s Regional Of -
fices enter the individual items into the data 
management system of the Bundesbank’s 
credit assessment platform. Around 30,000 
sets of annual accounts are captured in this 
process each year. In addition, the enterprise’s 
or group’s master data, such as address, legal 
form, group affiliation and type of economic 
activity, are kept up to date.13 After the annual 
accounts data have been recorded, they are 
transferred to the Common Credit Assessment 
System, where the actual rating is assigned.Procedure

11 To update the credit rating, the Bundesbank writes to 
enterprises that have already been rated in the following 
years and asks them to submit their new annual accounts 
(if they have not already done so).
12 The initiative for a credit assessment can come from ei -
ther the submitting bank or the enterprise. It is irrelevant 
whether the enterprise meets high credit quality standards 
and its loan can potentially be submitted as collateral. The 
Bundesbank endeavours to broaden the group of assessed 
companies beyond the circle of eligible enterprises. This 
permits robust calibration of the credit assessment systems.

The Common Credit Assess -
ment System
Since 2011, the Bundesbank and the Oesterrei -
chische Nationalbank  (OeNB) have jointly oper -
ated a single platform called the Common 
Credit Assessment System (CoCAS) for con -
ducting credit assessments of enterprises that 
apply the International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) to their accounts. The OeNB 
and the Bundesbank created CoCAS between 
2008 and 2011 as a joint project.14 The idea 
behind CoCAS was to develop a harmonised 
tool for model- based credit assessments on the 
basis of the uniform accounting rules in the 
IFRSs which may also be used by other Eurosys -
tem NCBs as part of their respective credit as -
sessment systems.
CoCAS thus opens up a path towards harmon -
isation for the internal credit assessment sys -
tems of different central banks in the Eurosys -
tem, at least as far as the statistical analysis in 
the first stage is concerned. At present, CoCAS 
is used by its two providers, the OeNB and the 
Bundesbank, as well as by the central banks of 
Spain and Belgium, and from 2015, by the Por -
tuguese central bank.
Since CoCAS can be configured very flexibly, it 
can be used for different mathematical models 
which can also be based on national generally 
accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Since 
2014, the OeNB and the Bundesbank have also 
shared models in CoCAS for enterprises that 
use the accounting standards of the Austrian 
Commercial Code (Unternehmensgesetzbuch) 
and the German Commercial Code (Handels -
gesetzbuch)  respectively.15
The OeNB developed the methodology for the 
CoCAS mathematical models in cooperation 
with the Vienna University of Economics and 
Business.16 Originally, this methodology was in -
tended to produce credit ratings for the IFRS 
annual accounts of German and Austrian 
groups of companies. These are large, capital- 
market oriented groups with low default rates.17 The idea behind the approach is to con -
sider internal and external ratings (from credit 
institutions and ECAIs) in addition to the de -
fault data and balance sheet ratios used in bin -
ary classification methods, as this allows for a 
more precise forecast of the probability of 
 default.
The CoCAS model design is based on a three- 
step estimation procedure. The first step con -
siders available internal and external ratings to 
determine a “consensus rating” for the relevant 
enterprise in the form of a score. This score ex -
presses the average market perception of the 
enterprise, ie the mean of assessments carried 
out by credit institutions and ECAIs. The in -
ternal ratings captured by the model are taken The CoCAS

14 The Bundesbank is mainly tasked with developing and 
operating the IT infrastructure, while the OeNB’s chief 
 responsibility is for model development processes.
15 This was only possible because the accounting rules 
contained in the Austrian and German Commercial Codes 
are very similar. The OeNB had already been transferring 
the ratings of enterprises that use the Austrian Commercial 
Code accounting standards to CoCAS since 2012.
16 With regard to the methodology, see K Hornik, R Jankow -
itsch, C Leitner, M Lingo, S Pichler and G Winkler (2010), A 
latent variable approach to validate credit rating systems, 
in: D Rösch and H Scheule (eds), Model Risk in Financial 
Crises, pp 277-296.
17 For this reason, the traditional rating procedures based 
on logit/probit models, discriminant analyses, neural net -
works or support vector machines are unsuitable for these 
data, as they require a sufficient number of defaults for 
precise calibration.Deutsche Bundesbank

 The CoCAS model
The Common Credit Assessment System 
(CoCAS) classifi  es an enterprise by forecast-
ing the consensus rating. This forecast is 
based on a linear equation of the score 
with typical ratios from the analysis of an-
nual  accounts.1
For groups using the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), a model with six 
ratios is applied. The forecast of the score 
for enterprise i takes the following form.
By contrast, for enterprises using German 
Commercial Code accounting standards, a 
complex methodology comprising one basic model and several sector models is 
applied. The basic model with four ratios is 
identical for all enterprises and similar in 
terms of structure to the IFRS model. Subse-
quently, each enterprise is assigned to exactly one of 11 sectors according to its classifi  cation of economic activities; differ-
ent models are applied to the different sec-
tors. Accounts consolidated according to 
the German Commercial Code are assigned 
to a specifi  c group model, which means that there is a total of 12 sector models 
(j(i)  {1, …, 12}). The forecast from the 
basic modelis an input variable of the forecast of the respective sector model, which comprises 
three additional sector- specifi  c ratios.
Xi1,j(i) represents the value of the fi  rst sector 
ratio for enterprise i in sector j, while 1,j(i) 
denotes the coeffi   cient of this ratio. The sector model j used for the forecast de-
pends on the classifi  cation of economic 
 activities of enterprise i.
The advantage of this construction is that 
the uniform basic model enables compari-
sons between enterprises from different sectors and that classifi  cation changes re-
sulting from an enterprise being assigned to a different sector are kept to a minimum. In addition, the breakdown into basic and sec-
tor models reduces the maximum total number of model ratios to be used. The table below provides an overview of the combination of ratios in the basic and 
 sector models using wholesale trade as an 
 example.2
1 The score is a continuous variable which represents 
the consensus rating and is determined in the fi  rst step 
of model development. Risk classifi  cations by banks 
are taken from the central credit register to estimate 
the consensus rating.2 The ratios used in the models are listed in the follow-
ing documents, which can be found on the Bundes-
bank’s website at www.bundesbank.de under Tasks => 
Monetary policy => Collateral => Downloads. These comprise “The Bundesbank’s credit assessment pro-
cess” for the basic model ratios and “Bonitätsanalyse 
der Deutschen Bundesbank für Konzerne, die nach Inter national Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  bilanzieren” (available in German only) for all IFRS 
models.An example of the models  currently used for enterprises and groups using German Commercial Code  accounting standards

from the prudential reports of IRB- approach 
credit institutions submitted to the national 
credit registers of the central banks participat -
ing in CoCAS.18 The model therefore captures 
prudential data on each company from a var -
iety of different sources. In terms of German 
banks using the IRB approach, approximately 
24,500 reports are currently used per quarter. 
With regard to enterprises that apply IFRS ac -
counting standards, the model additionally 
considers external ratings from ECAIs accepted 
by the Eurosystem.19 Although the model uses 
ratings from institutions applying the IRB ap -
proach and ECAIs, it also takes account of the 
specific deviation of each rating entity from the 
market view (bias) and makes adjustments for 
this in the “consensus rating”.
In the second step of the estimation procedure 
the consensus rating is linked to ratios from the 
enterprises’ annual accounts via a linear regres -
sion. The ratios serve to explain the consensus 
rating and the process behind it.
The first step in selecting the ratios is to estab -
lish a comprehensive catalogue of potentially 
suitable ratios. The decisive criteria in this re -
spect are plausibility, interpretability and in -
formative value from a business perspective. 
Statistical techniques are then used to identify 
the most relevant ratios for predicting the con -
sensus rating. Significance, accuracy, robust -
ness and data availability play an important role 
in this regard.
Care is also taken to ensure that traditional 
ratios covering profitability, balance sheet struc -
ture and liquidity as well as the ability to gener -
ate cash flow are taken into account. The cata -
logue of ratios and the selected ratios are re -
viewed on an annual basis using current annual 
accounts data.
The third step involves a comparison of the 
average probability of default expected by the 
model and the empirically observed default 
rate. If the empirical default rate is significantly greater than that suggested by the model, the 
model is recalibrated to be more conservative.
The model design results in a linear equation 
that has fixed parameters and is based on the 
selected ratios. This equation forecasts a score20 
for the given ratios which is then assigned to a 
notch on the Bundesbank’s rating scale.Sector distribution of enterprises

18 The credit register in Germany is administered by the 
Central Credit Register for Large Exposures and Loans of 
€1.5 Million or More (Groß- und Millionenkreditevidenz -
zentrale).  The relevant rules on the reporting procedure are 
set out in the Regulation governing large exposures and 
loans of €1.5 million or more (Großkredit- und Millionenk -
reditverordnung)  and the Audit Report Regulation (Prü-
fungsberichtsverordnung) – available at www.bafin.de – as 
well as section 14 of the German Banking Act (Kredit -
wesengesetz).
19 For enterprises using national accounting standards, 
only the respective prudential reports of German and Aus -
trian credit institutions applying the IRB approach are used. 
This is because this data set contains a large number of 
small and medium- sized enterprises, for which the number 
of ratings from ECAIs is insufficient.
20 This score can correspond to the consensus rating, but 
may also differ from it.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

The innovation of the CoCAS methodology vis- 
à- vis traditional rating models is that it is not 
directly dependent on the availability of a min -
imum number of default events to provide ro -
bust estimates. In addition to capturing binary 
default events, the model design also takes 
into account enterprises’ quantitative credit 
ratings, which are condensed in the first step of 
the model.
In the second step, the condensed prudential 
reports of the banks replace default events as 
the endogenous variable used to estimate 
model parameters. This second step marks a 
return to the original level of analysis involving 
annual financial ratios, irrespective of whether 
a rating exists for the enterprise in question. 
The credit assessment model – and thus also 
the credit rating calculated via CoCAS – there -
fore always departs in the details from the 
banks’ assessments. Nevertheless, the model is 
able to provide a better explanation of market 
perception than conventional models based on default data because it is based on more  diverse 
information.
Actual defaults are only taken into account in 
the third step. Should credit institutions and 
ECAIs have been mistaken on aggregate in 
their assessment of the enterprises’ credit -
worthiness, the third step of the calibration 
allows for a conservative correction to be made 
to the forecast.
Supplementary qualitative 
and quantitative expert 
 analysis
The model- based credit risk assignment per -
formed by the system in the first step of the 
rating procedure is essentially based on the bal -
ance sheet and the profit and loss account as 
well as the resulting ratios for the respective 
enterprise. However, this is insufficient for a re -
liable credit rating. First, there is a large amount 
of additional information not contained in an -
nual accounts data that can be relevant for a 
credit rating but which cannot be sufficiently 
captured by a statistical model. Second, the 
delay between the reporting date/the compil -
ation of the annual accounts and submission to 
the Bundesbank is unavoidable. It is therefore 
not possible for the relevant annual accounts 
data to be completely up to date. Third, the 
data can be distorted by special factors and 
one- off effects, meaning that the informative 
value of the ratios used in the first step, and 
thus the statistical model’s proposal, may need 
to be revised in individual cases. This is why the 
model- based first step needs to be supple -
mented with an expert analysis carried out by 
analysts.
In principle, all relevant qualitative and quanti -
tative information not already evaluated in the 
first step can be taken into account in the 
second step, provided this information is avail -
able to the Bundesbank’s internal credit assess -
ment system or can be procured at reasonable 
expense.Advantages

In order to ensure that the classification of cash 
flow ratios for all enterprises/groups is as stand -
ardised as possible, the OeNB and the Bundes -
bank have produced their own type of cash 
flow statement, which is based on conven -
tional approaches to cash flow analysis, using 
the annual accounts data of enterprises that 
apply national accounting standards. The aim is 
to provide analysts with as uniform a view as 
possible of enterprises’ and groups’ liquidity 
flows (inflows and outflows), as not all enter -
prises using national accounting standards are 
required to produce a cash flow statement.
When determining credit ratings, groups are 
subject to a special set of rules that take into 
account dependencies within the group. This 
applies in particular if a company belonging to 
the group is in default. Approximately 40% of 
enterprises assessed by the Bundesbank are 
part of a group.21 For this reason, the Bundes -
bank’s provisions governing groups stipulate, 
among other things, that as a rule no company belonging to a group can be given a better rat -
ing than the group as a whole. The group is 
given its own rating by the Bundesbank based 
on the consolidated annual accounts.
Risk classifications from credit institutions and 
default events reported in the credit register are 
available to analysts on a quarterly basis. Fur -
thermore, the Bundesbank also takes into ac -
count all court insolvency proceedings registered 
in the portal of the justice authorities of the fed -
eral and state governments.22 Default events 
pursuant to Article 178 of the Capital Require -
ments Regulation (CRR) result in the enterprise 
in question being assigned to the lowest rating,

suant to the CRR and not temporary in nature. 
Materiality is determined on the basis of the 
credit volume and is considered to exist if the 
defaulted credit volume is equal to or exceeds 
2.5% of the enterprise’s total credit amount.23
Moreover, the analyst can take other important 
aspects into account. These include the market 
and sector environment, the current market 
and business developments, the competitive 
situation, relationships with customers and 
suppliers, information about the management 
and external credit ratings from ECAIs. Import -
ant sources of information in this respect in -
clude, in particular, quarterly bulletins, business 
evaluations, press reports and notices from the 
respective enterprise, but also information 
gained from direct contact with the enterprise. 
Overall, therefore, the second step of the credit 
assessment system provides a far more com -
prehensive and up- to- date picture of an enter -
prise’s creditworthiness than is possible with 
the first step alone.
Based on the aforementioned comprehensive 
analysis of all information, the enterprise is 
given a final credit rating class of between 1 
and 8 on a scale containing a total of 18 
notches. The notches 1 to 4- cover eligible 
companies (corresponding to the Eurosystem’s 
Credit Quality Steps (CQS) 1 to 3) and 5+ to 8 cover non- eligible companies (CQS 4 to 8). Rat -
ing 8 is for enterprises in default (see the table 
on page 43). The rating is generally valid for 
one year, but can be changed at any time on 
the basis of current information. The master 
scale used by the Bundesbank draws on the rat -
ing scales of ECAIs accepted by the Eurosystem. 
The status “eligible” is comparable to invest -
ment grade. Of the roughly 21,500 evaluated 
non- financial corporations with a valid rating,24 
approximately 12,000 are classified as eligible 
and roughly 9,500 have a rating of 4, which 
includes the notches 4+, 4 and 4-.25
The Bundesbank informs the enterprises of the 
result of the eligibility assessment in writing. This 
includes an independent assessment of their fi -
nancial structure in comparison with peers in 
the same sector and over time. Documents pro -
vided in this context include a fact sheet and a 
balance sheet evaluation. The fact sheet con -
tains the credit rating as well as multi- year and 
sectoral reference data for relevant ratios. These 
benchmark data relate to a peer group from the 
same sector and turnover size category as the 
enterprise. The balance sheet evaluation add -
itionally draws on a multi- year comparison of 
key data from the cash flow statement.
Outlook
The in- house credit assessment systems of na -
tional central banks enlarge and diversify the 
available pool of eligible collateral for monetary 
policy refinancing operations and make an im -
portant contribution to the efficient implemen -
tation of monetary policy in the Eurosystem.Other important

By modernising credit analysis procedures via 
CoCAS, the OeNB and the Bundesbank have 
laid solid groundwork for future developments. 
The flexible configurability of CoCAS makes it 
possible to quickly take into account new ac -
counting rules and different national GAAP . An 
increasing number of the Eurosystem’s central 
banks are participating in CoCAS as users. The 
system is therefore facilitating the harmonisa -
tion of statistical model- based credit analysis 
within the Eurosystem.In addition, it is important to ensure that the 
various procedures are further improved and 
that current developments such as the mod -
ernisation of accounting law, the electronic 
submission of annual accounts, the definition 
of default and the modernisation of credit 
registers are taken into account. Finally, the 
OeNB and the Bundesbank also strive to draw 
on current developments in theoretical model 
research on an ongoing basis.Deutsche Bundesbank
