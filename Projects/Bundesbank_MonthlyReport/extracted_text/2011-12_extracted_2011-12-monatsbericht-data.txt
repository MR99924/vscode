CommentariesEconomic conditions
Underlying trends
according 	to	the	available 	indicators, 	Ger-
man	economic 	activity 	clearly 	slowed 	down 	
at	the	beginning 	of	the	fourth 	quarter. 	indus-
trial	output 	in	October 	was	noticeably 	down 	
on	the	average 	level	of	the	third 	quarter 	and	
there 	was	a	sharp 	decline 	in	exports. 	 also,	
sentiment 	in	the	services 	sector 	deteriorated 	
somewhat, 	whereas 	construction 	activity 	
proved 	to	be	quite 	robust. 	The	same 	is	also	
true	of	private 	consumption, 	which 	is	bene -
fiting 	from 	the	ongoing 	favourable 	labour 	
market 	situation. 	 industrial 	new	orders 	in	
	October 	more 	than 	made 	up	for	the	sharp 	
seasonally 	adjusted 	decline 	recorded 	in	the	
previous 	month. 	This,	along 	with	the	slightly 	
improved 	sentiment 	in	trade 	and	industry 	in	
november, 	suggests 	that	the	economic 	dip	in	
the	fourth 	quarter 	is	not	likely 	to	be	espe -
cially 	deep.
Industry
industrial 	output 	rose	perceptibly 	in	October 	
by	a	seasonally 	adjusted 	¾%	compared 	with	
September. 	even	so,	it	was	still	down 	1¼% 	
on	the	average 	level	of	the	third 	quarter. 	
Manufacturers 	of	intermediate 	goods, 	in	par-
ticular, 	cut	back 	their 	production 	compared 	
with	the	third 	quarter, 	while 	capital 	goods 	
output 	was	scaled 	back 	only	slightly.
Demand 	for	industrial 	goods 	grew 	exception-
ally	sharply 	in	October 	by	a	seasonally 	ad-
justed 	5¼% 	on	the	month. 	The	average 	level

This	rise	in	new	orders 	compared 	with	the	
third 	quarter 	was	due	almost 	exclusively 	to	a	
higher 	level	of	orders 	from 	non-euro-area 	
countries 	(+7%). 	 by	contrast, 	orders 	from 	
euro-area 	countries 	remained 	virtually 	un-
changed 	(+¼%) 	and	domestic 	orders 	fell	by	
1¾%. 	On	balance, 	orders 	of	capital 	goods 	
went 	up	by	4%,	while 	intermediate 	goods 	
showed 	a	2%	decline.
There 	was	a	slight 	rise	in	both 	domestic 	and	
foreign 	sales 	of	German 	industrial 	goods 	in	
October 	compared 	with	September. 	 how-
ever,	the	average 	turnover 	of	the	third 	quar-
ter	could 	not	be	maintained 	in	seasonally 	ad-
justed 	terms 	(-1 %). 	The	decline 	was	more 	
pronounced 	in	intermediate 	goods 	than 	it	
was	in	capital 	goods. 	There 	was	a	sharp 	
month-on-month 	decline 	in	October 	in	the	
seasonally 	adjusted 	value 	of	exported 	goods, 	
which 	meant 	that	it	was	also	well	down 	on	
the	level	of	the	third 	quarter.
Construction
construction 	output 	in	October 	held	up	well	
at	the	high	level	of	the	previous 	month. 	com-
pared 	with	the	average 	of	the	preceding 	
quarter, 	there 	was	a	slight 	decline 	of	1 %	in	
seasonally 	adjusted 	terms. 	building 	construc-
tion	and	civil	engineering 	were 	affected 	in	
equal 	measure. 	construction 	orders 	in	Sep-
tember 	–	more 	recent 	data	are	unavailable 	at	
present – 	were 	perceptibly 	lower 	than	in	the	
previous 	month 	with	a	decline 	of	2¾%. 	The	
losses 	in	building 	construction 	were 	larger 	
than	in	civil	engineering. 	in	the	third 	quarter, 	
orders 	declined 	by	a	seasonally 	adjusted 	1 %	
compared 	with	the	second 	quarter.Moderate rise

Labour market
The	upward	 trend	 in	the	labour	 market	 con-
tinued 	into	the	fourth 	quarter. 	according 	to	
the	provisional 	figures 	of	the	Federal 	Statis -
tical	 Office,	 the	number	 of	persons	 in	work	 in	
Germany 	in	October 	went 	up	perceptibly 	by	
a	seasonally	 adjusted	 26,000	 on	the	month.	
compared	 with	 the	previous	 year,	 there	 was	
an	increase 	of	477,000, 	or	1.2%. 	The	per-
centage	 of	persons	 in	jobs	 subject	 to	full	so-
cial	security 	contributions 	showed 	a	further	
increase.	y ear-on-year	 job	growth	 in	Septem-
ber	amounted	 to	698,000,	 or	2.5%.	accord-
ing	to	the	ifo	 employment	 barometer,	 enter -
prises’ 	willingness 	to	recruit 	new	staff	in-
creased 	from 	a	high	level	in	november 	and	
the	Federal 	employment 	agency’s 	job	index	
also	indicated	 an	improvement.
in	november,	 the	official	 unemployment	 fig-
ure	fell	by	a	seasonally 	adjusted 	20,000	
to	2.91	million. 	The	seasonally 	adjusted 	un-
employment	 rate	 (using	 the	Federal	employ-
ment 	 agency’s 	definition) 	fell	to	6.9%. 	 in	
contrast 	to	the	preceding 	six	months, 	there	
was	 a	noticeable	 drop	 in	the	number	 of	un-
employed 	persons 	claiming 	insurance 	bene -
fits	in	the	month 	under 	review. 	The	gradual	
improvement 	in	the	number 	of	longer-term	
job	seekers	 receiving	 the	basic	 welfare	 allow-
ance 	continued. 	Total 	underemployment 	as	
recorded 	by	the	Federal 	labour 	agency 	fell	
a  great 	deal	more 	on	the	year	(-499,000	
	persons) 	than 	registered 	unemployment	
(-214,000	 persons)	 as	the	labour	 market	 pol-
icy	measures 	had	been 	scaled 	back 	signifi -
cantly 	owing 	to	the	improved 	employment	
situation.Prices
The	price 	for	a	barrel 	of	brent	crude 	oil	has	
been	 characterised	 by	a	sideways	 movement	
since 	 august, 	albeit 	with	noticeable 	fluctu -
ations. 	 at	 uS$110 	in	 november, 	it	was	up	
uS$2	on	the	level	of	the	previous 	month. 	it	
fell	again 	perceptibly 	in	the	first	half	of	De-
cember, 	however. 	 as	this	report 	went 	to	
press, 	the	price 	for	crude 	oil	stood 	at	
uS$104½.	prices	 for	future	 deliveries	 of	crude	
oil	were	 being	 quoted	 at	discounts	 across	 the	
entire	 maturity	 range;	uS$2½	 and	uS$4	 were	
being 	charged 	for	six-month 	and	12-month	
deliveries	 respectively.
imports 	in	October 	were 	a	seasonally 	ad-
justed	 0.2%	 cheaper	 than	 in	September.	en-
ergy	prices 	went 	up	by	2.0% 	despite 	the	
slight 	decline 	in	crude 	oil	prices. 	This,	how-
ever,	 was	more	 than	 offset	 by	the	perceptible	
drop 	of	0.4% 	in	the	prices 	of	industrial	
goods. 	The	same 	pattern 	can	also	be	ob-
served 	in	the	case	of	domestic 	products, 	al-
beit	at	a	lower	 amplitude,	 with	 energy	 prices	
rising 	by	0.7%, 	while 	the	price 	of	industrial	
goods 	fell	by	0.2%. 	On	balance, 	seasonally	
adjusted 	producer 	prices 	remained 	at	the	
same 	level	as	in	the	previous 	month. 	The	
year-on-year 	figure 	went 	down 	marginally	
to	6.8%	for	import	prices	and	to	5.3%	in	the	
case	 of	domestic	 producer	 prices.
consumer 	prices 	went 	up	by	a	seasonally	
	adjusted 	0.2% 	in	november 	compared 	with	
October. 	 in	the	energy 	sector, 	the	price 	re-
ductions	 in	the	case	 of	fuel	 were	 more	 than	
offset	 by	the	price	 rises	 for	heating	 oil.	Food

Statutory health insurance scheme
The	statutory 	health 	insurance 	scheme 	as	a	
whole 	posted 	a	surplus 	of	€2½	billion 	in	the	
third 	quarter 	of	2011. 	Of	this	amount, 	the	
health 	insurance 	institutions 	accounted 	for	
€1½	billion 	and	the	health 	insurance 	fund 	for	
€1	billion. 	This	constitutes 	an	overall 	year-on-
year	improvement 	of	just	over	€1½	billion, 	
which 	was	mainly 	attributable 	to	the	insur -
ance 	institutions. 	The	statutory 	health 	insur -
ance 	scheme’s 	revenue 	increased 	by	5½%, 	
while 	expenditure 	rose	much 	less	sharply, 	by	
just	under 	2%.
The	health 	insurance 	fund’s 	payments 	to	the	
health 	insurance 	institutions, 	which 	are	fixed 	
in	advance, 	increased 	by	5%.	additional 	con-
tributions 	charged 	by	individual 	institutions 	
played 	a	negligible 	role,	and	actually 	fell	
slightly 	year	on	year.	by	contrast, 	the	twelve-
month 	rise	in	the	health 	insurance 	institu -
tions’ 	spending 	in	the	third 	quarter, 	at	just	
under 	2%,	again 	remained 	significantly 	be-
low	the	estimates 	for	the	year	as	a	whole 	
(around 	4%). 	in	particular, 	spending 	on	phar-
maceuticals 	continued 	its	steep 	decline 	
(-4½%) 	as	manufacturers 	granted 	higher 	dis-
counts 	on	pharmaceuticals 	that	are	not	sub-
ject	to	the	fixed-amount 	regulation 	from 	au-gust	2010 	onwards 	and	discount 	agreements 	
enabled 	the	institutions 	to	make 	sizeable 	cost	
savings. 	by	contrast, 	growth 	in	spending 	on	
hospital 	treatment 	(almost 	3½%) 	was	above 	
average. 	Outlays 	on	sickness 	benefit 	climbed 	
by	as	much 	as	8½%. 	in	the	first	three 	quar-
ters	taken 	together, 	the	health 	insurance 	in-
stitutions 	posted 	a	cumulative 	surplus 	of	€4	
billion. 	 a	very	similar 	surplus 	could 	be	re-
corded 	for	the	year	as	whole, 	since 	expendi-
ture	in	the	final	quarter 	is	usually 	above 	aver-
age,	whereas 	the	institutions’ 	income 	from 	
the	health 	insurance 	fund 	remains 	constant.
The	health 	insurance 	fund’s 	revenue 	in-
creased 	by	just	over	5½%, 	particularly 	as	a	
result 	of	the	increase 	in	the	general 	contribu-
tion	rate	(from 	14.9% 	to	15.5% 	on	1 January 	
2011) 	but	also	because 	of	the	favourable 	de-
velopments 	in	wages 	subject 	to	compulsory 	
insurance 	contributions 	and	in	employment. 	
contribution 	receipts 	went 	up	by	almost 	
6½% 	in	the	third 	quarter. 	Their 	growth 	after 	
adjustment 	for	the	raising 	of	the	contribution 	
rate	came 	to	just	over	2%,	dampened 	by	the	
fact	that	the	rise	in	employment 	was	offset 	
by	a	sharp 	decline 	in	the	number 	of	unem -
ployed 	persons 	and	short-time 	workers. 	 in	
addition, 	total	pension 	payments 	subject 	to	
compulsory 	insurance 	contributions 	increased 	
only	slightly, 	since 	the	pension 	adjustment 	of	
1 %	in	mid-2011 	was	below 	aggregate 	wage

the	number	 of	pensioners	 roughly	 stagnated.	
by	contrast, 	payments 	to	the	fund 	from 	the	
central 	government 	budget 	were 	down 	on	
the	year. 	From 	January 	to	September, 	the	
health	 insurance	 fund	 posted	 a	surplus	 of	just	
under 	€1½	billion 	as	actual 	contribution 	in-
flows 	were 	significantly 	above 	the	planned	
figure. 	Given 	that	monthly 	transfers 	to	the	
health	 insurance	 institutions	 will	remain	 con-
stant, 	the	surplus 	will	increase 	sharply 	to-
wards	 the	end	of	the	year	 owing	 to	contribu-
tions	 paid	 on	seasonal	 bonuses.
The	statutory 	health 	insurance 	scheme 	as	a	
whole	 looks	 likely	 to	record	 a	very	 large	 sur-
plus	 for	2011.	consequently,	 most	 health	 in-
surance	 institutions	 and	the	health	 insurance	
fund 	will	probably 	be	able	to	substantially	
boost 	their	reserves. 	although 	the	cut	of	al-
most	 €1½	 billion	 in	transfers	 from	 the	central	
government	 budget	 and	less	subdued	 spend-
ing	on	pharmaceuticals 	will	probably 	cause	
the	financial	 situation	 to	worsen	 in	the	com-
ing	year,	 this	autumn	 the	group	 of	statutory	
health	 insurance	 estimators	 forecast	 a	largely	
balanced 	budget 	for	2012. 	This	prediction	
seems	 plausible	 for	the	health	 insurance	 fund	
provided 	that	the	revenue 	base 	does 	not	
come 	under 	pressure 	owing 	to	a	sharper-
than-expected 	slowdown 	in	economic	
growth.	as	 things	 stand,	 however,	 the	statu-
tory	health 	insurance 	institutions 	look	likely	
to	record 	another 	surplus, 	albeit 	a	smaller	
one,	as	the	expenditure 	estimate 	was	based	
on	what 	was	probably 	a	noticeably 	over-
stated	 value	 for	2011	 and	the	transfers	 from	
the	health 	insurance 	fund 	calculated 	on	this	
basis 	have 	already 	been 	fixed. 	provided 	that	
the	high	expenditure 	appropriations 	do	not	prove	 too	much	 of	a	temptation,	 more	 of	the	
additional 	contributions 	charged 	by	individ -
ual	institutions	 could	 be	revoked.
Public long-term care insurance scheme

growth, 	while 	the	rise	in	spending 	on	institu-

September, 	liquid 	reserves 	stood 	at	€5	billion

minimum 	requirement 	of	half	of	a	month’s

crease 	in	benefit 	rates 	(by	an	average 	of	just	
under 	2%)	will	take	place 	at	the	beginning 	of	
2012. 	This	is	to	be	followed 	by	adjustments

Government 	has	decided 	upon 	the	main 	ele-
ments 	of	a	plan	to	expand 	nursing 	benefits,

Mutual funds
Domestic 	mutual 	funds 	sold	shares 	totalling 	
€5.2	billion 	net	in	the	reporting 	month 	(€0.7 	
billion 	in	the	previous 	month). 	On	balance, 	
fresh 	funds 	were 	mainly 	injected 	into	special-
ised	funds 	reserved 	for	institutional 	investors 	
(€4.8 	billion). 	among 	the	mutual 	funds 	open 	
to	the	general 	public, 	almost 	only	equity-
based 	funds 	recorded 	inflows 	(€0.5 	billion). 	
During 	the	reporting 	month, 	foreign 	funds 	
traded 	in	the	German 	market 	sold	shares 	to	
the	tune	of	€0.1	billion. 	On	balance, 	foreign 	
investors 	featured 	prominently 	as	purchasers, 	
as	did	domestic 	non-banks 	in	particular, 	
adding 	shares 	totalling 	€1.1	billion 	and	€4.5	
billion 	respectively 	to	their	portfolios. 	by	con-
trast, 	domestic 	credit 	institutions 	sold	fund 	
shares 	worth 	€0.3	billion.
Balance of payments
The	German 	current 	account 	recorded 	a	sur-
plus	–	in	unadjusted 	terms 	–	of	€10.3 	billion 	
in	October 	2011. 	The	result 	was	€5.7	billion 	
down 	on	the	level	of	the	previous 	month. 	
This	was	attributable 	both 	to	a	lower 	trade 	
surplus 	and	to	a	smaller 	surplus 	on	invisible 	
current 	transactions, 	which 	comprise 	ser-
vices, 	income 	and	current 	transfers.
according 	to	provisional 	calculations 	by	the	
Federal 	Statistical 	Office, 	in	October 	the	for-
eign	trade 	surplus 	was	down 	by	€5.7	billion 	
on	the	month 	to	€11.6 	billion. 	after	adjust -
ment 	for	seasonal 	and	calendar 	effects, 	it	de-
creased 	by	€2.5	billion 	to	€12.6 	billion. 	The	
value 	of	exports 	fell	by	3.6% 	while 	the	value 	of	imports 	dropped 	by	1.0%. 	compared 	with	
the	third-quarter 	average, 	seasonally 	adjusted 	
nominal 	exports 	fell	by	2.0% 	and	imports 	by	
1.4%. 	price	effects 	played 	almost 	no	role	in	
this	development.
invisible 	current 	transactions 	posted 	a	slight 	
surplus 	of	€0.4	billion 	in	October, 	compared 	
with	a	gain	of	€1.2	billion 	in	September. 	all	
three 	sub-accounts 	contributed 	to	the	de-
cline. 	after	a	largely 	balanced 	position 	in	the	
previous 	month, 	the	services 	sub-account 	re-
corded 	a	deficit 	of	€0.5 	billion. 	This	was	
mainly 	due	to	a	decline 	in	receipts 	from 	mer-
chanting 	trade. 	The	deficit 	in	current 	trans -
fers	grew 	by	€0.3	billion 	to	€3.6	billion. 	The	
surplus 	in	cross-border 	income 	fell	slightly 	
and	stood 	at	around 	€4.5	billion 	in	the	period 	
under 	review.
cross-border 	portfolio 	investment 	generated 	
net	capital 	exports 	in	October 	again 	(€15.9 	
billion, 	compared 	with	€7.4	billion 	in	Septem-
ber).	This	was	mainly 	due	to	the	fact	that	for-
eign	investors 	sold	German 	securities 	worth 	
€15.1 	billion. 	as	in	the	previous 	month, 	the	
portfolio 	reduction 	centred 	on	debt	securities 	
(€17.4 	billion). 	They 	mainly 	sold	bonds 	and	
notes 	(	€13.2 	billion), 	especially 	private 	secur -
ities,	and	money 	market 	paper. 	by	contrast, 	
they	purchased 	shares 	and	mutual 	fund 	
shares 	for	a	total	of	€2.3	billion 	in	Germany. 	
Domestic 	investors, 	however, 	showed 	inter-
est,	albeit 	limited, 	in	foreign 	paper 	(€0.8 	bil-
lion). 	This	largely 	benefited 	foreign 	shares.
in	October, 	direct 	investment 	resulted 	in	net	
capital 	exports 	(€5.2 	billion), 	whereas 	inflows 	
had	been 	recorded 	in	September 	(€2.4 	bil-Mutual funds

lion). 	The	turnaround 	can	be	attributed, 	for	
one	thing, 	to	the	fact	that	domestic 	enter -
prises 	provided 	their 	foreign 	affiliates 	with	
more	 capital	 (€9.1	 billion	 after	 €4.3	 billion	 in	
September). 	This	occurred 	mainly 	via	intra-
group 	loans 	(€7.3 	billion). 	Moreover, 	re-
invested	 earnings	 led	to	an	increase	 in	capital	
in	the	branches 	(€3.7 	billion). 	For	another	
thing,	 foreign	 enterprises	 provided	 their	 Ger-
man	subsidiaries 	with	fewer 	funds 	(€3.9 	bil-
lion	after 	€6.7	billion). 	 here,	intra-group	
loans 	and	reinvested 	earnings 	played 	an	im-
portant	 role.

counter 	to	the	overall 	trend, 	however, 	non-
banks 	recorded 	net	outflows 	(€9.0 	billion).	
This	was	primarily 	due	to	enterprises 	and	
households 	(€10.8 	billion) 	that	redeemed	
short-term 	financial 	loans 	in	particular. 	The	
banking	 system	 saw	 capital	 imports	 totalling

flows 	of	funds 	(€40.6 	billion). 	They 	reduced	
receivables 	from 	financial 	loans 	to	non-
residents 	and	simultaneously 	increased 	their	
borrowing 	abroad. 	Moreover, 	foreign 	busi-
ness	 partners	 increased	 their	 deposits.	 While	
banks 	experienced 	capital 	inflows, 	the	bun-

Outlook for the German economy –  
macroeconomic projections for 2012 and 2013
The	crisis 	in	public 	finances 	in	a	number 	of	euro-area 	countries, 	the	ensuing 	uncertainty 	as	well	
as	the	general 	economic 	slowdown 	are	placing 	a	strain 	on	economic 	activity 	in	Germany. 	
	 although 	the	domestic 	conditions 	for	an	extended 	and	broadly 	based 	upturn 	in	Germany 	re-
main 	intact, 	its	high	degree 	of	openness 	means 	that	demand 	impulses 	from 	the	main 	sales 	mar-
kets	abroad 	are	of	major 	importance 	for	the	German 	economy.
Following 	a	3.0% 	rise	in	economic 	output 	in	the	current 	year,	the	pace 	of	expansion 	in	Germany 	
is	likely 	to	fall	perceptibly 	to	0.6% 	in	2012 	as	a	result 	of	a	lean	period 	during 	the	winter 	months. 	
This	forecast 	assumes 	that	there 	will	be	no	further 	significant 	escalation 	of	the	sovereign 	debt	
crisis. 	instead, 	the	baseline 	scenario 	is	predicated 	on	investors’ 	and	consumers’ 	uncertainty 	grad-
ually	receding 	somewhat. 	The	German 	economy 	could 	then	return 	to	a	sound 	growth 	path	in	
the	course 	of	next	year,	based 	on	a	continuing 	expansionary 	monetary 	policy 	and	faster 	global 	
economic 	growth. 	under	these 	conditions, 	gross 	domestic 	product 	(GDp)	could 	grow 	by	1.8% 	
in	2013. 	Given 	an	estimated 	potential 	growth 	of	1¼% 	per	year, 	this	means 	that	the	German 	
economy 	would 	be	operating, 	by	and	large, 	at	normal 	capacity 	over	the	entire 	forecast 	horizon.
consumer 	prices 	have 	risen 	sharply 	in	the	current 	year	in	line	with	the	quite 	dynamic 	global 	and	
domestic 	activity. 	On	an	annual 	average, 	the	cost	of	living 	is	likely 	to	go	up	by	2.5% 	on	the	year.	
For	the	two	following 	years, 	noticeably 	lower 	rates 	of	inflation 	of	1.8% 	and	1.5% 	respectively 	
are	likely. 	First, 	the	rise	in	the	cost	of	imported 	goods, 	especially 	for	energy, 	should 	remain 	within 	
narrow 	bounds. 	Second, 	domestic 	price 	pressure 	is	likely 	to	increase 	only	moderately.
uncertainty 	about 	future 	economic 	developments 	is	extremely 	high	at	present. 	if	the	scheduled 	
reforms 	succeed 	in	overcoming 	the	fiscal 	crisis 	and	in	allaying 	investors’ 	caution 	in	the	near	fu-
ture, 	growth 	in	Germany 	might 	be	higher 	over	the	medium 	term 	than	outlined 	here. 	neverthe-
less,	greater 	weight 	should 	be	attached 	to	the	downside 	risks	stemming 	from 	the	sovereign 	debt	
crisis.DEUTSCHE

Current situation
in	line	with	the	expectations 	of	the	June	pro-
jection, 	the	German 	economy 	continued 	to	
pick	up	in	the	second 	and	third 	quarters 	of	
2011. 	 a	0.3% 	increase 	in	overall 	economic 	
output 	in	the	second 	quarter 	was	followed 	
by	growth 	of	0.5% 	in	the	third 	quarter. 	The	
comparatively 	weak 	second 	quarter 	has	to	be	
seen	in	connection 	with	the	preceding 	three-
month 	period, 	in	which 	GDp	growth 	of	1.3% 	
had	been 	achieved 	owing 	in	part	to	catching-
up	and	backlog 	effects 	vis-à-vis 	the	final	
quarter 	of	2010. 	Sharply 	expanding 	exports 	
to	non-euro-area 	countries 	were 	the	main 	
driving 	force 	behind 	the	cyclical 	upswing 	in	
the	second 	and	third 	quarters 	of	2011. 	There 	
was	a	further 	clear 	increase 	in	exports 	to	
other 	euro-area 	countries 	as	well. 	 positive 	
corporate 	sentiment 	that	lasted 	well	into	the	
summer 	and	the	high	utilisation 	of	industrial 	
capacity 	gave 	impetus 	to	investment. 	Spend-
ing	on	new	machinery 	and	equipment 	con-
tinued 	to	rise,	and	construction 	investment 	
largely 	held	up	at	the	level	of	the	first	quarter 	
of	2011, 	which 	had	been 	heightened 	by	
catching-up 	effects. 	 by	contrast, 	there 	was	
only	subdued 	growth 	in	private 	consumption 	
after 	what 	was,	admittedly, 	a	strong 	rise	in	
the	final	quarter 	of	2010 	and	the	first	three 	
months 	of	2011.
The	situation 	in	the	labour 	market 	continued 	
to	improve 	in	the	wake 	of	the	upturn 	in	eco-
nomic 	activity. 	The	unemployment 	rate, 	as	
defined 	by	the	Federal 	employment 	agency, 	
has	recently 	fallen 	to	6.9%, 	thus	reaching 	its	
lowest 	level	since 	German 	reunification. 	This	
was	due	to	rising 	employment, 	which 	went 	up	by	385,000, 	or	0.9%, 	in	seasonally 	ad-
justed 	terms 	in	the	first	three 	quarters 	of	
2011. 	 in	most 	cases, 	jobs	subject 	to	social 	
contributions 	were 	created. 	in	terms 	of	num-
bers, 	employment 	growth 	in	manufacturing, 	
business-related 	services 	(excluding 	tempor -
ary	employment) 	and	health 	and	social 	ser-
vices 	was	most 	important. 	Since 	the	begin -
ning	of	the	second 	quarter, 	there 	have 	been 	
scarcely 	any	further 	gains 	to	be	recorded 	in	
temporary 	employment, 	which 	had	under -
gone 	sharp 	expansion 	in	an	earlier 	phase 	of	
the	recovery.
The	fact	that	the	number 	of	unemployed 	in	
the	insurance 	system 	has	been 	stagnating 	for	
some 	months 	suggests 	that	the	reserves 	for	
recruitment 	from 	within 	this	group 	are	largely 	
exhausted. 	Further 	perceptible 	gains 	in	em-
ployment 	are	likely 	to	be	achievable 	only	by	a	
reduction 	in	structural 	unemployment, 	an	in-
crease 	in	labour 	market 	participation 	and	
more 	immigration. 	according 	to	the	available 	
information, 	immigration 	has	been 	subdued 	
so	far	following 	the	complete 	opening 	of	
borders 	with	a	number 	of	eu	partner 	coun -
tries	in	central 	and	eastern 	europe. 	neverthe-
less,	it	seems 	quite 	plausible 	to	assume 	that, 	
in	time, 	the	–	by	international 	comparison 	−	
favourable 	employment 	and	income 	oppor -
tunities 	that	exist	in	Germany 	will	be	reflected 	
in	the	migration 	movements.
While 	the	rise	in	negotiated 	earnings 	in	the

what 	weaker 	than	expected, 	the	increase 	in

Major assumptions1
There 	is	likely 	to	be	no	more 	than	a	subdued 	
expansion 	of	the	global 	economy 	in	the	final	
quarter 	of	2011 	and	the	first	quarter 	of	2012. 	
a	part	in	this	is	played 	by	the	more 	restrictive 	
monetary 	and	fiscal 	policies 	embarked 	on	in	
a	number 	of	emerging 	market 	economies, 	
which, 	in	many 	cases, 	are	also	intended 	to	
counteract 	signs 	of	overheating. 	 economic 	
activity 	in	the	euro	area	is	being 	dampened, 	
in	particular, 	by	the	sovereign 	debt	crisis 	as	
well	as	the	necessary 	structural 	adjustments. 	
in	the	second 	half	of	next	year, 	the	pace 	of	
global 	expansion 	might 	pick	up	again 	pro-
vided 	–	as	is	assumed 	in	the	present 	projec -tion	–	that	there 	are	no	negative 	shocks, 	say,	
in	connection 	with	the	euro-area 	sovereign 	
debt	crisis, 	that	trigger 	further 	losses 	of	con-
fidence.
Overall, 	global 	economic 	growth 	in	the	next	
two	years 	is	likely 	to	be	3½% 	and	just	over	
4%	respectively. 	 it	may	be	expected, 	how-
ever,	that	the	moderation 	in	the	case	of	the	
euro-area 	trading 	partners 	will	be	more 	pro-
nounced 	and	that	the	ensuing 	recovery 	will	
progress 	more 	slowly 	than	in	most 	other 	in-
dustrial 	countries. 	Owing 	to	their	close 	eco-
nomic 	links	with	the	euro	area, 	this	is	likely 	to

ing	partners 	quite 	strongly, 	too.	uS	economic 	
growth 	will	probably 	remain 	moderate 	over	
the	next	few	years. 	Structural 	factors, 	such	as	
adjustments 	in	the	real	estate 	markets, 	are	
likely 	to	continue 	dampening 	the	recovery. 	
added 	to	this	is	the	discontinuation 	of	fiscal 	
measures, 	which 	have 	thus	far	supported 	
economic 	activity. 	 in	the	emerging 	market 	
economies 	of	South 	and	 east	 asia,	whose 	
markets 	have 	become 	considerably 	more 	im-
portant 	for	German 	exporters 	over	the	past	
few	years, 	the	current 	slowdown 	is	likely 	to	
be	overcome 	as	soon 	as	the	beginning 	of	
next	year.
in	line	with	the	global 	growth 	profile, 	the	ex-
pansion 	of	world 	trade 	is	likely 	to	slow	down 	
to	5½% 	next	year,	but	then	pick	up	again 	to	
more 	than	7%	in	2013. 	German 	exporters 	are	likely 	to	feel	the	weak 	demand 	in	 europe 	
keenly. 	 in	the	coming 	year, 	growth 	in	their 	
sales 	markets, 	at	3½%, 	might 	therefore 	be	
noticeably 	more 	subdued 	than 	in	the	two	
years 	before. 	This	constitutes 	a	downward 	
	revision 	of	more 	than 	3	percentage 	points 	
compared 	with	the	June	projection. 	With 	the	
expected 	pick-up 	in	the	euro-area 	economy, 	
the	sales 	markets 	could 	then	grow 	by	6%	in	
2013.
The	euro 	was	trading 	at	 uS$1.36 	in	the	
period 	relevant 	to	the	derivation 	of	the	ex-
change 	rate	assumption. 	The	single 	currency 	
has	thus	depreciated 	by	around 	5%	against 	
the	uS	dollar 	since 	the	June	projection 	was	
finalised. 	Taking 	account 	of	changes 	in	its	
value 	against 	other 	currencies 	that	are	rele-
vant	to	foreign 	trade, 	the	depreciation 	of	the	
euro	averages 	2¼%.
Given 	a	continuing 	supply 	shortage 	owing 	to	
the	developments 	in	libya	and	reduced 	pro-
duction 	in	the	north	Sea,	crude 	oil	prices 	at	
times 	stood 	somewhat 	higher 	in	the	second 	
and	third 	quarters 	of	the	year	than	the	as-
sumptions 	of	the	June 	projection. 	Forward 	
prices, 	which 	are	relevant 	to	the	derivation 	of	
the	future 	oil	price 	path, 	continue 	to	point 	to	
a	steady 	decline, 	however. 	The	present 	pro-
jection 	therefore 	assumes 	a	crude 	oil	price 	of	
uS$109½ 	in	2012 	and	uS$104 	in	2013 	for	a	
barrel 	of	brent, 	compared 	with	uS$111½ 	on	
an	annual 	average 	in	2011. 	The	crude 	oil	
price 	for	2012 	is	thus	somewhat 	above 	the	
assumptions 	of	the	June 	projection. 	The

with	 their	 marked	 decline	 over	 the	course	 of	
this	year, 	they	reflect 	the	global 	moderation	
in	growth	 that	 has	already	 materialised	 and	is	
still	expected. 	On	an	annual 	average, 	this	
price 	reduction 	will	not	be	apparent 	until	
2012, 	when 	other 	commodity 	prices 	could	
fall	by	more	 than	 7%	after	 an	18%	 increase	
this	year.	 Other	 commodity	 prices	 in	2012	 are	
thus	10% 	lower 	than 	assumed 	in	the	June	
projection. 	 a	year-on-year 	increase 	of	just	
over	 4%	is	then	 assumed	 again	 for	2013.
The	escalation	 of	the	sovereign	 debt	 crisis	 in	
the	euro	area	has	interrupted 	the	expected	
normalisation	 of	short-term	 interest	 rates.	in	
the	June	 projection,	 a	steady	 rise	in	the	three-
month 	interest 	rate	on	unsecured 	transac -
tions 	on	the	interbank 	market 	was	assumed	
over	the	forecast 	horizon 	based 	on	market	
data. 	For	the	present 	projection, 	market 	ex-
pectations 	following 	the	policy 	rate	cut	in	
early 	november 	suggest 	a	further 	decline 	in	
2012, 	however, 	and	thus	a	markedly 	(110	
basis	 points)	 lower	 interest	 rate	level	 for	2012	
as	a	whole	 than	 in	the	June	 projection.	 On	an	
annual 	average, 	rates 	of	1.2% 	are	assumed	
for	2012	 and	1.4%	 for	2013,	 compared	 with	
1.4%	 in	2011.
Owing	 to	the	strong	 demand	 for	secure	 and	
liquid 	paper, 	the	yield 	on	German 	govern -
ment	 bonds	 with	 a	residual	 maturity	 of	nine	
to	ten	years	fell	 to	no	more	 than	 1.9%	 in	no-
vember.	nevertheless,	 it	is	assumed	 that,	 over	
the	next	 two	 years,	 there	 will	be	a	steady	 in-
crease 	from 	this	perceptibly 	reduced 	level	in	
comparison	 with	 the	June	 projection	 assump-
tions. 	Following 	2.6% 	on	average 	this	year	
(owing 	to	the	still	higher 	yields 	in	the	first	half	of	the	year), 	long-term 	interest 	rates 	of	
2.4% 	and	2.7% 	are	assumed 	for	2012 	and	
2013 	respectively. 	Much 	as	in	the	case	of	
short-term 	interest 	rates, 	the	level	in	the	
coming 	year	will	thus	be	significantly 	(120	
basis 	points) 	lower 	than 	was	assumed 	in	
June.
according	 to	the	bank	lending	 Survey,	 credit	
conditions 	tightened 	somewhat 	on	balance	
in	the	third 	quarter; 	however, 	the	surveyed	
banks 	intend 	to	leave 	their	credit 	standards	
largely 	unchanged 	over	the	next	three	
months. 	although 	the	balance 	of	responses	
about	 credit	 conditions	 in	the	autumn	 survey	
of	the	German 	 chamber 	of	 commerce	
(DihK)	 published	 in	October	 was	 negative,	 it	
did	show 	signs 	of	improvement. 	after	a	rise	
in	the	previous 	two	months, 	the	november	
ifo	credit	constraint 	indicator, 	too,	shows 	a	
fall	in	the	percentage	 of	enterprises	 reporting	
that	 banks	 were	 more	 restrictive	 in	their	 lend-
ing.	On	balance,	 the	survey	 results	 therefore	
give	no	indication 	that	credit 	standards 	will	
tighten	 considerably.	 These	 standards	 are	set	
to	remain	 relatively	 favourable	 over	 the	next	
two	 years,	 although	 it	will	not	quite	 be	pos-
sible	to	maintain 	the	current 	exceptionally

sidered 	significantly 	lower 	the	2011 	deficit, 	
whereas 	the	financial 	impact 	thereafter 	will	
be	limited 	(easing 	the	situation 	in	2012, 	
straining 	the	situation 	in	2013). 	With 	regard 	
to	social 	contributions, 	shortfalls 	as	a	result 	
of	a	reduction 	of	the	contribution 	rate	to	the	
pension 	insurance 	scheme 	(2012 	and	2013) 	
as	well	as	lower 	insolvency 	benefit 	contribu-
tions 	(suspension 	in	2011 	and	low	rate	in	the	
years 	thereafter) 	outweigh 	higher 	contribu -
tion	rates 	to	the	statutory 	health 	insurance 	
scheme, 	Federal 	employment 	agency 	(as	of	
2011) 	and	public 	long-term 	care	insurance 	
scheme 	(as	of	2013). 	by	contrast, 	in	terms 	of	
taxes, 	additional 	revenue 	is	recorded 	on	the	
whole, 	chiefly 	from 	indirect 	taxes3	but	also	
owing 	to	the	phasing 	out	of	more 	generous 	
depreciation 	allowances. 	On	the	expenditure 	
side, 	the	deficit-increasing 	assistance 	to	fi-
nancial 	institutions 	is	expected 	to	be	low	over	
the	forecast 	horizon 	(still	accounted 	for	just	
under 	1½% 	of	GDp	in	2010). 	 in	addition, 	
many 	expenditure-related 	economic 	support 	
measures 	are	gradually 	being 	phased 	out,	
and	spending 	is	dampened 	somewhat 	by	the	
central 	government’s 	consolidation 	package 	
and	moderate 	pension 	growth 	in	order 	to	
make 	up	for	previous 	deviations 	from 	the	
general 	formula. 	On	the	other 	hand, 	spend-
ing	increases 	have 	been 	agreed 	in	some 	areas 	
– most 	recently 	transport 	infrastructure 	and	
public 	long-term 	care	insurance.
Cyclical outlook4
Over 	the	course 	of	the	past	few	months, 	the	
cyclical 	outlook 	has	taken 	a	turn	for	the	worse, 	which 	means 	that	the	economic 	up-
turn	in	Germany 	is	not	likely 	to	continue 	for	
the	time	being. 	although 	no	longer 	quite 	as	
favourable 	as	in	the	past, 	enterprises 	still	con-
sider 	their 	economic 	situation 	to	be	good. 	
however, 	they	have, 	in	particular, 	notably 	
lowered 	their 	expectations 	of	further 	eco-
nomic 	growth. 	This	is	also	reflected 	in	the	
hard 	economic 	indicators. 	 after	another 	
sharp 	rise	in	the	volume 	of	new	orders 	for	
German 	industry 	in	the	second 	quarter 	of	
2011 	–	inter alia 	owing 	to	a	substantial 	num-
ber	of	large 	orders, 	especially 	in	other 	trans-
port	equipment 	–	the	third 	quarter 	saw	a	per-
ceptible 	decline. 	Despite 	the	pick-up 	in	orders 	
in	October, 	this	is	likely 	to	be	reflected 	in	in-
dustrial 	output 	in	the	final	quarter 	of	2011 	
and	the	first	quarter 	of	2012. 	Furthermore, 	
industrial 	output 	–	in	seasonally 	adjusted 	
terms 	–	was	significantly 	boosted 	in	the	third 	
quarter 	as	a	number 	of	automotive 	manufac-
turers 	forewent 	holiday 	plant 	shutdowns. 	as	
the	output 	figure 	for	October 	indicates, 	it	is	
unlikely 	that	this	elevated 	level	can	be	main-
tained. 	This	is	also	suggested 	by	a	decline 	in	
capacity 	utilisation 	in	the	industrial 	sector 	
from 	the	third 	to	the	fourth 	quarter 	of	2011 	
recorded 	in	the	ifo	surveys. 	by	contrast, 	con-Short-term

struction 	activity 	appears 	to	be	fairly 	robust	
and,	 as	things	 stand,	 a	number	 of	other	 eco-
nomic	 sectors	 will	probably	 feel	almost	 no	ef-
fect	from	 the	economic	 slowdown.	 Overall,	 a	
cyclical 	sideways 	movement 	is	expected 	for	
the	final	 quarter	 of	2011	 and	the	first	quarter	
of	2012.
in	line	with	eurosystem	 experts’	 assumptions	
about 	global 	economic 	developments 	and	
forecasts 	of	economic 	trends 	in	the	other	
euro-area	 countries,	 a	recovery	 is	expected	 to	
kick	 in	from	 the	second	 quarter	 of	2012	 on-
wards, 	which 	could 	gradually 	strengthen.	
This	is	based 	on	the	idea	that	the	fiscal 	and	
economic 	policy 	measures 	introduced 	in	a	
number 	of	partner 	countries 	are	likely 	to	
gradually	 alleviate	 investors’	 and	 consumers’	
uncertainty. 	 under 	this	condition 	–	paired	
with	 the	expansionary	 bias	 of	monetary	 pol-
icy	–	the	fourth-quarter 	GDp	growth 	rate	in	
Germany 	could 	total 	1.3% 	in	2012, 	rising	
to	2.0%	 in	2013.	 On	an	annual	 average,	 the	
calendar-adjusted 	increase 	in	economic 	out-
put	would	 thus	 be	0.8%	 in	2012	 and	1.9%	 in	
2013,	 compared	 with	 3.0%	 in	2011.	as	 there	
are	fewer	 potential	 working	 days	 in	2012	 and	
2013 	than	in	the	respective 	year	before, 	the	
unadjusted 	GDp	rate	would 	work 	out	at	
0.6%	 in	2012	 and	1.8%	 in	2013.	compared	
with	the	June 	forecast, 	this	represents 	a	
downward	 revision	 of	the	anticipated	 growth	
rate	by	1.2	percentage	 points	 for	2012.

of	products 	demanded 	globally 	will	thus	
probably 	no	longer 	be	as	favourable 	as	in	
2010 	and	2011, 	when 	there 	was	a	greater 	de-
mand 	for	high-quality 	intermediate 	and	cap-
ital	goods 	from 	international 	customers. 	On	
an	annual 	average, 	this	equates 	to	an	in-
crease 	in	real	exports 	of	3¼% 	(3¾% 	after 	
calendar 	adjustment) 	in	2012 	and	5¾% 	(6%	
after 	calendar 	adjustment) 	in	2013, 	after 	
growth 	of	8¼% 	in	2011.in	2012, 	enterprises 	are	not	expected 	to	in-
vest	in	machinery 	and	equipment 	to	the	ex-
tent	that	they	did	in	2010 	and	are	doing 	in	
2011. 	First, 	the	investment 	postponed 	in	the	
2009 	crisis 	year	has	probably 	now	been 	made 	
good. 	Second, 	the	somewhat 	slower 	pace 	of	
global 	demand 	is	reducing 	the	need 	to	invest 	
in	capacity 	extensions. 	nevertheless, 	growth 	
in	spending 	on	new	machinery 	and	equip -
ment, 	and	buildings 	in	2012 	and	2013 	is	
again 	likely 	to	significantly 	outpace 	that	in	
GDp.	 enterprises 	plan	to	raise 	their 	invest -
ment 	budgets, 	and	this	is	likely 	to	be	put	into	
practice 	in	the	scenario 	described 	here. 	 in	
addition, 	despite 	a	forecast 	rise	in	interest 	
rates, 	financing 	conditions 	for	German 	enter -
prises 	are,	on	the	whole, 	still	favourable.
Over 	the	forecast 	horizon, 	private 	housing 	
construction 	is	also	set	to	benefit 	from 	low	
financing 	costs 	and	the	assumed 	ongoing 	
uncertainty 	regarding 	alternative 	forms 	of	in-
vestment. 	The	resulting 	demand 	focuses 	
mainly 	on	apartments 	in	multi-storey 	blocks. 	
This	can	be	seen	in	the	statistics 	on	building 	
permits, 	which 	show 	that	the	number 	of	per-
mits	granted 	for	apartments 	in	multi-storey 	
blocks 	in	the	third 	quarter 	of	2011 	rose	by

baseline 	scenario, 	this	is	not	expected 	to	
change 	in	the	final	quarter 	of	2011 	and	the	
first	three	months	of	2012.	Thereafter,	the	in-
cipient 	economic 	recovery 	will	most 	likely	
mean 	that	stockbuilding 	no	longer 	has	a	
dampening	 impact	 on	economic	 growth.	 On	
an	annual	 average,	 changes	 in	inventories	 are	
thus	 likely	 to	make	 a	negative	 contribution	 to	
growth	 in	2012	 and	to	have	 a	predominantly	
neutral	 effect	 in	2013.
private 	consumption 	will	probably 	continue	
to	benefit 	from 	the	favourable 	situation 	on	
the	labour	 market	 and	from	 a	clear	 rise	in	in-
come. 	households’ 	disposable 	income 	could	
go	up	by	3¼% 	in	2011, 	and	2¾% 	in	both	
2012	 and	2013.	 This	is	due,	 first,	 to	a	percep-
tible	 rise	in	net	earnings,	 with	 tax	relief	 meas-
ures	 and	lower	 social	 contributions	 offsetting	
almost	 all	of	the	higher	 wage	 tax	burden	 re-
sulting	 from	 the	effects	 of	tax	progression	 in	
2012 	and	approximately 	50% 	thereof 	in	
2013. 	Second, 	income 	from 	entrepreneurial	
activity	 and	 capital	 is	likely	 to	again	 increase	
sharply. 	 after	a	decline 	in	monetary 	social	
benefits 	in	2011 	only	a	moderate 	rise	is	on	
the	cards 	for	2012 	and	2013 	–	in	particular	
due	to	continued 	favourable 	developments	
on	the	labour 	market. 	 in	the	scenario 	as-

restricted	 to	the	winter	 half-year	 2011-12	 and

Due	to	the	ever	greater 	international 	division 	
of	labour, 	growth 	in	imports 	will	probably 	
continue 	to	significantly 	outpace 	that	in	ag-
gregate 	demand 	over	the	forecast 	horizon. 	
With 	aggregate 	demand 	increasing 	by	1¾% 	
in	2012 	and	3¼% 	in	2013, 	imports 	of	goods 	
and	services 	could 	go	up	by	4¼% 	and	6½%, 	
respectively, 	after 	recording 	a	7½% 	increase 	
this	year.	This	means 	that	import 	growth 	will	
outstrip 	export 	growth 	for	the	next	two	
years, 	which 	is	mainly 	attributable 	to	fairly 	ro-
bust	domestic 	demand. 	The	contribution 	of	
net	trade 	to	GDp	growth 	would 	therefore 	be	
slightly 	negative 	in	2012 	and	neutral 	in	2013. 	
The	foreign 	trade 	balance 	(as	a	percentage 	of	
nominal 	GDp)	should 	see	only	a	minimal 	
change 	over	the	forecast 	horizon. 	The	cur-
rent	account 	surplus 	is	thus	expected 	to	total	
5¼% 	of	GDp	in	both 	2011 	and	2012, 	increas-
ing	to	5½% 	in	2013. 	it	would 	then 	still	be	
significantly 	below 	the	high	of	7½% 	in	2007.
now	that	working 	hours 	have 	returned 	to	
normal, 	the	impact 	of	the	sideways 	move -
ment 	in	economic 	activity 	in	the	fourth 	quar-
ter	of	2011 	and	the	first	quarter 	of	2012 	on	
the	labour 	market 	can	be	largely 	cushioned 	
using 	the	available 	flexible 	working 	time	ar-
rangements. 	no	notable 	decline 	in	employ -
ment 	is	expected, 	as	is	also	indicated 	by	sur-
veys	on	enterprises’ 	staffing 	plans. 	in	the	ser-
vices 	sector, 	especially 	health 	and	social 	ser-
vices, 	the	sustained 	positive 	trend 	in	
employment 	is	likely 	to	continue. 	however, 	
there 	could 	be	adjustments 	in	temporary 	em-
ployment, 	as	developments 	in	the	past	few	
months 	have 	already 	indicated. 	Given 	the	
usual 	lag	vis-à-vis 	macroeconomic 	activity, 	a	
slight 	increase 	in	employment 	is	to	be	ex-pected 	again 	from 	the	end	of	2012. 	On	an	
annual 	average 	for	2012, 	the	number 	of	em-
ployed 	persons 	could 	rise	by	0.3%, 	although 	
in	mathematical 	terms 	this	increase 	would 	
largely 	be	carried 	over	from 	2011. 	a	gain	of	
0.4% 	is	expected 	in	2013. 	Once 	again, 	the	
main 	source 	of	growth 	will	probably 	be	em-
ployment 	subject 	to	social 	contributions, 	
while 	the	number 	of	persons 	exclusively 	in	
low-paid 	part-time 	employment 	–	assuming 	
that	the	monthly 	wage 	ceiling 	for	this	cat-
egory 	remains 	at	€400 	–	is	unlikely 	to	see	
more 	than	a	marginal 	rise.
in	the	forecast 	period, 	developments 	in	un-
employment 	are	likely 	to	be	largely 	in	line	
with	employment 	trends. 	however, 	a	moder -
ate	increase 	in	labour 	supply 	is	likely 	to	curb	
the	decline 	in	unemployment 	somewhat, 	
with	a	slight 	rise	in	immigration 	and	a	further 	
(albeit 	small) 	rise	in	labour 	market 	participa -
tion	counteracting 	the	decrease 	in	the	do-
mestic 	labour 	force. 	On	an	annual 	average, 	
this	forecast 	expects 	the	official 	unemploy -
ment 	figure 	to	be	just	under 	3.0	million 	in	
2012. 	This	corresponds 	to	a	rate	of	7.0%. 	in	
2013, 	the	unemployment 	rate	could 	be	
0.2	percentage 	point 	lower 	and	the	number 	
of	unemployed 	persons 	may	stand 	at	2.9	mil-
lion.

particularly	 in	industry,	 on	the	one	hand	 and	
by	the	gloomier 	outlook 	for	2012 	on	the	
other.	all	 in	all,	growth	 in	negotiated	 wages	
will	therefore 	probably 	continue 	to	increase	
but	remain	 in	a	range	 that	 is	compatible	 with	
price 	stability. 	 based 	on	the	agreements	
signed	 to	date,	 an	increase	 of	1.7%	 is	to	be	
expected	 for	2011,	 followed	 by	2.4%	 in	2012	
and	2.6%	 in	2013.
The	resounding 	success 	experienced 	by	en-
terprises	 in	2010	 is	also	behind	 the	exception-
ally	strong 	wage 	drift, 	with	actual 	earnings	
rising 	far	faster 	(by	3.0%) 	than 	negotiated	
wages	 in	2011.	especially	 but	not	exclusively	
in	the	automotive 	industry, 	companies 	have	
allowed 	their 	employees 	to	partake 	in	their	
business 	success 	by	awarding 	them 	bonus	
payments. 	 although 	most 	enterprises 	will	
also	end	this	business 	year	on	a	successful	
note, 	bonuses 	may	be	somewhat 	smaller 	in	
future. 	 particularly 	in	the	metalworking 	in-
dustry, 	part	of	the	bonus 	payments 	in	2011	
can	probably	 be	viewed	 as	compensation	 for	
the	fact	that	a	wage 	agreement 	containing	
comparatively	 low	negotiated	 rates	 has	been	
in	force 	for	a	long	period 	of	time. 	in	effect,	
growth 	in	actual 	earnings 	in	2012 	could	
therefore	 be	somewhat	 weaker	 than	 in	nego-
tiated 	wages. 	 a	slightly 	positive 	wage 	drift	
would	 be	likely	 again	 in	2013.
Given	 a	somewhat	 smaller	 burden	 from	 em-
ployer 	social 	contributions, 	wage 	costs 	per	
employee 	are	likely 	to	increase 	by	1.9% 	in	
2012 	and	by	2.7% 	in	2013. 	The	pause 	in	
growth	 in	the	fourth	 quarter	 of	2011	 and	the	
first	quarter 	of	2012 	and	the	lag	in	labour	
market 	adjustment 	suggest 	that	productivity	gains	 will	be	low	next	 year.	unit	 labour	 costs	
are	thus	likely 	to	rise	considerably 	more	
sharply	 (by	1.5%)	 than	 in	2011.	as	 growth	 in	
productivity	 returns	 to	normal,	 the	increase	 in	
unit	labour	 costs	 will	weaken	 slightly	 to	1.3%	
in	2013.
Following 	the	discernible 	recovery 	of	profit	
margins 	in	2010, 	the	subdued 	pace 	of	eco-
nomic 	growth 	anticipated 	in	2012 	means	
that	 margins	 are	unlikely	 to	widen	 again	 be-
fore	2013.	 Measured	 by	the	GDp	 deflator,	 the	
prices 	of	domestically 	produced 	goods 	and	
services	 could	 go	up	by	just	over	 ¾%	 in	2011,	
by	1½%	 in	2012	 and	by	1¾%	 in	2013.
consumer	 price	 inflation	 has	probably	 passed	
its	peak 	and	is	likely 	to	weaken 	perceptibly	
over	 the	forecast	 horizon.	 On	an	annual	 aver-
age,	the	rate	of	inflation 	–	as	measured 	by	
the	 harmonised 	 index 	of	 consumer 	 prices	
(hicp)	 –	will	probably	 fall	significantly	 to	1.8%	
in	2012 	and	moderate 	somewhat 	further	
to	1.5%	 in	2013.	 The	main	 reason	 for	this	is	
the	smaller	 contribution	 from	 energy.	 Despite	
lagged 	adjustments 	to	gas	prices 	and	rising	
electricity 	prices, 	which 	are	probably 	mainly	
due	to	an	increase 	in	network 	charges, 	en-
ergy	 price	 inflation	 should	 initially	 fall	to	4%	
next	 year.	in	 2013,	 it	is	likely	 to	reach	 a	virtual	
standstill, 	at	0.5%. 	This	projection 	assumes	
that	 crude	 oil	prices	 will	decline	 over	 the	fore-
cast	 horizon.	 For	food,	 too,	 inflation	 is	likely	
to	gradually	 weaken	 in	line	with	 lower	 prices	
on	the	commodity 	markets. 	 however, 	this	
movement 	will	be	offset 	to	some 	extent 	by	
rising 	prices 	for	tobacco 	products. 	For	the	
other 	components 	(goods 	excluding 	energy,	
services), 	rising 	wages 	will	probably 	cause 	a	Strong growth

having 	increased 	very	sharply, 	reaching 	4.3% 	
in	2010, 	the	deficit 	ratio	in	Germany 	is	likely 	
to	fall	significantly 	to	around 	1 %	in	2011. 	The	
favourable 	economic 	developments 	for	the	
year	as	a	whole 	are	one	important 	factor 	in	
this	decline, 	and	the	cyclical 	component 	is	
now	likely 	to	be	positive 	overall. 	another 	fac-
tor	is	the	fact	that, 	as	in	previous 	upturns, 	tax	
revenue 	is	growing 	much 	more 	strongly 	than	
macroeconomic 	reference 	variables 	would 	
suggest. 	looking 	at	fiscal 	policy 	measures, 	it	is	currently 	expected 	that	the	very	high	cap-
ital	transfers 	to	support 	financial 	institutions 	
in	2010 	(just	under 	1½% 	of	GDp)	will	largely 	
cease 	to	be	a	factor. 	Furthermore, 	the	phas-
ing	out	of	parts 	of	the	economic 	stimulus 	
programmes, 	central 	government’s 	consoli -
dation 	package 	and	higher 	social 	contribu -
tion	rates 	will	ease	the	strain 	on	the	general 	
government 	budget.
in	combination 	with	the	relatively 	strong 	
nominal 	GDp	growth, 	the	steep 	fall	in	the	
deficit 	is	leading 	to	a	marked 	decline 	in	the	
debt	ratio, 	which 	had	risen 	sharply 	to	83.2% 	
by	the	end	of	2010. 	The	planned 	gradual 	re-
duction 	in	risk	assets 	and	the	associated 	li-
abilities 	taken 	on	by	the	government 	sector 	
to	support 	the	financial 	market 	could 	speed 	
up	this	debt	reduction, 	while 	additional 	as-
sistance 	to	individual 	euro-area 	countries 	
have 	the	opposite 	effect. 	all	in	all,	the	cur-
rent	government 	estimate 	of	a	debt	ratio	of	
around 	81 % 	at	the	end	of	2011 	appears 	
plausible, 	although 	this	is	subject 	to	consider -
able	uncertainty, 	not	least	in	connection 	with	
the	sovereign 	debt	crisis.
in	2012, 	the	deficit 	ratio	could 	remain 	virtu-
ally	unchanged 	given 	the	baseline 	forecast 	
for	macroeconomic 	conditions 	outlined 	
above. 	in	this	scenario, 	the	slowdown 	in	eco-
nomic 	activity 	would 	thus	lead	to	a	limited 	
increase 	in	the	deficit. 	 in	structural 	terms, 	
however, 	there 	could 	be	a	slight 	improve -
ment 	–	even 	though 	the	consolidation 	path	is

Risk assessment
The	baseline 	scenario 	in	this	forecast 	assumes 	
that	the	uncertainty 	caused 	by	the	sovereign 	
debt	crisis 	will	ebb	somewhat, 	but	that	cau-
tiousness 	among 	consumers 	and	investors, 	
which 	stems 	from 	a	deep 	feeling 	of	insecur -
ity,	will	not	be	fully	reversed. 	if	the	crisis 	can	
be	overcome 	more 	swiftly 	and	durably, 	eco-
nomic 	growth 	in	Germany 	could 	be	stronger 	
in	the	medium 	term 	than 	outlined 	in	this	
forecast. 	 a	further 	escalation 	of	the	sover -
eign	debt 	crisis 	would 	imply 	considerable 	downside 	risks, 	however. 	Furthermore, 	the	
pace 	of	economic 	growth 	in	several 	emer -
ging	market 	economies, 	which 	have 	recorded 	
exceptional 	growth 	rates 	in	recent 	years, 	
could 	level	off	to	a	greater 	extent. 	This	would 	
hit	Germany 	particularly 	hard	given 	its	de-
pendency 	on	exports.
crude	oil	prices 	and	exchange 	rates 	represent 	
the	main 	risks	to	price 	stability. 	Given 	the	
projected 	development 	in	global 	economic 	
activity, 	it	is	quite 	possible 	that	crude 	oil	
prices 	will	not	fall	significantly 	over	time, 	in-
stead 	remaining 	at	a	high	level. 	however, 	a	
more 	pronounced 	slowdown 	in	economic 	
growth 	in	some 	emerging 	market 	economies 	
could 	depress 	oil	prices 	more 	substantially.Risks to

German enterprises’ profitability and financing 
in 2010
German 	enterprises 	emerged 	strengthened 	from 	the	deep 	recession 	of	2009. 	Given 	that	domes-
tic	and	foreign 	demand 	made 	a	swift 	and	strong 	recovery, 	significant 	losses 	in	industrial 	produc-
tion	capacity 	were 	successfully 	avoided. 	it	would 	have 	been 	quite 	a	realistic 	prospect 	for	such	
losses 	to	occur 	considering 	the	strong 	economic 	downturn 	if	the	affected 	enterprises 	had	not	
taken 	–	in	cooperation 	with	employees, 	investors 	and	customers 	–	a	wide 	range 	of	precaution-
ary	measures 	in	order 	to	safeguard 	their	liquidity 	and	financial 	strength. 	in	light	of	the	strong 	
increase 	in	sales, 	enterprises 	managed 	to	return 	to	normal 	profitability 	in	2010 	and	thus	consid-
erably 	alleviated 	the	at	times 	strained 	balance 	sheets.
as	a	result 	of	business 	activity 	picking 	up	progressively, 	inventory 	levels 	as	well	as	short-term 	
receivables 	and	liabilities 	increased. 	in	addition, 	investment 	in	fixed 	assets 	were 	at	a	level	higher 	
than	necessary 	to	maintain 	stocks 	–	even 	in	economic 	sectors 	that	still	had	largely 	underutilised 	
capacity 	at	the	beginning 	of	the	reporting 	period. 	The	new	capital 	equipment 	was	mainly 	
	financed 	through 	the	cash	flow, 	which 	ballooned 	in	2010 	as	a	result 	of	the	extremely 	favourable 	
cost-earnings 	ratio. 	The	capital 	base	was	strengthened 	further 	through 	profit 	retention 	and	cap-
ital	injections, 	thereby 	reducing 	dependence 	on	bank 	loans. 	as	was	the	case	a	year	earlier, 	only	
short-term 	loan	contracts 	were 	scaled 	back, 	whereas 	long-term 	loans 	increased. 	consequently, 	
enterprises 	were 	able	to	move 	a	step	ahead 	in	the	direction 	of	financing 	the	basis 	for	production 	
through 	long-term 	equity. 	The	degree 	of	integration 	between 	enterprises 	rose	again 	after 	the	
upward 	trend 	had	been 	interrupted 	in	2008 	and	2009.
as	things 	currently 	stand, 	Germany 	has	a	healthy 	corporate 	base. 	in	good 	economic 	times, 	in-
cluding 	2010 	and	largely 	also	the	current 	year,	a	healthy 	corporate 	base	is	associated 	with	high	
profitability. 	in	a	difficult 	economic 	setting, 	however, 	resilience 	is	substantial. 	in	the	future, 	this	
ought 	to	provide 	assurance 	for	investments 	necessary 	to	preserve 	and	advance 	successful 	busi-
ness	models 	–	even 	at	less	favourable 	funding 	terms 	and	conditions.DEUTSCHE

Underlying trends
a	strong 	economic 	recovery 	took 	place 	in	
2010. 	real	gross 	domestic 	product 	(GDp)	was	
up	by	3.7% 	on	average 	over	the	year	after 	it	
had	fallen 	by	5.1 % 	in	2009 	as	a	result 	of	the	
financial 	and	economic 	crisis. 	The	swift 	
pick-up 	in	business 	activity 	enabled 	many 	en-
terprises 	to	gradually 	scale 	back 	the	provi -
sions 	for	securing 	their	sustainability 	and	li-
quidity 	made 	during 	the	deep 	recession 	
amidst 	exceptionally 	uncertain 	prospects. 	ac-
cording 	to	the	financial 	statements 	statistics,1	
inventories 	have 	been 	built	up	again 	consid-
erably 	and	short-term 	receivables 	and	liabil-
ities	increased 	significantly. 	by	contrast, 	the	
shift	from 	short-term 	bank 	loans 	to	longer-
term 	contracts 	continued. 	in	addition, 	enter -
prises 	once 	again 	strongly 	increased 	their 	
cash	resources. 	although 	the	reporting 	year’s 	
high	level	of	operating 	capital 	inflows 	is	re-
flected 	here, 	it	is	to	be	regarded 	as	evidence 	
of	a	persistently 	high	preference 	for	liquidity, 	
which, 	in	light	of	the	historically 	low	interest 	
rate	level, 	also	involved 	low	opportunity 	
costs.
The	basis 	for	the	return 	to	profitability 	was	
formed 	by	the	considerable 	increase 	in	sales. 	
in	2010, 	the	economic 	sectors 	captured 	in	
the	financial 	statements 	statistics 	were 	able	
to	recover, 	on	average, 	two-thirds 	of	the	de-
cline	which 	they	had	suffered 	in	the	preced-
ing	contractionary 	phase. 	it	was	not	only	the	
manufacturing 	sector 	and	its	large 	array 	of	
primarily 	export-oriented 	enterprises 	which 	
were 	affected 	by	this	extensive 	cyclical 	fluctu-
ation. 	The	bulk	of	the	services 	sector, 	particu-
larly	wholesale 	trade, 	logistics 	and	business 	services, 	experienced 	a	cyclical 	trough 	too	
which, 	however, 	was	not	nearly 	as	deep 	as	in	
important 	industrial 	sectors. 	by	contrast, 	con-
struction 	and	motor 	vehicle 	trade 	recorded 	a	
relatively 	stable 	business 	trend 	not	least	due	
to	the	economic 	stimulus 	packages 	of	2008 	
Q4-2009 	Q1.	During 	the	reporting 	period 	of	
2010, 	overall 	corporate 	earnings 	rose	sharply 	
and	exceeded 	the	level	reached 	in	2008, 	the	
year	in	which 	the	first	effects 	of	the	crisis 	
were 	already 	being 	felt.	The	pace 	of	recovery 	
was	particularly 	fast	regarding 	returns 	on	
sales. 	This	suggests 	that	the	profitability 	of	
the	German 	corporate 	sector 	–	not	least	due	
to	substantial 	restructuring 	efforts 	through -
out	the	past	decade 	–	is	relatively 	high	des-

own	funds. 	Together 	with	long-term 	liabil -
ities,	own	funds 	constituted, 	on	average, 	al-
most 	half	the	balance 	sheet 	total. 	long-term 	
equity 	and	liabilities 	available 	to	enterprises 	
surpassed 	fixed 	assets 	by	one-tenth, 	after 	
these 	two	balance 	sheet 	items 	had	almost 	
been 	head-to-head 	in	2008.
balance 	sheets 	and	income 	statements 	were 	
under 	great 	strain 	throughout 	the	financial 	
and	economic 	crisis. 	it	was,	however, 	possible 	
to	limit	losses 	and	safeguard 	liquidity 	from 	a	
healthy 	base	by	applying 	a	number 	of	oper-
ational 	and	financial 	measures. 	The	rapid 	ad-
justments 	made 	were 	the	prerequisite 	for	
coping 	with	the	immediate 	strains 	entailed 	
by	the	severe 	recession. 	however, 	it	was	only	
the	early 	turnaround 	and	initiation 	of	a	strong 	
rebound 	that	enabled 	the	German 	real	econ-
omy	to	escape 	the	crisis 	relatively 	unscathed. 	
it	is	therefore 	not	surprising 	that	the	number 	
of	insolvencies 	was	already 	noticeably 	on	the	
decline 	in	2010 	(-2%), 	following 	growth 	of	
11½% 	in	2009. 	This	contrasts 	markedly 	with	
the	economic 	downturn 	in	the	first	half	of	
last	decade, 	during 	which 	the	number 	of	in-
solvencies 	increased, 	at	times 	sharply, 	over	a	
period 	of	four	years 	in	a	context 	of	trend 	
stagnation 	and	structural 	problems. 	There 	
were 	visible 	fluctuations 	in	the	insolvency 	
rate	(ie	the	ratio 	of	bankruptcy 	filings 	to	
number 	of	enterprises) 	in	the	manufacturing 	
and	transportation 	sectors 	in	2008 	and	2010. 	
The	cyclical 	impact 	on	the	number 	of	insolv-
encies 	was	less	pronounced 	in	the	trade 	sec-
tors.	The	construction 	sector 	was	able	to	
withstand 	the	crisis 	period 	without 	the	fre-
quency 	of	insolvencies 	increasing. 	besides 	the	
favourable 	demand 	in	this	sector 	throughout, 	it	came 	in	handy 	that	the	sector’s 	corporate 	
landscape 	had	previously 	become 	more 	ro-
bust. 	With 	regard 	to	business-related 	ser-
vices, 	a	sector 	which 	is	generally 	known 	for	
its	high	number 	of	newly 	founded 	com-
panies, 	the	insolvency 	rate	has	increased 	
steadily 	since 	2007.
Sales and income
The	strong 	recovery 	in	domestic 	and	foreign 	
demand 	was	reflected 	in	2010 	by	a	consider -
able	increase 	in	sales 	in	virtually 	all	economic 	
sectors 	listed 	in	the	financial 	statements 	stat-
istics. 	The	surplus 	in	revenue 	averaged 	8%,	
following 	a	decline 	of	10½% 	in	the	previous 	
year.	While, 	as	a	result, 	there 	was	still	a	visible

pared 	with	pre-crisis 	levels, 	gross 	income,

Deutsche BundesbankFinancial statements statistics with broader sectoral coverage and a new basis of extrapolation
This article introduces financial statements statistics which 
rest on a broader statistical basis.1 This improves not only the 
extrapolation of results from the non-financial corporations 
sector, but also the information value of sectoral data. The 
inclusion of energy and water supply figures (including waste 
management services) means that the production sector is now 
fully covered. The representativeness of the services sector sta -
tistics has been improved primarily by including railway, postal 
and telecommunication enterprises’ financial statement data, 
as well as those from the accommodation and restaurant sector. 
This also means that the “trade, transport, accommodation and 
restaurants” as well as the “information and communication” 
sectors could be defined in line with the revised sectoral break -
down of the national accounts. Rental and leasing activities 
are now also included in the calculation.2 Measured in terms 
of the number of enterprises, the statistics cover 70% of the 
non-financial corporations sector. Based on sales, the coverage 
is now more than 93%, compared with 81% prior to the expan -
sion of the statistical basis.
The practice of extrapolating based on the evaluation of sales 
data of the statistical business register, which is being applied 
for the first time, represents an improvement in methodology. 
Like the financial statements data pool, the business register 
enables every enterprise to be identified by its smallest legal 
entity. This facilitates the reconciliation of the sectoral clas-
sification between annual financial statements and the basis 
of extrapolation compared with the previously used turnover tax statistics, the recording of which was based on the fiscal 
unit which may contain groups of enterprises. The sectoral 
sales based on the business register are checked against other 
indicators for plausibility and adjusted if necessary. On balance, 
the new basis of extrapolation increases selectivity between the 
individual economic sectors.
Results from the annual financial statements for a reporting year 
are usually published on three different dates. Initial preliminary 
data (ie currently the data for 2010) are published just under 12 
months after the end of the reporting year and are based on a 
subset of around 20,000 to 25,000 enterprises, which represents 
around one-quarter of the entire expected annual financial 
statement figures. This enables us to determine changes to the 
financial statement items that are by and large undistorted and 
can be used to update the results of the regular extrapolation. 
At this early stage of the evaluation, the focus is on the data for 
the non-financial corporations sector in its entirety. Around 18 
months after the end of the reporting year, the pool of data is 
so broad that the first comprehensive balance sheet and profit 
results by sector can be published. This is followed around one 
year later by publication of the effectively final data, which are 
based on the extrapolation of the now virtually complete data 
set comprising approximately 90,000 enterprises.
The results presented in this article are based uniformly on the 
new broader statistical basis. By back-calculating to 2006, the 
lines of development in the recent past are not distorted by

a statistical break. Comparing the results of the new statisti -
cal basis with those of the old basis during the overlap period 
primarily reveals differences in levels in the aggregate balance 
sheet and income statement positions, whereas the develop -
ment of the main items is barely affected by the modification save for a few exceptions.
The expansion means that the balance sheet total of all report -
ing enterprises increased by just over 30%. Fixed assets rose by 
twice this figure, which is due to a lesser extent to the fact that 
the new statistical basis includes leasing companies and accom -
modation and restaurants, seven-tenths of the assets of which are fixed assets. The incorporation of economic sectors with more capital-intensive services, such as energy production and 
the railways, is quantitatively more significant. The inclusion of 
the telecommunications sector, which is also capital-intensive 
but has more equity available, contributes to an upward shift 
of the equity ratio by one-half percentage point. In contrast, the share of liabilities is one percentage point lower, which 
is also attributable to the telecommunications sector with its 
lower requirement for bank loans and its especially pronounced 
group structures.
The difference in levels is 15% in the case of sales. The now 
marked increase in depreciation expenses is just as much a consequence of the inclusion of economic sectors that produce 
comparatively capital-intensively as the below-average increase in personnel costs. Shifting the relative importance of the 
primary factors of production, however, does not significantly change the overall costs in relation to the revenue. The returns on sales calculated from the old and new statistical basis are practically identical, which is noteworthy from both a meth -
odological and analytical perspective given the fluctuations 
observed during the overlap period.
The improved coverage of fixed assets also affects the sources 
and uses of funds calculation. The enterprises’ investment expenditure functions as a key component in this regard, and 
is significant for both economic and structural questions. This 
means that the gross accretion of fixed assets is around 40% higher using the new statistical basis. On the financing side, the increase is just as large for the entire inflow of funds, and is 25% for cash flow. The information value of the financial statements statistics for the investment and financing ability of 
the non-financial corporations sector has therefore increased 
significantly.

the	chemical 	enterprises 	were 	at	the	fore-
front 	once 	again. 	The	bulk	of	sectors 	occu -
pied	a	mid-table 	position; 	out	of	the	large 	
sectors, 	only	the	car	industry 	witnessed 	a	de-
cline. 	however, 	after 	car	manufacturers 	had	
been 	forced 	to	report 	losses 	on	average 	in	
2009, 	they	were 	able	to	improve 	their	earn-
ings	in	the	reporting 	year.	even	larger 	than	in	
manufacturing 	was	the	jump 	in	profits 	in	
wholesale 	trade, 	overcoming 	the	poor 	profit-
ability 	of	the	crisis 	year.	Transport, 	which 	had	
similarly 	been 	severely 	stricken 	by	the	reces -
sion, 	improved 	by	around 	one-half. 	however, 	
this	still	meant 	that	the	sector, 	at	2½%, 	was	
at	the	bottom 	end	of	the	profitability 	scale.
retail	and	motor 	vehicle 	trade 	recorded 	a	
one-third 	increase 	in	profits. 	Despite 	a	con-
siderable 	decline 	in	sales, 	the	motor 	vehicle 	
sector 	accomplished 	this	feat	by	selling 	a	
growing 	number 	of	larger 	passenger 	cars, 	
the	profit 	margin 	of	which 	is	usually 	higher. 	
in	this	context, 	the	recovery 	of	the	fleet	busi-
ness	played 	a	role,	too.	by	contrast, 	the	ex-
tremely 	large 	volume 	of	sales 	in	2009 	was	
mainly 	supported 	by	small 	and	medium-sized 	
vehicles 	which 	had	attracted 	particular 	de-
mand 	due	to	the	car	scrappage 	scheme. 	car	
dealers’ 	generally 	rather 	weak 	return 	on	sales 	
increased 	to	just	below 	3%	in	2010. 	With 	an	
increase 	in	profits 	of	one-fourth, 	business-
related 	service 	providers 	consolidated 	their 	
leading 	position 	regarding 	profitability, 	which 	
is,	however, 	heavily 	biased 	upwards 	due	to	
the	considerable 	weight 	of	non-corporations, 	
the	profits 	of	which 	also	contain 	entrepre -neurial 	remuneration. 	 as	for	construction, 	
the	annual 	results 	of	enterprises 	were 	up	by	
one-tenth 	year-on-year, 	whereas 	only	little	
changed 	in	the	energy 	sector, 	and	the	infor-
mation 	and	communication 	sector 	was	even 	
confronted 	with	a	slight 	fall.
Income and expenses in detail
as	a	result 	of	more 	finished 	and	unfinished 	
goods 	being 	capitalised 	than 	in	2009, 	the	
gross 	revenue 	of	all	recorded 	enterprises 	ex-
panded 	somewhat 	more 	strongly 	in	2010 	
than	sales. 	The	movements 	in	these 	items 	are	
determined 	by	the	manufacturing 	sector, 	
which, 	as	the	economy 	has	improved, 	has	
built	up	its	stocks 	of	finished 	goods. 	another 	
substantial 	contribution 	was	made 	by	con-
struction. 	it	is	likely 	that, 	for	larger 	orders 	in	
particular 	–	ie	civil	engineering 	measures 	
commissioned 	by	the	public 	sector 	as	part	of	
the	economic 	stimulus 	packages 	–	partial 	ser-
vices 	will	have 	been 	capitalised 	as	“unfin -
ished 	goods” 	prior 	to	project 	completion.
interest 	income 	fell	substantially 	further 	in	
the	reporting 	period, 	although 	the	decline 	of	
just	over	15% 	was	only	half	that	of	the	previ-
ous	year. 	This	was	due	in	particular 	to	the	
	reported 	amount 	of	financial 	assets 	being 	re-
duced 	as	a	result 	of	having 	been 	netted 	with	
pension 	reserves 	pursuant 	to	the	act	Mod -

Once 	output 	had	rapidly 	recovered 	following 	
the	crisis-induced 	slump, 	the	cost	of	mater -
ials	soared 	by	9%,	after 	falling 	by	13½% 	in	
2009. 	The	increase 	in	this	cost	item	was	par-
ticularly 	pronounced 	in	manufacturing. 	This	
was	not	only	due	to	the	particularly 	strong 	
fluctuations 	in	production 	between 	2009 	and	
2010. 	 an	additional 	factor 	that	increased 	
spending 	was	the	comparatively 	strong 	rise	in	
the	prices 	of	commodities 	and	primary 	and	
intermediate 	goods. 	especially 	the	prices 	of	
primary 	energy 	imports 	recovered 	exception-
ally	quickly 	following 	the	cyclical 	trough. 	This	
development 	mainly 	affected 	the	chemical 	
industry 	due	to	oil	and	gas	being 	key	input 	
factors 	here, 	too.	 by	contrast, 	the	corres -
ponding 	increase 	in	costs 	in	retail 	trade 	was	
lower; 	one	particular 	reason 	for	this	was	that	
only	half	of	the	decline 	in	the	buying 	prices 	
of	consumer 	durables 	in	2009 	was	reversed. 	
Despite 	sharp 	increases 	in	the	reporting 	
period, 	producer 	prices 	for	agricultural 	prod-
ucts, 	too,	were 	still	perceptibly 	lower 	than	in	
2008.
enterprises’ 	personnel 	expenses 	increased 	by	
2%	on	average 	for	all	of	2010 	following 	a	
decline 	of	3%	a	year	earlier. 	The	main 	reason 	
for	the	subdued 	growth 	was	that	the	collect-
ive	wage 	agreements 	were 	affected 	by	the	
then-depressed 	business 	activity, 	which 	led	to	
the	social 	partners 	agreeing 	predominantly 	
on	one-off 	payments 	and	only	planning 	for	
the	introduction 	of	increases 	in	scheduled 	
rates 	at	a	later	date	–	if	at	all.	Forgoing 	add-
itional 	wage 	demands 	led	to	a	building-up 	of	
the	core	workforces 	in	the	course 	of	2010, 	
even 	in	sectors 	of	the	economy 	that	had	
been 	deeply 	scarred 	by	the	recession. 	Taken 	on	its	own, 	this	drove 	up	personnel 	costs 	just	
as	much 	as	the	reduction 	in	short-time 	work 	
and	the	gradual 	normalisation 	of	working 	
hours, 	the	crisis-induced 	reduction 	of	which 	
had	often 	required 	employees 	to	accept 	de 
facto 	pay	cuts. 	 as	utilisation 	steadily 	rose, 	
employees, 	too,	filled 	up	their	working 	time	
accounts. 	For	enterprises, 	this	meant 	an	ac-
cumulation 	of	reserves 	which 	ate	into	the	an-
nual	result.
in	2010, 	the	number 	of	temporary 	workers 	
went 	up	sharply 	after 	particularly 	the	indus -
trial	enterprises 	had	waived 	third-party 	hiring 	
in	the	recession. 	The	rise	in	expenses 	in	this	
area	contributed 	to	the	item	“other 	ex-
penses”, 	which 	also	includes 	the	cost	of	tem-
porary 	workers, 	recording 	a	considerable 	
gain	of	3½%, 	following 	-5½% 	the	previous 	
year.	The	act	Modernising 	accounting 	law	is	
another 	reason 	for	the	increase 	in	other 	ex-
penses. 	an	upward 	revaluation 	of	pension 	li-
abilities, 	to	be	discounted 	closer 	to	market 	
rates, 	was	of	particular 	importance. 	This	was	
joined 	by	the	first-time 	inclusion 	of	future 	
wage 	and	pension 	increases 	in	2010. 	Many 	
enterprises 	appear 	to	have 	decided 	to	take	
these 	changes 	on	board 	immediately 	instead 	
of	gradually 	repaying 	the	difference 	up	to	the	
financial 	year	of	2024, 	as	permitted 	by	law.
enterprises’ 	write-downs 	fell	by	an	additional 	
4%	in	the	reporting 	period 	after 	a	decline 	of	
more 	than	5%	had	been 	recorded 	in	2009. 	
contributing 	factors 	included 	depreciations 	
of	fixed 	assets, 	although 	stocks 	of	such	assets 	
at	the	end	of	the	business 	year	were 	some -

The	greater 	number 	of	bonds 	honoured 	and	
larger 	payments 	made 	due	to	a	rise	in	liabil-
ities	to	affiliated 	enterprises 	also	contributed 	
to	the	increase 	in	interest 	expenditure. 	On	
average, 	interest 	expenditure 	was	up	again 	in	
2010 	compared 	with	interest-bearing 	liabil -
ities,	which 	is	remarkable 	considering 	the	de-
cline 	in	 bund	yields. 	 apparently 	enterprises 	
considered 	it	worth 	the	additional 	effort 	to	
strengthen 	their 	relationship 	with	providers 	
of	external 	finance 	and	their 	ability 	to	plan	
ahead 	for	payment 	obligations 	connected 	to	
this.
Sources and uses of funds
The	inflow 	of	funds 	to	enterprises 	rose	con-
siderably 	from 	the	cyclical 	trough 	and	even 	
exceeded 	its	2008 	levels. 	a	major 	factor 	in	
this	context 	was	that	revenue 	increased 	mas-
sively 	following 	the	rapid 	economic 	improve-
ment, 	whereas 	expenditure, 	such	as,	for	in-
stance, 	personnel 	expenses, 	was	still	con-
strained 	by	dampening 	effects. 	This	meant 	
that	internal 	financing 	options 	improved 	con-
siderably 	as	a	result 	of	profit 	retention, 	espe-
cially 	since 	the	imputed 	items 	were 	down 	
once 	again, 	as	was	the	case	for	“earned 	de-
preciations” 	and	the	accumulation 	of	re-
serves. 	Moreover, 	a	considerably 	greater 	
amount 	of	funds 	was	available 	again 	to	cor-
porations 	due	to	external 	capital 	injections. 	
however, 	ongoing 	business 	operations 	and	
an	as-yet 	limited 	need 	for	investment 	were 	
partly 	also	financed 	through 	the	taking 	on	of

short-term 	segment 	which 	followed 	the	ex-
tensive 	contraction 	of	2009 	is	mainly 	attrib -utable 	to	cyclical 	factors 	with	regard 	to	trade 	
payables. 	in	contrast 	to	this,	inflows 	of	funds 	
from 	long-term 	contracts 	were 	only	half	their	
2009 	level, 	which 	is	likely 	to	be	related 	to	the	
fact	that	the	significance 	of	the	motive 	of	
shifts 	towards 	longer 	maturities, 	dominant 	
during 	the	crisis, 	diminished.
The	greatest 	changes 	in	the	use	of	funds 	be-
tween 	2009 	and	2010 	were 	witnessed, 	as	
was	to	be	expected, 	in	the	items 	which 	pro-
foundly 	reflect 	cyclical 	influences. 	This	ap-
plied 	to	both 	inventory 	investments 	and	
short-term 	receivables, 	which 	posted 	strong 	
growth 	due	to	more 	generous 	payment 	terms 	
and	also	to	sales 	financing, 	which 	is	typical 	of	
certain 	market 	segments. 	 enterprises 	once 	
again 	filled 	up	their	cash	resources 	in	the	re-
porting 	period 	despite 	the	fact	that	there 	had	
already 	been 	a	strong 	boost 	in	2009 	with	the	
aim	of	safeguarding 	liquidity. 	 it	is	likely 	to	
have 	been 	important 	in	this	context 	that	en-
terprises 	“parked” 	some 	of	the	funds 	re-
ceived 	on	their	bank 	accounts 	as	no	oppor -
tunity 	arose 	for	it	to	be	adequately 	used, 	par-
ticularly 	since 	investing 	it	in	securities, 	for	
example, 	promised 	no	substantial 	benefit 	in	
terms 	of	returns. 	however, 	the	acquisition 	of	
long-term 	equity 	investments 	picked 	up	
again. 	in	comparison 	to	the	accumulation 	of

Deutsche BundesbankWas business investment actually weak in the past decade?
What the financial statements statistics tell us
In the discussion surrounding the German current account 
surplus, one of the points sometimes made is that business 
investment over the past decade could have been higher. Evi -
dence for this argument appears to be provided by the national 
accounts data, which show that, in the German non-financial 
corporations sector, net investment remained below savings 
during virtually the entire second half of the past decade even 
though this economic sector generally has net funding needs. 
However, in Germany business gross fixed capital formation as 
a percentage of GDP was not below the results for comparable 
industrial countries. Indeed, at 11¼%, the average ratio for 
the last investment cycle1 was as high as the figure for France 
and even somewhat above the levels recorded for the United 
States (11%) and the United Kingdom (10½%).
Getting an a priori  lucrative business idea up and running 
generally entails a package of coordinated measures, invari -
ably with multiple options to choose from. An enterprise will 
invest substantially in its own capacities if in-house production 
is preferred. In this context, the list of potential locations will 
not be confined to the home country alone. Moreover, thought 
can be given to outsourcing steps of the value-added chain. 
The scope of investment pursued by the corporate sector as a 
whole depends on numerous microeconomic decisions which 
impact on enterprises’ balance sheets and income statements.  
The financial statement statistics are therefore able to provide a 
detailed picture; the sectoral breakdown and categorisation of 
firms by size is significant for analytical purposes. It should be 
noted that, in this context, capital consumption is measured by 
depreciation, which is relevant for taxation. 
The analysis is based on data on the enterprises’ use of funds.  
Investment-related expenses refer to the purchase of fixed assets and the net acquisition of long-term equity investments and 
securities.  By contrast, for the sake of simplicity no attention is 
paid to changes in cash resources and receivables, financial cur -
rent assets as well as inventories, which are highly sensitive to 
cyclical movements. This leads to the assumption that any fluc -
tuations in inflows of funds are absorbed by these components 
in such a manner that, whilst ensuring liquidity, medium-term 
investment intentions are not influenced. A key indicator in the 
analysis is the fixed asset accumulation factor, which sets gross 
inflows in relation to write-downs and thus serves as a measure 
of increases (>1) or reductions (<1) in fixed assets.2 By compar -
ing this metric with the broader factor comprising fixed and 
(long-term) financial asset accumulation, it is possible to gauge 
the importance attributed to fixed investment as opposed to 
the acquisition of long-term equity investments and securities.3 
On the one hand, using fixed assets and holding a capital stake 
are mutually exclusive, as they constitute two alternative ways 
of deploying funds to generate profits. On the other hand, 
investment in fixed assets requires inter alia  strategic stakes in 
enterprises, for example in order to safeguard the sourcing of 
intermediate goods or make it easier to penetrate markets.4
The observation period chosen for this analysis was subdivided 
into two expansionary phases, each lasting three years (1998 
to 2000 and 2006 to 2008), and a five-year interim period of 
moderate economic growth.5 During the last economic upturn, 
the fixed asset accumulation factor for all enterprises averaged 
1.16 and was thus almost as high as in the 1998 to 2000 boom 
period.6 The investment performance in the past decade has 
nonetheless been mixed overall due to the fact that inflows 
of fixed assets in the first five years were just about able to 
offset depreciation. Moreover, there is no difference between 
the two expansionary cyclical phases regarding the factor of 
1 Dated from peak to peak in the time series of business gross fixed 
capital formation, the investment cycle under review spans the mid-
2000 to end-2007 period in all four countries.  — 2 This is predicated on 
the assumption that assets up to the amount of depreciation have been 
acquired in order to offset the capital consumption.  — 3 The denomi-
nator shared by both indicators is the depreciation of fixed assets. 
With regard to the use of funds, this component demonstrates the greatest stability over time. The variation of the indicators is therefore 
primarily attributable to the respective numerator.  — 4 Other aspects 
such as tax considerations may also play a role. — 5 The year 2009 is 
ignored here. One reason for this is the unique economic situation in 
this year; another is the fact that the statistical basis is still patchy at 
this level of granularity. The evaluation is based on the old statistical 
basis. — 6 Leasing-financed investment, which accounted for around Enterprises’ fixed and long-term financial investment in successive cyclical phases

fixed and financial asset accumulation. As a percentage of the 
depreciation of fixed assets, the funds deployed for the acquisi -
tion of long-term equity investments and securities during the 
New Economy boom did not exceed the funds used for these purposes in the broadly industry-based upswing that occurred between 2006 and 2008.
Since the middle of the last decade, hardly any sectoral differ -
ences in fixed capital formation have been discernible. Only the 
construction sector was somewhat down on the average; its performance, however, was much improved compared with the 
adjustment crisis of this sector in the preceding period, in which 
capital formation had fallen significantly short of the stock 
maintenance benchmark. Between 1998 and 2005, the rate of 
fixed asset accumulation in the services sectors remained below 
that recorded for the manufacturing sector. With the excep -
tion of construction companies, the investment budgets of all 
enterprises contained substantial funds for longer-term equity 
investments and securities, frequently exceeding the level of net 
investment in fixed capital. In return, between 1998 and 2000 
the manufacturing sector made a much larger volume of funds 
available for long-term financial investments than it had in the 
last upturn, which suggests that the pressure to outsource parts 
of the industrial production process has eased in the meantime. 
By contrast, in the case of trade and transport as well as of 
business-related service providers, the gradation was quite the 
opposite.
The acquisition of long-term equity investments and securities 
is primarily an option open to large enterprises. In the period 
under review, the amount of funds budgeted for these purposes 
was consistently greater than the volume set aside for boost -
ing the stock of fixed assets. Counterbalancing this, small and 
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) focused on investing in their 
own capacities. Moreover, the procyclical pattern of fixed capi -
tal formation is much more pronounced in this size category. In 
each of the two upturns, the volume of fixed assets acquired by 
SMEs exceeded the stock maintenance benchmark by one-tenth. 
Between 2001 and 2005, however, SMEs’ fixed investment fell 
short of this level by almost the same margin.
Overall, enterprises‘ use of funds entailed an increase in profit -
ability. The return on sales went up from 3¾% at the end of the 
1990s to just over 5% in 2007, never to drop below that initial 
level, not even in the course of the subsequent severe financial 
and economic crisis. With its focus on fixed capital formation, the SMEs’ investment strategy resulted in a disproportionate 
increase in profits. In the years after 2003, these firms not only saw their return on sales go up fairly quickly by half as much 
again to 6% on the average for the years 2006 to 2008 but also held up well in 2009 (5½%) under extremely adverse circum -
stances.
9 All in all, the ability to sustainably increase profits and 
simultaneously expand financial resilience is a clear sign that 
German companies occupy a broadly successful market position. 
Accordingly, in view of this key objective of corporate policy, 
investment activity of the non-financial business sector over the past decade cannot be judged in an unfavourable light. 
one-fifth of investment in machinery and equipment during this phase 
and which increased by one-third between 2003 and 2008, is omitted from the extrapolated results for the reporting population described here. See Deutsche Bundesbank, Leasing financing in Germany,

amounted 	to	more 	than 	one-fifth; 	even 	in

it	was	just	below 	two-fifths. 	During 	the	re-

down 	by	almost 	one-sixth, 	which 	is	likely 	to	
be	attributable 	to	the	netting 	of	plan	assets

result 	of	expanding 	their	activities. 	Demand 	
for	an	increased 	accumulation 	of	reserves 	in	
this	context 	was	also	created 	by	the	build-up 	
of	working 	time	accounts 	and	in	connection 	
with	potential 	future 	payment 	of	back 	taxes 	
owed. 	The	latter 	were 	quite 	likely 	in	some 	
areas 	as	the	prepayments 	for	2010 	had	been 	
undercalculated 	given 	the	unexpectedly 	
strong 	recovery. 	Tax	reserves 	increased 	by	
15% 	in	2010, 	which 	to	a	large 	extent 	was,

growth 	in	2010. 	 consequently, 	the	equity 	
ratio	largely 	expanded, 	too,	despite 	the	sub-

which 	implied 	a	continuation 	of	the	upward 	
trend 	following 	the	crisis-induced 	interrup -
tion. 	This	is	true	despite 	the	contributions 	
made 	by	changes 	to	accounting 	law,	some 	of	
which 	caused 	equity 	to	increase, 	while 	others 	
(especially 	the	netting 	of	plan	assets 	and	pen-
sion	reserves) 	led	to	a	decrease 	in	the	balance 	
sheet 	total. 	a	certain 	convergence 	can	also	
be	noticed 	particularly 	in	manufacturing, 	
which 	suggests 	that	greater 	advances 	tended 	
to	be	made 	in	sectors 	with	below-average 	
equity. 	Of	the	large 	industries, 	it	was	mainly 	
manufacturers 	of	motor 	vehicles 	and	manu -
facturers 	of	machinery 	and	equipment 	that	
caught 	up,	whereas 	the	equity 	ratios 	among 	
the	chemical, 	metal 	and	electrical 	engineer -
ing	sectors, 	which 	had	been 	above 	the	manu-
facturing 	sector’s 	average 	in	2009, 	remained 	
virtually 	unchanged.
Outlook for 2011
The	strong 	economic 	recovery 	in	2010 	led	to	
a	perceptible 	easing 	of	enterprises’ 	financial 	
and	earnings 	situation, 	which 	had	been 	
under 	considerable 	strain 	as	a	result 	of	the	
economic 	slump 	in	2008 	Q4-2009 	Q1.	The	
path 	that	enterprises 	had	then 	set	out	on	
was	to	tide	over	the	economic 	slowdown 	by	
holding 	on	to	a	large 	portion 	of	their	produc-
tion	capacity 	and	human 	capital, 	which 	en-
abled 	them 	to	rapidly 	take	advantage 	of	the	
pick-up 	in	demand. 	both	the	cash	flow	and	
the	operating 	result 	shot	up	even 	more 	
strongly 	than 	sales. 	The	cost-earnings 	ratio 	
returned 	to	normal 	levels 	in	2011 	as	the	up-
swing 	gained 	in	strength. 	especially 	person -
nel	expenses 	were 	probably 	up	due	to	size-able	wage 	increases 	and	voluntary 	remuner -
ation 	paid	by	enterprises. 	 however, 	other 	
cost	factors, 	too,	are	likely 	to	have 	lost	their	
dampening 	effect.
Throughout 	2011, 	growth 	in	sales 	was	rather 	
reasonable 	according 	to	information 	avail-
able	up	to	the	third 	quarter 	from 	the	quar-
terly	group 	accounts 	of	non-financial 	groups 	
of	enterprises 	listed 	in	the	DaX	and	the	
MDaX.	The	rising 	cost	burden, 	however, 	put	
pressure 	on	the	profit 	margins 	of	those 	
groups 	covered 	by	this	analysis. 	The	fact	that	
their 	annual 	result 	before 	taxes 	for	2011 	is	
nonetheless 	estimated 	to	have 	been 	around 	
one-half 	percentage 	point 	higher 	than	in	the	
previous 	year, 	ie	just	below 	7%,	is	not	so

Direct investment and financial constraints 
 before and during the financial crisis
The	financial 	and	economic 	crisis 	temporarily 	resulted 	in	massive 	distortions 	in	international 	
trade 	and	cross-border 	capital 	flows, 	including 	a	sharp 	slump 	in	global 	direct 	investment 	stocks 	
in	2008 	(-14%). 	however, 	enterprises’ 	exposures 	abroad 	have 	since 	recovered 	and	stocks 	are	
currently 	even 	recording 	new	highs. 	in	contrast 	to	these 	international 	developments, 	Germany’s 	
direct 	investment 	relationships 	proved 	to	be	quite 	robust 	during 	the	crisis 	and	thus	had	a	stabil-
ising	effect 	on	Germany’s 	financial 	ties	with	the	rest	of	the	world.
This	article 	describes 	the	main 	developments 	in	Germany’s 	direct 	investment 	relationships 	imme-
diately 	before 	and	during 	the	financial 	crisis 	and	makes 	a	comparison 	with	developments 	abroad. 	
Furthermore, 	it	examines 	the	impact 	of	potential 	financial 	constraints 	on	direct 	investment 	activ-
ity	as	well	as	on	foreign 	trade. 	it	emerges 	that	real	economic 	factors 	such	as	productivity 	and	
size	play	an	important 	role	in	the	internationalisation 	of	domestic 	enterprises. 	however, 	in	add-
ition, 	financial 	factors, 	such	as	the	level	of	cash	flows 	generated, 	are	also	of	key	importance. 	a	
lack	of	access 	to	external 	financing 	can	ultimately 	pose 	an	obstacle 	to	cross-border 	activities.
although 	German 	banks 	tightened 	their	credit 	standards 	during 	the	crisis, 	no	perceptible 	con-
straints 	on	financing 	options 	can	be	identified 	for	enterprises 	in	Germany 	for	the	period 	under 	
review, 	including 	with	regard 	to	external 	financing 	of	foreign 	activities. 	This	is	shown, 	inter alia ,	
by	the	results 	of	the	bundesbank’s 	bank 	lending 	survey, 	as	well	as	other 	survey 	results.DEUTSCHE

Global developments  
in direct investment
according 	to	data	from 	unc TaD,1	global 	dir-
ect	investment 	stocks 	reached 	a	new	record 	
level	of	around 	uS$19 	trillion 	at	the	end	of	
2010. 	While 	in	the	wake 	of	the	global 	finan-
cial	crisis, 	particularly 	in	2008, 	a	strong 	de-
cline 	in	direct 	investment 	activity 	was	re-
corded, 	in	global 	terms 	direct 	investment 	re-
turned 	to	its	pre-crisis 	level	as	early 	as	the	
end	of	2009. 	however, 	there 	were 	strong 	re-
gional 	differences. 	For	example, 	at	4%,	the	
crisis-induced 	declines 	in	developing 	coun -
tries	were 	the	least	pronounced. 	by	contrast, 	
in	developed 	economies 	direct 	investment 	
stocks 	fell	by	one-sixth 	in	2008 	and	in	emer -
ging	market 	economies 	they	dropped 	by	as	
much 	as	one-third. 	however, 	their	respective 	
recoveries 	from 	2009 	onwards 	were 	all	the	
more 	vigorous.2	The	rebound 	in	direct 	invest-
ment 	after 	the	initial 	phase 	of	the	financial 	
crisis 	was	driven 	above 	all	by	greenfield 	in-
vestments, 	ie	the	setting 	up	of	new	produc-
tion	and	sales 	sites	on	greenfields. 	although 	
cross-border 	mergers 	and	acquisitions 	(M&as)	
have 	also	recorded 	growth 	since 	their	crisis-
induced 	low	at	the	end	of	2008/beginning 	of	
2009,3	this	lagged 	far	behind 	developments 	
in	greenfield 	investments. 	M&as,	which 	are	
frequently 	partly 	debt-financed, 	accounted 	
for	only	just	over	one-fifth 	of	global 	direct 	in-
vestment 	inflows 	in	2010, 	whereas 	in	2005, 	
at	the	peak 	of	the	last	M&a	boom, 	their 	
share 	was	more 	than	twice 	as	high.
Developed 	economies 	accounted 	for	around 	
two-thirds 	of	all	direct 	investment 	stocks 	at	
the	end	of	2010. 	These 	economies 	were 	thus	still	the	main 	direct 	investment 	locations. 	in	
2010, 	Germany 	was	one	of	the	five	largest 	
target 	countries 	for	foreign 	direct 	investment, 	
measured 	in	terms 	of	stocks 	valued 	in	uS	dol-
lars,4	alongside 	the	 united 	States, 	 hong	
Kong, 	the	united 	Kingdom 	and	France. 	how-
ever,	with	the	exception 	of	Germany, 	it	is	pre-
cisely 	in	these 	countries 	that	current 	levels 	are	
still	quite 	significantly 	below 	pre-crisis 	levels.
it	is	noteworthy 	that, 	in	2010, 	for	the	first	
time	emerging 	market 	and	developing 	coun-
tries	combined 	accounted 	for	more 	than	half	
of	global 	direct 	investment 	inflows. 	 at	the	
same 	time, 	they	were 	themselves 	increasingly 	
active 	as	direct 	investors, 	often 	also	within 	
their	own	group 	of	countries.5	This	demon -
strates 	the	sharp 	growth 	in	the	importance 	of	
emerging 	market 	and	developing 	countries 	in	
the	area	of	direct 	investment 	and	indicates 	
that	economic 	ties	between 	these 	countries 	
are	becoming 	ever	stronger. 	This	is	likely 	to	
tend	to	also	have 	a	positive 	impact 	on	growth 	
in	these 	countries 	and	on	international 	trade. 	
however, 	at	the	same 	time, 	it	can	be	seen

2	The	unc TaD	data	must 	be	interpreted 	with	a	certain 	
degree 	of	caution. 	First, 	market 	price 	fluctuations 	play	a

in	addition, 	exchange 	rate	fluctuations 	vis-à-vis 	the	uS	
dollar 	are	reflected 	in	the	data. 	Furthermore, 	the	direct 	
investment 	stocks 	of	countries 	without 	separate 	stock 	
statistics 	–	this	applies 	in	particular 	to	many 	emerging 	
market 	and	developing 	countries 	–	are	estimated 	using

owing 	to	withdrawals 	of	capital, 	write-downs, 	losses 	
and,	in	some 	cases, 	loans 	to	parent 	companies.

cations 	within 	this	group 	of	countries. 	Thus 	
in	2010 	more 	than 	one-third 	of	the	funds 	
flowed 	to	china	(excluding 	hong	Kong), 	bra-
zil,	russia 	and	Singapore.
German direct investment
a	comprehensive 	analysis 	of	German 	direct 	
investment 	using 	current 	data	is	possible 	to	a	
limited 	extent 	only. 	Data 	on	German 	direct 	
investment 	stocks, 	broken 	down 	by	partner 	
countries 	and	sectors, 	derived 	from 	Deutsche 	
bundesbank 	surveys 	are	currently 	only	avail-
able	up	to	the	end	of	2009. 	The	data	for	
2010 	contained 	in	the	adjacent 	chart 	have 	
therefore 	been 	taken 	from 	the	annual 	inter-
national 	investment 	position. 	They 	are	partly 	
based 	on	estimates 	and	only	a	rough 	regional 	
or	sectoral 	breakdown 	is	available. 	Further -
more, 	market 	values 	rather 	than	book 	values 	
(which 	are	used 	for	the	stock 	statistics) 	are	
used 	in	the	international 	investment 	position 	
for	listed 	subsidiaries. 	in	spite 	of	these 	limita-
tions, 	the	most 	important 	trends 	during 	the	
financial 	and	economic 	crisis 	can	be	traced.6
German 	foreign 	investment 	saw	quite 	buoy-
ant	growth 	in	the	run-up 	to	the	crisis 	and	
until	the	end	of	2007. 	Despite 	a	marked 	de-
cline, 	it	continued 	to	grow, 	in	euro	terms, 	
even 	during 	the	financial 	crisis.7	Thus 	Ger-
man	enterprises 	went 	against 	the	global 	
trend 	mentioned 	above 	and	consequently 	
maintained 	their 	cross-border 	exposures. 	 in	
particular, 	they	did	not	experience 	a	sharp 	
slump 	in	2008. 	The	recovery 	of	the	real	econ-
omy	and	stabilisation 	of	the	financial 	markets 	
resulted 	in	German 	direct 	investment 	abroad 	going 	back 	up	by	€37	billion 	in	2009. 	The	
increase 	focused 	mainly 	on	euro-area 	coun -
tries	and	was	predominantly 	in	the	form 	of	
equity 	capital. 	Moreover, 	declining 	annual 	
losses 	at	foreign 	subsidiaries 	played 	a	role.

vestment 	in	Germany, 	there 	has	also	been 	a	Stock statistics

slight 	easing 	in	the	upward 	trend 	since 	2007, 	
but	without 	this	resulting 	in	a	crisis-induced 	
slump 	like	that	experienced 	elsewhere. 	Only	
in	2009 	were 	direct 	investment 	stocks 	slightly 	
down 	on	the	year	(by	€6	billion), 	which 	was	
on	balance 	solely 	due	to	a	decline 	in	intra-
group 	loans, 	which 	are	also	classified 	as	dir-
ect	investment, 	in	line	with	international 	
standards.
On	the	basis 	of	the	direct 	investment 	stock 	
data, 	it	therefore 	appears 	that	Germany 	wea-
thered 	the	financial 	crisis 	quite 	well. 	The	spe-
cific	influences 	of	the	financial 	crisis 	are	
shown 	more 	clearly 	by	means 	of	a	closer 	an-
alysis 	of	the	components 	which 	direct 	invest-
ment 	comprises 	than	through 	a	breakdown 	
by	country 	or	economic 	sector.
in	2007, 	German 	investors’ 	cross-border 	cor-
porate 	investment 	still	recorded 	considerable 	
growth 	(+€98 	billion). 	Foreign 	direct 	invest -
ment 	assets 	in	Germany 	also	increased 	(+€40 	
billion). 	both	were 	driven 	by	equity 	capital, 	
which 	was	expanded 	significantly 	due,	
among 	other 	things, 	to	continuing 	strong 	
profitability 	in	2007 	and	consequently 	higher 	
reinvested 	earnings.
There 	were 	clear 	signs 	of	the	global 	recession 	
and	high	losses 	in	the	financial 	sector 	as	early 	
as	2008. 	German 	direct 	investment 	abroad 	
rose	by	a	mere 	€8	billion 	and	foreign 	direct 	
investment 	in	Germany 	went 	up	by	only	€10	
billion. 	lower 	profitability 	and	the	associated 	
decline 	in	annual 	surpluses 	or	a	marked 	in-
crease 	in	annual 	losses 	compared 	with	the	
previous 	year	at	many 	direct 	investment 	en-
terprises 	resulted 	in	a	drop 	in	equity 	capital. 	This	was	particularly 	pronounced 	in	the	case	
of	branches 	of	German 	enterprises 	abroad. 	
To	compensate, 	affiliated 	German 	enterprises 	
increased 	loans 	to	foreign 	direct 	investment 	
enterprises. 	here,	transfers 	of	funds 	to	non-
resident 	financial 	intermediaries 	were 	a	key	
factor. 	as	regards 	foreign 	direct 	investment 	in	
Germany, 	there 	was	also	an	expansion 	in	
loans 	from 	foreign 	investors 	to	their	German 	
subsidiaries. 	The	loans 	were 	predominantly 	
granted 	to	holding 	companies.
year	on	year,	in	2009 	both 	German 	subsidiar -
ies	abroad 	and	affiliates 	of	foreign 	propri -
etors 	in	Germany 	were 	able	to	considerably 	
reduce 	possible 	annual 	losses, 	especially 	in	
the	banking 	sector 	(by	€17	billion 	in	each 	
case). 	German 	foreign 	branches 	as	a	whole 	
saw	their	annual 	surpluses 	rise	by	€8	billion. 	
at	the	end	of	2009, 	German 	direct 	invest -
ment 	stocks 	abroad 	amounted 	to	€892 	bil-
lion,	while 	foreign 	stocks 	in	Germany 	totalled 	
€651 	billion.
information 	on	the	sectoral 	structure 	of	dir-
ect	investment 	can	only	be	obtained 	to	a	
limited 	extent 	from 	the	data, 	as	holding 	com-
panies 	at	the	first	(primary) 	level	are	a	pre-
ferred 	form 	of	investment 	(over 	half	in	the	
case	of	German 	foreign 	investments, 	around 	
two-thirds 	in	the	case	of	foreign 	investments 	
in	Germany). 	 nevertheless, 	it	can	be	con-
cluded 	that	the	manufacturing 	sector, 	and	in	
particular 	the	chemical 	industry, 	mechanical 	
engineering 	and	manufacturers 	of	vehicles 	
play	a	predominant 	role.	Furthermore, 	the

in	regional 	terms, 	industrial 	countries 	domin-
ate	both 	as	an	investment 	destination 	(share: 	
88%) 	and	as	a	source 	(97%).8	alongside 	the	
united 	States 	(16% 	and	9%	respectively), 	
european 	countries 	play	a	major 	role	in	this	
context, 	especially 	the	euro-area 	partner 	
countries, 	including 	in	particular 	the	nether -
lands. 	in	addition, 	the	united 	Kingdom 	and	
Switzerland 	are	of	considerable 	importance. 	
The	united 	States 	has	played 	an	ever	smaller 	
role	in	recent 	years, 	not	least	because 	emer -
ging	market 	economies 	have 	provided 	new	
growth 	markets. 	 by	contrast, 	direct 	invest -
ment 	relationships 	with	the	netherlands 	have 	
seen	quite 	buoyant 	growth. 	as	the	nether -
lands, 	like	the	other 	benelux 	countries, 	is	a	
favourite 	holding 	company 	location, 	it	can-
not	be	ruled 	out	that	investors 	from 	Germany 	
and	other 	countries, 	including 	the	 united 	
States, 	merely 	use	it	as	a	springboard 	and	the	
actual 	funds 	thus	originated 	from 	or	flowed 	
to	third 	countries. 	German 	direct 	investment 	
in	the	so-called 	bric	 countries 	(brazil, 	russia, 	
india	and	china) 	has	been 	notably 	dynamic, 	
albeit 	still	at	a	low	level, 	in	the	past	few	years. 	
it	recently 	accounted 	for	5%	of	German 	for-
eign	investment 	stocks.
Flow 	data	from 	the	balance 	of	payment 	stat-
istics 	can	be	used 	to	analyse 	developments 	
until	into	2011. 	These 	give	a	similar 	picture 	
for	the	period 	of	time	described 	above, 	par-
ticularly 	the	dynamic 	growth 	until	2007 	and	
moderation 	in	2008.9	The	data	show 	a	fur-
ther	increase 	in	both 	direct 	investment 	in	
Germany 	and	German 	direct 	investment 	
abroad 	in	2009 	and	2010. 	 any	deviations 	
from 	the	stock 	data	may	arise	because 	these 	
data	also	take	into	account 	valuation 	effects 	(owing 	inter alia 	to	exchange 	rate	changes). 	
however, 	the	data	available 	to	date	for	2011 	
indicate 	a	renewed 	slowdown. 	The	intensifi-
cation 	of	the	financial 	crisis 	since 	May	2010 	
combined 	with	a	plausible 	time	lag	for	direct 	
investment 	projects 	could 	have 	been 	a	factor 	
in	this,	as	there 	was	probably 	a	tendency 	to	
put	off	foreign 	investment 	in	light	of	increas-

by	means 	of	short-term 	financial 	loans 	from 	
foreign 	holding 	companies 	domiciled 	in	the

marked 	downturn 	can	nevertheless 	be	ob-
served. 	Whether 	or	not	this	downturn 	was	
due	to	the	crisis 	is	therefore 	a	matter 	of	par-
ticular 	interest. 	 cross-border 	direct 	invest -
ment 	activities 	may	have 	been 	impaired 	by	
several 	factors 	during 	the	financial 	crisis. 	First, 	
demand 	effects 	should 	be	mentioned. 	The	in-
creased 	risk	aversion 	of	investors 	may	have 	
resulted 	in	them 	being 	less	interested 	in	ex-
panding 	their 	cross-border 	activities. 	More -
over, 	however, 	direct 	investment 	may	also	
have 	been 	affected 	at	least	to	some 	extent 	by	
a	lack	of	financing 	options. 	in	principle, 	dif-
ferent 	transmission 	channels 	are	conceivable. 	
On	the	one	hand, 	enterprises’ 	own	funds 	
were 	reduced 	owing 	to	falling 	turnovers 	and	
lower 	earnings.11	On	the	other 	hand, 	the	
possibilities 	for	accessing 	capital 	market 	
funding 	were 	becoming 	more 	and	more 	limited 	and	expensive, 	and	access 	to	bank 	
loans 	was	being 	restricted 	by	tighter 	credit 	
standards 	during 	the	crisis 	period.12	This	is	
likely 	to	have 	been 	of	particular 	significance 	
for	large-scale 	M&as	and	the	activities 	of	pri-
vate	equity 	investors, 	which 	witnessed 	a	
sharp 	drop 	owing 	to	a	lack	of	financing 	op-
tions. 	according 	to	data	from 	the	M&a	data-
base 	Zephyr,13	the	number 	of	completed 	
cross-border 	take-overs 	involving 	German 	en-
terprises 	and	with	a	known 	transaction 	value 	
of	at	least	€1	billion 	fell	from 	19	in	the	pre-
crisis 	year	2007 	to	a	mere 	five	in	2010. 	Fur-
thermore, 	the	number 	of	transactions 	that	
could 	be	financed 	by	new	bank 	loans 	also	fell	
during 	the	financial 	crisis. 	This	indicates 	that	
precisely 	these 	large-scale 	projects 	suffered

that	 perceive	 financing	 as	a	business	 risk	for	
the	coming 	months 	are	refraining 	from 	for-
eign	 investment.	 Only	 just	under	 one-third	 of	
them 	said	that	they	currently 	want 	to	invest	
abroad. 	This	is	significantly 	less	than 	is	the	
case	for	the	other 	industrial 	enterprises 	sur-
veyed. 	according 	to	the	DihK’s	assessment,	
the	business 	situation 	of	enterprises 	experi -
encing	 financing	 problems	 is	often	 still	so	un-
certain	 that	 they	 shied	 away	 from	 expanding	
abroad. 	experience 	has	shown, 	the	DihK	ar-
gues, 	that	investment 	abroad 	is	associated	
with	higher 	risks	and	banks 	are	therefore	
more	 cautious	 about	 providing	 loans	 for	this	
purpose. 	 in	the	preceding 	years 	(2010 	and	
2009)	 it	was	furthermore	 constantly	 held	 that	
enterprises	 that	 invested	 abroad	 saw	a	deteri-
oration	 in	their	 credit	 conditions	 far	more	 fre-
quently	 than	 companies	 that	 were	 not	active	
abroad. 	 and	this	was	the	case	despite 	the	
fact	that	industrial 	enterprises 	that	want 	to	
invest 	abroad 	thought 	that	they	were 	in	a	
better	 situation	 and	therefore	 gave	 more	 op-
timistic 	business 	expectations, 	which 	should	
actually 	make 	it	easier 	to	negotiate 	better	
credit 	conditions. 	 nevertheless, 	foreign 	in-
vestments 	were 	apparently 	regarded 	as	par-
ticularly 	risky. 	Furthermore, 	in	the	case	of	
large-scale	 financing	 projects,	 given	 a	lack	 of	
trust	 among	 the	credit	 institutions	 as	well	 as

academic	 research	 has	so	far	paid	 little	 atten-

nancial 	constraints 	do	not	influence 	enter -
prises’ 	decisions 	regarding 	whether 	to	sell	
their	 products	 abroad	 or	to	invest	 abroad;	 ra-
ther,	differences 	in	productivity 	at	firm	level	
are	of	relevance.15	 however, 	multinational	
enterprises 	also	differ 	from 	purely 	national	
enterprises 	in	other 	respects. 	For	example,	
the	latter 	have 	a	comparatively 	higher 	share	
of	borrowed 	funds 	and	lower 	cash	flows.

studies.16	contrary 	to	the	assumptions 	made 	
by	conventional 	models, 	there 	are	good 	rea-
sons	for	why	not	only	an	enterprise’s 	prod -
uctivity 	but	also	its	access 	to	external 	capital 	
has	an	influence 	on	its	internationalisation 	
decision, 	as	it	is	relatively 	difficult 	to	put	up	
collateral 	for	cross-border 	investments 	and	
debt	financing 	is	therefore 	comparatively 	ex-
pensive. 	although 	the	empirical 	part	of	the	
projects 	covers 	the	period 	prior 	to	the	crisis, 	
the	results 	nevertheless 	help	to	provide 	a	bet-
ter	understanding 	of	the	developments 	dur-
ing	the	crisis 	and	show 	possible 	economic 	
policy 	approaches.
These 	hypotheses 	are	verified 	empirically 	
using 	information 	on	affiliates 	of	German 	en-
terprises 	from 	the	Deutsche 	 bundesbank’s 	
Microdatabase 	Direct 	investment 	(MiDi)17	and	
German 	enterprises’ 	balance 	sheet 	data.18	
The	data	enable 	potential 	financial 	con-
straints 	and	productivity 	to	be	measured 	for	
enterprises 	operating 	in	Germany 	only	as	
well	as	for	exporting 	enterprises 	and	the	par-
ent	companies 	of	multinationals. 	Further -
more, 	they	permit 	an	analysis 	of	financing 	
bottlenecks 	for	foreign 	branches, 	thereby 	
allowing 	the	relative 	significance 	of	financial 	
constraints 	at	parent 	enterprise 	and	affiliate 	
level	to	be	determined. 	in	contrast 	to	earlier 	
studies, 	which 	focus 	on	enterprises 	in	the	
manufacturing 	sector, 	the	data	record 	also	in-
cludes 	services 	sector 	enterprises.
Theoretical 	considerations 	give	reason 	to	as-
sume 	that	the	decision 	about 	whether 	to	be-
come 	active 	abroad 	tends 	to	be	determined 	
more 	by	the	financial 	constraints 	facing 	Ger-
man	investors 	than 	by	any	financial 	con-straints 	facing 	existing 	foreign 	affiliates. 	The	
empirical 	analysis 	shows 	a	kind	of	hierarchy 	
for	the	financing 	of	production 	in	foreign 	
branches: 	while 	financing 	bottlenecks 	for	the	
parent 	company 	are	significant 	to	the	likeli-
hood 	of	establishing 	an	affiliate 	abroad, 	with	
regard 	to	the	expansion 	of	affiliates, 	above 	all	
the	latter’s 	own	financing 	options 	are	of	rele-
vance.
Financing 	conditions 	can	also	influence 	the	
decision 	about 	whether 	to	opt	for	exports 	or	
direct 	investment 	abroad. 	This	is	because 	the	
fixed 	market 	entry 	costs 	are	generally 	lower 	
for	exports 	than 	for	direct 	investment. 	 by	
contrast, 	the	variable 	costs 	of	trade 	are	higher 	
as	the	products 	must 	first	be	brought 	onto 	
the	foreign 	market, 	while 	in	the	case	of	an	
investment 	abroad, 	they	can	be	produced 	on	
site.19	Financial 	constraints 	should 	therefore 	
have 	a	greater 	impact 	on	direct 	investment 	
activities 	than	on	exports. 	in	principle, 	it	can	
be	expected 	that	given 	the	costs 	for	foreign 	
investment, 	more 	productive 	enterprises 	that	
are	less	subject 	to	financial 	constraints 	are	
more 	likely 	to	become 	active 	abroad.Two Bundes-

The	empirical 	results 	of	both 	studies20	con-
firm	 that	 both	 an	enterprise’s	 productivity	 as	
well	as	financing 	requirements 	have 	a	dem-
onstrable 	influence 	on	internationalisation	
decisions. 	Specifically, 	the	analysis 	produces	
three 	key	results. 	First, 	firm	size	(positive),

in	the	balance 	sheet 	total	(negative) 	have 	a	
significant 	impact 	on	exports 	and	direct 	in-

of	an	enterprise, 	variables 	that	are	closely	
connected	 with	 an	enterprise’s	 financing	 op-
tions 	also	play	a	role.	The	higher 	the	cash	
flow, 	the	less	external 	financing 	is	needed;	
the	more	 fixed	 assets	 are	required,	 the	higher	
the	funding 	needs.21	Second, 	financial 	con-
straints 	have 	a	greater 	impact 	on	direct 	in-
vestment 	than	on	exports, 	which 	is	consist -
ent	with	the	higher 	fixed 	costs 	for	direct 	in-
vestment. 	Third, 	financing 	restrictions 	influ-
ence 	the	fundamental 	decision 	concerning	
whether	 to	go	abroad	 at	all.	The	finding	 that	
financing 	issues 	are	only	relevant 	for	those

Financial constraints and choices between direct investment and exports
Deutsche BundesbankThe impact of fi  nancial constraints on export ac-
tivity and direct investment is discussed in two 
Bundesbank discussion papers.1
On the one hand, the estimates are based on the 
Bundesbank’s Microdatabase Direct investment 
(MiDi), which mainly provides information on 
foreign affi  liates. This information was supple-
mented by balance sheet data on the German 
parent companies from the Dafne database (pro-
vided by Bureau van Dijk) and Hoppenstedt. The 
data cover the pre-crisis period 2002-2006, and 
the results are therefore not distorted by devel-
opments in the fi  nancial crisis. After an outlier 
correction, information from just under 90,000 
German fi  rms was entered into the analyses; of 
these, around 6% had foreign subsidiaries in 
more than 100 countries altogether and roughly 
as many companies were exporters. The number 
of data points that are actually entered into the 
individual estimations depends on various fac-
tors. There was a particular request that the 
underlying data for all fi  rms in the overall period 
be made available in full for the Heckman esti-
mation tabulated here.
First, hypotheses on the effects of potential fac-
tors are derived by means of theoretical models. 
These are then examined using various empirical 
approaches. A distinction is made here between the “extensive” margin and the “intensive” mar-
gin. The former examines the decision to be 
present at all in a country (with exports or direct 
investment). The latter focuses on the respective 
size of the exposure. This can involve the num-
ber of affi  liates, the size of the foreign turnover 
or the scope of investment. Univariate and bi-
variate probit regressions using 0-1 dummy vari-
ables are employed accordingly. In addition, 
count data models (Poisson, Negative Binomial 
and a Zero-Inﬂ  ated Poisson model to control for 
the high number of zeros in the observations) as 
well as fi  xed effects estimators are used at the 
intensive margin. The purpose of the latter in 
the estimate is to take account of fi  rm-level char-
acteristics which are not (or cannot be) incorpor-
ated explicitly, the “unobserved heterogeneity”. 
The subdivision of fi  rms by size and sector allows 
effects to be allocated to the individual sub-
groups and ensures the robustness of the results.
One approach which enables both decisions to 
be modelled simultaneously is the Heckman se-
lection model. The results of the Heckman selec-
tion model in relation to foreign direct invest-
ment (FDI) are shown in the table on page 67. 
The dependent variable of the regression model 
is the turnover of the respective domestic multi-
national enterprise i in the corresponding host 
country j at time t. In order to counter endo-

geneity problems in the company-level data 
used, micro-level explanatory variables are entered in the estimates with a one-period time-lag. The not excessively high value of 0.183 re-ported for the correlation of the residuals from volume and selection equation (Rho) shows that the independent estimation of volume and se-lection equation is only slightly distorted and that the errors of individual estimates are still within acceptable limits; the insignifi  cant Mills ratio also indicates this. The additional results shown by Buch et al (2009) from the separate es-
timates for extensive and intensive margin are therefore likewise valid. A further result from the Heckman model is that certain factors obvi-ously drive the probability of setting up an affi  li-ate in a country, but not the size of the invest-ment. This includes, at fi  rm level, the cash ﬂ  ow. Similarly, country-level variables such as GDP or per capita income of the host country only have an effect on the decision to open an affi  liate, but not on turnover there. Other variables have a similar effect on both margins or – presumably
2 – 
only on the volume.

those 	with	a	small 	cash	flow	stay	“at	home” 	
and	exclusively 	serve 	the	national 	market, 	
while 	medium-sized 	enterprises 	export 	and	
large 	high-earning 	enterprises 	operate 	with	
foreign 	branches. 	The	overlaps 	in	the	data	
make 	it	clear 	that	the	theoretically 	derived 	re-
sults	do	not	apply 	in	every 	individual 	case. 	a	
fundamental 	tendency 	is,	however, 	obvious.
The	research 	papers 	do	not	provide 	a	direct 	
test	for	the	influence 	of	policy 	measures 	on	
enterprises’ 	access 	to	foreign 	markets. 	how-
ever,	economic 	policy 	implications 	can	be	de-
rived 	from 	the	results. 	On	the	one	hand, 	
measures 	that	increase 	the	productivity 	of	
enterprises 	ultimately 	make 	it	easier 	for	them 	
to	become 	active 	in	foreign 	markets. 	On	the	
other 	hand, 	however, 	the	results 	also	high-
light	the	significance 	of	financial 	factors. 	
Thus 	if	enterprises 	lack	access 	to	external 	fi-
nancing, 	this	can	pose 	an	obstacle 	to	foreign 	
investment.
With 	regard 	to	the	implications 	of	the	crisis, 	
how	many 	enterprises 	withdraw 	completely 	
from 	foreign 	markets 	in	the	wake 	of	a	crisis 	is	
of	significance. 	if	withdrawal 	from 	the	mar-
kets	played 	an	important 	role	in	the	adjust -
ment 	process, 	this	would 	have 	longer-term 	consequences 	for	German 	enterprises’ 	eco-
nomic 	activities 	abroad, 	as	the	return 	to	these 	
markets 	entails 	high	entry 	costs. 	by	contrast, 	
if	there 	is	only	a	drop 	in	turnover, 	a	recovery 	
of	the	global 	economy 	also	has	a	direct 	posi-
tive	impact 	on	foreign 	economic 	develop -
ments. 	This	seems 	to	have 	been 	the	case	for	
German 	foreign 	exposures 	in	light	of	the	
marked 	export 	recovery 	from 	2009 	onwards.
Conclusion
unlike 	many 	other 	countries, 	Germany’s 	
cross-border 	direct 	investment 	did	not	experi-
ence 	a	pronounced 	slump 	during 	the	finan -
cial	crisis, 	but	rather 	only	a	moderation 	of	the	
upward 	trend. 	The	willingness 	to	invest 	
abroad 	on	the	one	hand 	and	of	foreign 	in-
vestors 	to	invest 	in	Germany 	on	the	other 	
also	witnessed 	a	rapid 	recovery. 	 yet	uncer -
tainty 	persists, 	as	may	be	inferred 	from 	the	
subdued 	direct 	investment 	activity 	to	date	
during 	2011. 	The	risks	associated 	with	cross-
border 	investments 	are	also	likely 	to	dampen 	
enterprises’ 	direct 	investment 	activities 	given 	
the	increasing 	uncertainty 	during 	the	finan -
cial	crisis 	with	regard 	to	further 	economic 	
and	political 	developments.Implications
