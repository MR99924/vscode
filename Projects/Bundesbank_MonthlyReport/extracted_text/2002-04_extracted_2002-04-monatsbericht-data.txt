ManufacturingDevelopments in manufacturing took a turn
for the better at the end of 2001 and in early2002, although the upturn has so far beenconstrained. There was a slight seasonally ad-justed fall in the volume of new orders in Feb-ruary, for example, but the intake was stillhigher than in the autumn of last year, whenthe most recent low was recorded. TakingJanuary and Februar together, the figure forthe fourth quarter of 2001 was exceeded byaround 1
14% in seasonally adjusted terms.
The year-on-year decline narrowed to 5%,compared with almost -8% in autumn 2001.
Positive stimuli were generated by foreign de-
mand for German manufactured products.The level of new orders in the first twomonths of this year was a seasonally adjusted2
34% higher than in the final quarter of
2001. This meant that orders were now onlyaround 3
14% down on the year, compared
with -9% in the fourth quarter of 2001. Inthe two-month period of January and Febru-ary, domestic orders stabilised, seasonally ad-justed, at the low level of the precedingmonths. The year-on-year fall, at 6
14%, was
only slightly lower than in the final quarter of2001 (-6
34%).
In February, output fell back again in compari-
son with the previous month, when produc-tion had been stepped up sharply owing tothe surge in orders at the end of 2001. Never-theless, taking February and January to-gether, output was still
14% up on the fourthIncoming

6quarter of 2001. Owing to a baseline effect,
the decline over 12 months widened to5
12%, having been 4% in the October to
December period.
ConstructionThere were no discernible expansionary stim-
uli in the construction industry at the start of2002 either. In seasonally adjusted terms, thevolume of new construction orders in Januaryand February did, in fact, increase comparedwith December, when a new low had beenreached, but was scarcely up on the averagelevel of the fourth quarter. Business activityremained 4
34% down on the comparable
period of 2001.
The industrial sector, in particular, was re-
strained in terms of placing new orders inJanuary and February, with the figure beingalmost 3% down on the start of 2001. Inresidential construction, demand remainedunchanged at a low level. It was only publicsector customers that placed a significantlygreater number of new orders than in the lastfew months of 2001.
Construction output, which had been very
much held back in January by the cold winterweather, returned to normal in February. Tak-ing both months together and after eliminat-ing seasonal variations, output was some-what below its level in autumn of last year.The figure was still 3% down on the year.Economic conditions in Germany*

7Labour market
In the first few months of the year, the labour
market was still feeling the impact of the cyc-lical slowdown. There was, for example, afurther decline in the seasonally adjustednumber of persons in work in January (morerecent statistical data are unavailable atpresent). At almost 25,000 persons, themonth-on-month fall was somewhat sharperthan before. The cold winter weather, whichrestricted employment in the outdoor occu-pations, was a contributory factor in this. Theyear-on-year fall widened to 130,000 per-sons, or 0.3%. Not least, the manufacturingand construction sectors have made furtherreductions in their workforces. At the sametime, there was a further increase in short-time working. At almost 260,000, almosttwice as many employees were on short-timework as 12 months previously.
At the end of March, the number of persons
registered as unemployed fell to a seasonallyadjusted 3.97 million, ie around 8,000 fewerthan in the previous month. The year-on-yearrise decreased to 155,000, compared with185,000 in February. The seasonally adjustedunemployment rate, as defined by the Fed-eral Labour Office, stayed unchanged at9.6%; the relevant figure in accordance withinternational standards was 8.1%.
The slight fall in unemployment registered at
the labour exchanges cannot be explained byan incipient cyclical improvement. It is, infact, mainly due to intensified efforts in termsof job placement by the labour exchanges:many of those who were asked to take amore active part in looking for a job reacted
to this by ceasing to register as unemployed.
PricesPrice developments in Germany have been
marked recently by a further significant rise ininternational oil prices. In early April, thequotations for a barrel of Brent North Sea Oilwent up for a time to US$27
12. At the time
this report went to press, the price had goneback down to around US$25, but even thissignifies an increase of around US$6, or one-third, compared with January, when the low-est figure for this year was recorded. Besidesa gradual rise in demand owing to the globaleconomic upturn, the main reason for the (insome cases, excessive and speculation-driven)price surge lay in the increasing political risksin the Middle East.
According to the official price measurement,
consumer prices for petrol and heating oilwent up 4.1% month on month in March.This played a major part in the higher-than-average seasonal rise in the consumer priceindex. The year-on-year rate of increase,which had gone down to 1.7% in February,went back up to 1.8%. Excluding energy, therate in March, as in February, was 2.1%.

8lion. The Federal Government (ie central gov-
ernment) was responsible for just over half ofthis amount ( 32.7 billion). While the Federal
Government reduced its outstanding moneymarket loans by 30.9 billion and redeemed
liabilities in the amount of 37.9 billion, it con-
currently tapped the capital market for 311.5
billion gross. Sales of five-year special Federalbonds (Bobls) alone yielded 39.7 billion. After
redeeming the series which matured in Febru-ary, the Federal Government recorded a netinflow from Bobls of 33.2 billion. In addition,
it raised 31.2 billion and 30.3 billion, respect-
ively, by running down its market manage-ment stocks of Federal bonds (Bunds) andtwo-year Federal Treasury notes (Schätze).Central government repaid bank loans to thenet value of 31 billion. These consisted almost
exclusively of loan liabilities for two off-budget special funds – the Redemption Fund
for Inherited Liabilities and the Federal Rail-ways Fund – which are now recorded directlyunder the Federal Government.
TheLand Governments (state government)
borrowed 31.8 billion on balance in February.
They raised 31.8 billion gross and 30.8 billion
net from issuing Treasury notes and bonds.Issuing activity was concentrated on the threestates of Berlin, Hesse and Schleswig-Hol-stein. Although in the past few states havelaunched issues with a maturity of less thanone year, Schleswig-Holstein borrowed 3
14
billion by issuing a Treasury note running for
six months. While repaying loans against bor-rowers’ notes in the amount of 31.4 billion
on balance, the Land Governments simultan-
eously incurred additional liabilities amount-ing to 32.3 billion in the form of short-term
cash advances from banks. No significantflows were recorded by the “German Unity”Fund and the ERP Special Fund. Local govern-ment probably increased its indebtednessagain in February.
Federal Government borrowingIn March the Federal Government once again
expanded its indebtedness significantly by35.0 billion. In contrast to February it drew
exclusively on the money market, whereas itcut its liabilities on the capital market by 31.5
billion: gross borrowing of 39.0 billion was
more than offset by redemptions amountingto310.5 billion. Sales of Schätze yielded 30.4
billion for central government as the net out-come of a new issue ( 35.7 billion), market

9The sale of Bunds and Bobls from market
management stocks raised 31.8 billion. Net
redemptions were recorded for both Federalsavings bonds (- 32.1 billion) and bank loans
(-31.5 billion).
In the first quarter of 2002 the Federal Gov-
ernment’s indebtedness rose by 320.5 billion.
In the first quarter of 2001 net borrowinghad totalled 317 billion (after adjustment
for exceptional redemptions of equalisationclaims). The change in capital market debt inthe first three months of this year amountedto336.6 billion gross and 35.4 billion net,
which was in line with the volumes projectedby the issuance calendar. The Federal Govern-ment’s money market indebtedness rosesteeply by 315.2 billion. The fact that the
amount borrowed in the first quarter (as re-corded in the above market flows) almostequals the estimated net borrowing require-ment for the whole of 2002 of 321 billion
does not necessarily have implications for thelikely volume of actual net borrowing up tothe end of this year (as recorded in the gov-ernment budget accounts).
Concerning the structural profile of capital
market debt, the declining trend seen forquite some time now in liabilities in the formof Federal savings bonds (- 33.8 billion) and
loans against borrowers’ notes (- 33.0 billion)
persisted in the first quarter of this year. Thefall in the latter owes much to maturing loansof the off-budget Federal special funds. In thecase of the Federal savings bonds, the out-standing volume of which has decreased bywell over half during the past four years, thedecrease reflects the continuing relativelysubdued demand for these securities. Thus in
the first quarter, maturing Federal savingsbonds amounting to 34.3 billion contrasted
with fresh sales of only 30.5 billion. The de-
cline in the outstanding volume of Treasurydiscount paper (Bubills) (- 34.3 billion) is only
temporary because the monthly issue of 35
billion worth of such paper, starting in April,will lead to a sizeable increase in circulation.The outstanding amount of Bobls (+ 33.4 bil-
lion), by contrast, has already been affectedby the announced increase in standard vol-umes.
With regard to the financing terms for new
issues, the Federal Government met with dis-tinctly more favourable conditions in the firstquarter of this year compared with the firstquarter of 2001 for securities of less than oneFederal Government net borrowing in

Securities markets
Bond marketIn February, domestic borrowers issued bonds
in the German market to the market value of372.5 billion, compared with 397.8 billion in
the previous month. Net of redemptions, andafter taking due account of changes in is-suers’ holdings of their own bonds, net salescame to 311.7 billion, compared with 319.6
billion in January. The lower net sales com-pared with the previous month, were mainlydue to smaller issues of commercial paper,particularly by enterprises. Foreign bondswere sold in the German market to the extentof35.8 billion net; more than 50% of this
sum was denominated in foreign currencies.Overall, net sales of domestic and foreignbonds yielded 317.5 billion in February, com-
pared with 323.2 billion a month before.
The major part of the amount raised accrued
to credit institutions. They received 313.1 bil-
lion net from sales of their own bonds, com-pared with only 36.5 billion in January. Public
Pfandbriefe, which were sold to the extent of37.5 billion net, were in the forefront, fol-
lowed by other bank debt securities, at 35.8
billion. The outstanding amount of mortgagePfandbriefe increased by 31.6 billion, where-
as debt securities issued by specialised creditinstitutions were redeemed to the extent of
31.7 billion net.
In February, corporate bonds were repur-
chased to the extent of 33.4 billion, after re-
cord sales of 36.6 billion had been recorded
in January.
In February, the outstanding amount of public
sector bonds increased by 32.0 billion net.
The Federal Government received 34.8 billion
net from sales of debt securities, andlaunched five-year special Federal bonds(Bobls) totalling 39.4 billion by tender. On bal-
ance, the outstanding amount of such paperrose by 32.9 billion. Ten-year Bund issues and
two-year Federal Treasury notes (Schätze)were sold to the value of 31.2 billion and
30.3 billion net, respectively. Thirty-year
issues were sold to the tune of 30.2 billion
net.
1Bonds of the former Federal Post Office
worth 32.8 billion were redeemed. The Land
Governments reduced their bonded debt by30.2 billion.
No euro/Deutsche Mark bonds were issued
by non-residents under the lead managementof German syndicates in February. Owing toredemptions, the outstanding amount ofsuch paper, still in part denominated inDeutsche Mark, declined by 35.7 billion.

tions increased their bond portfolios by 310.3
billion, with bank debt securities predominat-ing, at 35.5 billion. Public sector bonds and
securities issued by non-residents were soldto the amount of 33.9 billion net and 32.6
billion, respectively. Non-banks investedmainly in domestic debt securities ( 37.1 bil-
lion), purchasing nothing but bonds issued byprivate borrowers. Foreign investors reducedtheir buying in the German bond market by33.3 billion.
Equity marketIn February, issuing activity in the German
equity market continued to be quite sub-dued. Domestic enterprises placed newshares to the market value of only 30.7 billion
(January: 31.5 billion). On balance, foreign
equities were sold in the German market tothe value of 34.6 billion, compared with 35.6
billion a month before. Altogether, domesticand foreign equities totalling 35.2 billion
were sold in the German equity market inFebruary.
In February, domestic non-banks bought
equities worth 310.8 billion (net). Domestic
credit institutions, by contrast, reduced theirequity portfolios by 36.6 billion net. On bal-
ance, they only sold domestic paper. Foreigninvestors purchased German equities worth31.0 billion net. They predominantly engaged
in portfolio investments.Investment fund certificates
The amount raised by domestic investment
funds came to 36.4 billion in February, com-
pared with 311.5 billion in January. Almost
two-thirds of those funds were invested infunds open to the general public. As in theprevious month, the major part accrued toopen-end real estate funds, at 31.8 billion.

12of32.5 billion; that was slightly less than in
the previous month ( 33.2 billion). The total
amount raised from sales of domestic andforeign investment fund certificates thuscame to 39.0 billion.
The investment fund certificates were pre-
dominantly bought by domestic non-banks(37.6 billion), which mainly purchased do-
mestic fund certificates. Non-residentsbought certificates of German funds amount-ing to 31.0 billion. Credit institutions’ hold-
ings of investment fund certificates went upby30.4 billion.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account – the combined
outcome of foreign trade, services, factor in-come and current transfers – ran a surplus of33.4 billion in February compared with one of
only 30.5 billion a month earlier.
According to calculations by the Federal Stat-
istical Office, there was a surplus of 310.2 bil-
lion on trade in goods in February comparedwith a surplus of 310.1 billion in January.
After the elimination of seasonal factors,however, the trade surplus was slightly small-er in February (at 39.7 billion compared with
311.5 billion the month before). This was pri-
marily the result of a sharp (seasonally adjust-ed) rise of 7% in the volume of importedgoods in February compared with Januarywhen the level was relatively low. If the firsttwo months of the current year are taken to-gether, however, imports were still 3
12%
below the figure in the final two months of2001. German exports of goods rose by a
seasonally adjusted 2% between January andFebruary. In a two-month comparison therewas a slight increase of 1%. Developments inforeign trade were not due to price move-ments as the prices of both exports and im-ports remained virtually unchanged in sea-sonally adjusted terms in February.
At36.5 billion, the deficit on invisible current
transactions with non-residents in Februarywas 32.6 billion below the previous month’s
level. This was due to the reduced net ex-penditure on factor income ( 30.3 billion in
February compared with 35.8 billion in Janu-
ary) and the smaller deficit on services ( 33.2
billion). This was accompanied by net ex-penditure (of 33.0 billion) on current trans-
fers. There had been a surplus of 30.7 billion
in this segment in January owing to paymentsreceived from the EU budget.
As in the previous two months, cross-border
portfolio investment again resulted in netcapital outflows – of 313.2 billion – in Febru-
ary. This development in the month under re-view was due mainly to the fact that foreignsecurities were again in great demand ( 311.8
billion) from German investors, who spent al-most equal amounts on shares ( 33.4 billion),
investment fund certificates ( 32.5 billion),
bonds and notes ( 33.6 billion) and money
market paper ( 32.3 billion). The operations of
non-resident investors also led to net capitaloutflows ( 31.3 billion) whereas in the previ-
ous month these had resulted in a net influxof funds ( 33.5 billion). It was predominantly

13non-residents sold in the month under re-
view. By contrast, net amounts of shares andinvestment fund certificates (each worth 31.0
billion) and privately issued bonds worth 31.5
billion were taken up by non-residents.
Net amounts of funds ( 32.6 billion) went
abroad through direct investment, too, inFebruary. In the course of this, German pro-prietors provided their foreign subsidiarieswith 37.5 billion net, mostly in the form of
loans. Conversely, foreign enterprises alsostrengthened their presence in Germany,resulting in capital imports of 34.9 billion.
Enterprises and individuals recently imported
35.4 billion (net) through statistically recorded
non-securitised credit transactions. They didso both by taking up short-term loans abroadand by drawing on their foreign bank bal-ances. By contrast, the external transactionsof general government were almost in bal-ance (- 30.2 billion). The credit transactions of
the banking system as a whole, which maylargely be interpreted as the outcome of allother statistically recorded external trans-actions, resulted in net capital exports of 35.8
billion in the month under review. This wasdue solely to outflows (of 37.3 billion)
through the external operations of the creditinstitutions while there were net liabilities(of31.5 billion) incurred by the Bundesbank
(primarily in connection with the paymentsystem TARGET).

15Government
benefits for familiesThe financial consequences of bringing
up children are reflected in additionalexpenditures but also in income lossesif a parent gives up her/his job orswitches to part-time working. Generalgovernment assumes a substantial partof these costs by providing largely freeeducation and subsidising childcare in-stitutions, but also by means of trans-fers and tax benefits. The scale and na-ture of these government activities areultimately an expression of societalpreferences. They largely defy an ob-jective evaluation, and it is not the in-tention of this article to judge suchgovernment activities. Instead, follow-ing a brief general analysis, the articleprovides an overview of the variousbenefits granted to families by generalgovernment and of their developmentover the past decade. The cumulativeimpact of these government benefitson the incomes of standardised house-holds is illustrated using several model-case calculations. Looking to the futuredevelopment of family policy benefits,attention must be paid to the fiscal re-quirement to ensure a sustainable pub-lic finance trend by reducing the gov-ernment expenditure ratio. Given thatconstraint, any further increases infamily policy benefits can be financedsolely by reallocating resources withingeneral government budgets.

16The nature of and reason for public
benefits for children
General government provides benefits in nu-
merous ways to ease the burden on familieswith children. For example, many non-cashbenefits are provided in Germany; these not-ably include the largely free provision of edu-cation and the subsidisation of childcare facil-ities. In addition, special child-related cashtransfers are paid or tax allowances provided(for details see box on page 18).
Pursuant to the principle of social equity em-
bodied in the Basic Law (Article 20), the gov-ernment is required to secure the subsistencelevel of its citizens, where necessary throughtransfer payments. Families who cannot bearthe financial strains that are inevitably associ-ated with bringing up children themsleveshave the right to claim support. In the firstplace the basic requirements in respect ofchildren are largely met by the provision ofnon-cash and cash benefits by general gov-ernment; any remaining gaps are thencovered by social assistance. The precisescope and the nature of the assistance pro-vided by the state to ensure that familiesreach the subsistence level is ultimately a pol-itical decision.
Furthermore, the additional expenditure
which rearing children inevitably entails re-duces families’ tax-paying potential. As ageneral principle, therefore, only incomewhich exceeds the subsistence level (as de-fined in social assistance legislation) is subjectto taxation. This means that families’ basicmaintenance requirement for children shouldnot be taxed. Above all, the Federal Constitu-
tional Court has repeatedly underscored thisprinciple and prompted Parliament to takeappropriate action.
In addition, various benefits are granted for
children or for particular life and income situ-ations of parents. These include child-rearingbenefit, extra assistance for parents who areunemployed or who are buying a home aswell as claims on the statutory pension insur-ance scheme in respect of years spent bring-ing up children.
Government activity redistributes income
across the life-cycle of individuals. Whereasextensive government transfers are receivedduring childhood and youth (and again afterretirement), people generally make net pay-ments to government throughout their work-ing life. Such an intertemporal transfer sys-tem has considerable redistribution effectsboth within and between generations. Thelatter applies particularly whenever significantchanges in benefit levels or major demo-graphic shifts occur.
The issue of the scope and nature of child-
related transfers in Germany is currently alsobeing considered in the context of demo-graphic developments, which are leading to aconsiderable ageing of the population.
1Thus
the continued existence of the pay-as-you-gostatutory pension insurance scheme is also re-liant in the long term on the rearing of chil-dren.
1Whereas in 1960 each German woman gave birth to
an average of 2.4 surviving children in her lifetime, in
1999 the figure had fallen to 1.4.Cash and non-

17Also of relevance in this connection is the
question of the link between rearing childrenand employment. Key factors in this contextare the revenue losses resulting from inter-rupting or giving up work – usually affectingthe mother – and the (frequently insufficient)availability of affordable childcare facilities. Itshould also be borne in mind that the deci-sion as to whether or not to return to work isstrongly distorted by the tax and social secur-ity system. This is because the parent has topay, out of his/her net income after deductionof tax and social security contributions, theincome of the child carers, which in turn isalso subject to government levies. The taxwedge – which distorts the labour supplydecision – between gross income and the netincome left after deducting the cost of child-care is therefore particularly large.
General government expenditure
in connection with rearing children
A look at the child-rearing costs borne by the
government in 2000 shows first that tax reliefmeasures for parents were very extensive (seethe table on page 19 for details). As a generalprinciple, the component of income requiredto assure the subsistence level for children isexempt from income tax. Since 1996 this taxexemption has largely taken the form of childbenefit, which is granted independently ofthe level of income and is offset against wagetax receipts. Alternatively, parents may claima tax allowance for financially assuring thebasic needs of their children if this – for high-er income earners – provides greater relief tothe beneficiary than child benefit. If familyallowances had been paid in 2000 solely in
the form of this (constitutionally mandatory)income tax allowance, this would have de-pressed tax receipts by 320
12billion. As it
was, the total burden resulting from the fam-ily allowance system totalled just over 331
12
billion. Hence the “real” extent of govern-
ment assistance in 2000 amounted to only311 billion, ie the difference compared with
the payment of a pure tax-free allowance.
Another kind of financial assistance to par-
ents is the increment granted for each child inconnection with the home buyer’s allowance;according to the Federal Government’s Sub-sidy Report, this led to tax shortfalls of justover 32 billion in 2000.
2Moreover, the in-
come ceiling up to which this allowance isclaimable, which has been reduced since2000, also rises with the number of children(the associated additional costs are not re-corded). Further revenue shortfalls of 33 bil-
lion resulted in 2000 from various othermeasures, primarily the (temporary) house-hold allowance for single parents plus main-tenance and education allowances. In total,child-related tax measures in 2000 added upto over 337 billion.

On top of these tax relief measures, parents
also benefit from direct expenditures of

lion from the preceding arrangement for assisting home
buyers pursuant to section 34f of the Income Tax Act.
3The common practice of jointly assessing the tax liabil-
ity of spouses (the validity of which has largely been up-
held by the Federal Constitutional Court), which in 2001
curtailed tax revenue by 323 billion compared with the
amount which would have been raised if each spouse
had been assessed separately, is dependent on marital
status and therefore cannot be considered a promotional
measure related to children, even though the bulk of this
benefit accrues to families with children.Distortion of

18Statutory benefits for families with children
Tax measures
Child benefit: Paid for children up to the age of 18, if un-
employed up to 21 years of age and if in full-time educa-tion up to 27 (extended by the length of military or non-
military service). As from 2002, it amounts to 5154 per
month for each of the first three children and 5179 for all
other children (2000: DM270 for the first and second child,DM300 for the third child and DM350 for all other chil-
dren).
Children’s tax allowance: Granted as part of the family al-
lowance system as an alternative to child benefit if the in-come tax assessment shows that this allowance is more ad-
vantageous to the recipient. It is a tax-free allowance for
the subsistence level of children and as from 2002 amountsto53,648 (2000: DM6,912). Even if only child benefit is
paid, the children’s tax allowance reduces the solidarity
surcharge assessment base.
Childcare allowance: This tax allowance, which is likewise
offset against child benefit and which from 2002 includes a
child-rearing and education allowance, amounts to 52,160
(2000: DM3,024 for children under 16).
Tax deduction for proven childcare expenses: From 2002
such expenses exceeding 51,548 for children under the age
of 14 can be deducted from the income tax assessment
base up to 51,500.
Education allowance: Granted for children aged 18 and
over living away from home and in full-time education;
amounts to 5924. The wider education allowance granted
until the end of 2001 up to a maximum of DM4,200 hasbeen integrated into the childcare allowance.
Household allowance: Granted to single parents in 2002 in
the amount of 52,340; will be progressively phased out by
2005 (2000: DM5,616).
Maintenance allowance: Ceiling for the deduction of
maintenance expenses for persons for whom no child ben-efit can be claimed; amounts to 57,188 (2000: DM13,500).
Home buyers’ allowance: The tax grant paid to home
buyers since 1996 for a period of eight years, amountingannually to 52,556 for new properties and 51,278 for older
properties, is increased by 5767 per child. In addition, the
income ceiling for claiming the grant is raised by 515,339
per child.
Transfers from central, state and local government
Child-rearing benefit: Paid by the Federal Government for
a maximum of 24 months following the child’s birth, if theparent works no more than 30 hours per week (prior to2001: 19 hours); amounts to 5307. It is paid during the first
six months if the annual (net) income does not exceed
538,247 for single parents and 551,129 for married couples.
In the following months the benefit is graduated accord-ing to income. There is an income ceiling, up to which nodeductions are made, of 513,498 for single parents and
516,464 for married couples (until the end of 2000:
DM23,700 and DM29,400 respectively). Since 2001, eligiblepersons who satisfy these requirements have, alternatively,been able to draw 5460 per month over a period of twelve
months (“budget”). Income which exceeds the ceiling re-
duces the monthly claim by just over 4% of this additionalincome (or 6% in the case of the “budget”). In the case oftwo children or more, the income ceiling is, at present,
52,797 higher per additional child (2000: DM4,200).
Pension claims for periods of child-rearing: Since July 2000
parents with children born after 1991 are credited averagecontributions to the statutory pension insurance scheme
for three years. The Federal Government pays the corre-
sponding amounts to the scheme.Social assistance: Children have an age-related claim to so-
cial assistance which ranges from 55% to 90% of the stan-
dard rate applying to the head of the household (at pre-sent up to around 5290 per month depending on the indi-
vidual state). Furthermore, additional assistance is also
available to children for special requirements. Single par-
ents with small children can claim additional assistanceamounting to 40% of the standard rate. Other income (forchildren, in particular, child benefit less a “bonus” of 510)
is deducted from the gross claim in order to calculate the
payment amount.
Study grant: Pupils in further education and students can
claim a grant financed jointly by central and state govern-
ment if the income and savings of their family do not ex-
ceed a certain ceiling. The current maximum claim is 5583
per month. However, students receive only half of thisamount as a free grant; the rest must be repaid on prefer-
ential terms after they have completed their studies.
Maintenance advance: Paid to single mothers with chil-
dren under 12 years of age by local government, in accor-
dance with the Standard Rate Regulation, for a maximum
of 72 months if the father fails to meet his maintenanceobligation or pays less than the minimum amount. A max-imum of 5111 per month is currently paid for children
under 6 in the west German states.
Housing allowance: The housing allowance claim partly
depends on the size of the household. Each child (as wellas another adult) leads to a higher rent subsidy if income
remains unchanged.
Unemployment assistance: After exhausting their entitle-
ment to unemployment benefit, unemployed persons may
receive means-tested unemployment assistance from the
Federal Government. If there are children in the house-hold, the assistance amounts to 57% of the net pay at thetime of employment, compared with a level of 53% forchildless claimants.
Benefits through the social security funds
Co-insurance for children under the health insurance fund:
As long as children do not exceed certain income limits,
they are co-insured for free with the statutory health insur-ance funds of their parents, up to the age of 25 (extendedby the length of military or non-military service). However,if the main earner in the family is insured privately, children
are not co-insured in the statutory health insurance fund.
Maternity benefit: As a rule, six weeks before and eight
weeks after the birth, the statutory health insurance fund
reimburses the mother’s loss of net earnings up to 513 per
day (2000: DM25). In the case of mothers who are insuredprivately, the Federal Government pays a lump sum of, atpresent 5210. For all mothers, whether insured privately or
with the statutory health insurance fund, the employer
makes up the difference between 513 and her previous net
earnings.
Surviving dependants’ pension: The 2001 pension reform
stipulates that, for spouses who were born after 1961 or
who married after 2001, the surviving dependants’ pensionincreases depending on the number of children they haveraised. For the first child two contribution years will be
considered at average income levels and for all other chil-
dren one year.
Orphan’s pension: If at least one parent with a pension
claim dies, the children receive benefits from the statutory
pension insurance scheme.
Unemployment benefit: Unemployed persons with chil-
dren can claim 67% of their previous net earnings from the
unemployment insurance fund compared with 60% for
childless claimants.

19central, state and local government. Child-
rearing benefit is paid by the Federal Govern-ment for a maximum of 24 months after thebirth of a child if one parent stops working orworks less as long as certain income thresh-olds are not exceeded. The Federal Govern-ment spent a total of 33
12billion on this
benefit in 2000.4
In the case of social assistance, benefits forchildren mainly take the form of current cost-of-living subsidies. At the end of 2000, 2.7million persons were receiving such assistanceof whom 1 million were under the age of 18.The latest Social Report put the social assist-ance benefits for married couples and fam-ilies in 2000 at just under 32.8 billion. How-
ever, it should also be borne in mind that theother government benefits for children arelargely offset against social assistance. On topof this were remedial measures for childrenand help to ensure an adequate school edu-cation, which resulted in expenditureamounting to 31.4 billion. Like the income
tax exemption for subsistence requirements,child-related social assistance is derived fromthe government duty to ensure a minimumlevel of existence for the population.
Since 1986 periods of child-rearing have been
included when calculating the retirementpension payable under the statutory pensioninsurance scheme. The underlying idea is tomake up the parent’s lost contributions dur-Benefits granted for families with

20ing the first phase of the child’s life, when it
needs particularly intensive childcare. SinceJune 1999 the Federal Government has paidseparately recorded contributions to thestatutory pension insurance scheme to fi-nance credits for periods of child-rearing aris-ing in the same year.
5Since these additional
pension claims have been significantly ex-tended but only subsequently result in pen-sion expenditure, the Federal Government’scorresponding contributions to the statutorypension insurance scheme in 2000 ( 311
12bil-
lion) far exceeded the scheme’s related bene-fit payments (almost 35
12billion). However,
these contributions are not set aside but in-stead are used to finance current expend-iture, thus enabling the current contributionrate to the statutory pension insurancescheme to be lowered to a corresponding ex-tent. The higher claims will burden contribu-tion payers at a later date, over and abovethe probably generally rising level of socialsecurity contributions.
Including several other support measures
(education assistance, maintenance advance,supplements to housing allowance and un-employment assistance as well as incrementsfor children paid to public-sector employees),child-related transfers amounted to roughly327 billion in 2000.
6
The expenditure of central, state and local
government in connection with childcare andeducation is even more extensive. However,most of these benefits cover a necessary min-imum requirement in respect of children. Thealternative of financing such costs by char-ging them to the user would inevitably entailhigher tax allowances and social assistance
expenditure for children. According to the an-nual accounts statistics for 1999 (the latestavailable), spending on nursery schools, netof revenue, amounted to almost 37
12billion.
Assistance for young people is aimed at com-bating special problems connected with rais-ing, educating and looking after youngpeople, eg by providing accommodation in achildren’s home or with foster parents. Thecost of this to public finance in 2000 was38 billion.
Net expenditure on general schools and voca-
tional colleges less fees and other receiptsamounted in 1999 to almost 342 billion.
School administration, pupil transport andother school-related expenditure, such ascounselling and homework assistance, costcentral, state and local government an add-itional 33

tiary education, according to the 1999/2000Education Finance Report of the Bund-LänderKommission, reached almost 310

Altogether, the volume of non-cash transfers
totalled 371 billion.
Besides central, state and local government,
the social security funds also provide specialbenefits for families with children. The mostimportant such measure is the free co-

on the contribution rate, average wages and salaries and
the total number of children under three years of age.
Prior to that, the cost of upgrading parents’ pension
claims for periods of child-rearing was included as a
lump-sum as part of the general Federal grant to the
statutory pension insurance scheme.
6Families with children are also given preferential treat-
ment in the field of public housing. The size of these
benefits cannot be quantified, however.

insurance funds. In 2000, 13.8 million peopleunder the age of 20 profited from this ar-rangement. In financial terms (based on age-related expenditure profiles of the health in-surance funds) this support may be estimatedat311
12billion. Including other elements
(birth-related non-cash benefits, maternitybenefit, pension entitlements for survivingdependants and orphans, and higher un-employment benefit claims), the totalamount of assistance related to childrengranted by the social security funds amount-ed to 316 billion in 2000.
When totalled (notwithstanding the different
reporting years),
8the list of general govern-
ment benefits granted to families with chil-dren adds up to a grand total of 3150 billion.
As already mentioned, however, a good partof this does not represent extra governmentaid but rather serves to meet mandatory in-come tax allowances for the subsistence ofchildren or finances benefits intended to safe-guard a minimum level of existence in the con-text of social assistance. Furthermore, child-re-lated expenditure is funded from governmentrevenue, a considerable part of which is paidby families with children themselves. Based ona rough calculation of this share contributedby families themselves, households containingchildren financed about one-third of the bene-fits provided to them in 2000.

The development of benefits in the 1990s
Between 1992 and 1999 (the latest year for
which detailed annual accounts statistics areavailable) general government benefits for
families with children increased by almostone-third to just over DM290 billion (or closeto3150 billion), which was much steeper
than the rise in the overall expenditure ofgeneral government.
10In terms of GDP , too,
an increase from 7.1% to 7.6% was record-ed; it was concentrated on the years between1995 and 1999 (see table on page 22 for de-tails).
Looking at the different types of benefit, tax
concessions (adjusted for the changeover ofthe family allowance system in 1996) in-creased most – by just over half. In 1996 thedual system of a children’s tax allowance plusthe additional payment of child benefit wasreplaced by a unified system in which a chil-dren’s tax allowance was only provided as analternative to child benefit. The latter is nowthe primary benefit and is offset againstwage tax. At the time of the changeover theannual tax-free allowance – following rulingsof the Federal Constitutional Court – wasraised sharply starting from DM4,104 toDM6,264 and then DM6,912 in 1997.Lower-income households were given extraassistance in that, after the changeover, themonthly child benefit for this group clearlyexceeded the value of the alternative tax-freeallowance and was raised considerably in1999 to DM250 for each of the first two chil-
8The addition of benefits from various reporting years
appears acceptable – also given the uncertainties which
exist anyway – because the expenditure recorded in 1999
probably changed little in 2000.
9This estimate is based on data from the 1998 sample
survey of income and expenditure (regarding turnover
tax) and the wage and income tax statistics of the Federal
Statistical Office.

23dren. In addition, the tax breaks for families
with children buying their own home wereconsiderably expanded, which was respon-sible for a large part of the overall growth inhousing subsidies. The additional homebuyer’s allowance for each child, which hadpreviously amounted to between DM600 andDM1,000, was raised to DM1,500 per year.
Expenditure on child-related benefits by cen-
tral, state and local government increased byalmost one-third during the period under re-view. The growth of social assistance, whichwas concentrated on the first half of the1990s, resulted particularly from the increasein the number of minors receiving benefit andthe marked rise in the defined requirementlevels up to the mid-1990s. By contrast, theFederal Government’s contributions to thestatutory pension insurance scheme creditedfor periods of child-rearing rose most sharplyafter 1995. They were fuelled partly by the in-crease in the contribution rate and partly bythe fact that the level of earnings credited forthe three-year period was raised in stagesfrom 75% to 100% of average earnings as ofJuly 2000. Furthermore, as from July 1998contributions paid by a parent in employmentare in effect no longer offset against the gov-ernment credits. Expenditure on child-rearingbenefit has remained virtually level on bal-ance. Although the entitlement period wasextended from 18 to 24 months for childrenborn after 1993, this was offset by the mar-ginal decrease in the number of births andthe fact that the income ceiling for claimingthis central government benefit was notraised up to the end of 2000.The non-cash benefits granted by central,
state and local government increased sharplyuntil the mid-1990s but thereafter went uponly marginally. For example, the obligationimposed by Parliament on local authorities toguarantee every child aged between threeand six a place in a nursery school as from1996 considerably accelerated the growth inexpenditure for these institutions in the firsthalf of the 1990s. For education but also forassistance for young people the relativelysharp increase in wages and salaries in thepublic sector which occurred at this timepresumably pushed up expenditure substan-tially, whereas the weaker trend in incomegrowth subsequently had a dampening ef-fect. Expenditure on non-cash benefits in-creased by one-fifth in all between 1992 and1999.
Social security benefits, too, grew strongly
until 1995 and then much more slowly up to1999. Over the whole period these benefitsincreased by one-quarter. Expenditure by thestatutory health insurance fund on co-insuredfamily members under 20 years of age wentup by the largest rate. This was due not onlyto an increase in the number of co-insuredchildren and youngsters but also to theballooning trend in health spending. Thematernity-related benefits of the statutoryhealth insurance funds likewise expandedsharply.

24Effects of general government benefits
on households’ income
The level of general government benefits and
statutory private transfers may appear limitedwhen considered individually. For parents,however, they often have a sizeable cumula-tive impact on the amount of disposable in-come. This is illustrated below using model-case calculations for 2002 which only takeinto account those benefits that directly af-fect disposable income. In particular, non-cash benefits and the crediting of periods ofchild-rearing in the statutory pension insur-ance scheme are excluded.
In most cases, the labour income of one par-
ent ceases or at least decreases following thebirth of a child. The income effects of family-related transfers which are then paid as asubstitute are calculated by comparing thedisposable income after the birth with an in-come not affected by reduced employmentdue to child-bearing. This corresponds to acomparison with similarly structured house-holds without children. However, this doesnot capture the complete change in thestandard of living because children increasethe family’s requirements. To be able to in-clude this in a rough approximation, the dis-posable incomes are additionally measured inrelation to the social assistance claims of thevarious types of household, which capturesthe minimum level of additional requirementsrelated to children.
The situation of parents varies greatly with re-
gard to the level of labour income, maritalstatus and whether or not they take up (part-time) employment after the birth of the child.
Also, the level of some benefits is graduatedover time, so that the age of the child alsoplays an important role. In order to take thedifferences on board, the analysis is based onstandardised cases, with a trade-off betweena realistic view comprising many types ofcases and a simplifying overview. In the fol-lowing analysis, three different income levels(half average, average and double average in-come) are combined with the two differentfamily types “single mother” and “marriedcouple”, each with one child. In addition, theassumption/resumption of part-time employ-ment in the child’s second year is also con-sidered. The comparison covers the periodfrom the start of maternity leave prior to thechild’s birth until the child’s fourth year(which largely reflects the situation in the fol-lowing years). The assumptions made aresummarised in the Annex (for the detailedresults, see the table on page 25 and theaccompanying charts).
The change in disposable income after the
birth of a child, if the parent stops workingcompletely, strongly depends on the level oflabour income earned before the birth. For asingle parent who, prior to the birth, earnedhalf the average income, disposable incomein the first two years after the birth is roughlytwo-fifths higher. Besides child-rearing bene-fit, this increase is due predominantly to thefact that social assistance is paid according toneed. As it is assumed that the father likewisehas a low labour income, maintenance pay-ments contribute only a limited amount tothe single mother’s overall income. Compared

26with an income derived solely from social as-
sistance, she still marginally improves her lot.
If the mother had earned an average level of
income prior to the child’s birth, her dispos-able income declines noticeably. Althoughthe mother receives maintenance paymentsfrom the father in the first few years, they areoffset against government transfers. Com-pared with the social assistance level, thepost-birth income drops considerably. Where-
as before the birth the mother earned almosttwice the social assistance level, her incomein the two years following the birth is onlyabout one-third higher.
Single parents whose income before the birth
was double the national average sustain byfar the largest losses. Their disposable incomein the year of the child’s birth is almost one-third below the level without a child and inthe second year (after payment of the rela-tively high maternity benefit has stopped), itis nearly two-fifths lower. In this case, themaintenance payments from the father ini-tially have a predominant share in the house-hold income.
11Government transfers, by
comparison, have little significance given therelatively high level of maintenance stipulatedby family law. While the income positiondrops dramatically in relation to the social as-sistance level compared with that of a house-hold without children, it is still considerablyhigher than that minimum standard. Whenchild-rearing benefit and the mother’s main-tenance cease to be paid, however, singleparents in all income groups fall to the socialassistance level unless they take up employ-ment again.
One issue that is of relevance in the context
of social and labour market policy is the ex-tent to which single parents can improvetheir financial situation by going back to%

27work. By resuming their former employment
on a half-time basis in the second year afterthe child’s birth, low income earners do notimprove their position significantly – evenleaving aside the question of childcare costs.Their disposable income increases by only14% as a result of going back to work. Themain reason for this is that the income fromemployment is largely counterbalanced bythe reduction in social assistance. By contrast,single parents in the higher income groups,for whom social welfare transfers are less im-portant, improve their income position muchmore if they take up part-time employment –for the average-income group by two-fifthsand for high-income groups by as much asfour-fifths, although for the latter group theentitlement to child-rearing benefit fallssharply. Another benefit which has a particu-lar impact in this case is the household allow-ance currently granted to single parents (al-though it is to be gradually phased out by2005), which at the moment is worth a po-tential of almost 3800 in tax savings. Disre-
garding childcare costs, high income earnersretain almost 60% of their part-time earn-ings, medium earners 50% and low earnerslittle more than 30% due to the offsetting ofsocial benefits.
In the child’s fourth year the position of all in-
come groups worsens perceptibly, chiefly onaccount of the cessation of child-rearingbenefit (for low and middle income earners)and the mother’s maintenance claim (for mid-dle and high income earners). This fourthyear is particularly relevant in that it also givesan impression of the income position of singleparents with older children.Married couples in which only one partner
continues to work after the birth of a childlikewise sustain a substantial drop in dispos-able income – although it is still higher thanthat of single parents. As in the case of singleparents, the size of the loss rises with theamount of the forfeited labour income. Be-sides lower child-rearing benefit in the firstyears, this is due to the fact that family allow-ance has a relatively smaller impact the higher

28the income is. However, the losses in the case
of higher income earners are cushioned bythe considerable tax savings resulting fromthe joint assessment of the spouses for in-come tax purposes, the effect of which in-creases if one partner stops working.
12While
in the child’s second year the disposable in-come of parents with a previously low labourincome falls from just under 160% of the so-cial assistance standard before the birth to125% afterwards and basically only exceeds
that level thanks to child-rearing benefit, thedisposable income of parents in the middleincome bracket recedes from over 260% to160% and that of high income earners fromjust under 480% to just over 250%.
If the parent takes up part-time employment
in the child’s second year, the disposable in-come of the lower income group improves byjust over one-fifth – and thus more than inthe case of single parents. The principal rea-son for this is that if one partner already has afull employment income, the means-testedtransfers are relatively small, so that the re-duction in benefits if the other partner takesup part-time employment are less significant.In the case of middle and high incomes, how-ever, the disposable income does not increaseas sharply as that of single parents. This isdue especially to the more sharply rising in-come tax burden, which is caused not leastby the smaller impact of joint income tax as-sessment once the second partner takes upemployment.
13The smaller increase in the
case of middle incomes is mainly attributableto the discontinuation of child-rearing bene-fit. Disregarding childcare costs, marriedcouples on a low income retain just over 60%of their extra earnings, those with a middleincome keep almost 40% and those with ahigh labour income retain just over 50%.%

29If taking up part-time employment involves
childcare costs, the growth of real disposableincome is reduced perceptibly, particularly asthese costs can only be partly offset againstincome tax. This substantially curbs the mon-etary incentives to take up paid employment.
Conclusion
In the second half of the 1990s, in particular,
benefits for children grew much faster thanoverall general government expenditure. Thisreflects, inter alia , the intention to ease the fi-
nancial burden on parents to a greater extentthan before. In turn, this was prompted inpart by Federal Constitutional Court rulingswhich notably brought about a significant in-crease in the tax allowances to cover chil-dren’s minimum subsistence. In its latest rul-ing, which stipulated that contribution ratesto the statutory nursing care insurancescheme need to be geared in favour of fam-ilies – which is still to be implemented by Par-liament – the Court also stressed the import-ance of children in the current pay-as-you-gosocial security system.
Government assistance for childcare plays a
decisive role in enabling parents to reconcilework and family life. Extensive and affordablechildcare facilities make it easier for parentsto take up or resume paid employment aftera child has been born and reduce the costsassociated with losses in their income. Forone thing, this can be a positive factor influ-encing couples to have children. For another,a higher rate of participation in the labourforce increases the utilisation of the availablehuman capital, with corresponding positive
macroeconomic effects. Against this back-drop, governments have stepped up childcarebenefits considerably by implementing the re-cently stipulated legal right to a place in anursery school for children aged betweenthree and six years. Government childcare as-sistance for children under three and for chil-dren of school age is less comprehensive.%

30Education, which is largely provided free of
charge, accounts for the bulk of overall gen-eral government measures related to chil-dren. Promoting the creation of human cap-ital is a vital government contribution tofuture macroeconomic development and theoptimal utilisation of the potential labourforce.
The model-case calculations presented above
have shown that parents sustain large finan-cial losses if they give up their job or switch topart-time working, especially once their childhas reached the age of four. This does notapply to single parents on a low income, whoare broadly able to maintain their (modest)standard of living even after the birth of achild. Admittedly, they can boost their dispos-able income only modestly, at least if theytake up a part-time job, owing to the highmarginal burden on additional earnings dueto deductions from benefits, so that their in-centive to work is comparatively small. For allother parents, the additional burden to beborne if they return to work is lower. How-ever, due account must be taken of the factthat the costs associated with childcare – es-pecially if very high – significantly weaken the
pecuniary incentives to take up gainful em-ployment.
In the final analysis, decisions on the nature
and scale of benefits related to children andfamilies have to be made on the basis ofvalue judgements and hence political com-promises. Any attempt to expand these bene-fits, however, must take account of the factthat aggregate government expenditure al-ready adds up to almost half of GDP , resultingin a heavy burden of taxes and social securitycontributions that inhibits growth. A majorfiscal policy objective is to gradually reducethe general government expenditure ratio inorder to achieve a durable consolidation ofpublic finance and, subsequently, to be ableto lower the burden of levies further. Forthese reasons, any expansion of family assist-ance measures can only be achieved by re-allocating resources within general govern-ment budgets. Moreover, the efficiency ofgovernment activity in this field, too, needsto be continuously monitored and improvedas far as possible.
Annex
Comparison of incomes of households with
and without children
The model-case calculations made in this article
are based on the assumption that, prior to thebirth of a child, single persons – and, in the case ofmarried couples, both partners – are gainfully em-ployed, drawing an employment income amount-ing to 50%, 100% and 200%, respectively, of
average earnings. Any other sources of incomehave been disregarded. Furthermore, it is assumedthat the mother interrupts her gainful employmentupon termination of her maternity leave (which inthis case begins at the start of the year and thusends in April of the year of birth). Income levels arecomputed for the year of birth as well as the child’sVaried conse-

31second and fourth years of life, embracing alterna-
tive scenarios regarding the mother’s gainful em-ployment. The respective calculations assume thatthe mother returns to her old job, halving both herworking hours and her former gross income, andthat no extra childcare costs have to be borne bythe mother while working.
14
In the case of single mothers – single parents arerarely fathers – claims to maintenance payments,which are governed by family law incorporatedinto the Civil Code, play a significant role. The es-tranged parent must pay maintenance for thechild. The amount is determined by the “Düssel-dorf Table”, which is used by judges in west Ger-man states, according to an adjusted net incomeand other maintenance obligations. The amountpayable is then supplemented by half the childbenefit claimable by the person liable for mainten-ance, to the extent that the claim – calculated onthe basis of the Düsseldorf Table – is less than3254 per month. It is assumed that the persons li-
able for maintenance make these payments in full,although this does not always correspond to real-ity.
15Where applicable, the parent obliged to
make maintenance payments also bears the costof the child’s private health insurance. Moreover,during the child’s first three years of life the motheris entitled to receive maintenance upon termin-ation of maternity benefit. The amount is based onher previous income but cannot fall below a cer-tain minimum subsistence level. The mother is notexpected to take up paid work during that period;if she does, half of the income she receives is de-ducted from the defined maintenance require-ment. To avoid overburdening the person liable formaintenance, the latter, inter alia , is allowed to
keep a certain minimum amount, and his mainten-ance liability towards the child’s mother is limitedto three-sevenths of his relevant income.With respect to health insurance, it is assumed
that persons whose income exceeds the thresholdfor opting out of the statutory health insurancescheme take out private health insurance, whichthey maintain even when not in gainful employ-ment.
16The tax relief granted under the family al-
lowance system is not taken into account whencalculating the income tax liability; instead, it isshown separately under “child benefit” (includingany additional savings from the children’s tax al-lowance). Any work-related tax-deductible ex-penses in excess of the basic allowances or tax-deductible special expenses in excess of social se-curity contributions are disregarded. For single par-ents, the income tax calculation is based on thehousehold allowance in effect in the current year.
Maternity benefit is assumed to be fully paid in the
year of birth. This type of income is not liable forsocial security contributions but is subject to theprogression rule under the income tax regime. Ma-ternity benefit is offset against child-rearing bene-fit, so that the latter is paid only from the child’sthird month in all model-case calculations.
The calculation of the housing allowance is based
on the assumption that the monthly rent is 3410
(single persons) and 3510 (married couples) and
that recipients live in an area for which peak rentsare assumed and in dwellings not older than 10years. The additional tax grants for families in thecontext of the home buyer’s allowance are disre-garded.
14With effect from 2002, part of these costs are deduct-
ible from income tax; an eligible claim to social assistance
would increase by the corresponding amount.
15In that case, central, state and local government pay a
certain minimum amount for up to six years pursuant to
the Maintenance Advance Act.
16For simplicity, monthly contributions are assumed to
be3200 (adults) and 350 (children).

33German enterprises’
profitability andfinancing in 2000This article is an update of the analy-
sis contained in the December 2001Monthly Report, which, for the first
time, presented extrapolated resultsfrom the Bundesbank’s corporate bal-ance sheet statistics for the years 1994to 1999 distinguished according tolegal form. That report also extendedthe area of coverage to Germany as awhole. These changes should be notedwhen making comparisons with the re-sults published in previous years.
In 2000, enterprises in the producing
sector, in the wholesale and retailtrade and in transport were able tomore than offset the previous dip intheir earnings. Owing to the sharpgrowth in business, however, this wasscarcely reflected in their gross returnon turnover. After tax, corporationsposted large increases in profits, sincetheir extensive utilisation of temporarytax breaks in the context of the corpor-ate tax reform meant that they paidless tax on earnings than in 1999. Thiswas accompanied by increased distri-butions of retained earnings, whichlowered the aggregate own fundsratio. But that is unlikely to lead to along-term weakening of the capitalbase. The multi-stage tax reform has,in fact, significantly improved theunderlying conditions for strengthen-ing firms’ financial viability in thelonger run.

34Cyclical setting
Overall, 2000 was quite a good year for the
German economy. This also holds true for theaverage of the enterprises in the producingsector, in the wholesale and retail trade andin transport examined in this article. Real GDPgrew by 3%, which was twice as fast as theaverage rate during the 1990s. This expan-sion also distinctly outpaced that of overallpotential output. As a result, there was anotable improvement in capacity utilisationwhich, for the first time in some while, re-turned to something like its normal level, al-beit with marked sectoral differences.
Foreign demand was a mainstay of growth in
2000, with real exports increasing by over13%, compared with 5
12% in the previous
year. The German export sector benefitedfrom both buoyant business activity in itsmain markets abroad and from the percep-tible improvement in its price competitive-ness, which was due mainly to domestic costdiscipline and exchange-rate developments.The euro depreciated by more than 18%against the US dollar between the start of2000 and its low at the end of October,which meant a cumulative loss of 30% sinceits introduction on 1 January 1999. Althoughthis made imports more expensive, there wasa sharp rise in real imports as well.
By contrast, growth in domestic demand, at
2%, was noticeably weaker than in the twopreceding years. The main reason for this wasthe sharp deterioration in the terms of tradeowing to the surge in oil prices and the euro’sdepreciation. This effectively meant a transferof income from residents to non-residents
amounting to 328 billion at constant prices.
Despite the satisfactory expansion of overalloutput, only a 1
12% higher real income was
available for domestic distribution, comparedwith +2% in both 1998 and 1999. In additionto reducing the purchasing power of house-holds – they increased their consumptionspending by no more than 1
12% in real
terms – the sharp rise in energy prices, to-gether with exchange-rate-induced higherprices for imported inputs, placed a strain onbusiness costs. This put a perceptible brakeon the favourable earnings potential impliedby buoyant sales activity and stable unit la-bour costs.
In the later course of the year, this – along
with the looming global economic slow-down – led to a noticeable slackening in thepropensity to invest. Nevertheless, on an an-nual average, firms substantially stepped uptheir fixed capital formation in 2000, withspending on new machinery, equipment andother plant rising by almost 9% at constantprices. This owed something to the fact thatinvestment projects were evidently broughtforward to 2000 in view of the new depreci-ation rules that were due to come into forceon 1 January 2001. By contrast, constructioninvestment declined again after having risenmarginally in 1999 for the first time since1994. Investment in new residential buildingsshowed the most pronounced decrease, con-tracting by 2
34% at 1995 prices. The year-on-
year fall in investment in other constructionamounted to 2
14%. The adverse trend in con-
struction work actually worsened in 2001.Sharp

35In 2000 the pay settlements, which are a
major component of overall costs, were bothappropriate to the labour market situationand consistent with price stability. On an an-nual average, nationally agreed wage and sal-ary rates went up by a total of 2% on amonthly basis. Owing to the negative wagedrift, actual earnings rose somewhat lessstrongly, at 1
12%. Unit labour costs in the
economy as a whole remained virtually un-changed. At 72
14%, the wage ratio – ie the
share of national income allocated to thecompensation of employees – was likewiseon a par with 1999.
There were wide disparities in the extent to
which the individual sectors examined in thisarticle participated in the sharp overall eco-nomic growth in 2000. The main determinantwas whether their activities were gearedmore to foreign business, which was thriving,or to supplying the domestic market, wheregrowth was more subdued. Thus, real grossvalue added in the manufacturing sector,which exports more than one-third of itsproducts, expanded by no less than 6%.Measured by turnover, the growth amountedto almost 9
12%, with a 16% increase in ex-
ports and a rise of just over 512% in domestic
sales. Producers of intermediate and capitalgoods were the main beneficiaries of the fa-vourable global economic climate. The slackdomestic demand meant that producers ofconsumer goods were able to increase theirtotal turnover by no more than 4%.
The picture in the wholesale and retail trade
was also marked by stark contrasts. At cur-rent prices, retail sales in 2000 were only1
12% up on 1999 and, at constant prices,
stagnated. By contrast, wholesale turnoverincreased by 6
12% in nominal terms and by
212% in real terms. Firstly, this was a reflec-
tion of buoyant trade in exports and capitalgoods. Secondly, it was a result of the factthat a large proportion of imported goods(which also showed a sharp rise) werehandled via the wholesale trade. The quiteclear difference between the nominal andreal figures mirrors the sharp rise in importprices that occurred in 2000. The fast pace ofgrowth in manufacturing output in turnstimulated demand for transport services.Real gross value added in the transport sec-tor (including communication) increased by7
12% in the period under review.
Besides the retail trade, the energy, gas and
water supply industry as well as the construc-tion sector faced adverse cyclical circum-stances in 2000. The real gross value addedby utilities was no more than 1% up on theyear; measured at current prices, it actuallydeclined perceptibly. This implies a falling de-flator of gross value added in this sector,which at first sight appears to be at variancewith the 3% rise in producer prices. One ex-planation for this might be that the consider-able price discounts owing to the deregula-tion of the electricity market ate into the elec-tricity generators’ profits to some extent.These price reductions were offset, however,by the sharp increase in natural gas prices.Overall construction output declined by 3%at constant prices, thereby continuing thenegative trend that had persisted since 1995.Output in the main building trades was cutModerate pay

36back by more than 312%, with turnover
shrinking by as much as 5%.
At 4%, the total real gross value added in
2000 by the economic sectors examined inthis article rose in line with firms’ total out-put. The fact that GDP grew less strongly wasdue, firstly, to the virtually stagnant develop-ment of general government and of non-profit institutions. Secondly, the balance oftaxes on products and subsidies on products(which, together with real gross value added,gives GDP valued at market prices) declinedin 2000.
Profitability
The overall favourable cyclical climate in 2000
had a perceptible impact on enterprises’ ag-gregate profit and loss account.
1The annual
result before taxes on income was 512%
higher than in 1999, when it had fallen by3
12%.2The dip in earnings in 1999, which
had been brought about not least by the EastAsia crisis, was thus more than offset. Thisfinding is confirmed, by and large, by the(latterly far more volatile) national accountsdata on the earnings of non-financial corpor-ations,
3although for a number of reasons
those data are only partly comparable withthe figures of the corporate balance sheetstatistics. According to the national accountsdata, corporations’ profits went up by 13
12%
in 2000, after having declined by 812%i n
1999.
The gross profit shown in the corporate bal-
ance sheet statistics rose almost as much asturnover. Measured as the gross return on
turnover, profitability in 2000 amounted tojust under 3
12%, which was virtually the
same as in 1999. This signifies a somewhatpoorer result than in 1998, although the fig-ures are distinctly better than in the periodfrom 1994 (the start of the cylindered series)to 1997, when the return had been a littleover 2
12%. In this connection it should be
borne in mind that the profitability and finan-cing ratios derived from the corporate bal-ance sheet statistics obviously apply only tothe firms still in existence during the reportingyear. The results therefore tend to be betterthan they would be if enterprises that had be-come insolvent were included in a hypothet-ical analysis.
The annual results after tax appear in an even
more favourable light than gross profit, withthe former increasing in 2000 by 11%. Themain reason for this was a perceptible fall in
1For more details on the method of extrapolation by
legal form and on the data pool, see Deutsche Bundes-
bank, German enterprises’ earning and financial pat-
terns, by form of business, Monthly Report, Decem-
ber 2001, p60-64. The update for 2000 is based on
around 17,000 annual accounts. Owing to the fact that
current figures on turnover from the turnover tax statis-
tics, which are needed for the extrapolation, are not yet
available, it was not possible to break the data for 2000
down by legal form. No analysis of the funds flow was
undertaken either, since the deteriorating trend with
regard to the data means that the data on the flow and
use of funds are subject to major uncertainty (see
Monthly Report, December 2001, p64).
2The annual result corresponds to the profit for the year
before profit/loss transfers and provides a better indica-
tion of the profits generated by the enterprises analysed
in this article, since numerous firms are associated
through profit transfer agreements (and partial profit
transfer agreements) with enterprises which are not re-
corded in the corporate balance sheet statistics (eg hold-
ing companies) to which their profits/losses are trans-
ferred.

37taxes on income and earnings, which is dis-
cussed in greater detail below. As a result, thenet return on turnover (ie the ratio of post-tax profits to turnover) improved slightly to2
12%. Since 1994, this ratio had risen by
12percentage point. However, the net return
to turnover ratio is only suited to showing thetrend in after-tax earnings over time. This isbecause it overstates the real return as thetaxes deducted solely comprise trade earn-ings tax and the income taxes paid by corpor-ations. By contrast, the annual results of non-corporations (ie partnerships and sole propri-etorships) are taxed as part of those entrepre-neurs’ private income and do not appear inthe profit and loss account of such enter-prises.
The considerable disparities in the respective
earnings level of the individual sectors reflectthe sectoral differences in business momen-tum described above. The manufacturing sec-tor, which benefited from the sharp rise inforeign demand and buoyant investment ac-tivity at home, lifted its annual result beforetaxes on income by 15% (in 1999 it had fall-en by 5
12%). Owing to the similarly sharp
growth in business activity, however, the sec-tor’s gross return on turnover grew only mod-erately by not quite 4
12%, thereby just about
matching its 1998 level. The post-tax pictureis similar; although the annual result expand-ed by 22
12%, the (more informative) net re-
turn on turnover in 2000 was no higher thanin 1998.
Within industry, the main beneficiaries of the
buoyant export demand and investment activ-ity were those branches which are strongly ori-%

38ented to exports or to capital goods, such as
manufacturers of chemicals and chemicalproducts, of motor vehicles and electricalmachinery and apparatus as well as – with cer-tain qualifications – manufacturers of machin-ery and equipment. Few manufacturers ofconsumer goods or producers of building ma-terials were able to keep pace with the growthin earnings in the former branches, and someof them saw their profit level fall. This develop-ment was also accompanied by marked differ-ences according to size category. Large enter-prises with a turnover of more than DM100million, which are relatively strongly engagedin export business, achieved double-digit in-creases in profits both before and after taxes,while small and medium-sized firms suffered aslide in earnings.
The overall buoyant trend in manufacturing
business also sharply boosted turnover in thetransport sector. Firms in that sector were notable to turn this into higher profits, however,and instead sustained a fall in earnings onbalance. Presumably this was mainly due tothe sharp rise in costs caused, above all, byhigher fuel prices. The situation in the whole-sale trade was similar in that markedly highersales tended to be accompanied by lowergross and net annual results. It should benoted in this context that turnover was in-flated by large price increases, especially inthe case of refined oil products. This wasmatched on the cost side by a significant risein expenditure on goods for resale. Added tothis was an exceptionally sharp rise in spend-ing on excise taxes, which is discussed below,and interest payments.

39sector and the wholesale trade to around
112% in each case.
The retail trade experienced a further erosion
of earnings, a trend which had begun in theearly 1990s and which been interrupted onlyin 1997 by a sharp rise in profits. In 2000 theresult before taxes on income declined by2
12% although, owing to the small growth in
business, the gross return on turnover re-mained at just under 2%. One factor thatcontributed to the unfavourable earningstrend in the retail trade – besides consumers’general restraint – was fierce price competi-tion on the supplier side. This had been initi-ated by the market entry of a foreign retailgroup, but ultimately these cut-throat pricescould not be sustained.
Of all the sectors examined here, the con-
struction sector once again showed the poor-est performance. The gross annual result de-clined by one-tenth, having already decreasedby more than two-fifths in 1999. Comparedwith its last peak in 1994, it has fallen bymore than 65
12%. With business volume like-
wise contracting, the construction sector’s re-turn on turnover remained at the previousyear’s depressed level of 1%; this was thelowest earnings score recorded by any sector.It should be noted, however, that the diver-gent sectoral returns on turnover reflect notonly differences in the profitability of firmsbut also marked differentials with regard toindustry-specific levels of capitalisation.
4
The high ratio of gross income to turnoverin the capital-intensive utilities sector, whichat 10
12% again led the rankings in 2000, isalso to be seen in that light. Even so, the sec-
tor’s gross return on turnover ratio was downon 1999, when it had been 11%. The mainreason for this was that the growth of the an-nual result before taxes lagged significantlybehind the sharp expansion in turnover thatresulted primarily from the steep price in-creases for imports of natural gas beingpassed through to the final consumers. Atthe same time, the rise in utility enterprises’turnover was in fact significantly retarded in2000 by a 14% fall in electricity generators’selling prices. By contrast, the net return onturnover rose noticeably by 1 percentagepoint to 6
12%, as the cost of taxes on earn-
ings was one-quarter lower than in 1999.This was due to the special features of thecorporate tax reform that came into force on1 January 2001, which will be discussed inmore detail below.
Income and cost in detail
The total output (which is made up of turn-
over plus changes in stocks of own productsand other capitalised production) of the sec-tors examined in this article increased by 6%in 2000 and thus twice as sharply as on anaverage of the two preceding years. This re-flects not only the positive cyclical trend butalso the fact that the sharp rise in importprices – driven by the energy markets but alsoby the euro’s depreciation – intensified up-ward pressure on the producer prices of in-dustrial products. Moreover, the average rate

40of growth of total output masks significant
differences across the individual sectors,which range from -6% in construction to9
12% in manufacturing and 12% for utilities.
By and large, the changes in stocks of ownproducts and other capitalised production re-mained at the high level of 1999.
Interest received and other income, which in-
cludes income from participating interests,profit transfers and other operating income,again increased more sharply than totaloutput in 2000. Interest received grew by14
12%, compared with 412% in the previous
year. This was due partly to the sharp rise of7% in the stock of interest-bearing debtorsand investments and partly to the higher levelof the average credit interest rate, whichamounted to 4% in 2000. Other incomewent up by 11
12%, as in 1999, not least be-
cause income from participating interestsshowed a significant increase over 12 months.Consequently, total income was 6
12%u po n
its 1999 level.
Total cost rose at almost the same pace as in-
come but because it was lower, there was stillroom for a marked increase in the gross an-nual result. The major strain on enterprises’expenditure in 2000 was the strong growthin the cost of materials which, at 7
12%, was
more than twice as high as in the two preced-ing years. As a result, the share of the cost ofmaterials in total output rose perceptibly toalmost 63
12% from just under 6112%i n
1994. As mentioned above, the main reasonfor the higher cost of materials was the dis-tinct increase in the prices of imported inputs,in general, and of refined oil products, in par-ticular. This placed a disproportionate burden
on industries such as chemicals and chemicalproducts which are especially dependent onfossil energy. The wholesale trade and gassuppliers were also heavily affected, althoughas a rule they can rapidly pass on changes ininput prices for refined oil products and nat-ural gas to their customers.
At 3%, labour cost rose at a notably slower
pace in 2000 than total cost. As a result, their(direct) share of total output fell by
12per-
centage point to 18%. Since the workforce inthe examined sectors expanded by
12%, ac-
cording to the official statistics, the growth inlabour cost per employee was even some-what slower. This was mainly due to the mod-erate pay developments described earlier inthis article. Furthermore, social security con-tributions were again lowered slightly owingto higher government transfers to the statu-tory pension insurance scheme funded byrevenue from the “ecological tax”. Differen-tials in the change in labour cost from sectorto sector may largely be explained in terms ofdivergent trends in employment. In manufac-turing, the wholesale and retail trade and thetransport sector employment rose, in someinstances significantly, which led to an above-average increase in labour cost. By contrast,the haemorrhage of jobs in construction andutilities, which has been evident for quitesome time, accelerated in 2000. As a result,labour cost fell distinctly in those sectors.
Depreciation charges went up by just over
6%, compared with 3
12% in 1999. That

41comprised of uncollectable debtors plus
write-downs of investments and participatinginterests. This may have been due to majorstock price adjustments on the equity mar-kets, which mainly occurred in the secondhalf of 2000 and, in the case of some enter-prises, led to corresponding value adjust-ments at the end of the business year. At4
12%, however, the consumption of fixed
assets increased only slightly more than in1999. This was mainly attributable to declin-ing depreciation in the accounts of construc-tion firms and utilities.
In 2000, producing enterprises paid around
17
12% more interest than in 1999, though
this cost item amounted to only 112%o ft o t a l
output. This considerable increase was due,firstly, to an expansion of the stock of interest-bearing creditors by 8
12% and, secondly, to a
perceptible rise in banks’ short and long-termlending rates. The average rate of interest pay-able by enterprises consequently went up byalmost
12percentage point to 512%, a level
last reached in 1997-98. Since interest re-ceived grew more moderately – and from alower base – than interest paid, net interestpaid increased by one-fifth.
As mentioned above, considerable relief was
afforded to enterprises’ profit and loss ac-counts by the decline in the amount spent ontaxes on income. The marked increase in thegross annual result would per se lead one to
expect higher tax payments. The alleviatingeffect was mainly due to changes in corpor-ation tax legislation as part of the corporatetax reform that entered into force on1 January 2001. This already had a major im-pact on accounting for the financial year
2000 because, for the last time, enterpriseshad the option of cutting their tax bill by re-leasing profits retained in earlier years andtaxed at a rate of 45% (“EK 45”) and ear-marking them for distribution to shareholdersin 2001. At the turn of 2001-02, the remain-ing stock of retained profits with tax paid at45% was reallocated the 40% tax category(“EK 40”); during a transitional period of15 years these retained earnings, too, can bedistributed as dividends. The tax relief ac-crued to enterprises because, under the “old”corporation tax regime, distributed profitswere taxed at only 30%. (This rate will con-tinue to apply in future to EK 40 disburse-ments even though under the “new” legisla-tion the rate of corporation tax has been set auniform 25% for both retained and distrib-uted earnings.) Moreover, such special divi-dend payments were evidently used to offsetlosses within groups, which is no longer pos-sible under the new tax legislation. The “taxfacility” of 15 percentage points was eitherreimbursed to enterprises or could be used asan offset (at the beginning of 2002, thisclaimable corporation tax facility was reducedto “only” 10 percentage points).
5Many cor-
porations made use of this disbursement op-tion, with the result that, as gauged from thegovernment cash accounts, corporation taxrefunds in 2001 actually exceeded corpor-ation tax payments.

42By contrast, a marked 612% rise was record-
ed in expense on other taxes, which includetaxes on land and buildings and excise taxes.This owed much to the entry into force of thesecond stage of the “ecological tax reform”on 1 January 2000, which further raised therates of tax on fuel and electricity. This wasreflected, above all, in the cost accounts ofwholesale traders, which pay the largestshare of petroleum taxes to the public ex-chequer, and the energy sector.

12%. In terms of
firm size, balance sheet growth shows aspread similar to that displayed by incomegrowth: enterprises with a turnover of morethan DM100 million recorded a balance sheetgrowth that was higher than average, whilesmaller enterprises registered barely any in-crease. When comparing sectors, construc-tion was an exception to the general trend inthat its balance sheet total shrank by 5%.The rates of increase in the other sectorswere within a comparatively narrow rangebetween 7% and 10%.On the asset side, the sharp growth in the
balance sheet was mainly due to financialassets, which increased by one-tenth in 2000,raising their share of total assets to 51
12%.
As in the two preceding years, non-financialassets increased by 5%, although it should benoted that the stock of tangible fixed assetsgrew only by 4%, ie more slowly than in1999. This trend was not broadly based, how-ever; it was chiefly attributable to a decline inconstruction and a quite small increase in theutilities sector. Inventories increased moresharply than before, however, which may bedue to unplanned stockbuilding, especiallytowards the end of 2000. This somewhatqualifies the absolute growth of non-financialassets.
The trend in financial assets was mainly char-
acterised by rapid growth in participatinginterests, which increased by 17
12% and en-
larged their share of total assets to 13%; in1994, the ratio had been 9%. This reflectsthe continuing trend towards “external ex-pansion”, which increasingly represents an al-ternative to internal investment within theenterprise. Another important factor was thevery high level of stock market prices duringthe early part of the year under review. Firstly,this made the acquisition of participatinginterests much dearer. Secondly, this offeredenterprises greater opportunities to “pay for”such acquisitions with their own highly pricedshares – which gave a considerable boost tothe international boom in corporate mergers.

43Conversely, the increase in the stock of invest-
ments (largely debt securities) was moremodest than in earlier years since enterprisesevidently attached little strategic importanceto them given the high (and partially exagger-ated) profit and growth expectations.
The enterprises’ short and long-term debtors
rose by 9% and 15%, respectively. In theshort-term range, one factor that had an im-pact was the marked increase in trade debt-ors which, in turn, was due to the sharp ex-pansion in business activity. This is also re-flected in short-term creditors, the level ofwhich increased by 11
12% in 2000. There
was also a further perceptible growth in lend-ing and borrowing between affiliated enter-prises, which likewise pushed up the level oftheir debtors and creditors.
The release of retained profits on tax
grounds, described elsewhere in this article,was a major factor limiting the increase inown funds to “only” 5% compared with arise of 8% in borrowed funds. The divergenttrends of the two items was further accentu-ated, however, by the fact that the releasedamounts did not lead to an immediatematching reduction in total liabilities since,for accounting purposes, they were treatedas short-term borrowed funds until their dis-bursement. The (vertical) own funds ratiotherefore fell by just under
12percentage
point to 17%. In all probability, however, thedecline in the equity ratio shown for 2000does not indicate a sustained deterioration incorporate financing. It is, in fact, more likelythat corporations will generate additionalown funds in future through greater profit re-Enterprises’ balance sheet*

44tention, which will doubtless be encouraged
by the lowering of the corporation tax rate to25%. Moreover, past experience suggeststhat the raising of capital by issuing newshares will regain importance once the moodon the stock markets picks up.
All sectors of the economy except the whole-
sale and retail trade saw their own funds ratiodecline in 2000. In the construction sector,where corporations are thinly represented,this was probably due less to tax consider-ations than to the ongoing erosion of theequity capital base brought about by sizeablelosses. The equity ratio in the constructionsector reached an all-time low of 1
12%; this
was also the lowest ratio of any of the eco-nomic sectors examined. As before, manufac-turing firms (22
12%) and utilities (26%) were
at the top of the table. This wide contrast inthe provision with own funds reflects not onlydifferences in terms of financial viability butalso variations in industry-specific capital in-tensity and diverging preferences for a par-ticular legal form of business organisation.
7
The (largely tax-induced) limited increase inown funds was also mirrored in other majorasset and liability ratios. What is most strikingis that the increase in long-term liabilitiesfailed to match the growth of fixed assets,which was principally driven by the large-scale acquisition of participating interests; thecorresponding ratio dropped by 4
12percent-
age points in 2000 compared with 1999. Theratio of liquidities and short-term debtors toRatios relating to enterprises’ assets

In 2000, the enterprises in the economic sec-
tors examined in this article, in the aggregate,more than made good the decline in profit-ability sustained in 1999. The boom in foreigndemand gave a boost mainly to enterpriseswith a high share of exports, whereas firmsthat are geared more to supplying the domes-tic market, which showed relatively subduedgrowth, had a more difficult time. Aftertaxes, corporations recorded large increases
in profits as they paid less tax on income thanin 1999 owing to exceptional rules applyingin connection with the reform of corporationtax. This was accompanied, however, by agreater release of profits retained in earlieryears. Nevertheless, the resulting decline inthe own funds ratio is likely to be no morethan a temporary phenomenon and shouldnot be construed as indicating a weakeningof German firms’ financial viability. Indeed,the corporation tax reform has, not least, sig-nificantly improved the conditions for an ex-pansion of the equity capital base – for cor-porations and non-corporations alike.

57RTGSplus–
successfullyestablishedOn 5 November 2001 the Bundesbank
successfully launched its new liquidity-saving real-time gross settlement sys-tem, RTGS
plus. Handling some 120,000
payments each working day, it is oneof the largest clearing systems in theEuropean Union. In terms of volume, itaccounts for nearly 50% of all transac-tions in the EU central banks’ TARGETsystem. Alongside its strict gearing tothe needs of the market and of its cus-tomers, its high degree of acceptanceand the speed with which it has be-come established are primarily attrib-utable to its innovative design, whichcombines liquidity-saving features withrapid, secure payment processing andoffers banks a number of differentways of individually managing liquid-ity. This article gives an overview of ini-tial experience since the system wasput into operation. In addition, it takesa look at the current situation inrespect of individual payment trans-actions in euro and the challengeswhich lie ahead.
Developments in euro clearing since the
start of monetary union
RTGS
plus, the Deutsche Bundesbank’s new li-
quidity-saving real-time gross settlement sys-tem, began operation on 5 November 2001.Having taken only two years to develop, itsucceeds Euro Link System (ELS) and Euro Ac-cess Frankfurt (EAF). The main performancefeatures of these earlier settlement systemsWhy RTGSplus

58have been incorporated into RTGSplusand im-
proved. One of the key factors behind thenew development was the new competitiveenvironment engendered by the introductionof the euro. This appeared to signal the needto combine the separate procedures of EAFand ELS to exploit synergies in terms of costand efficiency. Apart from the Bundesbank asthe system operator, the main beneficiariesare the credit institutions participating inRTGS
plus. In addition, RTGSplushas enabled
the Bundesbank to respond to the more strin-gent demands of the market, especially in thefield of liquidity management, as well as tomore recent technological developments.Since its launch, RTGS
plushas shown itself to
be a highly efficient and reliable system – fromthe technical perspective, too. The thoroughpreparation and test activities and the closecooperation with the banking sector have
clearly paid off.
RTGS
plusis an individual payment system. In-
dividual payments – as opposed to retail pay-ments – are typified by same-day forward-ing and single-transaction processing, ie thecredit transfers are processed individually ra-ther than in bulk. These systems are used toprocess both interbank payments and cus-tomer payments. On no account do theamounts transferred have to be large. Rather,the need for speed is one of the deciding fac-tors.
RTGS
plusalso operates as the national TAR-
GET component. The EU central banks’ TAR-GET (Trans-European Automated Real-timeGross settlement Express Transfer) systemconsists of the 15 national RTGS systems andthe payment mechanism of the EuropeanCentral Bank (ECB), which are interconnectedby means of the Interlinking component. Thisenables the exchange of cross-border credittransfers between the RTGS systems in thecountries of the sender and receiver. In thebroader sense, however, TARGET covers bothdomestic and cross-border payments. In add-ition, the Euro1 clearing system operated bythe private Euro Banking Association (EBA)and the more nationally oriented PNS (ParisNet Settlement) and SEPI (Servicio Espaæol dePagos Interbancarios) provide additional effi-cient processing facilities for individual pay-ments in the euro area.
Altogether, the European individual payment
systems increased their volume in the pastthree years by nearly 15% per annum. How-Daily average

59ever, at only just over 8%, the increase in the
overall value of transactions was somewhatweaker. Greater use was clearly being madeof these systems to process customer pay-ments for smaller average amounts, thesehaving previously been handled through re-ciprocal banking arrangements (correspond-ent banking). In line with expectations, the in-dividual payment systems’ growth sloweddown somewhat over time.
The operational volume of the TARGET sys-
tem has increased strongly. This is particularlytrue of cross-border transactions, where anaverage volume growth of 30% per annumwas achieved in recent years. However, at justover 10%, value growth was far weaker.
By comparison with the cross-border TARGET
segment, growth in the volume of domesticpayments processed in the TARGET system(RTGS
plusand other RTGS systems) is com-
paratively moderate (+15% per annum). Thechange in the structure of cross-border pay-ment settlement brought about by the dis-mantling of correspondent banking relationshad a far smaller impact on payments pro-cessed within the national RTGS systems. Atnearly 20% per annum, the value of trans-actions has, however, shown quite a markedincrease.
The German TARGET component, RTGS
plus,
processes more than 105,000 domestic pay-ments each working day. In addition, 16,000of the more than 45,000 cross-border TAR-GET transactions in the EU are submitted viaRTGS
plus. With the introduction of RTGSplus,
the volume of business of some 50,000 pay-ments per day that were previously processed
via EAF was transferred to the German TAR-GET component. The relatively sharp increaseevident in the two charts on pages 58 and 59is due to this statistical base effect. Measuredon the basis of the volume of all domesticand cross-border payments, RTGS

Particularly strong growth has also been ex-
perienced by EBA’s Euro1 system; however,the expectations of around 200,000 pay-ments per working day entertained before itslaunch have not yet been met. Euro1 is a se-cured net settlement system which operatesin such a way as to save liquidity but does notoffer final settlement in central bank moneyuntil the end of the day.

The main performance features of
RTGS
plus
In view of the speed at which financial mar-kets are merging, managing liquidity risk andtrying to save liquidity are becoming increas-ingly important. The following aspects can behighlighted.
– As a secure payment settlement medium
with a maximum degree of liquidity, cen-tral bank money is assuming an increas-ingly important role in securities settle-
ment, foreign exchange trading and otherpayment transactions.
– An increasing number of payments need
to be made at specific times of the day. Li-quidity therefore needs to be managedactively throughout the day and not justat close of business. It therefore takes ona vital role as an “operating resource”,the provision of which carries opportunitycosts (eg tying up collateral, which wouldearn higher rates of interest elsewhere).Some banks have already gone over topricing intraday liquidity internally (ataround 15 to 20 basis points).
– As a result of the ongoing concentration
in the banking industry, the globalisationof business activities and high competitivedynamism, liquidity management is be-coming increasingly complex. In the fu-ture, processing activities may well be out-sourced to larger banks which then as-sume the task of providing “third party”services for other banks.
RTGS
plustakes particular account of these de-
velopments.
RTGSplusis a liquidity-saving real-time gross
settlement system. All credit transfers submit-ted are executed with immediate finality,provided that the payment is adequatelycovered; there is therefore no initial “batch-ing” followed by collective settlement. Un-covered payments are placed in queues. Aparticular feature of RTGS
plusis that, like its
predecessor, EAF, it permits the extensive useOther countries 1

61of reciprocal payments as an additional cover
fund.
– When payments are submitted, RTGSplus
tries to use as cover the credit balances in
RTGSplusas well as reciprocal payments
which are made by other participants andspecifically intended for the submitter.
– Queued payments are moved forward for
processing as quickly as possible by con-tinuously implementing mathematicallybased optimisation processes (algorithms);the offsetting individual payments in thequeues are posted to accounts at thesame time.
Payments are debited and credited to a separ-
ate RTGS
plusintraday account in central bank
money. This intraday account is linked via a“liquidity bridge” to a “home account” atany one of the euro-area central banks.Liquidity can be transferred flexibly betweenthe home account and the intraday RTGS
plus
account both at the start and in the course ofthe day. TARGET is used for foreign “homeaccounts”. At the end of the day, the remain-ing credit is automatically transferred back tothe relevant home account.
RTGS
plusparticipants have convenient ways
of specifically managing their liquidity flow.Payments for which the total amount of theparticipant’s liquidity may be used are submit-ted by participants as express payments.However, if the amount of liquidity whichmay be paid out is to be limited, the partici-pant submits a limit payment. This meansthat account can be taken of additional limitsdefined by the participant when payments
are executed. Participants can be flexible intheir use of bilateral and multilateral limits aswell as of a total limit. Limit payments areonly executed immediately if there is enoughliquidity and the limits have not been ex-hausted.
Compared with other mechanisms, the send-
er limits used in RTGS
pluspresent many ad-
vantages in terms of liquidity management.
– The submitter makes the execution of
payments which exceed the limit depend-ent on the receiver making payments inhis favour (payment-versus-payment phil-osophy). This facility is backed by the ex-tensive transparency of the queues of in-coming payments.
1Consistent use of off-
setting payment flows reduces theamount of liquidity needed.
– The multiple limit options, together with
the opportunity to use the informationand control system (ICS) described onpage 62 to make adjustments at any time,allow an individually tailored approachthat is invariably appropriate to the situ-ation. Optimal liquidity management isguaranteed even if the participant struc-ture is less homogenous or if exceptionalsituations occur in the course of the day.A flexible use of limits, which lies fullywithin the hands of the participant con-cerned, is certainly preferable to rigid sys-tem regulations.

ed for him and have been made by other participants but

62– In addition, limits are a user-friendly
“tool” which is easy to implement. Partici-pants therefore do not need to developany particular mechanisms in their ownsystems. Smaller banks, in particular, arelikely to benefit.
– Limits support a pattern of early submis-
sion.
The innovative information and control sys-
tem (ICS) is pivotal for liquidity managementin RTGS
plus. ICS gives participants easy and
extensive real-time access to all relevant data.Participants can themselves keep track of thecurrent state of their accounts. Moreover,they can obtain information on the queues ofincoming and outgoing payments as well asdetails of individual payments that have al-ready been executed or are pending. Partici-
pants can also use ICS to change the status(eg order in the queue) of payments thathave not yet been executed. Limits can alsobe increased or reduced and liquidity trans-fers initiated between the RTGS
plusintraday
account and the home account.
While SWIFT’s tried and tested Y-Copy ser-
vice2is used to process payments, state-of-
the-art IP (Internet Protocol) technology isused for information and control. The infor-mation and control system is available eitheras a browser version or as a business-to-business version. In the former case, a partici-pant’s employee can access data on the ICScomputer direct from a PC terminal. In thebusiness-to-business version, the participant’sIT system communicates electronically withthe ICS computer on the basis of predefinedXML (Extensible Markup Language) stand-ards. This enables the participant to integratethe flow of data into his own internal sys-tems, where they can be processed further.At the network level, the Bundesbank is oneof the first users of the new SWIFTNet ser-vices (SWIFTNet InterAct and SWIFTNet Inter-Act Browse).
3As an alternative, the Bundes-
bank also offers browser access via a virtualprivate network (VPN).An example of how limits work
A bank has 5200 million on its RTGSplus
intraday account. However, it plans to use
only 550 million of this liquidity for limit
payments. If it submits limit payments to-talling 5200 million, only 550 million worth
of credit transfers will be made in the firstinstance. The 5150 million worth of pay-
ments which exceed the limit are initially“parked”. They are executed only as thebank receives payments from other partici-pants. This enables the bank to submit pay-ments at the earliest opportunity. It doesnot, however, run the risk of executing itspayments promptly while only receivingthe expected incoming payments at theend of the day. The risk of unlimited unilat-eral outflows of liquidity can therefore beheld in check.

2SWIFT’s Y-Copy service was especially developed by
SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Tele-
communication) for the exchange of payments between
real-time gross settlement systems and their participants.

63Initial experience of RTGSplus
There are at present 59 direct participants in
RTGSplus, including the most important
names in the euro clearing business. Four in-stitutions are participating directly fromabroad by means of remote access. The con-sistent use of SWIFT standards and separateintraday accounts make RTGS
plusvery attract-
ive in terms of remote access. In addition,around 8,500 credit institutions (includingbranches) can be reached indirectly inRTGS
plus– via a direct participant or the
Deutsche Bundesbank. The participation oflarge institutions and increasing concentra-tion in euro clearing are evident in the struc-ture of business in RTGS
plus. The five largest
submitters account for more than half of allpayments and the ten largest participants foraround 70%. However, in terms of its designand business policy, RTGS
plusis not a system
for large banks only. Rather, it has been con-ceived as an open system for small and largebanks alike; there are no size-related accesscriteria. The Bundesbank therefore offers anefficient payment infrastructure which is in-tended to enable every bank to offer its ownpayment products on a competitive basis.Two further “accession phases” are plannedfor July and December this year; some 35 in-stitutions will probably be added to the list ofparticipants.
Participants use RTGS
plusto a large extent to
forward customer payments arising fromtheir commercial transactions. More than60% of all RTGS
plustransactions are customer
payments, with interbank payments account-ing for the remainder. RTGS
plusis also likely tobe used to a considerable extent to forward
payments coming from abroad, as these canbe forwarded to the receiver via RTGS
plusin
the SWIFT format, in other words withouttheir having to be converted into the GermanDTA format.
4By contrast, in the TARGET sys-
tem the share of customer payments in thetotal cross-border volume of transactionsamounts to no more than around 40%. Thehigh proportion of customer payments inRTGS
plustherefore results in a noticeably
lower average payment amount than in otherRTGS systems in TARGET. RTGS
plusis none-
theless still clearly different from retail pay-ment systems. While the average payment inthe Bundesbank’s retail payment system (RPS)Average transaction amounts in

RTGSplusparticipants are taking full advan-
tage of the opportunities offered by RTGSplus
to manage liquidity. This is evident, first, fromthe intensive use made of ICS. Every day 450users at the 59 participating banks each ac-cess ICS some 30 times to obtain informationor to carry out control operations. Second,the preference for liquidity management canbe seen from the large proportion of limitpayments. Nearly 90% of all payments aresubmitted by participants as limit paymentsand only 10% as express payments. This ap-plies, moreover, to both domestic RTGS
plus
transactions and cross-border TARGET trans-fers. Overall, more than 500 limits are set inthe system each working day.– As one might expect, bilateral limits (450
cases) predominate in terms of number.These enable payment outflows to a spe-cific partner to be controlled very pre-cisely.
– In addition, a multilateral limit can be de-
fined for all the relations to which no bilat-eral limit applies. It is used in 28 cases.
– A total limit is also used by 38 banks. This
enables the use of liquidity to be con-trolled for limit payments as a whole.

The positive effect of the limits on the volumeof payments processed can also be seen, forexample, from the (early reciprocal) submis-sion and settlement process in RTGS
plus.
In February 2002, for instance, more than
20% of all transfers – when calculated by vol-ume – were submitted in the first hour; for thefirst two hours the figure was more than one-third, and by 10 am, ie three hours after thesystem had begun operation, almost half. Thepayments tended to be for smaller amounts.Correspondingly, when calculated in terms ofpayment values, the curve is flatter.
Incoming payments can very frequently be
settled immediately (88% of volume, 70% ofvalue). However, counterflows of payments%

5This limit can also be used in addition to bilateral and
multilateral limits. For example, if Bank A sets a bilateral
limit of 20 vis-à-vis Bank B and Bank C and a multilateral
limit of 40 for all other participants, it could use a total
limit of 60. Thus, Bank A can decide that all its outgoing
limit payments less the incoming payments intended for
it may at no time exceed this limit of 60. The difference
between the total credit balance in RTGSplusand the total
limit is reserved for express payments.Broad

65are also taken into account. Queues of any
noteworthy size build up only in the morn-ings. At around 9 am, the peak time, justunder 6,000 payments worth an equivalentof330 billion are held in queues. The mech-
anisms for reducing the queues are imple-mented continuously at intervals of no morethan a few minutes. While rapid processing isthe prime concern with regard to expresspayments, liquidity saving is more importantfor limit payments. This is evident from thedifferent average time that payments remainin the RTGS
plussystem (53 seconds for ex-
press payments and just over 14 minutes forlimit payments).
In order to ensure a smooth transition to
RTGS
plusthroughout the banking industry,
the Bundesbank will continue to provide ac-cess to large-value payment transactions viaELS (Euro Link System) until the end of 2004.Each working day, some 25,000 transactionssubmitted in ELS are transmitted to RTGS
plus.
In addition, around 13,000 payment ordersare submitted by ELS participants for otherELS participants. With the introduction ofRTGS
plus, the Bundesbank stopped offering
the particularly low-priced, batch-orientedELS Prior2 segment, its level of performancehaving drawn increasingly closer to the ELSPrior1 segment over time. However, it has notyet been possible to match the full volume ofPrior2 payments; consequently the Bundes-bank’s overall volume of large-value paymenttransactions has gone down by around 5,000transactions a day since the introduction ofRTGS
plus.Impact of future developments on
RTGSplus
In particular, the launch of the CLS system –announced for this year – is expected to havea major effect on individual payment systems(see the Box on page 66). In the future alarge share of the payments which originatein foreign exchange transactions and are cur-rently settled in individual payment systemssuch as RTGS
plus, TARGET or Euro1 may well
be transferred to CLS. The likely impact canbe roughly calculated from what we alreadyknow about the decline in volume and turn-over on US public holidays.

66decline in the volume of transactions of just
over 10% and a decline of around 20% invalue. The impact was even more evident inthe other systems. However, it should beborne in mind that the decline would onlycarry through in full if all foreign exchangetransactions were processed fully in CLS. Thisis, however, unlikely to be the case in theshort or the medium term.
CLS carries out settlement on the basis of
central bank liquidity which has been madeavailable in advance. For this reason the par-ticipants need to provide the system withliquidity according to a fixed pay-in schedule.CLS imposes very strict standards on thebanks’ intraday liquidity management. Withregard to euro transactions, this means thatparticipants with net payment obligationsmust transfer the net amounts they have topay in five equal instalments at specific timesbetween 8 am and 12 noon. The paymentsmust be made via TARGET to CLS Bank’saccount at the ECB. In terms of fulfillinginpayment obligations, RTGS
plusis particularly
attractive as a point of access to TARGET as itoffers a range of support functionalities spe-cially geared to CLS payments. These include
– the possibility of reserving liquidity by set-
ting a total limit, thereby ensuring thatenough money is available to execute theCLS payment;
– submitting the CLS payment as an “until”
payment. This new instrument enablesparticipants to monitor the payment con-stantly. In future RTGS
pluswill issue a
warning 15 minutes before the paymentContinuous Linked Settlement (CLS)
Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) is
the result of an initiative launched by
large international banks to develop a
worldwide foreign exchange settle-
ment system which largely eliminates
settlement risk. CLS currently has the
backing of 69 shareholder banks. The
initiative came about because the two
payments arising from a foreign ex-
change transaction are processed at
present in different clearing systems
and often in different time zones.
There is hardly any possibility of
synchronising the flow of payments,
thus reducing risk. In the future CLS
will process the payments in accord-
ance with the principle of payment
versus payment (PVP) so that no trad-
ing partner runs the risk of carrying
out his part (currency) of the transac-
tion on the value day without actually
having received the expected equiva-
lent in the other currency. The system
will be operated by New York-based
CLS Bank, which has been established
specifically for this purpose. Despite
some delays, this new procedure is
now scheduled to be introduced in
mid-2002. At its launch, CLS will handle
seven currencies (US dollar, euro, yen,
pound sterling, Swiss franc, Australian
dollar and Canadian dollar), the subse-
quent intention being to expand the
number of currencies in which it can
operate.

– generating CLS payments via ICS. Partici-
pants themselves can submit the pay-ments on time to CLS Bank if their internalapplications are out of operation;
– RTGS
pluswill also offer a particular contin-
gency plan for CLS payments. Even in theunlikely case of RTGS
plusbreaking down,
payments can still be transferred to CLS.
While CLS will reduce the volume of inter-
bank payments in the payment systems, con-tractionary effects are also to be expected inthe field of customer payments as a result ofthe EU pricing regulation of December 2001.For instance, this regulation requires that,under certain conditions, from 1 July 2003the same charges be levied on cross-borderpayment transactions up to 312,500 as on
corresponding domestic credit transfers. Al-though the pricing regulation is concernedprimarily with low-value cross-border pay-ment transactions and, in the European Com-mission’s view, it does not apply to interbankpayment systems, secondary effects are likely.If, for instance, the banks are unable to passon the costs of using interbank clearing sys-tems to their customers or can pass on onlysome of those costs, price sensitivity will in-crease in individual payment transactions.This may also result in customer paymentsbeing shifted.
The potential impact of the EU pricing regula-
tion on RTGS
pluscan be seen by the fact that,
in terms of volume, the share of payments ofup to 312,500 is just over 50%. Furthermore,
with effect from 1 January 2006, the amountto which the EU pricing regulation will applywill go up to 350,000 (these payments cur-
rently having a share of 68% in RTGS
plus).
Owing to the high proportion of customerpayments, the issue of fees in RTGS
plusis
probably more important than for the othersystems in TARGET. The EU pricing regulationcould, however, also lead to a reduced turn-over in the entire TARGET system (the shareof payments of up to 350,000 is 63%).
Depending on volume, a fee of between
30.17 and 30.24 is charged for processing
domestic payments in RTGS
plus. The rather
moderately differentiated, degressive pricestructure in RTGS

RTGS
plusin European payment
transactions
In RTGSplus, the Deutsche Bundesbank has
succeeded in establishing an innovative prod-uct on the European market. Together withstate-of-the-art technology and competitivepricing, the highly efficient, comprehensiveRTGS
plusservice with multiple options for in-
dividual use plays an important role. Thesefactors will also have a significant influenceon the debate on the future of European indi-vidual payment transactions.
The individual payment systems in the EU
have contributed to the smooth transition tomonetary union. Their structures, however,also reveal weaknesses which had to be ac-cepted in the run-up to monetary union be-cause of the intense time pressure and thecomplexity of the tasks that had to be accom-plished. The introduction of the euro bank-notes and coins at the start of 2002 markedthe completion of monetary union, and thequestion is now how the EU individual pay-ment system environment should be shapedover the long term. It also needs to be bornein mind that eastward enlargement of the EUmeans that a new challenge is just aroundthe corner. If the situation is compared withthat in the United States, it might be assumed
that, in the longer run, market needs in theeuro area will be met by a single RTGS systemand a liquidity-saving hybrid system. How-ever, RTGS
plushas shown that, on balance, it
is possible to combine the two philosophies.
For the central banks the main question is
how to improve the TARGET system. There is,first of all, no doubt that, owing to the manycross-references to monetary policy and giventhe mandate in Article 3 of the Statute of theESCB,
6putting that kind of infrastructure in
place should be viewed as central to the tasksof the Eurosystem. However, it is question-able whether TARGET’s present interlinkedstructure will be appropriate over the longterm to meet market requirements for effi-ciency and soundness. It is precisely in pay-ment transactions that economies of scaleplay a crucial role in terms of output coveringcosts. In the TARGET system as it is at present,the volume of business is concentrated on asmall number of systems. This means that,taken together, the three largest RTGS sys-tems in the TARGET system account for some70% of the total (domestic and cross-border)volume and the six largest RTGS systems fornearly 90%. Ultimately, this is also likely to re-flect the fact that banks which operate inter-nationally have been increasingly centralisingtheir liquidity management in euro since itsintroduction.

69Furthermore, from a pan-European perspec-
tive, the TARGET system as it is at the mo-ment does not meet all the requirements ofthe market. For instance, transparency in TAR-GET does not cover the whole of Europe (egby offering the means to monitor queues ofincoming payments across all RTGS systems).It is also difficult to imagine more complicatedmechanisms for liquidity management andsaving being implemented across all 15 RTGSsystems. However, given the upcoming chal-lenges, improvements are urgently required.For example, market participants in the euroarea could be offered completely new oppor-tunities for liquidity management if, say, allparticipants’ accounts were managed from acentral technical platform. It should also benoted that, in the current TARGET system, theinterposition of the Interlinking componentcauses delays between the time at which theamount is debited in the submitting RTGSsystem and the time at which it is credited inthe receiving RTGS system. Although cross-border payments are generally processedwithin five minutes, the interlinking structuredoes not do sufficient justice to the reality ofthe single currency area and the need for lesscomplexity.
From business perspectives, consolidation
cannot be avoided in the medium term. How-ever, as things look at the moment, a technic-ally uniform TARGET system throughout theeuro area is not on the horizon. Rather, it canbe assumed that consolidation will first beprogressive, with only a limited number ofcentral banks being involved. It is likely tohinge on the RTGS systems in common usebeing designed in such a way as to be“client-friendly”, the clients in this context
being the national central banks. The individ-ual central banks would, for example, eachhave sole access to their participants’ dataand accounts. On the one hand, this wouldenable a common technical processing plat-form to be used and, on the other, the centralbanks concerned would retain the responsi-bility for conducting the business. In somecountries, such client-based concepts have al-ready been made public. RTGS
plus, too, could
be expanded to implement this kind of con-cept within a reasonable period of time.Owing to its decided decentralised structure,the Bundesbank has accumulated extensiveinternal experience of technical centralisationover the past ten years. Despite the concen-tration of technical resources, which was ne-cessary for economic reasons, it succeeded inleaving the branches’ decentralised responsi-bility for conducting the business largely in-tact.
From the Bundesbank’s point of view, the fol-
lowing aspects would need to be taken intoaccount in relation to actual cooperation on acommon platform.
– The common platform should present a
broad business orientation and includecommercial payments as a target seg-ment. Only this kind of approach wouldmake it possible to achieve the economiesof scale that are economically necessary.The price is still the factor which distin-guishes individual from retail payments.

70should be the minimum. The liquidity-
saving real-time gross settlement approachwith extensive information transparency islikely to hold the key to the future. This isborne out by a brief glance at the situ-ation in other European countries. Italy,for instance, has recently announced thatit will be modernising its RTGS system andimplementing liquidity-saving and liquid-ity-managing elements. In France, too,market participants are being offeredboth real-time gross settlement via theRTGS system TBF and a liquidity-savingsettlement alternative in the hybrid systemPNS.
– It is possible to respect the principle of
subsidiarity in the Eurosystem and culturaldiversity in the euro area only if the actualconduct of business and customer care re-main in the hands of the national centralbanks. This also applies to the businessareas with points of contact for paymenttransactions (eg responsibility for process-ing refinancing transactions).
– In other words, only technical operations
should be centralised. In order to achievea certain degree of neutrality, it might beconsidered appropriate, for example, toestablish an independent operating com-
pany owned by the participating centralbanks. However, the range of services onoffer should be designed strictly in accord-ance with market and customer needs.
Payment transactions will continue to evolve
rapidly in the period ahead. The introductionof new technologies will further enhance theperformance of the systems and further relaxthe spatial ties between participants and sys-tem operators, which are already loose.Against a backdrop of globalisation and fur-ther concentration in the banking industry, aneven tighter interweaving of what were oncenational market segments is to be expected.The emergence of new service providers andincreased price awareness will further stimu-late competitive pressure – for the centralbanks, too. At the same time, the eastwardenlargement of the EU presents fresh politicalchallenges to be overcome. In view of thesefactors, a common technical TARGET plat-form would appear to be the only sensiblelong-term solution for the Eurosystem.Owing to its high level of acceptance, its in-novative design and its low prices, RTGS
plus
may well be the model to be followed and setthe standard.RTGSplussets
