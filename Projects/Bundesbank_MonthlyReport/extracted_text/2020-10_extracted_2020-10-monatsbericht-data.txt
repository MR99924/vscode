Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Economic output in Germany is likely to have 
risen sharply in the third quarter of 2020. As 
measured by quarterly gross domestic product 
(GDP), the German economy may already have 
recouped slightly more than half of the dra -
matic losses sustained in the first half of the 
year, but is still around 5% below its pre- crisis 
level of the fourth quarter of 2019.1 The main 
reason for the strong rebound in the third 
quarter is that, after bottoming out in April, the 
economy had already recovered rapidly in many 
areas over the remainder of the second quar -
ter. As a result, at the beginning of the third 
quarter, economic output already exceeded the 
average of the second quarter by a consider -
able degree. It has then likely moved towards a 
more subdued path of recovery in the third 
quarter.
The industrial sector may have recorded com -
paratively robust growth. It had fallen particu -
larly sharply in the second quarter and then 
picked up vigorously up until July. The recovery 
in industrial output took a brief pause in Au -
gust, although this was attributable to the de -
cline in production in the automotive sector, 
which was mainly related to plant shutdowns. 
By contrast, industrial orders continued to in -
crease and almost returned to pre- crisis levels. 
Moreover, according to the ifo Institute’s Sep -
tember survey, industrial enterprises increas -
ingly assessed their situation as less unfavour -
able. Their outlook for the next few months 
also improved further. By contrast, sentiment 
among service providers (excluding trade) de -
teriorated somewhat in September for the first 
time since the spring. The Purchasing Man -
agers Index (PMI) for the services sector has 
now fallen in October for the third time in suc -
cession. The recent sharp rise in the number of 
infections and the resulting tightening of con -tainment measures in some regions are likely to 
weigh predominantly on some services sectors 
such as hotels and restaurants. As things cur -
rently stand, the German economy is likely to 
continue its recovery in the current quarter, but 
at a considerably slower pace. The pre- crisis 
level is still likely to be significantly undershot at 
the end of the year.
Industry
The recovery in industrial activity took a brief 
pause in August 2020. Compared with the pre -
vious month, which had undergone a small up -
ward revision, industrial output even declined 
somewhat (-¾%) in seasonally adjusted terms. 
Following the strong countermovement in May 
and June, the pace of recovery had already 
slowed in July. However, the slight decline in 
August is largely attributable to developments 
in the automotive sector, where output fell 
considerably (-12½%), in part owing to the tim -
ing of plant shutdowns. This implies that, ex -
cluding motor vehicles, output would have 
risen again slightly on the month (+1½%). Ac -
cording to the German Association of the 
Automotive Industry, the number of units pro -
duced was higher again in September, suggest -
ing that the decline in August represents a tem -
porary dip. Nevertheless, the number of units 
was still around one- eighth below the pre- crisis 
level of the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition 
to the automotive sector, the manufacture of 
pharmaceutical products was also down signifi -
cantly in August (-10½%). However, on an 
average of July and August, industrial output 
increased sharply compared with the strongly 
depressed second quarter (+13½%). The pro -German eco -

1 GDP is calculated on a quarterly basis by the Federal Stat -
istical Office. On a monthly basis, the economic low point 
in April is likely to have been significantly below the aver -
age of the second quarter of 2020 (and in September 
probably slightly above the average of the third quarter). 
From this perspective, the share of the downturn that has 
already been recuperated would therefore be higher still.Deutsche Bundesbank

duction of capital goods rose particularly 
sharply (+20¾%), but output of intermediate 
and consumer goods (+9% and +7% respect -
ively) was also on a clear upward trajectory. 
Nevertheless, overall industrial output is still 
just over one- tenth below the pre- crisis level of 
the fourth quarter of 2019.
In August 2020, German industrial orders con -
tinued to recover at the more moderate pace 
of the previous month. In seasonally adjusted 
terms, demand for German industrial products 
showed a rise of 4½% compared with the pre -
vious month, the figure for which has been re -
vised upwards somewhat. Following the fourth 
consecutive increase, the level of the final quar -
ter of 2019 was very nearly achieved towards 
the end of the period under review, off by just 
1½%. On an average of July and August, there 
was a substantial increase (+27¾%) compared 
with the previous quarter, which had been 
marked by the downturn in April. The counter -
movements were particularly strong in those 
areas where the collapse had been very pro -
nounced beforehand. From a sectoral perspec -
tive, significantly more new orders than in the 
second quarter were therefore recorded for 
intermediate goods and, in particular, capital 
goods, where volatile developments in the 
automotive sector had left their mark (+19¾% 
and +37¾% respectively). At the same time, 
demand for consumer goods was also higher 
(+3½%). In a regional breakdown, the increase 
in domestic demand was still significantly 
smaller than that of foreign demand, which 
had seen a particularly steep decline before -
hand (+13½% compared with +39¾%). Large- 
scale domestic orders in June and the drop in 
domestic demand for motor vehicles in August 
were also a factor here. In fact, the latter de -
creased in Germany on a month- on- month 
basis, whereas euro area demand, in particular, 
saw a significant increase.
Nominal industrial sales remained unchanged 
in seasonally adjusted terms in August 2020. As 
in the case of production, there appears to 
have been a pause in activity here, too, follow -Orders increase

ing the major steps towards recovery in the 
preceding months. However, on an average of 
July and August, turnover rose steeply com -
pared with the second quarter, which had been 
marked by the downturn (+17½%). Capital 
goods saw a particularly sharp catch- up move -
ment in the third quarter, as had been the case 
with production, above all in the automotive 
sector. In regional terms, export sales rose 
more strongly than sales at home (+22¼% and 
+13% respectively), although they had also ex -
perienced a significantly sharper downturn in 
the second quarter. 70% of the losses incurred 
since the final quarter of 2019 have now been 
recouped in both Germany and abroad. In Au -
gust 2020, nominal exports of goods rose 
markedly on the month in seasonally adjusted 
terms (+2½%) and remained on the more mod -
erate recovery path embarked upon in July. On 
an average of July and August, the increase in 
exports of goods was considerably more pro -
nounced overall compared with the strongly 
depressed second quarter – in both real and 
nominal terms (+19% in each case). Given the 
fact that coronavirus impacted virtually all 
countries worldwide in the spring, this increase 
was broadly distributed in regional terms. There 
was particularly strong growth in exports to the 
United Kingdom, the central and eastern non- 
euro area EU countries, the United States and 
the euro area. By contrast, exports to Japan 
dropped markedly. After seasonal adjustment, 
nominal imports of goods rose very steeply in 
August 2020. In comparison with the previous 
month, the increase was even stronger than 
that seen for exports of goods (+7%). Taking 
the average of July and August, however, there 
was a shortfall compared with growth in ex -
ports, in both nominal and real terms (+10½% 
and +9% respectively).
Construction
The coronavirus crisis is still leaving only small 
traces in the German construction sector. Un -
like most other industries, output in this sector 
was only marginally down in the second quar -ter, which is also why a subsequent recovery 
failed to materialise. Instead, construction out -
put in August 2020 fell slightly on the month 
after seasonal adjustment (-¼%). On an aver -
age of July and August, it dropped somewhat 
more sharply compared with the average of 
the spring months (-3%). This decline was 
markedly more moderate in the main construc -
tion sector than in the finishing trades, where 
the data are prone to revision. New orders in 
the main construction sector posted a slight 
seasonally adjusted rise on an average of July 
and August compared with the previous quar -
ter. Not least in view of the strong incoming 
orders in the final quarter of 2019 and the first 
quarter of 2020, the order situation in the con -
struction sector can still be classified as very 
good. Moreover, according to the ifo Institute, 
the level of equipment utilisation in the main 
construction sector increased marginally in 
September and remains significantly above its 
long- term average. The business climate in this 
sector also continued to improve.
Labour market
The slight recovery in the labour market con -
tinued recently. Seasonally adjusted employ -
ment in August 2020 experienced the second 
month- on- month rise since the start of the 
pandemic, although there was only a slight in -
crease of 19,000 in the number of persons in 
work in Germany. In July, low- paid employ -
ment, which had previously also recorded the 
strongest decline, grew in particular. The num -
ber of filled jobs subject to social security con -
tributions was higher, especially in services such 
as health and social work services and the hotel 
and restaurant sector. By contrast, employment 
in the manufacturing sector continued to re -
cord a marked decline.
Although short- time working has declined 
sharply in the meantime, it is still being used on 
a considerable scale. According to an initial es -
timate by the Federal Employment Agency, fol -
lowing the peak of just under 6 million in April, Industrial sales 
stagnated, 
goods exports 
and imports 
continued to

the number of short- time workers fell by al -
most three-  tenths to 4.24 million up to July. 
This means that at that time around one in 
eight employees subject to social security con -
tributions was still in short- time work. As there 
was also a fall in the average number of hours 
worked per short- time worker, the volume of 
labour lost through short- time work had al -
ready shrunk by 44% compared with the peak 
in April.
The number of persons officially registered as 
unemployed remained broadly stable over the 
summer months. In September, the seasonally 
adjusted figure was 34,000 below the June 
peak. This small decrease is entirely attributable 
to a drop in the number of unemployed per -
sons receiving the basic welfare allowance. 
One factor in this could have been the slow 
resumption of active labour market policy 
measures. These had been suspended at the 
start of the pandemic, contributing to the rise 
in unemployment at the time. There is not yet 
any evidence of a decline in the unemployment 
insurance system with its more cyclical charac -
ter. Due to rounding, the unemployment rate 
fell by a moderate 0.1  percentage point to 
6.3%. Leading labour market indicators have 
continued to improve and suggest that em -
ployment and unemployment will continue to 
recover.
Prices
Depressed by concerns about future develop -
ment of demand against a backdrop of resur -
gent infection rates, crude oil prices did not 
continue their recovery in September 2020. An -
other important factor in this context was un -
certainty about the ongoing implementation of 
output cuts agreed by OPEC members. Prices 
were down by 7% compared with August and 
were as much as one- third below their previous 
year’s level. Prices in October have been mov -
ing more or less sideways so far. As this report 
went to press, the price of a barrel of Brent 
crude oil stood at US$42. Crude oil futures were trading at a slight premium. The premium 
on crude oil futures was US$1½ for deliveries 
six months ahead and US$2½ for deliveries 12 
months ahead.
In August, import prices again increased mod -
erately overall, mainly due to energy. They were 
unchanged if energy is excluded, however. Do -
mestic industrial sales prices, for which data are 
already available for September, went up 
slightly both overall and if energy is excluded. 
As in previous months, the previous year’s level 
was significantly undershot at the end of the 
period under review, with import prices down 
by 4% and industrial producer prices 1% lower.
Consumer prices (HICP) were slightly lower in 
September after seasonal adjustment. Energy 
prices dropped markedly as a result of the re -
newed fall in oil prices and food also cost 
slightly less. As prices for new clothing collec -
tions showed a weaker increase than in previ -
ous years, industrial goods excluding energy 
became less expensive overall. By contrast, 
prices for services remained largely unchanged. 
Annual headline HICP inflation was down by 
0.4% on the year, compared with being 0.1% 
lower in August.2 Excluding energy and food, 
the rate fell from +0.6% to +0.3%. If in add -
ition the volatile clothing and travel compon -
ents are factored out, inflation still stood at 
+¾%, however. In the remaining months of 
2020, headline inflation is likely to fall some -
what more significantly below its previous 
year’s level owing to the recent decline in crude 
oil prices and base effects. The rates should 
turn positive again when the temporary cut in 
VAT rates is rescinded in January 2021. Inflation 
rates of well above 2% are then likely as from 
the second half of 2021, owing to the fact that 
prices are currently being dampened by the 
VAT cut.Unemployment

Public finances3
Local government finances
Local government core budgets and off- budget 
entities achieved a balanced result in the 
second quarter of this year. In the previous 
year, they had posted a surplus of €4½ billion. 
Revenue was down by a total of 1½% (€1 bil -
lion). Tax revenue fell much more sharply, by 
14½% (€4 billion). Revenue from local business 
tax, a major source of income, dropped by 
39%. By contrast, income tax shares increased. 
As a rule, they are based on the previous quar -
ter, and first-  quarter tax revenue had barely 
been affected by the coronavirus crisis. Because 
a large number of institutions had to close due 
to the pandemic and fees were suspended, rev -
enue from fees saw a sharp decline (of 16%, or 
€1½ billion). By contrast, transfers from state 
government rose steeply, by 19½% (€5 billion). 
Liquidity assistance provided by the federal 
states played a role in this. For example, North 
Rhine-  Westphalia, in particular, appears to 
have brought forward general purpose grants 
(around €1½ billion) to stabilise local govern -
ment budgets.
Expenditure rose strongly, by 5½% (€3½ bil -
lion). Staff costs, a major item, saw dispropor -
tionately low growth of 3%. Spending on so -
cial benefits increased only moderately, by 
1½%, with accommodation costs for the long- 
term unemployed rising in particular. Other op -
erating expenditure even stagnated, by and 
large. By contrast, grants to non- government 
entities rose very substantially (by 11%), as did 
fixed asset formation (by 14%, or €1 billion).
Overall in the first half of the year, local govern -
ment thus recorded a high deficit of a little over 
€9½ billion, compared with just a slight deficit 
in the first six months of the previous year. The 
coronavirus crisis had a considerable impact 
only in the second quarter, although significant 
declines in tax revenue were already recorded 
in the first quarter. However, the situation will 
probably ease as the year progresses. Central and state government will still compensate 
local governments for expected shortfalls in 
local business tax of €11 billion (the reference 
point being the tax estimate made in the au -
tumn of last year). In addition, central govern -
ment is promising €2½ billion in compensation 
to local public transport enterprises, which had 
lost large portions of their income in the spring. 
Central government is furthermore perman -
ently increasing its share in the accommoda -
tion costs for recipients of unemployment 
benefit II by around €3½ billion annually. By 
contrast, general purpose grants that have al -
ready been brought forward are likely to 
dampen revenue somewhat in the second half 
of the year. Overall, local government budgets Significant

phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the

November), by contrast, contain an in- depth description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter.

could still be close to balance at the end of 
2020 (2019: surplus of just over €5½ billion).
Against the backdrop of the overall balanced 
result, local government debt remained virtu -
ally unchanged from the end of the previous 
quarter, amounting to €137½ billion (including 
liabilities to the public sector). Credit market 
debt rose slightly, to just under €97 billion. The 
volume of cash advances fell marginally, to €38 
billion. Developments differed between the 
federal states. Local governments in Bavaria, 
for example, bridged a funding gap in the 
second quarter with additional cash advances 
on balance. By contrast, a surplus was still gen -
erated in North Rhine-  Westphalia during this 
period, which was drawn upon to repay a small 
portion of the large volume of cash advances. 
The surpluses budgeted for in the second half 
of the year are likely to be used, at least in part, 
to pay back loans. While the current low inter -
est rates make higher debt levels appear sus -
tainable, the credit burdens still entail risks, es -
pecially at the level of individual local govern -
ments. Local governments and, within the 
framework of budgetary oversight, state gov -
ernments, too, are called upon to effectively 
limit such risks. It is also the duty of state gov -
ernments to ensure that all their local govern -
ments receive financing commensurate with 
the tasks of the latter through their local gov -
ernment financial equalisation schemes.
In the coming year, local government budgets 
will probably tip into a strong deficit, as rev -
enue growth is likely to continue being damp -
ened by the crisis and by certain measures. For 
example, the central government funds to 
compensate for crisis- related shortfalls in local 
business tax were limited to the current year. 
According to the latest tax estimate, however, 
tangible revenue shortfalls are also to be ex -
pected in subsequent years. This is partly due, 
not least, to the relaxed depreciation rules as 
part of the economic stimulus package. The 
second Family Relief Act (Zweites Familienent -
lastungsgesetz)  will also lead to tax revenue 
losses. Based on the general rules in numerous federal states, transfers from state government 
under the tax revenue sharing scheme are set 
to be lower than previously expected, too. 
Local government receipts from fixed shares in 
state government tax revenue will therefore be 
much lower in the absence of smoothing ad -
justments.
The crisis has brought to light, once again, the 
problems within the currently highly volatile 
system of local government financing. State 
governments are called upon to keep the crisis- 
related revenue shortfalls of their local govern -
ments at a sustainable level. It would thus seem 
appropriate to undertake a fundamental re -
form to stabilise local government revenue in 
times of crisis as well.4 Simply loosening 
budgetary rules for local government would 
not provide a sustainable solution.

bond market in August 2020 was down on 
July’s  figure (€172.2 billion). After deducting 
the significantly lower redemptions and taking 
account of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, net issuance of domestic 
debt securities came to €60.4 billion. The out -
standing volume of foreign debt securities in 
Germany fell by €4.4 billion in the reporting 
month, which meant that the outstanding vol -
ume of debt instruments in the German market 
rose by €55.9 billion overall.
In the month under review, the public sector 
issued debt securities worth a net €49.9 billion 
(compared with €35.6 billion in July). Central 
government was the main issuer of new secur -
ities (€44.0 billion), chiefly in the form of Treas -

(Schätze) on the market (€5.8 billion) and con -
tinued to service the other Bund maturity seg -
ments. State and local governments issued 
their own bonds worth €5.9 billion net. Central 
government is primarily tapping the capital 
market to finance additional credit needs aris -
ing from the impact of the COVID-  19 pan -
demic.
In August, domestic enterprises issued bonds 
with a net value of €8.7 billion, compared with 
€15.5 billion one month earlier. Other financial 
intermediaries were the chief issuers on bal -
ance.
Domestic credit institutions increased their cap -
ital market debt by €1.7 billion net in the re -
porting month, following net redemptions of 
€2.0 billion in July. On balance, it was only the 
outstanding volume of debt securities issued by 
specialised credit institutions (€4.4 billion) 
– which include, for example, public promo -
tional banks – that saw an increase. By con -
trast, mortgage Pfandbriefe and other bank 
debt securities recorded net redemptions to the 
tune of €1.6 billion and €1.1 billion, respect -
ively.
Foreign investors proved to be the main buyers 
in August (€56.3 billion). One reason for the 
strong demand from non-  resident investors 
was the high volume of issuance by the public 
sector. The Bundesbank acquired debt secur -
ities totalling €18.0 billion net, predominantly 
under the Eurosystem’s asset purchase pro -
grammes. By contrast, domestic non- banks 
and credit institutions disposed of debt secur -
ities amounting to €10.7 billion and €7.6 billion 
respectively, in net terms. While non- banks off -
loaded mainly domestic securities, credit insti -
tutions’ sales focused on foreign securities.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed new shares worth €2.9 billion in the 
German equity market. The volume of foreign equities in the German market rose by €6.4 bil -
lion over the same period. On balance, domes -
tic non- banks were by far the main purchasers 
of shares (€7.6 billion). Domestic credit institu -
tions increased their holdings by €1.0 billion. 
Foreign investors stepped up their equity ex -
posure in Germany by €0.7 billion on balance.
Mutual funds
German mutual funds recorded net inflows of 
€6.3 billion in August, compared with €7.4 bil -
lion in July. On balance, specialised funds re -
served for institutional investors were the chief 
beneficiaries (€4.2 billion). Among the various 
asset classes, new shares were placed on the 
market primarily by mixed securities funds (€3.1 
billion) and open- end real estate funds (€1.3 
billion). The outstanding volume of foreign

were virtually the only purchasers of mutual 
fund shares in August (€15.8 billion), acquiring 
more foreign than domestic securities. Domes -
tic credit institutions expanded their fund port -
folios by €0.7 billion, while foreign investors 
were only marginally active in the German mar -
ket on balance.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €16.5 billion in August 2020, down €4.6 bil -
lion from the previous month’s level. This was 
chiefly attributable to a smaller surplus in the 
goods account. By contrast, the surplus in invis -
ible current transactions, which comprise ser -
vices as well as primary and secondary income, 
posted an increase.
In August, the surplus in the goods account de -
creased by €5.7 billion on the month to €14.4 
billion, with exports of goods falling more 
sharply than imports.
The surplus on invisible current transactions 
rose by €1.1 billion in August to €2.1 billion, 
largely because net receipts in primary income 
expanded by €1.1 billion to €8.2 billion. A de -
cline in dividend payments to non- residents on 
portfolio investment played a major role here. 
Moreover, the deficit in the secondary income 
account narrowed by €0.3 billion to €3.2 bil -
lion. Although receipts declined slightly, mainly 
off the back of lower government revenue 
from current taxes on income and wealth of 
non- residents, expenditure fell somewhat more 
sharply, partly owing to a decline in general 
government payments to the EU budget in 
connection with financing related to gross na -
tional income. Moreover, the deficit in the ser -
vices account rose only slightly by €0.3 billion 
to €2.9 billion as expenditure fell somewhat 
less than revenue. This was partly because 
travel expenditure increased, as it usually does 
at this time of year, after the measures to con -
tain the pandemic were eased in many coun -
tries starting from June.Current account

In August 2020, shifting assessments of the dy -
namics of the COVID-  19 pandemic continued 
to shape events in the international financial 
markets. This uncertainty was also reflected in 
Germany’s cross- border portfolio investment, 
which recorded net capital inflows of €46.3 bil -
lion in August (after €12.1 billion in July). For -
eign investors acquired German securities 
worth €57.0 billion net. One reason for this 
lively demand was the large issuance volume of 
Federal securities (Bunds), which are considered 
particularly secure. Foreign investors focused 
their demand almost exclusively on bonds 
(€37.1 billion) and money market paper (€19.2 
billion), as well as a modest volume of shares 
(€0.7 billion). Purchases and sales of mutual 
fund shares offset each other during the period 
under review. Domestic investors purchased 
foreign securities totalling €10.6 billion net. 
On balance, they acquired foreign investment 
fund shares (€10.3 billion) and regular shares 
(€4.7 billion), but divested themselves of 
bonds  issued  by non- residents (€2.4 billion). 
German investors offloaded exclusively euro-  
denominated bonds on balance, while main -
taining net demand for foreign currency bonds. 
They also sold off foreign money market paper 
(€2.0 billion).
Financial derivatives recorded net capital ex -
ports of €9.2 billion in August (July: €11.6 bil -
lion).Direct investment posted net capital exports of 
€3.7 billion in the reporting month (after in -
flows of €9.6 billion in July). Domestic enter -
prises increased their foreign direct investment 
by €13.6 billion, boosting the equity capital of 
foreign branches by €9.9 billion and granting 
additional loans of €3.7 billion to affiliated en -
terprises. Foreign firms stepped up their direct 
investment in Germany by €9.9 billion. On bal -
ance, they did so mainly through additional 
intra- group lending (€8.8 billion), with a focus 
on financial loans. Moreover, foreign enter -
prises stepped up their equity stakes in Ger -
many by €1.1 billion.
Other statistically recorded investment, which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investment, saw net outflows 
of €69.7 billion in August (after €21.1 billion in 
July). Cross- border transactions settled via the 
Bundesbank’s accounts, in particular, resulted 
in net capital exports of €35.7 billion, increas -
ing TARGET2 claims by €37.0 billion. Outflows 
were also generated by enterprises and individ -
uals (€23.0 billion), monetary financial institu -
tions excluding the Bundesbank (€6.5 billion) 
and general government (€4.5 billion).

Developments in the German banking 
 system during the negative interest rate 
policy period
In June 2014, the ECB Governing Council decided to lower the interest rate on the deposit facility 
from 0% to -0.10%. This was the first time that a Eurosystem policy rate had been in negative 
territory. In the years that followed, the interest rate on the deposit facility was gradually lowered 
to -0.50%. Some market interest rates and yields also turned negative after June 2014: money 
market rates were the first to follow the interest rate on the deposit facility below the zero mark, 
while longer- term capital market yields only moved into negative territory with something of a 
time lag and with interruptions.
By contrast, German banks’ deposit rates came to a halt at the zero mark for the most part, espe -
cially for household deposits. At the same time, lending rates continued to decline in line with 
general interest rate developments. This narrowed German banks’ interest margins in lending and 
deposit business with the private non- financial sector.
Taken in isolation, shrinking interest margins could inhibit banks’ willingness to lend, thereby 
impeding the intended effect of the accommodative monetary policy measures. However, the 
diminishing interest margins did not coincide with a deterioration in banks’ profitability. This is 
because, up until the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, their adverse impact on earnings was 
offset by positive income effects originating from favourable economic developments and the 
low interest rate level. Low loan loss provisions and brisk credit demand are two major factors in 
this regard. That is also the reason why there has been no indication for Germany thus far that 
banks’ willingness to provide credit might have declined. On the contrary, banks continued to 
expand their lending and deposit business, with the expansion of lending business driven not only 
by demand but also by supply.
The economic downturn caused by the coronavirus crisis is now likely to dampen the profitability 
of German banks. Results for German banks for the first and second quarters are already showing 
an increase in loan loss provisions, and the sharp economic downturn means that this develop -
ment is likely to continue. As loan loss provisions rise, the pressure that narrowing interest mar -
gins exert on profitability becomes more difficult for banks to offset. This increases the likelihood 
that margin pressure will lead to a tightening of the supply of credit. At the same time, the mon -
etary policy, supervisory and fiscal policy measures taken in response to the coronavirus crisis are 
counteracting such a risk.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Against the backdrop of a persistently weak in -
flation outlook in the euro area, the ECB Gov -
erning Council decided in June 2014 to lower 
the interest rate on the deposit facility from 0% 
to -0.10%. This was the first time that a Euro -
system policy rate had been in negative terri -
tory. The interest rate on the deposit facility 
was later gradually lowered further to -0.50% 
in September 2019. For the purposes of this 
article, the point in time when the interest rate 
on the deposit facility was lowered into nega -
tive territory for the first time is defined as the 
beginning of the negative interest rate policy 
(NIRP) period. Accordingly, in this article, the 
period from June 2014 to August 2020 stakes 
out the time frame for analysing developments 
in the German banking system.
In addition to the negative interest rate on the 
deposit facility, other monetary policy measures 
are crucial for understanding the developments 
observed in the German banking system. Most 
notably, these include the expanded asset pur -
chase programme (APP) and the three series of 
targeted longer-  term refinancing operations 
(TLTROs) (see the chart on p. 17). The excess 
liquidity1 generated by these measures was a 
key driver behind money market rates follow -
ing the interest rate on the deposit facility deep 
into negative territory.2 Empirical evidence sug -
gests, furthermore, that the APP contributed to 
the lowering of long- term capital market yields, 
thereby also flattening the yield curve.3
In this setting of negative interest rates and fur -
ther expansionary measures, it became increas -
ingly important over time to keep an eye on the 
relationship between banks’ profitability and 
their willingness to provide credit in order to as -
sess monetary policy transmission. This is be -
cause, in a protracted period of low or negative 
interest rates, banks’ profitability and thus their 
capital levels may come under pressure. In this 
vein, banks are reluctant to pass through nega -
tive interest rates to their depositors.4 This 
seems to be particularly true of household de -posits.5 This reluctance to pass on negative mar -
ket interest rates to depositors, combined with 
the continued pass- through of interest rate cuts 
to borrowers, leads to a decline in the spread 
between lending and deposit rates. This spread 
is the interest margin that banks generate. All 
other things being equal, the negative interest 
rate applied to excess liquidity impairs banks’ 
profitability as well. In combination with the 
narrowing interest margin, the resulting pres -
sure on profitability could, in principle, lead to 
capital constraints and a lower credit supply.6
This is how a situation can arise in which an 
accommodative monetary policy turns out to 
narrow the supply of credit over time. One pre -
requisite for this is an adverse effect of the 
NIRP on banks’ profitability and thus on their 
capital levels. However, such a burden does not 
come about automatically, since the margin 
pressure caused by the negative interest rate 
can be offset by the positive effects, if any, that 
the accommodative monetary policy has on 
other profitability components. For example, 
the NIRP has a positive impact on economic 
developments, which, because credit default 
risk declines, means that banks set aside less in 
loan loss provisions. In addition, the NIRP helps 
stimulate credit demand.
A further prerequisite for the negative interest 
rate to have a contractionary effect on banks’ 
credit supply is a positive relationship between 
capital levels and the credit supply. As long as 
banks are well capitalised, that relationship is 
unlikely to materialise. However, an adverse ef -
fect on the credit supply cannot be ruled out if 
capital levels are only just above the regulatory 
minimum.7Onset of NIRP

If the NIRP in the euro area were to lead to a 
tightening of the supply of bank credit, this 
would run counter to the actual intended ef -
fect of monetary policy since, during the NIRP 
period, monetary policy in the euro area sought 
to ease any existing credit supply constraints in 
the banking sector. This is reflected, for in -
stance, in the launch of the TLTROs.8 These op -
erations are currently offering banks the possi -
bility of taking up longer- term funding at fa -
vourable rates compared with most of their 
other sources of funding. For banks that 
achieve their individual benchmark for loan 
growth, the interest rate on the TLTRO- III series 
is between -0.5% and -1% over a given period 
of time. When viewed in isolation, this sup -
ports banks’ profitability owing to the lower 
interest expenditure. The Eurosystem further -
more adopted a two- tier system for remunerat -
ing excess liquidity at the end of 2019. This 
measure also improved banks’ profitability be -
cause it means that banks’ excess liquidity is 
remunerated at 0% up to a certain level (cur -
rently six times their minimum reserve), instead 
of at the negative interest rate on the deposit 
facility (currently -0.5%).
Against this background, this article first looks 
at how German banks’ profitability has evolved 
during the NIRP period, focusing above all on 
how the negative interest rate on the deposit 
facility impacted on margins in lending and de -
posit business with the private non- financial 
sector. This is followed by an assessment of de -
velopments in German banks’ lending business 
with this sector. The principal focus here is 
whether signs of supply- side constraints can be 
found and how developments in lending busi -
ness in turn impact on profitability.
Since March 2020, the coronavirus crisis has 
been the key factor dictating developments in 
the German banking system. The spread of 
COVID-  19 and the measures taken to contain it 
caused a historic decline in economic output in 
Germany. Monetary and fiscal policymakers 
and banking supervisors took various measures 
to cushion the considerably negative impact on the economy, thus also supporting the German 
banking system.
The core function of the monetary policy meas -
ures was to ensure the broad supply of liquidity 
to the private non- financial sector. Given the 
risks to price stability, the monetary policy 
stance in the euro area was therefore made 
even more expansionary. Amongst other 
things, the ECB Governing Council initiated fur -
ther non- standard measures with the launch of 
the pandemic emergency purchase programme 
(PEPP) as well as pandemic emergency longer- 
term refinancing operations (PELTROs). In add -
ition, it made the conditions of the pre- existing 
TLTRO- III series even more attractive.

their lending.9 Fiscal policymakers, too, initi -
ated numerous support measures,10 including 
extensive lending programmes by promotional 
banks with a full assumption of credit risk by 
government in some cases.11
Despite these measures, increased loan loss 
provisions will probably be the main burden on 
banks’ profitability in the wake of the corona -
virus crisis. In addition, an increase in risk 
weights is expected to put a strain on banks’ 
capital ratios.12 How great the burden will be 
very much depends on how the pandemic 
evolves. Together with the declining interest 
margin, the strain on profitability could become 
so intense that there is a greater likelihood of 
banks cutting back on the supply of credit.
Banks’ profitability 
in the NIRP period
The profitability of German banks has so far 
proved to be stable overall during the NIRP 
period. Compared with the period from 1999 
to 2007,13 the net interest margin has been 
lower in the NIRP period.14 By contrast, the 
valuation result, the most important compon -
ent of which is loan loss provisions, moved in 
banks’ favour during the NIRP period (see the 
upper chart on p. 23).15 A key factor behind 
this favourable development was the good 
state of the German economy up to the onset 
of the coronavirus crisis. This was also sup -
ported by expansionary monetary policy meas -
ures, including the negative interest rate on the 
deposit facility (see the box on pp. 19 ff.).
The reluctance to pass through negative inter -
est rates to depositors played a key role in the 
declining net interest margin observed in the 
German banking system. This reluctance is par -
ticularly evident in deposit business with house -
holds.16 In terms of volume, deposit business 
with households is more significant than de -
posit business with non- financial corporations 
(NFCs).17 At the beginning of the NIRP period, 
the average interest rate on household deposits applied by the “median” bank – i.e. the median 
of the distribution of deposit rates at the indi -
vidual bank level – was still well above the zero 
mark (see the lower chart on p. 23). Over the 
course of the NIRP period, the median then 
gradually approached the zero mark. In August 
2020, it came to only around 0.01%. The 90th 
percentile of the distribution is also just slightly 
above this level. By contrast, the average inter -
est rates on NFC deposits have been moving 
into negative territory since the end of 2016. At 
the same time, the share of banks that charge 
negative deposit rates on average has risen 
steadily since then. In business with NFCs, then, 
banks are able to charge negative deposit rates 
across the board. This is particularly true of 
sight deposits. In this category, around 63% of 
the reporting banks reported a negative 
volume- weighted average interest rate in Au -
gust 2020. However, the growing introduction 
of negative deposit rates in business with NFCs 
did not lead to an abrupt drop in these rates 
deep into negative territory.… supervisors

13 The reference period covers a window in which the 
binding effect of the zero mark as regards the interest rates 
applied to deposits is likely to have played only a minor 
role, or no role at all, for banks. The three- month EURIBOR’s 
lowest level in the reference period was 2%. In addition, 
the reference period was characterised by periods of falling 
and rising policy rates. The beginning of the period was 
marked by the launch of the euro as book money and the 
transfer of monetary policy responsibility from the national 
central banks to the Eurosystem. The reference period ends 
before the peak of the global financial market crisis.

in relation to total assets. Net interest income is the differ -
ence between interest income and expenses.

also includes write- downs and reversals of write- downs on 
securities held in the liquidity reserve.

rates on household deposits is evident in the other euro

ume of household deposits is roughly four times higher

The effects of a negative interest rate policy on banks’ 
profi  tability and macroeconomic developments in dynamic 
stochastic general equilibrium models
As outlined in the main article, a negative 
interest rate policy (NIRP) affects banks’ 
profi  tability via various channels. These ef-
fects arise not just directly via the policy 
rate’s impact on deposit and lending rates 
but also indirectly via other economic vari-
ables. This is the case, for example, when a 
negative policy rate stimulates macroeco-
nomic activity, which then has an impact on 
banks’ profi  tability. In turn, the way in 
which banks respond to a change in their 
profi  tability also affects other macroeco-
nomic variables.
Indirect and feedback effects of this kind 
can be analysed using dynamic stochastic 
general equilibrium (DSGE) models. In these 
models, monetary policy affects bank- 
specifi  c variables such as interest rates and 
credit dynamics and also infl  uences the real 
economy via a range of complementary 
transmission channels. In this box, two dif-
ferent DSGE models (model A and model B) 
are used to investigate the effects of a NIRP 
on banks’ profi  tability.1
In both models, the starting point is a styl-
ised negative demand shock. The intensity 
of this shock is calibrated such that the cen-
tral bank – in order to stabilise the econ-
omy  – has to react so forcefully that the 
policy rate enters negative territory. Three 
scenarios are analysed, each differing in 
terms of how fl  exibly monetary policy-
makers can adjust the policy rate, and 
banks their deposit rates, to economic de-
velopments. By comparing the three scen-
arios, it is ultimately possible to determine 
how the NIRP affects both the economy as 
a whole and banks’ profi  tability.In the fi  rst scenario, it is assumed that there 
is no limit on the extent to which both the 
policy rate and commercial banks’ deposit 
rates can be lowered into negative territory, 
with neither monetary policymakers nor 
commercial banks being subject to any con-
straints in this respect. In the second scen-
ario, the former are unable to lower the 
policy rate, and the latter their deposit 
rates, to an unlimited extent. They are both 
constrained by an effective lower bound on 
interest rates, which, for the sake of simpli-
city, is set at zero. In the third scenario (ana-
lysed in model A only), it is assumed that 
the policy rate can be lowered into negative 
territory, but only as far as -0.5%. By con-
trast, commercial banks are unable to cut 
their deposit rates to below zero.2
Model A is based on Gerali et al. (2010).3 
This framework contains a fi  nancial sector 
with monopolistic competition among 
banks. The banks’ interest margin is defi  ned 
as the difference between the lending rate 
and the deposit rate. In the long- run equi-
librium, the lending rate is higher than the 
policy rate, which, in turn, is above the de-
posit rate, resulting in a positive interest 
margin. It is assumed that banks cannot 
fl  exibly adjust their deposit or lending rates. 
Furthermore, banks have to maintain an 
1 The two models are based on a New Keynesian 
framework along the lines of Christiano et al. (2005) or 
Smets and Wouters (2007).
2 This roughly corresponds to the current data. In Ger-
many, the deposit rate aggregated across all categories 
of new business with the private non- fi  nancial sector 
as defi  ned in the MFI interest rate statistics stood at 
around 0% in August 2020. The Eurosystem’s deposit 
facility rate is currently -0.5%.

already been used in previous Monthly Report ana-
lyses. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2015a).Deutsche Bundesbank

(exogenously) imposed capital ratio and 
incur costs if they deviate from it. In order 
to obtain a loan, households and enter-
prises have to provide collateral (e.g. the 
value of their stock of housing or physical 
capital).
The chart on p. 21 shows the consequences 
of a demand shock in model A for the three 
outlined scenarios.4 The same demand 
shock is assumed in all of the scenarios. It 
causes a decline in both real economic out-
put and infl  ation.5 Monetary policy re-
sponds by lowering the policy rate. Conse-
quently, lending and deposit rates fall, as 
does the interest margin, because lending 
rates decline more sharply than deposit 
rates in all scenarios.6
Comparing scenarios 2 and 3 provides an 
insight into the isolated impact of lowering 
the policy rate into negative territory (down 
to -0.5%) relative to the effect of just bring-
ing it down to zero. In both scenarios, it is 
assumed that negative interest rates cannot 
be applied to deposits at banks. The zero 
bound on deposit rates is thus binding for 
banks. Like the policy rate, the lending rates 
fall more sharply in scenario 3 than in scen-
ario 2. The lower lending rates stabilise in-
vestment demand and thus drive up the 
demand for credit and the lending volume. 
This mitigates the economic downturn 
more effectively in scenario 3 than in scen-
ario 2, leading to a smaller decline in infl  a-
tion. As banks cannot reduce their deposit 
rate to below zero, the interest margin and 
bank profi  ts initially decrease more sharply 
in scenario 3 than in scenario 2.7 Thus, the 
stronger expansion of the lending volume 
in scenario 3 does not fully offset the 
smaller interest margin. However, the more 
stable economic developments in scen-
ario 3 are accompanied by a faster recovery 
in banks’ profi  ts.In scenario 1, both monetary policymakers 
and banks are unconstrained. Monetary 
policymakers cut the policy rate to levels far 
below zero. Consequently, lending rates 
also fall more steeply than in the second 
scenario, where the policy rate cannot fall 
below zero. Although the banks in this 
scenario lower their deposit rates into nega-
tive territory, this, taken in isolation, reduces 
the interest margin and thus their profi  ts. 
Nonetheless, the lower lending rates in-
crease the incentive to invest, which means 
that the economic downturn is less sharp 
than in the second scenario. Accordingly, 
the infl  ation rate falls less steeply. The up-
turn in scenario 2 comes later than in scen-
ario 1, which is refl  ected in a delayed stabil-
isation of banks’ profi  ts.
A comparison of scenarios 1 and 2 illus-
trates that, when the policy rate is subject 
to a binding zero lower bound, monetary 
policymakers are less able to mitigate the 
economic downturn and falling infl  ation 
than without this constraint (the effect of 
non- standard monetary policy measures at 
the lower bound on interest rates is disre-
garded here).
Model B is based on Kühl (2018).8 In this 
model, non- fi  nancial corporations (NFCs) 
fund their investments with bank loans and 
capital. Both NFCs and banks are subject to 
balance sheet constraints which require 
4 The simulations are based on Gerke et al. (2020).
5 An exogenous preference shock that increases con-
sumers’ discount rate is used. This reduces the prefer-
ence for consumption in the present and thus also ag-
gregate consumer demand. Conversely, aggregate 
saving increases.
6 This is due to the parameterisation in Gerali et al. 
(2010). In particular, the parameters for the adjustment 
costs for changing interest rates on loans and deposits 
imply a corresponding reaction in those variables.
7 Banks’ profi  ts are defi  ned as the difference between 
interest income and interest expenditure.

lyses. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2016).Deutsche Bundesbank

them to hold capital. The level of lending 
rates is therefore determined by the lever-
age ratios of banks and NFCs. Unlike in 
model A, the policy rate and the deposit 
rate are, by defi  nition, identical. As in model 
A, banks generate their profi  ts from the 
interest margin, i.e. the difference between 
the lending rate and the deposit rate. As 
the policy rate and the bank deposit rate 
are identical, scenario 3 cannot be simu-
lated in this model.
As a result of the negative demand shock, 
output and infl  ation also decline in scen-
arios 1 and 2 of model B (see the chart on 
p. 21). Here, too, the central bank responds 
by cutting the policy rate. As in model A, 
lending rates fall more sharply than deposit 
rates, leading to a smaller interest margin.9
In scenario 1, the effects of a demand shock 
on output and infl  ation are comparable to 
those in model A.  The interest margin 
enters negative territory, i.e. losses are in-
curred. This reduces bank capital. The de-
clining lending rates lead to fi  xed capital 
investment and a corresponding increase in 
borrowing. In scenario 2, there is an effect-
ive zero lower bound on both the policy 
rate and the deposit rate. As the policy rate 
cannot be lowered as far as in scenario 1, 
the demand shock leads to a sharper eco-
nomic downturn in scenario 2. This is in line 
with model A. Compared with scenario 1, 
the leverage ratio in the non- fi  nancial sec-
tor increases. This is primarily due to the 
fact that capital in the non- fi  nancial sector 
decreases as a result of the sharper eco-
nomic downturn. The higher leverage ratio 
in the non- fi  nancial sector is associated 
with greater expected losses for banks. 
Banks are compensated for their expected 
losses with higher lending rates. The result-
ing wider interest margin in comparison 
with scenario 1 ensures that banks’ profi  ts 
and capital fall less steeply in scenario 2.A comparison of the two models points to 
qualitatively similar macroeconomic effects. 
However, the feedback effect of macroeco-
nomic activity on banks’ profi  tability varies. 
In model A, the NIRP stimulates credit de-
mand, which leads to comparatively strong 
growth in the lending volume. Given a posi-
tive interest margin, this ultimately has a 
positive impact on commercial banks’ 
profi  ts. In model B, the NIRP reduces the 
leverage ratio in the non- fi  nancial sector. 
Lending rates thus fall more sharply, which 
has a negative impact on banks’ profi  tabil-
ity.
All in all, three conclusions can be drawn 
about the NIRP . First, it reduces banks’ inter-
est margin, especially when there is a zero 
lower bound on banks’ deposit rates. 
Second, it stabilises macroeconomic activity 
by lowering the overall interest rate level. 
Third, it can stabilise or worsen banks’ prof-
itability, depending, above all, on develop-
ments in lending rates and the lending vol-
ume.
9 This is due to assumptions about the specifi  cs of 
lending conditions. In the model, lending conditions 
are selected so as to maximise the benefi  t to borrow-
ers. Following the demand shock, borrowers can thus 
negotiate a signifi  cantly lower lending rate.Deutsche Bundesbank

The box on pp. 24 ff. uses empirical methods to 
examine which types of banks charge negative 
interest rates in deposit business with NFCs. Its 
findings suggest that a larger share of house -
hold deposits in relation to total assets increases 
the likelihood of negative interest rates being 
applied to NFC deposits. The analysis presented 
in the box also indicates that banks adjusted 
their business strategy in deposit business with 
households during the NIRP period: banks gen -
erated higher net commission income on their 
outstanding deposit holdings than in the pre-  
NIRP period.18 This could be because banks 
raised their fees in deposit business with house -
holds. It might also be because banks used their 
business relationships with households to cross-  
sell further banking services from which they 
generated commission profits.
The reasons why negative deposit rates are a 
more common occurrence in business with 
NFCs than they are in business with households 
are varied and ambiguous. Households are 
generally in a better position than NFCs to con -
vert a larger proportion of their deposits into 
cash. Furthermore, the zero mark might repre -
sent more of a “psychological” barrier for 
households and prompt a stronger response if 
rates fall below that level.19 It might also be the 
case that banks fear a loss of their reputation if 
they introduce negative deposit rates for 
households.
Empirical evidence suggests that, in the pre-  
NIRP period, German banks sought to keep 
their interest margin in lending and deposit 
business as constant as possible.20 To this end, 
they passed through changes in the interest 
rates applied to their outstanding loans to 
households via deposit rates.21 A separate an -

Negative interest rates on corporate deposits and higher 
fees – what role do retail deposits play?
The negative interest rate policy (NIRP) 
introduced by the Eurosystem in mid- 2014 
sent commercial banks’ interest margins 
into decline. There are different ways in 
which banks can respond to the pressure 
this places on their profi  tability. One is to 
apply negative interest rates to retail de-
posits; another is to attempt to generate 
more income from fees and commissions. 
This box explores these two avenues inde-
pendently of each other from an empirical 
angle with a view to fi  nding out what char-
acterises a bank that opts for one of these 
two paths.
Which types of banks charge 
enterprises  negative deposit rates?
The fi  rst step is to empirically identify the 
bank characteristics which infl  uence the 
probability of a bank in Germany, on aver-
age, charging non- fi  nancial corporations 
(NFCs) a negative rate of interest on their 
overnight (sight) deposits. This is achieved 
by estimating a linear probability model 
with bank microdata combined with bank 
and time fi  xed effects.1 The estimation 
covers the period from September 2014 
(since when the three- month OIS rate has 
been below zero) to September 2019.2
Linear probability models only allow the de-
pendent variable to have a value of zero or 
one. In the calculations presented here, this 
variable is one in month t  if a bank’s 
volume- weighted interest rate on NFC sight 
deposits is negative3 and zero otherwise. 
The benchmark model contains three ex-
planatory bank- specifi  c variables which are 
the main point of interest in this analysis: a 
bank’s NFC deposit base, household de-
posit base, and excess liquidity.4 The three 
variables are each shown as a percentage of the respective bank’s total assets. In add-
ition, the benchmark model contains two 
bank- specifi  c control variables: liquid assets5 
as a percentage of total assets, and the 
bank’s size (measured by the logarithm of 
total assets).
According to the empirical literature, the 
share of deposit- based funding in relation 
to a bank’s total assets explains a major 
part of the supply of credit in the NIRP 
period.6 Conceivably, then, the share of 
deposit- based funding will be a factor in 
the negative interest rates applied to NFC 
deposits as well. Since banks are signifi  -
cantly more reluctant to apply negative 
interest rates to household deposits than to 
NFC deposits,7 the present analysis adds the 
deposit shares of NFCs and households to 
1 Probit or logit models would be alternative estima-
tion models for binary data. However, it is very diffi   cult 
to incorporate bank and time fi  xed effects, and robust 
standard errors into these model classes, which is why 
a linear regression model is used in this case (see 
Altavilla  et al. (2019)).
2 Unlike in the main article, a short- term market inter-
est rate, rather than the deposit facility interest rate, is 
used here to distinguish the period of negative interest 
rates. Short- term market rates such as the three- month 
overnight index swap (OIS) rate generally refl  ect banks’ 
funding costs best of all, which is why they are com-
monly used for empirical analyses of interest rate pass- 
through.
3 Data source: MFI interest rate statistics.
4 The term “deposit base” refers to sight and time 
deposits . “Excess liquidity” denotes banks’ predomin-
antly short- term credit balances on their central bank 
accounts in excess of their required reserves. Excess 
liquidity  is a subset of banks’ total claims on the Euro-
system. Unlike excess liquidity, the latter also include 
longer- term claims. Data source: monthly balance 
sheet statistics.
5 Liquid assets are calculated as currency in circulation 
plus foreign and domestic debt securities plus bank 
claims on the Eurosystem, less required reserves. Ex-
cess liquidity has been deducted from claims on the 
Eurosystem because it is already included in the esti-
mates as a standalone variable. Data source: monthly 
balance sheet statistics.

the estimates as separate items. One possi-
bility is that banks with a high share of NFC 
deposits are more reluctant to apply nega-
tive interest rates to this type of deposit be-
cause they are uncertain how their custom-
ers would react. It is also conceivable that 
these banks are more inclined to apply 
negative interest rates to NFC deposits as a 
way of alleviating the pressure on their 
shrinking interest margins. This pressure on 
profi  tability is likely to be more noticeable 
still at banks where the share of household 
deposits is high. Following this line of rea-
soning, these banks would likewise be more 
inclined to apply negative interest rates to 
NFC deposits.
A higher level of excess liquidity will reduce 
banks’ net interest income, all other things 
being equal, because it is subject to a nega-
tive interest rate.8 For this reason, higher ex-
cess liquidity could increase the probability 
of a bank charging negative interest rates 
on NFC deposits.
To investigate whether the infl  uence of the 
main variables of interest has changed over 
the course of the NIRP period, we divide 
this period into two roughly equal sub- 
periods,9 the fi  rst running from September 
2014 to December 2016, the second from 
January 2017 to September 2019. The infl  u-
ence of the main variables of interest in this 
analysis is estimated for each of these two 
sub-periods. This is achieved by interacting 
them with suitable time dummies.10 The 
share of the extrapolated NFC sight deposit 
base of banks applying a negative average 
interest rate in relation to total NFC sight 
deposits rises across both sub-periods, 
climbing from 10% on average during the 
fi  rst NIRP sub-period to just over 60% in the 
second.
In the robustness check, the benchmark 
model is extended to include the following bank- specifi  c variables: the interest rate on 
household deposits, the interest rate on 
loans to the private non- fi  nancial sector, a 
measure of profi  tability, and the capital 
ratio.11 As in the benchmark model, these 
variables are interacted with time dummies.
The table on p. 26 presents the results of 
the empirical analysis. The two main fi  nd-
ings are as follows:
– During the fi  rst NIRP sub-period, a higher 
share of NFC deposits in relation to total 
assets is associated, to a statistically sig-
nifi  cant degree, with a lower probability 
of a bank charging negative interest 
rates on NFC deposits. A statistically sig-
nifi  cant correlation no longer exists in 
the second sub-period.
– By contrast, a higher share of household 
deposits in relation to total assets is asso-
ciated, to a statistically signifi  cant de-
gree, with a higher probability of a bank 
charging negative interest rates on NFC 
deposits.12
8 In the euro area, this is due to the deposit facility 
rate, which has been negative since June 2014.
9 The split was timed to coincide with the turn of a 
year and to create two periods of a similar length.
10 For the fi  rst period (from September 2014 to De-
cember 2016) the dummy is one and zero otherwise. 
The second dummy is one from January 2017 and zero

12 The second, “extended” model specifi  cation sug-
gests that the infl  uence was weaker here; the coeffi   -
cient is no longer signifi  cant during the fi  rst NIRP 
sub-period.Deutsche Bundesbank

The estimation results show that banks for 
which NFC deposits were a relatively im-
portant source of funding were less inclined 
to apply negative interest rates to these de-
posits at the beginning of the NIRP period 
than other banks. One explanation for this 
could be that, at the beginning of the NIRP 
period, the banks in question were still un-
certain how their customers would respond 
to negative interest rates. However, the 
more banks and customers became accus-
tomed to negative interest rates on de-
posits, the less inhibited the individual bank 
probably was to risk this step and apply a 
negative interest rate to NFC deposits. The 
insignifi  cant coeffi   cient in the second NIRP 
sub-period might be a refl  ection of this. 
These results might suggest, furthermore, 
that the pressure to respond to shrinking 
interest margins was not yet as intense in 
the fi  rst sub-period as it would become in 
the second. The estimation results also 
seem to indicate, above all in the second sub-period, that banks for which household 
deposits were a relatively important source 
of funding were more inclined to apply 
negative interest rates to NFC deposits. 
Given banks’ reluctance to apply negative 
interest rates to household deposits, those 
which make greater use of those deposits 
as a source of funding are likely to experi-
ence more pressure on their interest mar-
gins, all other things being equal. Negative 
NFC deposit rates are one way in which 
they could attempt to mitigate this pressure 
on interest margins.
The results suggest, furthermore, that a 
higher share of excess liquidity in relation to 
total assets does not infl  uence, to a statis-
tically signifi  cant degree, the probability of 
negative interest rates being applied to NFC 
deposits. This is consistent with the fi  nding, 
made in the main article, that the cost of 
holding excess liquidity is low relative to the 
burden of shrinking interest margins (see 
p. 29).
In addition, the robustness check suggests 
that, in the fi  rst NIRP sub-period, a lower 
interest rate on household deposits reduces 
the probability of negative interest rates 
being applied to NFC deposits.13 It would 
appear that there was no need to apply 
negative interest rates to NFC deposits dur-
ing this fi  rst sub-period because the interest 
rate on household deposits at that time was 
still far enough away from zero. This 
changed in the second NIRP sub-period, 
when interest rates on household deposits 
reached the zero mark at many banks and 
remained there (see p. 23). The infl  uence of 
the coeffi   cient turns statistically insignifi  cant 
on account of the lack of variability.
13 The coeffi   cients can be interpreted symmetrically in 
both directions. The case of a “lower” interest rate, 
rather than a “higher” one, is considered because 
banks lowered their deposit rates for the most part 
during the NIRP period, rather than raising them.Linear probability model on the

The coeffi   cient of the profi  tability measure 
changes its sign as it moves from the fi  rst 
sub-period to the second. Its infl  uence is 
not economically relevant, though, as a 
change in this variable hardly affects the 
probability of negative interest rates being 
applied to NFC deposits.14 This does not in-
dicate that mounting pressure on profi  tabil-
ity would have led to negative interest rates 
increasingly being applied to deposits.
Which types of banks increased their 
commission margin?
Besides applying negative interest rates to 
deposits, there are other instruments, such 
as higher fees and commissions, which 
banks can use to alleviate the pressure that 
a declining interest margin exerts on their 
profi  tability. The following section examines 
the extent to which the infl  uence of differ-
ent bank characteristics on the commission 
margin has changed over time. The com-
mission margin is computed as net commis-
sion income15 over total assets. The estima-
tion period runs from January 2012 until 
September 2019, so it includes both the 
NIRP period and the immediately preceding 
(pre- NIRP) period, when the short- term 
market interest rate was only just above 
zero. This wider observation period allows 
us to investigate whether the infl  uence of 
the variables under consideration in the 
NIRP period was statistically different from 
that observed in the pre- NIRP period.
A panel model with bank and time fi  xed ef-
fects is used in the estimation,16 while the 
independent variables are the same as the 
ones used in the benchmark model above. 
As in the benchmark model, this analysis 
separately estimates the infl  uence of the 
main variables of interest for the respective 
periods.The results presented in the above table do 
not show an empirical correlation between 
the share of NFC deposits in relation to 
total assets and a bank’s commission mar-
gin. By contrast, a larger share of household 
deposits was already associated with a 
higher commission margin in the pre- NIRP 
period. This infl  uence increased signifi  cantly 
in the NIRP period compared with the 
14 The standard deviation of the measure of profi  tabil-
ity is very small, at 6.5 basis points. In other words, an 
increase of one standard deviation in the measure of 
profi  tability reduces the probability in the fi  rst sub-
period by 0.32 percentage point. The infl  uence of the 
measure of profi  tability is therefore economically insig-
nifi  cant.
15 Net commission income is calculated as commis-
sion income net of commission expenses. It notably 
includes fees from giro transactions, payments, and se-
curities and safe custody business. The net commission 
income fi  gures for 2012 and 2013 are based on annual 
data from the profi  t and loss statistics. From 2014, 
quarterly data are available under the Financial and In-
ternal Capital Adequacy Information Regulation. These 
fi  gures are interpolated linearly to obtain monthly 
data.

standing loans.22 Owing to their high volume, 
these deposit categories are of particular rele -
vance for the interest margin. They can further -
more be repriced by banks on an ongoing 
basis. The relationship between interest rates 
applied to outstanding loans and those applied to household deposits was estimated using 
data from the pre- NIRP period (January 2003 to 
May 2014). Subsequently, the relationship esti -
mated by the model was used to forecast de -
posit rates conditional on the actual develop -
ment of lending rates from June 2014 onwards. 
If bank behaviour had remained unchanged 
during the NIRP period, the aggregated deposit 
rate for households would have been expected 
to fall well below zero by mid-  2020 (see the 
adjacent chart). According to the model fore -
cast, banks would have applied an average 
interest rate of around -1% per year in mid-  
2020 on deposits. As it turns out, though, the 
deposit rate was hovering just above the zero 
mark (see the adjacent chart). This caused Ger -
man banks’ interest margin in lending and de -
posit business with the private non- financial 
sector to narrow during the NIRP period (see 
the chart on p. 29).Aggregated interest rate on households'

point increase in the share of household de-
posits in the pre- NIRP period was associ-
ated with a rise of 0.38 basis point in the 
commission margin, its effect was stronger 
during the NIRP period, at between 0.44 
and 0.49 basis point.18 Compared with the 
pre- NIRP period, in the NIRP period banks 
were able to increase their net commission 
income per euro of household deposits by 
between 0.06 and 0.11 cent.19
The infl  uence of excess liquidity is unlikely 
to be positively signifi  cant because the cost 
of holding excess liquidity is low relative to 
the burden of banks’ shrinking interest mar-
gin. The result confi  rms this theory: in none 
of the periods under observation does the 
level of excess liquidity infl  uence the level of 
the commission margin to a statistically sig-
nifi  cant degree.In summary, it can be concluded from the 
two analyses that banks are generally reluc-
tant to apply negative interest rates to 
household deposits. The fi  ndings suggest 
that banks for which these deposits are a 
relatively important source of funding 
mainly followed two paths: they applied 
negative interest rates to NFC deposits, and 
they increased their commission margin.
17 A hypothesis test based on one- tailed and two- 
tailed tests (see Michaelis (2021)) also confi  rms the dif-
ference in infl  uence. It shows that the coeffi   cients in 
both NIRP sub-periods are signifi  cantly higher than be-
fore.
18 An increase of one standard deviation in household 
deposits widens the commission margin by 0.14 basis 
point in the fi  rst sub-period and by 0.13 basis point in 
the second.
19 This result can be computed from the difference 
between the respective coeffi   cients, i.e. 0.44-0.38 = 
0.06 and 0.49-0.38 = 0.11. Both the deposit share and 
the commission margin are calculated as a share of 
total assets, which is why the fi  gures can be inter-
preted “per euro of household deposits”.
22 The analysis follows the approach outlined in Sopp 
(2018).Deutsche Bundesbank

However, the decline in the interest margin 
was due to more than just the negative interest 
rate on the deposit facility. The effects which 
the negative interest rate on the deposit facility 
had on the interest margin are isolated in a fur -
ther analysis,23 which takes into account the 
impact of a lower level of short- term money 
market rates and of a change in the slope of 
the yield curve.24 This approach makes it pos -
sible to estimate how the interest margin 
would have developed if the interest rate on 
the deposit facility had remained at 0%. The 
interest margin declines in this hypothetical 
scenario, too, but less steeply than actually ob -
served (see the adjacent chart). This is because 
even if the interest rate on the deposit facility 
had not been negative, older, higher- interest 
loans would have gradually expired over the 
course of a low interest rate period and been 
replaced by new, lower- interest loans. The de -
clining capital market rates, which were also 
influenced by the monetary policy asset pur -
chase programmes, would have resulted in fall -
ing lending rates in the hypothetical scenario as 
well, as longer- term capital market rates are an 
important benchmark for pricing longer- term 
loans.25
Over time, a gap emerged between the interest 
margin that would have been produced with -
out a negative interest rate on the deposit facil -
ity (as outlined in the above analysis) and the 
actual interest margin (see the adjacent chart). 
The empirically estimated impact that the nega -
tive interest rate on the deposit facility had on 
the interest margin thus increased over time. 
Two factors were behind this. First, the interest 
rate on the deposit facility was lowered deeper 
into negative territory in several steps. Second, 
the gradual expiry of older, higher- interest 
loans has an impact here, too, because it 
means that the effect of the negative interest 
rate on the deposit facility will only fully materi -
alise with a time lag. This suggests that the ef -
fect will have continued to increase during the 
period in which the interest rate on the deposit 
facility remained at its current level of -0.5%. If 
the findings of the analysis are extrapolated, assuming that the current negative interest rate 
on the deposit facility remains constant, its ef -
fect is expected to rise further by around one- 
third over the next five years.
The negative interest rate on the deposit facility 
implies, furthermore, that banks face costs for 
holding excess liquidity which increase with the 
amount of excess liquidity held. These costs 
were reduced by the introduction of the tiering 
system at the end of 2019. However, the costs 
of holding excess liquidity up until the introduc -
tion of the tiering system are likely to be rather 
low compared with the burden of a shrinking 
interest margin in lending and deposit busi -
ness. The above analysis on the effect of the

gins can be used to roughly estimate the ratio 
of both variables in absolute figures. This ap -
proach finds that, from the beginning of the 
NIRP period up to end- 2019, the burdens that 
banks in Germany faced from the declining 
interest margin were around four times higher 
than the costs of holding excess liquidity.
Overall, then, there is strong evidence for the 
German banking system that the negative 
interest rate on the deposit facility, combined 
with the binding effect of the zero mark as re -
gards the interest rate applied to deposits, 
weighed on banks’ interest margins. What is 
also evident, though, is that a combination of 
circumstances of this kind does not automatic -
ally have to lead to a deterioration in profitabil -
ity. Indeed, the declining interest margin had 
been offset by low loan loss provisions prior to 
the onset of the coronavirus crisis, which was 
probably due in part to the expansionary mon -
etary policy stance.

banks’ lending
Expansion of lending and 
 deposit business
An examination of balance sheet aggregates 
does not provide any evidence to suggest that 
banks were restricting their supply of credit in 
response to mounting margin pressure during 
the NIRP period. On the contrary, the volume 
of loans granted to the private non-  financial 
sector increased in absolute terms during this 
period (see the adjacent upper chart).26 The in -

to total assets. In the NIRP period, banks that 
had previously attached relatively little import -
ance to lending business also stepped up their 
operations in this area. At the same time, there 
was also an increase in the use of private non- 
financial sector deposits as a source of funding 
(see the upper chart on p.  30). As a result, 
lending and deposit business gained in import -
ance for German banks during the NIRP period, 
both in absolute terms and in relation to total 
assets. In the case of lending business, the in -
crease in absolute terms was significantly 
stronger at this time than in the period from 
the financial crisis to the start of the NIRP 
period. By contrast, the relative gain in signifi -
cance of lending business had already been ob -
served in the pre- NIRP period.
Banks’ interest income, expressed in absolute 
terms, is positively related to volumes. Banks 
were thus able to stabilise their net interest in -
come above all by increasing the volume of 
lending business. However, this stabilising ef -
fect was not sufficient to fully offset the decline 
in margins (see the lower chart on p. 30).
No sign of supply- side 
 constraints
The expansion of lending to NFCs and house -
holds during the NIRP period is likely to be at -
tributable to both demand- side and supply- side 
factors. Data from the Bank Lending Survey 
(BLS), conducted among 34 German banks, in -
dicate that loan demand made a significant 
contribution here. The surveyed institutions re -
ported strong increases in demand, in part, 
both in business with NFCs and with house -
holds, citing the low interest rate level as the 
main driver of this development.27
The BLS also indicates that banks increased the 
supply of credit.28 In the survey rounds during 
the NIRP period, the credit institutions reported 
that there had been a narrowing of the spread 
between their lending rates and a suitable ref -
erence interest rate in each case (typically a market interest rate).29 This applied to both 
business with NFCs and business with house -
holds. The institutions taking part in the BLS 
identified competition with other banks as the 
main driver behind the tightening of margins. 
Such competition- driven pressure on margins, 
coupled with a simultaneous increase in loan 
demand, clearly indicate an expansion in the 
supply of credit. Banks appeared to be using 
lower lending rates to compete for the rising 
demand. The expansion of the credit supply 
has thus tended to increase margin pressure.
If a relationship exists between margin pressure 
and lending, then it ought to show up in a 
comparison of lending by banks that are ex -
posed to different degrees of margin pressure. 
Banks that are heavily reliant on household de -
posits as a source of funding are more exposed 
to margin pressure than other banks. This is be -
cause these banks’ net interest margin fell 
more sharply than that of the other banks dur -
ing the NIRP period (see the chart on p. 32). 
However, this relative decline was already un -
derway beforehand, which probably has some -
thing to do with the fact that some banks’ 
interest rates on deposits had already reached 
zero in the pre- NIRP period (see the lower chart 
on p. 23). By contrast, the difference in how 
the return on assets has evolved at banks that 
are more and less reliant on deposit funding is 
smaller than it is in the case of the net interest 
margin. Credit cooperatives and savings banks 
make up a disproportionately large share of the 
banks that are heavily reliant on deposit fund -
ing. These two categories of banks have the 
highest return on assets in the German banking 
system.30Increased lend -

Compared with the other banks, banks that are 
more reliant on deposit funding saw stronger 
growth in lending business with the private 
non- financial sector throughout almost the en -
tire NIRP period. However, this merely repre -
sented a continuation of previously observed 
developments. Overall, the difference between 
the rates of loan growth at banks that are more 
dependent on deposit funding and those that 
are less reliant on deposit funding did not 
change noticeably during the NIRP period. A 
straightforward comparison of the two types 
of banks, then, provides no indication that the 
margin pressure induced by the binding effect 
of the zero mark as regards the interest rates applied to deposits affected the volume of 
lending.
Margin pressure does, however, appear to have 
had an effect on the relative riskiness of the 
loans granted. An analysis based on data from 
the German credit register indicates that banks 
with a heavy reliance on deposit funding ex -
panded their credit supply to riskier enterprises 
to a greater extent than the other banks after 
the interest rate on the deposit facility had 
been lowered to negative levels.31
Expansion of maturity 
 transformation in lending and 
deposit business
Increasing the volume of lending business is 
not the only way to stabilise profitability. Ma -
turities and interest rate fixation periods in 
lending business are also parameters which 
banks can potentially use to respond to margin 
pressure. While long- term loans as a share of 
all outstanding loans remained relatively con -
stant during the NIRP period, sight deposits as 
a share of all deposits increased. This marks a 
continuation of a trend that has been ongoing 
for some time now (see the chart on p. 33).32 
On balance, maturities of loans increased rela -
tive to maturities of deposits. Taken in isolation, 
the resulting greater maturity transformation 
stabilised interest margins, as investments with 
longer maturities usually have a higher rate of 
interest. However, the APP and PEPP monetary 
policy asset purchase programmes reduced 
long- term government bond yields, amongst 
other things, which in turn are included, as the 
basic rate, in the calculation of interest rates on 
long- term loans. These monetary policy meas -… and consist -

ures are therefore likely to have played a part in 
reducing marginal earnings from maturity 
transformation.
Increased maturity transformation was accom -
panied by a rise in interest rate risk, even after 
taking hedging transactions into account.33 It is 
the interest rate fixation periods of loans and 
deposits, rather than their maturities, that have 
a bearing on how interest rate risk develops in 
lending and deposit business. So while German 
banks’ lending business did not see a notable 
increase in maturities, there was evidence of 
longer interest rate fixation periods, however. 
Since the onset of the NIRP period, the length 
of these periods has increased, particularly for 
loans for house purchase (see the adjacent 
chart).34
The extent to which the increased use of short- 
term deposits as a source of funding and the 
longer interest rate fixation periods of loans for 
house purchase are more a reflection of banks’ 
business policy decisions or of changes in their 
customers’ demand remains an open question. 
The increase in short- term deposits is presum -
ably partly due to households’ strong prefer -
ence for liquidity and risk aversion. Their de -
mand for highly liquid sight deposits also came 
about because alternative forms of investment 
offered little in the way of superior returns.35 
Customer preferences also play an important 
role in determining the interest rate fixation 
periods of loans for house purchase.36
Increased cross- border lending
Expanding foreign business is one way, above 
all for larger banks, to evade strong competi -
tion and margin pressure in domestic lending 
and deposit business.37 Foreign business, how -
ever, is not more profitable per se. The cost of 
running foreign branches and subsidiaries, 
amongst other things, needs to be charged 
against earnings. In addition, exposures outside 
the euro area are subject to currency risk, 
which, if hedged, also reduces income.During the NIRP period, German banking 
groups substantially expanded their lending to 
enterprises and households in other euro area 
countries, above all.38 This had still been declin -
ing in the pre- NIRP period. By contrast, lending 
business with NFCs, in particular, has expanded 
significantly since mid- 2018. Compared with 
the previous year, credit growth accelerated 
from just under 2.0% in the second quarter of 
2018 to a little under 17% in the fourth quarter 
of 2019 before slowing down again markedly 
amid the decline in global economic activity. In … and increase

August 2020, the annual growth rate in this 
credit segment stood at 5.0%.39 This is how 
the rise in lending abroad, taken in isolation, 
supported the net interest income of banks in 
Germany.
The significance of foreign business as a whole 
for banks in Germany, taking into account their 
foreign branches and subsidiaries, remained 
broadly unchanged following the slump during 
the financial and sovereign debt crisis and has 
since fluctuated around the 25% mark in terms 
of total assets. Lending to enterprises and 
households in other euro area countries is of 
particular relevance for the German banking 
system. Its significance has increased, especially 
since mid- 2017, and it accounted for around 
half of total foreign business on average in 
2020.40
Reducing holdings of debt 
 securities supports lending
One alternative to lending is for banks to use 
their resources to purchase debt securities. 
Apart from offering a way of generating in -
come, they also play an important role in 
banks’ liquidity management. German banks 
offloaded debt securities on their books during 
the NIRP period (see the above chart), the bulk of which were German general government 
bonds and German bank debt securities. The 
reduction in holdings of German bank debt se -
curities marked the continuation of a trend that 
has been observed since 2008. By contrast, the 
scaling- back of German general government 
bond holdings represents a new development. 
In net terms, German banks had still been in -
creasing these holdings in the period from the 
financial market crisis to the beginning of the 
NIRP period.
One reason for the offloading of German gen -
eral government bonds from German banks’ 
balance sheets is likely to have been the decline 
in public debt up until the coronavirus crisis. 
However, the APP probably played an import -
ant role as well. The Eurosystem’s purchases of 
these assets caused prices to increase and 
yields to decrease.41 This incentivised banks to 
sell these bonds in order to take advantage of 
price gains and step up lending to the private 
non- financial sector. Portfolio rebalancing of 
this kind is discussed in the literature as an im -
portant transmission channel for monetary pol -
icy asset purchase programmes.42 Empirical 
studies find evidence for Germany of portfolio 
rebalancing due to the APP: banks that saw a 
sharper decline in yields in their bond portfolios 
as a result of the APP increased their lending by 
more than other banks.43 Moreover, since the 
APP was launched, there has been an increas -
ingly positive relationship between the volume 
of maturing bonds in a bank’s portfolio and its 
lending.44 Overall, however, portfolio rebalan -
cing is likely to have played a rather minor role 
in the expansion of credit volumes. In most cat -
egories of banks, changes in debt securities 
holdings were small compared with lending 
growth (see also the upper chart on p. 30).Exposures in

Bank debt securities 
as a source of funding
Besides deposits, banks can also use debt se -
curities as a source of funding. It is precisely 
during the NIRP period that the issuance of 
debt securities might have become more at -
tractive from the banks’ perspective. After all, 
as with other marketable debt instruments, the 
zero mark has no binding effect here, or at 
least a weaker one than in deposit business for 
banks in Germany. Greater use of negative-  
interest- bearing liabilities as a source of fund -
ing would counteract the pressure on margins 
in lending and deposit business by reducing 
interest expenditure. Indeed, yields on bank 
debt securities tended to decline more sharply 
during the NIRP period than interest rates on 
deposits. That said, in terms of their level, yields 
on bank debt securities were not below deposit 
rates across the board. Yields on other bank 
debt securities45 were consistently higher. 
Broadly speaking, yields were only below de -
posit rates and below zero in Germany for 
Pfandbriefe.
Due in part to banks wanting to retain the op -
tion of raising the share of negative- interest-  
bearing liabilities in their funding mix as 
needed, bank debt securities might have 
stopped diminishing in importance as a com -
ponent in that mix since the onset of the NIRP 
period. This loss of importance had begun dur -
ing the financial crisis and was a broad trend 
observed across various categories of banks.46 
During the NIRP period, by contrast, new issu -
ance of debt securities was roughly in line with 
redemptions for most categories of banks, 
meaning that they experienced no major 
changes in volumes of outstanding debt secur -
ities (see the adjacent chart). The marked re -
duction at Landesbanken was confined to the 
start of the NIRP period.
Nevertheless, substitutions of deposits with 
debt securities were not a widespread phe -
nomenon. This is unsurprising insofar as, for 
most banks, bank debt securities are unlikely to be a much cheaper source of funding than de -
posits. Over half of banks in Germany did not 
use debt securities at all for funding purposes 
during the NIRP period. Small banks, in particu -
lar, often do not use debt securities as a source 
of funding.
Assessment from a monetary 
policy perspective
Lending and deposit business in the German 
banking system has grown in importance since 
the financial crisis, with lending business as a 
percentage of the total volume of business 
being steadily expanded during this spell. In the 
NIRP period, this relative growth went hand in 
hand with strong rates of expansion in abso -
lute terms, too. By contrast, expansion in ab -
solute terms had been subdued between the 
financial crisis and the onset of the NIRP period. 
The developments in the German banking sys -
tem during the NIRP period detailed here are 
thus largely in line with the intended effect of 
monetary policy. The expansion of lending is 
likely to have been driven by demand for credit, 
but also by banks’ willingness to lend. The call Decrease in

for loans and banks’ willingness to lend, in 
turn, were bolstered by accommodative mon -
etary policy. Monetary policy measures of the 
kind that pushed down yields on alternative 
forms of investment are also likely to have 
played a role in banks’ willingness to lend. The 
APP and, in response to the coronavirus crisis, 
the PEPP are two major examples of these pol -
icies. The monetary policy measures and banks’ 
increasing willingness to supply credit had the 
knock- on effect of driving down lending 
rates,47 but the flatter decline in deposit rates 
meant that interest margins in lending and de -
posit business narrowed.
However, this pressure on margins does not 
appear to have been much of an impediment 
to German banks’ lending so far. Despite ex -
periencing margin pressure, banks managed to 
stabilise and even improve their capital levels 
up to the onset of the coronavirus crisis,48 with 
low credit default rates and the resulting re -
duced need for loan loss provisions being major 
factors at play. This positive development in 
borrower default risk can be put down in part 
to the favourable economic situation, which in 
turn was being bolstered by accommodative 
monetary policy. Thus, while monetary policy 
led to a narrowing of margins, it also had a 
positive impact on banks’ profitability through 
other channels.49
The economy is now experiencing a downturn 
as a result of the coronavirus crisis. If, in the 
wake of the COVID-  19 pandemic, many bor -
rowers run into payment difficulties and there 
is an uptick in defaults on loans, it can be as -
sumed that this downturn will start to weigh 
more heavily on banks’ profitability. In addition, 
banks’ capital ratios could come under pressure 
if risk weights rise.50 The comprehensive pack -
age of fiscal support measures, the temporary 
suspension of the obligation to file for insolv -
ency, and supervisory rules have prevented a 
steep increase in credit defaults for now. How -
ever, the negative repercussions are more likely 
to surface once the assistance programmes 
come to an end. In this setting, banks will also find it harder to offset margin pressure in lend -
ing and deposit business. If the economic 
downturn puts pressure on banks’ capital 
levels, a link between capital levels and lending 
could materialise or grow stronger. This in -
creases the likelihood that the negative interest 
rate on the deposit facility will inhibit lending if 
its overall effect on profitability and capital 
levels is negative.
Conversely, measures that stabilise a bank’s 
profitability and ease capital constraints reduce 
the likelihood of the negative deposit facility 
rate having an adverse impact on the credit 
supply. By introducing the tiering system, the 
Eurosystem had already adopted a measure at 
the end of last year, i.e. even before the out -
break of the coronavirus, that contributed to 
an improvement in banks’ profitability. In re -
sponse to the COVID-  19 pandemic, the ECB 
Governing Council decided on further meas -
ures,51 one of which was to make the condi -
tions for the TLTROs significantly more attract -
ive in order to create additional incentives for 
lending. The extremely favourable interest rate 
is likely to have been the main driver behind 
the brisk demand amongst euro area banks for 
these operations recently.52 Even if these meas -
ures are not aimed primarily at banks’ profit -
ability, they nevertheless probably helped sta -
bilise it by lowering banks’ funding costs. The 
extent of this depends on take-up of the instru -
ments by banks and the costs of alternative 
funding instruments.
Supervisory relief measures granted in response 
to the coronavirus crisis are easing banks’ cap -
ital constraints. These primarily comprise the 
release of the Pillar 2 Guidance buffer and the Margin pressure

easing of Pillar 2 Requirements.53 In addition, 
the countercyclical capital buffer in Germany 
was lowered from 0.25% to 0%. The fiscal pol -
icy measures adopted in Germany in response 
to the coronavirus crisis in Germany are also 
indirectly supporting banks’ profitability.54 This 
is because the numerous support measures for 
enterprises and also for households are coun -
teracting a sharp rise in borrower default risk.
In summary, it can be concluded that the Euro -
system’s monetary policy measures – including 
lowering the deposit facility rate into negative 
territory – had their intended effect in the Ger -
man banking system up until the coronavirus crisis. However, the economic downturn result -
ing from the coronavirus pandemic is increas -
ing the likelihood that the negative deposit fa -
cility rate will have an adverse impact on Ger -
man banks’ lending. The measures taken by 
monetary and fiscal policymakers and banking 
supervisors during the coronavirus pandemic 
are reducing this likelihood.

Patterns of international business cycles
Early in 2020, a long upswing in the global economy came to an abrupt end. The novel corona -
virus spreading around the world and the measures taken to contain it were accompanied by a 
dramatic slump in activity and culminated in a crisis of historic proportions. The root causes of 
earlier economic downturns were often less obvious. Analysing suitable indicators in order to 
identify signs of a cyclical downturn at an early stage is, however, a key task for a forward-  
looking monetary policy. Recessions are, for example, often preceded by signs of overheating 
that are likely to be associated with a heightened vulnerability to crises. Relevant warning signals 
can provide valuable insights for predicting cyclical turning points.
Indeed, empirical studies suggest that cyclical turning points – at least when seen with the bene -
fit of hindsight – often announced themselves in advance. For example, the longer an upswing 
lasted, the greater was the probability that it would soon end. In most cases, a period of higher- 
than- average aggregate rates of expansion was followed by a soft patch in which GDP growth 
fell below its trend, and only rarely by a severe recession. Recessions in advanced economies 
were often indicated by a flattening of the yield curve, or followed sharply accelerating oil prices. 
The inclusion of such variables improves the accuracy of models for recession forecasting. Even 
so, the models would not have identified some crises in advance and have forecast recessions 
that failed to materialise.
Quantitative models can therefore send important warning signals before cyclical turning points. 
Economic observers will still be taken by surprise by downturns in the future, however. But this 
should not be viewed as a failure of empirical business cycle research. Even economies that pre -
viously appeared to be fairly resilient can be plunged into recession by shocks of sufficient mag -
nitude. This year’s global economic crisis is one example of this.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
At the beginning of 2020, the coronavirus pan -
demic brought an extended upswing in the 
global economy to a sudden end. The spread 
of the virus and the measures taken to contain 
the number of infections led within a matter of 
weeks to a dramatic slump in activity, finally 
culminating in an economic crisis of historic 
proportions. Although the easing of the restric -
tions saw activity picking up rapidly, the recov -
ery has remained incomplete so far given the 
ongoing risks of infection and constraints that 
remain in place.
Even in the past, growth paths did not run 
along straight lines. Rather, they were repeat -
edly interrupted by soft patches – in other 
words, minor setbacks or periods of below 
average rates of expansion. Dramatic declines 
in macroeconomic activity – recessions – are 
also on record for almost every economy. 
Periods of high macroeconomic underutilisa -
tion are typically accompanied by deflationary 
pressure on consumer prices. This may call for 
timely monetary policy intervention, especially 
given its time- lagged effects. Against this back -
drop, the analysis and forecasting of macro -
economic fluctuations –  also known as the 
business cycle – have always been a key focus 
of applied macroeconomics.
For economic forecasting and the formulation 
of recommendations for monetary policy, an 
understanding of macroeconomic processes 
and their key drivers is essential. Modern busi -
ness cycle models represent recessions mainly 
as the outcome of unexpected events known 
as shocks.1 These include, say, unanticipated 
policy measures, technological advances, nat -
ural disasters, changes in preferences as well as 
modified expectations and risk assessments. 
Other possible triggers include unexpected 
international developments that can be trans -
mitted through various channels, such as inter -
national trade and cross- border financial rela -
tionships. This means that cyclical swings are 
very difficult to predict. Price rigidities, financial market imperfections and other frictions can 
delay the effects of shocks, prolong them and 
also amplify them. It is, above all, the delays 
that give economic observers the opportunity 
to identify nascent downturns at an early stage.
Moreover, during a period of expansion there is 
often an increase in vulnerabilities owing, for 
example, to exaggerations in the financial sys -
tem. This means that, in mature upswings, 
comparatively small shocks could trigger major 
turmoil.2 Timely identification of vulnerabilities 
would then make it possible to predict cyclical 
turning points or, at least, estimate their prob -
ability.
Identification of cyclical 
 turning points
Quantitative analysis of macroeconomic down -
turns and estimating the probability of their oc -
currence require not only an understanding of 
macroeconomic processes but also an empir -
ical definition. In the traditional classification of 
business cycle phases, a recession describes a 
period of declining economic activity. This def -
inition is used as the basis for business cycle 
dating, for example, by the National Bureau of 
Economic Research (NBER) for the United 
States and the Centre for Economic Policy Re -
search (CEPR) for the euro area, both of which 
are widely recognised as official. A recession 
follows a peak in aggregate output and, after a 
trough, moves into an expansion. In order to 
be classified as a recession, the contraction also 
has to last at least a few months, be broad-  
based and must not be confined to a small Pandemic brings

the interpretation of economic processes as a sequence of

as well as Kydland and Prescott (1982). The Bundesbank’s 
Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model is 
one instance of a more comprehensive model of this class.

Measuring classical business cycles
Classical business cycles are characterised 
by alternating periods of increasing and 
declining  economic activity. To date these 
cycles, the literature often applies a rule- 
based procedure developed by Bry and 
Boschan (1971) to an indicator of macro-
economic activity.1 Expert- based methods 
are an alternative approach in which special 
committees identify the phases of the busi-
ness cycle on the basis of several statistical 
procedures and a subjective assessment of 
a number of macroeconomic indicators. In 
the United States, for example, the Business 
Cycle Dating Committee at the National 
Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), 
founded in 1978, employs a generally ac-
cepted classifi  cation of economic activity 
into expansionary and recessionary phases.2 
The Business Cycle Dating Committee at the 
Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) 
has been determining economic peaks and 
troughs for the euro area since 2003.3 A 
comparable classifi  cation of business cycle 
phases in Germany was presented by the 
German Council of Economic Experts (SVR) 
in 2017.4
Given the conceptual disparities, the ques-
tion arises as to how the dates determined 
using mechanical methods differ from ex-
pert assessments. In order to make a com-
parison possible, the cyclical turning points 
for the economic areas mentioned above 
are calculated using the Bry- Boschan algo-
rithm. The respective seasonally adjusted 
quarterly values of real gross domestic 
product (GDP) for the period from the fi  rst 
quarter of 1970 to the second quarter of 
2020 are used as an indicator of economic 
activity.5
On balance, the dating of the cycles ac-
cording to the Bry- Boschan algorithm is broadly in line with the experts’ assess-
ment.6 This is particularly true of the United 
States and the euro area. Differences exist 
only in the identifi  cation of individual turn-
ing points and the classifi  cation of phases 
with low and, in some cases, negative GDP 
growth rates. For example, the recession in 
the United States identifi  ed by NBER experts 
in 2001 is not recognised. Furthermore, the 
algorithm shows a brief downturn for the 
euro area in the early 1980s, while the CEPR 
Committee registers a prolonged contrac-
tion.7 A similar picture emerges for Ger-
many in the fi  rst half of the 1980s, although 
the Bry- Boschan algorithm identifi  es two 
short periods of contraction during the 
longer- lasting recession identifi  ed by the 
SVR. There are further deviations for Ger-
many in the fi  rst half of the 2000s and 
around the end of 2012 and the beginning 
of 2013.
The Bry- Boschan algorithm, in line with the 
NBER experts’ assessment, dates the start 
of the economic downturn in the United 
1 The procedure recognises peaks and troughs in a 
time series if their level was lower or higher in the 
period before and after. Further conditions ensure a 
minimum cycle length and guarantee that each peak is 
preceded by a trough.

5 The data on macroeconomic activity for the euro 
area aggregate for the period prior to the establish-
ment of the monetary union are taken from the Euro 
Area Business Cycle Network’s Area Wide Model 
(AWM) database. GDP data for Germany are data for 
West Germany up to and including the year 1991.
6 The version of the Bry- Boschan algorithm adapted 
by Harding and Pagan (2002) for use in quarterly time 
series is used to date the turning points. It is customar-
ily assumed that a business cycle comprises at least fi  ve 
quarters and that a cyclical expansion or recession 
each last at least two quarters.
7 Developments in investment and employment, 
which, in contrast to real GDP , recorded a signifi  cant 
and steady decline in the period in question, were a 
key factor in the CEPR experts’ decision; see Centre for 
Economic Policy Research (2003).Deutsche Bundesbank

States as a result of the coronavirus pan-
demic to the fi  rst quarter of 2020. The algo-
rithm also shows a cyclical peak for the 
euro area in the fi  nal quarter of 2019 in line 
with the decision of the CEPR Committee. 
Interestingly, according to the mechanical 
method, the German economy has been in 
a contractionary phase since the second 
quarter of 2019. In actual fact, the slight 
decline in economic output was not fol-
lowed by a recovery, meaning that the fi  rst 
quarter of 2019 marks the most recent peak 
in economic output.Overall, this comparison shows that al-
though the Bry- Boschan algorithm does not 
fully replicate the expert- based dating of 
cyclical phases, it does come quite close. 
One advantage of the Bry- Boschan proced-
ure over expert dating is that it is easy to 
use. Also, experts classify cyclical phases 
only after a certain time lag.8 However, 
when turning points at the current end are 
calculated in an “automated” manner, it 
should be borne in mind that the results 
may also change again as GDP data are re-
vised.
8 For instance, a clear time lag between the onset of a 
recession and the offi   cial reporting by the NBER or 
CEPR is standard. For the last two past recessions, the 
time lag for NBER was between three and four quar-
ters, and for CEPR between four and fi  ve quarters.A comparison of cyclical turning points

number of sectors or regions of the economy.3 
As a preferred measure for aggregate eco -
nomic activity, both the NBER and the CEPR 
therefore use gross domestic product (GDP) ad -
justed for seasonal effects and price move -
ments. However, other quarterly time series are 
additionally taken into consideration – such as 
gross national income in the United States or 
the production and expenditure- side GDP com -
ponents as well as employment in the euro 
area. As the NBER aims at a monthly chron -
ology of the business cycles, selected higher-  
frequency indicators are also analysed.4 On 
both sides of the Atlantic, this is the basis on 
which a committee of experts defines cyclical 
peaks and troughs – otherwise known as cyc -
lical turning points.5
In cyclical analysis as well as academic research, 
expert-  based dating as well as heuristic tech -
niques and quantitative methods are used for 
defining turning points. The latter have the ad -
vantage that they can be applied in accordance 
with uniform criteria to a large group of coun -
tries. In some cases, cyclical movements can be 
classified more rapidly on this basis. This is es -
pecially true when it comes to the widespread 
concept of a “technical” recession, which is de -
fined as two or more consecutive quarters of 
negative (seasonally adjusted) GDP growth.6 
Often, the Bry- Boschan algorithm is applied as 
an alternative.7 This approach identifies peaks 
in a time series if the level was previously and 
subsequently lower. When analysing quarterly 
GDP time series, the two preceding and subse -
quent quarters are typically taken into consid -
eration. Furthermore, the specification of the 
algorithm ensures a minimum cycle length and 
the sequence of peaks and troughs.8 Even 
though the procedure is quite simple, the re -
cession dates obtained in this way for major 
economies  largely correspond to the judge -
ment of experts (see the box on pp. 43 f.).
Even when there is no major crisis, the macro -
economic growth process seldom takes a 
steady course. Instead, there are typically alter -
nating periods of rapid and slow growth. If phases of slow economic expansion – known 
as soft patches – persist for an extended period, 
the associated welfare losses can in fact be 
greater than those experienced in brief reces -
sions. With this in mind, greater attention has 
been paid over the past few years to analysing 
cyclical patterns of trend- adjusted time series, 
especially of real GDP .9 As defined in this way, a 
downturn would set in as soon as economic 
output –  following a period of high growth 
rates – begins to move back to its trend level, 
then finally falling below it.10 This process, 
which ends when the cyclical trough is reached, 
is not necessarily associated with a decline in 
economic output but perhaps merely with 
below average rates of expansion.
Identifying such cycles necessitates a trend ad -
justment of the time series under consider -
ation. There are various statistical procedures 
available for this, although these occasionally Both expert

3 This definition has already been applied in the United 
States for almost 75 years; see Burns and Mitchell (1946). 
In its modern interpretation, the three cited criteria are re -
garded as somewhat interchangeable. Hence, the decline 
in GDP in March and April of the current year – which was 
arguably only brief, albeit severe and broadly based – was 
also classified as a recession; see National Bureau of Eco -
nomic Research (2020a).
4 These include, in particular, real disposable income ad -
justed for transfer payments as well as employment. Other 
indicators, such as private consumption, retail and whole -
sale turnover, industrial output as well as initial claims for 
unemployment benefits play a somewhat less important 
role.
5 For a description of the dating methods, see Centre for 
Economic Policy Research (2012) and National Bureau of 
Economic Research (2020a).
6 In its definition, the CEPR likewise points to the fact that 
recessions are generally characterised by two consecutive 
quarters of declining GDP growth. See Centre for Economic 
Policy Research (2012).
7 See Bry and Boschan (1971).
8 For a description of the methodology and its application 
to quarterly GDP time series, see Harding and Pagan 
(2002).
9 A discussion of the advantages and drawbacks of this 
practice may be found inter alia in Canova (1998) as well as 
Burnside (1998).
10 In this instance, a downturn is characterised by growth 
rates that lie below the longer- term trend, whereas an up -
turn is associated with above average rates of expansion. 
That is the reason why such upward and downward move -
ments are also called growth cycles. See Zarnowitz and 
Ozyildirim (2006).Deutsche Bundesbank

produce differing cyclical patterns.11 A further 
problem is the unreliability of the trend estima -
tions at the start and end of the sample. This 
means that additional data points can have a 
major impact on the estimation of the trend.12 
This can also affect the dating of turning points. 
The frequently used Hodrick- Prescott (HP) filter 
seems to display quite favourable properties in 
this respect. This is especially the case if the 
data series are extrapolated by suitable fore -
casting methods.13
Below, the HP filter is used to identify and ana -
lyse business cycles for a total of eight industrial 
countries14 as well as for the euro area and the 
OECD group as a whole. Local peaks and troughs 
in trend- adjusted GDP mark the transition be -
tween upturns and downturns. To mitigate the 
problems of trend estimation for the most recent 
quarters, the time series were extrapolated using 
OECD growth forecasts.15 The Bry- Boschan algo -
rithm was used for dating the cyclical turning 
points.16 In a small number of cases, the result -ing cyclical chronology – often dating back to 
the 1960s – was also adjusted slightly.17
Looking at cycles of trend- adjusted GDP time 
series leads to a significantly higher number of 
turning points being identified than when using 
the traditional definition of business cycle 
phases. This is also true of the United States 
and the euro area. As is to be expected, virtu -
ally all the recessions identified by the NBER 
and the CEPR were associated with a sharp 
downturn in the cyclical component of real 
GDP .18 Before taking a turn for the better, eco -
nomic output in these periods was in fact often 
more than 2% below its trend. With this in 
mind, this mark is set as a threshold here for 
the definition of recessions in the context of 
trend- based cycles.19 In addition, however, nu -

11 Added to this is the risk that the smoothing of volatile 
series will create misleading correlation patterns that mask 
the true characteristics of the cycles. For a discussion of the 
relative merits of various filtering methods giving due re -
gard to these aspects, see Hamilton (2018) and Hodrick 
(2020).

14 These are the United States, the United Kingdom, 
Japan, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Canada and Austra -
lia.
15 To do this, data from the June Economic Outlook were 
used; see OECD (2020). For the euro area, additional data 
from the Area Wide Model database of the Euro Area Busi -
ness Cycle Network (EABCN) were also used. This makes it 
possible to extend the GDP time series going back only as 
far as early 1991 by a further 21 years into the past. For a 
description of the dataset and the model, see Fagan et al. 
(2005).
16 For one complete cycle, a minimum length of 12 quar -
ters was specified, with each of its upturns and downturns 
having to have a minimum length of two quarters.
17 The cyclical component having to display a positive 
(negative) sign at the upper (lower) turning point was thus 
introduced as an additional condition. Moreover, four dat -
ings in total were shifted, as there was a significantly 
deeper lower or higher upper turning point in the immedi -
ate vicinity which was not selected by the dating procedure 
solely on account of the specified cycle length.
18 Only one of these “official” recessions is not identified 
as a separate downturn using the method applied here. 
The NBER dating for the United States for the early 1980s 
shows two recessions in quick succession. As defined here, 
this double- dip recession is identified as a single longer-  
lasting downturn.

merous soft patches are also identified, in 
which economic output fell only slightly below 
its trend. For the United States, for example, 
the onset of such a soft patch is found most 
recently for the beginning of 2012.20 The period 
of slow aggregate economic growth thus coin -
cided with the euro area recession following 
the sovereign debt crisis. For the most recent 
period, recessions are diagnosed for both the 
United States and the euro area in the wake of 
the coronavirus pandemic. Overall, quite a high 
degree of cyclical co- movement can be identi -
fied for other periods and countries, too (see 
the box on p. 48 ff.).
A look at the statistical features of the identi -
fied cycles underlines the fact that economic 
developments in advanced economies gener -
ally run along similar lines. In almost all the in -
dustrial countries analysed, nine or ten com -
plete economic cycles since the 1960s were 
counted. Just about half of them ended in a 
recession. In the other cases, economic output 
was no more than slightly down on its trend. 
Economic downturns were mostly significantly 
shorter than upward movements. Between 
these cyclical turning points, which separated 
the phases of the business cycle from each 
other, real GDP generally moved within a range 
of just over 2% above and below its trend.
Even so, these common features should not 
make us lose sight of the fact that individual 
cycles do indeed deviate very significantly from 
the typical pattern. There are, for example, in -
stances of short upturns and longer- lasting 
downturns. In particular, however, there are 
variations in how deep the slumps are. In this 
regard, the economic slump of the first half of 
2020 is likely to turn out to be the severest in 
recent history everywhere.21
Do upswings die of old age?
In many places, the most recent crisis was pre -
ceded by an extended macroeconomic up -
swing. Against this background, concerns that the next recession had to be imminent have 
been expressed repeatedly over the past few 
years. However, amongst economists, the hy -
pothesis that an upswing might end simply as a 
result of its long lifespan is highly controversial. 
Empirical studies have come to fairly different 
conclusions. Diebold and Rudebusch (1990) 
and Rudebusch (2016), for example, show that 
the recession probabilities in the United States 
are not dependent on the duration of the pre -
ceding upswing. Using a comparable approach, 
however, the cross- country study in Castro 
(2010) finds that the probability of a turn -
around does in fact rise the longer a given cyc -
lical phase continues. This means that upswings 
would indeed “die of old age”.Cyclical fluctu -

International business cycles
In the wake of the COVID- 19 pandemic, 
economic output collapsed in almost all 
economies within a few weeks. Likewise, 
the global fi  nancial and economic crisis of 
2008-09 hit most industrial countries al-
most simultaneously. The same was true for 
the two oil price crises in 1973 and 1979-80. 
This high degree of international co- 
move ment is not typical of all crisis periods, 
however. One counterexample is the burst-
ing of the dotcom bubble in 2000, which 
triggered a recession only in some coun-
tries. Similarly, the European sovereign debt 
and banking crisis between 2010 and 2012 
saw economic output collapse in some 
euro area Member States, whilst other 
countries merely experienced soft patches. 
Against this backdrop, the question arises 
as to how strong the cyclical co- movement 
between the industrial countries actually is.
A variety of descriptive statistics point to a 
fairly close international cyclical relation-
ship.1 For example, according to an indica-
tor that shows the share of periods in which 
business cycle phases are aligned,2 the 
United States and Germany are highly syn-chronised. The business cycle phases of 
these two global economic heavyweights 
show strong overlap with those of other 
advanced economies, too. Correlation coef-
fi  cients tend to confi  rm this fi  nding.3 In a 
direct comparison with the United States 
and Germany, a positive relationship be-
tween business cycle phases can be ob-
served for almost all countries included in 
the analysis. In many cases, the point esti-

sions.

a classical dating of cyclical turning points, see Grigoraş

mators are also statistically signifi  cantly dif-
ferent from zero. Only Sweden and Spain, 
as well as the commodity- producing econ-
omies of Australia and Norway, appear to 
largely follow distinct business cycles.
There are indications of particularly strong 
cyclical synchronisation within Europe. For 
Germany’s immediate neighbours France, 
the Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland, 
the respective correlation with the German 
cycle is more pronounced than the co- 
movement with the United States. Geo-
graphical proximity, closer trade relations 
and interlinked production chains are likely 
to be key factors in this regard. However, 
the negative, albeit insignifi  cant, correlation 
between the Spanish and German business 
cycles is probably infl  uenced by the fact 
that Spain, like other European periphery 
countries, experienced a convergence 
boom with high growth rates in the 1990s 
and 2000s and, unlike Germany, avoided a 
recession at the beginning of the millen-
nium when the dotcom bubble burst. By 
contrast, Germany recovered fairly quickly 
after the global fi  nancial and economic cri-
sis, while the southern European euro area 
countries were drawn into the maelstrom 
of the sovereign debt crisis.4
That said, a comparison that is limited to 
contemporaneous correlations may over-
look international cyclical relationships. This 
is particularly true when economic down-
turns do not have a common, direct cause, 
but originate from a specifi  c country and 
then spread after a certain delay. In this 
case, business cycle phases would be more 
likely to be aligned with a lead or lag in 
time. Indeed, for a number of industrial 
countries, the correlation with the US cycle 
is estimated to be somewhat stronger if the 
comparison of developments accounts for a 
time shift. These countries, including Can-
ada, appear to lag behind the US business cycle, usually by one to two quarters, while 
Germany’s business cycle is synchronous 
with that of the United States. Within Eur-
ope, most countries have business cycles 
that are in step with or lag only slightly be-
hind the German cycle.
The conclusion that, on the whole, inter-
national business cycles correlate fairly 
closely is confi  rmed by further robustness 
studies.5 This is also consistent with the 
academic literature. Global and common 
regional factors therefore probably account 
for a considerable portion of national cyc-
lical fl  uctuations.6 However, their impact 
does not appear to have been constant Measures of business cycle

Based on these studies, this article applies a 
simple parametric survival model to the group 
of advanced economies.22 This approach esti -
mates the impact of the duration of an up -
swing on the probability that the upswing will 
soon come to an end.23 In this context, up -
swings dated using the Bry- Boschan algorithm, 
which can also be ended by soft patches, are 
taken into consideration. In addition, upswings 
that occur between recessions are investigated 
separately. Other explanatory variables are ini -
tially excluded from the analysis.24
Overall, the results suggest that the probability 
of an upswing coming to an end increases the 
longer the upswing continues. This holds espe -
cially true if upswings ended by soft patches 
are also taken into consideration. While there is 
a negligible risk of a young macroeconomic up -
swing leading to a cyclical downturn in the fol -
lowing quarter, the probability of a downturn 
rises sharply as the duration of the upswing in -
creases.25 On this basis, around one in every three upswings lasting more than ten years 
would end in the following quarter. Similar re -
sults to those in the overall sample can also be 
observed for most countries, although the rela -
tionship between the duration of an upswing 
and the probability of a downturn seems to be … can be inves -
tigated using a

Probability of a

upswingover time. For example, they did not play a 
signifi  cant role in the period of the “Great 
Moderation” prior to the fi  nancial and eco-
nomic crisis of 2008-09. In any case, the 
impact of severe international shocks on 
national economic developments seems to 
have increased over time,7 probably due in 
large part to the deepening of trade rela-
tions as a result of globalisation.8 Given the 
current shift towards greater protectionism, 
it thus remains to be seen whether cyclical 
fl  uctuations will display a stronger national 
infl  uence in the future.7 For more information, see Kose et al. (2008). In line 
with this fi  nding, counterfactual VAR simulations show 
that the synchronicity of international business cycles 
would have increased from the mid- 1980s to shortly 
after the turn of the millennium if global shocks of a 
similar magnitude to those in previous decades had 
occurred; see Stock and Watson (2005). Recently, 
however, country- specifi  c shocks in particular appear 
to spill over to other economies to a greater extent 
than previously; see Carare and Mody (2012).
8 This is supported by the fact that the infl  uence of 
international trade links on the synchronisation of busi-
ness cycles is confi  rmed in a variety of different regres-
sion specifi  cations; see Baxter and Kouparitsas (2005). 
Cross- border value chains appear to be the main rea-
son for this fi  nding; see Ng (2010).
22 The countries and economic areas featured in this an -
alysis are the euro area, the United States, the United King -
dom, Japan, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Canada and 
Australia.
23 This kind of methodology is appropriate if mortality is a 
factor (i.e. observation units are successively eliminated). In 
medical research, for example, comparable models are 
used to estimate the efficacy of clinical treatments. The 
event being observed does not necessarily need to be 
death, but can be selected at will; other typical examples 
include recovery or the onset of complications.
24 With regard to the number of quarters in which an 
economy has been in an upswing at any given point in 
time, it is assumed that this variable follows a Weibull dis -
tribution. This distribution is consistent with very different 
hazard functions that could, in principle, generate probabil -
ities of failure that rise or fall with the duration of the up -
swing. For an overview and other applications, see Cleves 
et al. (2008), pp. 248 ff. and Lancaster (1992), pp. 269 ff.
25 Specifically, this refers to the conditional probability that 
an upswing that has lasted until the time of observation 
will end in the following quarter.Deutsche Bundesbank

especially pronounced in the United States.26 
However, a considerably different picture is ob -
tained if soft patches are disregarded when de -
fining cyclical phases.27 If only recessions are 
taken into consideration, the probability of cri -
sis rises only slightly over time.28 The answer to 
the question of whether an upswing’s duration 
has an impact on its probability of soon coming 
to an end is highly dependent on how cyclical 
phases are defined.
Model- based forecasts 
of cyclical downturns
Alongside just the duration of an upswing, the 
academic literature and business cycle research 
also discuss additional indicators that can be 
relevant to forecasting cyclical turning points. 
In this context, new perspectives could be 
offered by focusing on variables that have an -
ticipated macroeconomic cyclical patterns in 
the past. Within the group of advanced econ -omies, such variables appear to include house 
prices, sentiment indicators and financial mar -
ket variables, for example. Furthermore, dedi -
cated indicators developed specifically for this 
purpose, such as the Bundesbank’s leading in -
dicator or the OECD composite leading indica -
tor, provide timely information on cyclical de -
velopments at the international level.29 Finally, 
the literature also makes use of more complex 
statistical methods for forecasting cyclical turn -

26 In robustness studies, the model was also estimated 
using dummy variables for the various countries following 
Castro (2010). However, the associated coefficients were 
only significant in a small number of cases.
27 In this specification, a country- specific analysis is not 
possible due to the even smaller number of observations.
28 In this case, the results are consistent with those pro -
duced by Diebold and Rudebusch. Unlike in these studies, 
however, the hypothesis that the probability of a recession 
does not depend on the duration of the upswing can be 
rejected on a statistical basis. See Diebold and Rudebusch 
(1990) and Rudebusch (2016).

ing points. In country- specific analyses, time 
series models, such as regime- switching models 
or smooth transition autoregressive models, 
are typically used for this purpose.30 The 
Bundes bank  also utilises these approaches to 
assess the state of the German economy (see 
the box on pp. 54 f.).
In the following section, panel regression 
models are estimated; this approach allows the 
wealth of information contained in an inter -
national dataset to be utilised.31 As the de -
pendent variables in question can only take 
one of two values – zero when an economy is 
in an upturn, or one when a cyclical expansion 
reaches its peak – binary regression models are 
appropriate here.32 One advantage of the logit 
models used here is that they have compara -
tively simple structures, even when additional 
explanatory variables are incorporated.33 Fur-
thermore, they enable historical probabilities of 
cyclical peaks to be calculated.In order to take transmission channels and 
causes of upturns into account as comprehen -
sively as possible, the first step is to preselect 
variables by analysing the explanatory power of 
a number of variables, alongside the duration 
of the upturn thus far, using a bivariate version 
of the logit model. This factors in indicators 
that other studies have found to signal the run- 
up to a cyclical peak; these include, for ex -
ample, interest rate spreads between assets 
with different maturities, equity and house 
prices, oil prices, and sentiment indicators.34 
Fiscal policy and monetary policy variables are 
additionally taken into account as, in the past, 
fiscal consolidation or restrictive monetary pol -
icy stances have been considered to have trig -
gered macroeconomic downturns.35 Labour 
market variables and industrial capacity utilisa -
tion, which could be indicative of “overheat -
ing” in the economy, were also assessed with 
regard to their suitability for predicting cyclical 
peaks. The final selection of variables aims to 
achieve the highest possible goodness of fit for

30 See, for example, Tian and Shen (2019), Carstensen et 
al. (2020), Eraslan and Nöller (2020) as well as Fornari and 
Lemke (2010) for forecasting turning points using binary 
vector autoregressions.
31 This approach is also used by Estrella and Mishkin 
(1997) and Borio et al. (2019).
32 Observations corresponding to downturns are removed 
from the sample.
33 As discrete dependent variables are problematic in trad -
itional regression analyses, these are replaced by continu -
ous variables in logit models – the logarithm of the odds 
ratio for the occurrence of a cyclical peak.
34 For example, Rudebusch and Williams (2009) highlight 
the ability of interest rate spreads to predict imminent re -
cessions. In the case of the United States in particular, ex -
treme scenarios with negative interest rate spreads are typ -
ically seen as signs of a looming recession (see Bauer and 
Mertens (2018)). House prices and credit data are factored 
into the turning point forecast in Borio et al. (2019) by way 
of an aggregate indicator. The role of equity prices as a 
predictor of recessions and cyclical movements is also dis -
cussed in the literature (see, inter alia, Mills (1988), Estrella 
and Mishkin (1998) and Andersson and D’Agostini (2008)). 
For more information on the properties of oil prices as a 
leading indicator, see Kilian and Vigfusson (2017).
35 For example, the tightening of monetary policy in the 
United States in the early 1980s is considered to be one of 
the causes of the 1981-82 recession (see, inter alia, Good -
friend and King (2005)). Heimberger (2017), however, at -
tributes the double- dip recession in many euro area coun -
tries from 2011 to 2013 to the strong fiscal consolidation in 
these countries.Deutsche Bundesbank

the regression models.36 The resulting models 
therefore also include explanatory variables 
with coefficients that are not statistically differ -
ent from zero, but which slightly improve the 
coefficient of determination.37
Determinants of cyclical peaks
If, initially, cyclical phases are again defined in 
such a way that even mild downward move -
ments are considered downturns, the results of 
the survival analysis are confirmed. Regardless 
of the forecast horizon under analysis,38 the 
duration of an upswing so far has a statistically 
significant positive impact on the probability of 
a cyclical peak.39 A narrower interest rate 
spread, i.e. a flatter yield curve, is also linked to 
an increased probability of an upswing soon 
coming to an end. This applies similarly to 
above average levels of debt in the private non- 
financial sector, dampened house prices, and 
particularly exuberant sentiment in industry. 
Factoring in equity prices, consumer sentiment 
and the domestic inflation rate measured by 
the GDP deflator also improves the model’s 
ability to predict cyclical peaks.40
However, the interrelationships appear some -
what different if the focus is placed on up -
swings that occur between recessions. In this case, a rise in oil prices is an important indica -
tor of an imminent turning point into a down -
turn. The duration of the respective upswing 
and the interest rate spread also prove to be 
robust indicators of approaching recessions in

36 In total, more than 20 variables are counted among the 
group of indicators considered to have potential for identi -
fying cyclical peaks. Depending on the characteristics of 
their time series, the variables are factored into the regres -
sion models in levels, as changes on the preceding quarter 
or preceding year, or as deviations from the trend. The ma -
jority of the indicators were obtained from the June 2020 
edition of the OECD Economic Outlook and the OECD 
Main Economic Indicators. The data on outstanding loans 
originate from the BIS. National sources were used to ob -
tain fiscal variables.
37 The measure of quality used is McFadden’s adjusted R 2, 
which penalises the incorporation of additional explanatory 
variables in order to prevent the model from becoming 
overfitted to the data. Other common information criteria 
produce similar results. Optimising the coefficient of deter -
mination in the strict sense is made more difficult by the 
fact that selecting regressors also often changes the com -
position of the sample. Nevertheless, this has no bearing 
on this analysis’ statements regarding the predictive power 
of the models used.
38 Forecast horizons of between one and four quarters 
were analysed. The probability of an upswing ending 
within the following four quarters was also estimated.
39 The statistical significance of the regression coefficients 
is discussed below. These describe the effects of marginal 
changes in each of the explanatory variables on the loga -
rithm of the odds ratio for the occurrence of a cyclical 
peak.

correlated with equity prices or the GDP deflator to a stat -
istically significant degree.Deutsche Bundesbank

A model for the timely identifi  cation of turning points in 
the business cycle and recession probabilities for Germany
Models used to identify probabilities of re-
cession and associated turning points in the 
business cycle are often based on only a 
single highly aggregated indicator.1 As an 
alternative, it is possible to look at a large 
variety of indicators, each of which cap-
tures different aspects of economic activity.2 
A new kind of modelling framework is pre-
sented below. This is based on cross- 
sectional information from a large dataset 
comprising numerous macroeconomic and 
fi  nancial indicators,3 in order to estimate 
probabilities of recession and thus predict 
turning points in the business cycle.4 The 
procedure, a smooth transition autoregres-
sive model,5 is based on the idea of a classic 
two- phase business cycle and allows a 
gradual transition between the two re-
gimes. Expansions and recessions are distin-
guished from one another by turning points 
in the business cycle. In a fi  rst step, indicator- 
specifi  c probabilities of assignment to a re-
cession phase are estimated for a large 
number of macroeconomic and fi  nancial 
variables. These are then condensed into an 
aggregate probability of recession. The me-
dian of the indicator- specifi  c probabilities is 
used as a measure of this.To assess the suitability of this model, a 
simulation study was performed with a 
pseudo real- time dataset6 for Germany. The 
original estimation period runs from Janu-
ary 1993 to December 1999. The evaluation 
period runs from January 2000 to August 
2020. The model not only determines the 
probability of recession at the respective 
point in time, but also predicts the probabil-
ities of recession for the coming months. 
The ex post recession dating by the German 
Council of Economic Experts serves as a ref-
erence for determining the forecast accur-
acy.7
The model is fairly reliable in identifying the 
last two recessions in Germany as dated by 
the German Council of Economic Experts. 
Nevertheless, the start of the recession 
which was triggered by the bursting of the 
dotcom bubble and which, according to 
the Council, lasted from February 2001 
through June 2003, as well as the onset of 
the Great Recession, which the Council 
now dates to between January 2008 and 
April 2009, are both identifi  ed by the model 
only with a lag of several months.8 In the

toregressive (MTAR) threshold adjustment type was

these cases.41 An above average rate of infla -
tion is also associated with a heightened prob -
ability of a cyclical peak in the following quar -
ter. The sign of the effect of house and equity 
prices as well as outstanding loans –  each 
measured as deviations from their growth 
trends – is highly dependent on their lag. In 
addition, lagged values for the selected vari -
ables significantly improve the informative 
value of the model, even if they have no statis -
tically significant impact on the probability that 
a cyclical peak will occur when viewed in isol -
ation.
In some cases, the regression coefficients vary 
greatly depending on the way in which cyclical 
peaks are identified, the selection of explana -
tory variables, the underlying group of coun -
tries, and the forecast horizon. One reason for 
this may be that many indicators contain simi -
lar information on imminent cyclical turning 
points. Country- specific regressions largely con -
firm the impression that the duration of the up -swing and the interest rate spread are good 
predictors of imminent cyclical peaks. For peaks 
that are followed by recessions, this holds true 
for the interest rate spread. In this context, it 
should also be noted that the coefficients only 
reflect historical correlation patterns. These are 
likely to contain indications of the driving forces 
behind cyclical turnarounds. For example, the 
1973 oil crisis can also be interpreted as a cause 
of the subsequent downturn. By contrast, fi -
nancial market variables as well as survey- based 
indicators probably only react in the run- up to 
cyclical slumps because market participants 
and respondents anticipate a downturn in 
many cases. Furthermore, the possibility that 
uncaptured factors are significant for the oc -
currence of cyclical peaks cannot be ruled out. 
For these reasons, the statistical impact of indi -Results should 
be interpreted 
with cautionfi  rst case, the model pinpoints the start of 
the recession four months later, as May 
2001 (and the end as early as March 2002). 
In the second case, the median nowcast in-
dicates a recessionary phase from July 2008 
to July 2009, i.e. with a time lag of six 
months (start of recession) and three 
months (end of recession). In this compari-
son, however, it should be noted that these 
recessionary phases were not dated until a 
much later point in time. At the time of the 
recessions, the assessment was nowhere 
near as clear. This was particularly true of 
the Great Recession of 2008-09, the start 
of which often went undetected until later. 
By comparison, the model would have de-
livered an early warning. Furthermore, for 
the downturn from 2001 to 2003 the 
model pointed to a dramatically rising risk 
of recession as early as March 2001, with a 
nowcast of 10% as well as forecasts of al-
most 50% for April and nearly 80% for 
May.The model gave warning signals more re-
cently, too. In the second half of 2019, it 
indicated elevated recessionary risks, which 
then declined sharply at the beginning of 
2020, however, owing to positive macro-
economic data for January and February. At 
the current end, the estimated probability 
of recession did not increase until early 
May, but then did so abruptly, surging to 
100%. However, the sweeping measures 
taken to contain the coronavirus pandemic 
were already being introduced in March. It 
was immediately clear that this would inev-
itably result in a slump in economic activity. 
In this case, the delay in signalling a reces-
sion was due to the fact that the model 
– unlike business cycle analysts – was un-
able to take into account the economic im-
pact of the measures until early May, when 
the macroeconomic indicators for March 
were released. This illustrates once again 
the special nature of the current crisis.
41 In the case of upswings that end in recessions, the rela -
tionship between the duration of the upswing and the 
probability that a cyclical peak will occur is weaker than for 
upswings that transition into soft patches. This is consistent 
with the results of the survival analysis.Deutsche Bundesbank

vidual variables must be interpreted with cau -
tion.
Forecasting economic 
 downturns
A key factor in predicting economic downturns 
is the model’s forecast of the probability of an 
upturn coming to an end. This probability tends 
to rise sharply before soft patches, but espe -
cially before recessions. For example, models 
indicated that the upswing prior to the global 
financial and economic crisis was increasingly 
fragile for almost all major advanced econ -omies. Flat yield curves, high levels of private 
debt and falling equity prices, but also the 
above average duration of the upswing so far, 
indicated a turning point ahead. Even clearer 
fluctuations were seen in the probabilities of 
recession for the United States at the turn of 
the millennium (i.e. before the economic slump 
triggered by the bursting of the dotcom bub -
ble) and in Japan in the run-  up to the severe 
economic crisis in the early 1990s.
The binary regressions therefore appear to pro -
vide valuable information about approaching 
peaks and impending downturns. To assess the 
quality of a forecast model more accurately, its 
predictions are usually compared with events 
that have actually occurred. This involves deriv -
ing warning signals from the forecast model 
probabilities and comparing them with the ac -
tual cyclical turning points. To this end, a 
threshold is sought which, when exceeded, 
means that the forecast probability sends the 
most reliable signal possible for a forthcoming 
downturn. If it is set too high, potential signals 
for downturns are missed. If it is set too low, a 
high proportion of false signals is to be ex -
pected. For peaks that mark the beginning of 
soft patches as well as those that are followed 
by deep recessions, threshold optimisation 
techniques suggest setting the threshold for 
sending a signal at 8%.42
Beginning with the broad definition of a turn -
ing point, for this threshold, the model cor -
rectly classifies just over three- quarters of all 
observations into those with and without 
peaks. The error rate is only slightly higher 
when looking exclusively at the peaks them -
selves. Only one-  third failed to be identified. 
However, in many cases, the model raises an

42 The information content of signals is established here 
by determining a ratio between the probability of a signal 
being triggered at a peak and the probability of a signal 
being a false alarm. To identify warning signals, it is more 
important to avoid type I errors (missed peaks). As a result, 
fairly low thresholds are therefore selected. See also

that the probability of a peak is significantly 
higher if the model sends a signal than if it 
does not. Compared with a naive forecast, 
which sets the unconditional probability of a 
peak for each quarter, the model- based fore -
cast represents a clear improvement.
The binary regression model is even more in -
formative if the forecast is limited to recessions. 
Here, almost all observations are identified cor -
rectly. The share of correctly identified peaks is 
also significantly higher than in the previous 
case. At the same time, however, the clear ma -
jority of the signals remain false. Nevertheless, 
the model is considerably more informative 
than naive forecasts. Although not every an -
nouncement was actually followed by a reces -
sion, the start of a recession was often clearly 
signalled.43
The global economic slump in the first quarter 
of 2020 can be used as a counter- example. Al -
though there were increasing signs of an immi -
nent soft patch in many countries last year, the 
risk of a recession in the near future was con -
sidered to be low. Only in the United States did 
the probability of recession rise slightly, owing 
to a negative interest rate spread. The COVID- 
19 pandemic itself and its consequences, how -
ever, could only be diagnosed, but not forecast 
with a greater lead.Summary
In summary, quantitative business cycle analysis 
can be used to identify fragile macroeconomic 
upturns and also to predict downturns. Reces -
sions, in particular, often appear to be signalled 
in advance – at least when looked at with hind -
sight. All the same, it must be acknowledged 
that the models presented here failed to recog -
nise a few (sometimes severe) downturns. 
Turning points could even be missed more fre -
quently in day- to- day business cycle analysis, 
not least because the characteristics of down -
turns often differ in their details from the pat -
terns observed in previous cycles. However, it is 
precisely the particularities of the situation pre -
vailing at a given time that are not yet reflected 
in the estimated forecast equations.
A look at the accuracy of judgements made by 
experts confirms how challenging it can be to 
predict economic downturns. In June 2008, for 
example, the Bundesbank was still anticipating 
fairly brisk growth in its forecasts for 2008 and 
2009.44 Six months later, the outlook was for … recessions,

43 In almost half of all cases, an increase in the probability 
of a turning point interpreted as a false signal was indeed 
followed by a recession after a few quarters. The forecast 
models would therefore have indicated that the upturn 
was highly fragile in these situations, too.

little growth in GDP over the course of 2009.45 
However, the current data show that, in the 
wake of the global financial and economic cri -
sis, German GDP fell markedly from as early as 
the second quarter of 2008, decreasing by 
3.3% over the course of 2009. Similarly, the 
International Monetary Fund has seldom fore -
cast a decline in GDP in its published projec -
tions over the past 30 years. Even during crisis 
periods, its assessments for the current year 
were still too optimistic in around half of all 
cases. Other national and international organ -
isations and private sector analysts have per -
formed similarly poorly in the past.46
Various explanatory approaches are put for -
ward for this patchy overall performance. Some 
suggest that people generally tend to stick to 
an assessment once it has been made and do 
not initially assign enough importance to new 
information that challenges it.47 It may also be 
the case that a recession – especially one that 
is less severe  – is initially difficult to identify 
from the preliminary data delivered by the eco -
nomic indicators. Macroeconomic forecasts 
would therefore be adjusted too slowly, despite signs of a deterioration in the situation. Other 
explanations are based on the incentives for 
business cycle forecasters. For instance, they 
might be reluctant to predict a recession if mis -
judgements could potentially result in major 
costs such as reputational damage.48 In add -
ition, the projections of international organisa -
tions might be influenced by political motives 
or concerns that a pessimistic forecast could 
become “self- fulfilling”.49 Finally, however, it is 
also possible that the picture may be clouded 
by the fact that, in some cases, impending 
downturns are detected early on and prevented 
by means of forward- looking economic policy 
measures. Recessions avoided in this way 
would not be included in the statistics.
Although these factors certainly play some -
thing of a role, there is still much to suggest 
that, in the end, some downturns simply can -
not be predicted. Even economies that previ -
ously appeared to be fairly resilient can be 
plunged into recession by shocks of sufficient 
magnitude. The latest global economic crisis 
resulting from the coronavirus pandemic under -
lines this once again. The fact that no warnings 
of an imminent economic turnaround are is -
sued in situations like this should not therefore 
be considered a failure on the part of the ex -
perts. Business cycle research can, however, 
identify undesirable developments or potential 
excesses and thus an increased risk of reces -
sion. Quantitative methods are an important 
tool in this regard.Explanatory

The protracted rise in residential property 
prices in Germany from a macroeconomic 
perspective: transmission channels and 
fundamental  determinants
The German economic upswing from 2010 until the slump caused by the coronavirus pandemic 
was accompanied by a continuous rise in residential property prices. Given the remarkable price 
levels reached in many regions, the economic slowdown last year already led to questions about 
the spillover effects on the residential property market. The historic slump in economic output this 
year caused by the pandemic has made these questions even more relevant. Going forward, 
developments in the residential property market in the short and longer term are currently subject 
to heightened uncertainty. This article uses econometric models of the residential property market 
to analyse the economic interrelationships between residential property price developments in 
Germany and macroeconomic developments. This also enables an assessment of the potential 
for a correction of residential property prices stemming from the previous price boom.
From a macroeconomic perspective, rising prices in the residential property market over the past 
few years have reflected developments in housing supply and demand. The price effects of the 
sharp surge in demand have stimulated additional residential construction, which has also driven 
the price of construction work up sharply. Land prices, whose contribution to residential property 
price inflation has risen significantly in recent years, have appreciated even more sharply. As land 
prices, in particular, tend to reflect a property’s asset value, the risk of residential property price 
exaggerations has also increased. Overvaluations have emerged, especially in urban areas, and 
valuation measures have recently indicated some upward price deviations at the macroeconomic 
level as well. However, these results depend on the calculation method and are also very heavily 
influenced by the underlying assumptions regarding the natural level of lending rates. Further 
analyses provide scant evidence in support of the hypothesis that destabilising speculative 
demand motives are the main driver of these overvaluations.
Overall, the price structure in the German residential property market last year can therefore be 
regarded as robust to pronounced changes in the macroeconomic environment. This finding is 
supported by the fact that the pandemic has so far left little mark on the residential property 
market. However, the macroeconomic environment is now much more fragile than before. That 
said, there are no signs of an abrupt correction in residential property prices, provided that there 
is no serious disruption to the ongoing macroeconomic recovery.Deutsche Bundesbank

Upward pressure on residen -
tial property prices broadly 
based across regions
The protracted German economic upswing, 
which began in 2010 and came to an abrupt 
end with the outbreak of the coronavirus pan -
demic, also affected the residential property 
market. However, this occurred gradually and 
with regional differences. In the first half of this 
upswing, the sharp rise in residential property 
prices was largely concentrated in urban areas, 
with prices initially barely rising at all in rural 
areas. The boom in real estate prices only took 
off gradually in non-  urban regions. As of 
roughly 2015, steep upward pressure on resi -
dential property prices became broadly based 
across regions. According to Bundesbank cal -
culations based on data from bulwiengesa AG, 
residential property prices in Germany as a 
whole have since risen by an average of 7¾% 
per year, whereas they rose by just 4¼% per 
year in the first half of the boom period. In 
2019, there were hardly any remaining differ -
ences in the price dynamics between urban 
and rural areas (see the box on pp. 69 ff.).1 In 
the rental segment, too, there were hardly any 
regional deviations in inflation last year. How -
ever, house price inflation significantly out -
paced inflation in terms of new rental con -
tracts.After years of consolidation in the construction 
sector, new construction activity picked up 
again in line with the positive price impulses of 
the most recent economic upswing. While 
there was a time lag before construction activ -
ity gained momentum, in 2019 the number of 
completed projects exceeded those in 2010 by 
just over 80%. The additional housing supply 
increased at an above- average rate in the seven 
largest cities. But in rural areas, too, the expan -
sion of supply did not fall behind the average 
development. Only in smaller and medium-  
sized towns and cities was growth in the num -
ber of new dwellings comparatively low. As 
from around 2017, construction activity in most 
regions stabilised at its elevated level, while 
residential investment, which includes modern -
isation, conversion and expansion measures in 
existing residential buildings, continued to see 
strong growth.
Already last year, in view of the remarkable 
level of residential property prices in many re -
gions, the question also arose as to what im -
pact the visible slowdown in the economy 
would have on the real estate market. This

Regional house price indices – what data the oﬃ   cial 
 statistics provide
Residential property markets are character-
ised by a high degree of regional hetero-
geneity. Appropriate data sources are re-
quired to investigate regional trends. For 
instance, while very granular regional data 
on the housing stock and construction ac-
tivity have been published in the offi   cial 
statistics for many years, corresponding 
price indices have only been provided since 
mid- 2019 and in a comparatively rough 
geographical breakdown. In addition to the 
house price index for Germany as a whole, 
the Federal Statistical Offi   ce reports on price 
developments of apartments and houses, 
starting from the fourth quarter of 2015, for 
fi  ve types of area based on the Federal Insti-
tute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs 
and Spatial Development’s (BBSR) classifi  ca-
tion of district types by settlement struc-
ture.1
According to this classifi  cation, districts and 
independently administered cities, which 
are referred to as district-free towns and cit-
ies, are broken down into four groups using 
criteria such as population density and 
share of the population living in towns and 
cities: large district- free towns and cities, 
urban districts, densely populated rural dis-
tricts and sparsely populated rural districts.2 
Among the big cities, the seven largest cit-
ies in Germany3 are grouped separately. 
This takes account, amongst other things, 
of the fact that this city aggregate plays a 
particularly important role in the analysis of the real estate market. The Bundesbank and 
vdpResearch GmbH have also been publish-
ing price indices for the group of the seven 
largest cities for some time now.
bulwiengesa AG has been providing the 
Bundesbank with district- level price data for 
many years.4 These data enable fairly fl  ex-
ible regional aggregates to be formed for 
analytical purposes. For instance, it is also 
possible to calculate regional price indica-
tors on the basis of the classifi  cation of dis-
trict types by settlement structure. These 
data start in 2004 and thus capture a con-
siderably longer period than the regional-
ised house price index compiled by the Fed-
eral Statistical Offi   ce, even though this 
means that they mainly cover the period of 
the recent upswing only. Furthermore, the 
data on houses and apartments can be 
condensed to form an overall aggregate,

2 The predominantly demographic criteria underlying 
the defi  nition of district types by settlement structure 
allow a stable categorisation, at least in the short to 
medium term. This is likely to be largely independent 
of events in the real estate markets and, in particular, 
to avoid interaction between price developments in a 
district and the category to which it is assigned.

which is currently not done in the offi   cial 
data. However, the Bundesbank’s regional 
indices based on price data from bul-
wiengesa AG are published only once a 
year, whereas the regionalised house price 
index appears quarterly. The nature of the 
underlying data also differs between pro-
viders. The Federal Statistical Offi   ce uses 
transaction data from committees of sur-
veyors for property values. bulwiengesa 
AG’s price data are primarily based on well- 
founded expert assessments.
Transaction data are the preferred data 
source for calculating real estate price in-
dices. However, they involve substantial re-
quirements with regard to statistical treat-
ment. For example, a quality adjustment 
based on hedonic methods usually only 
produces satisfactory results if a large num-
ber of observations is available in the case 
of pronounced heterogeneity. Limiting the 
geographical breakdown to merely fi  ve sub- 
groups is likely to refl  ect the attempt to pro-
duce results for the data currently available 
that are analytically meaningful and of suffi   -
ciently good statistical quality.
House prices in the district types by settle-
ment structure can show different tenden-
cies. Drawing on the price series based on 
data from bulwiengesa AG that has been 
available since 2004, statistical tests can be used to demonstrate that the annual rates 
of change between the fi  ve categories have 
differed systematically over much of the 
period under review. The gap between 
urban and rural areas was particularly pro-
nounced in the early phase of the upswing 
in Germany’s real estate markets in the fi  rst 
half of the last decade, for example.
The fact that raw data for the offi   cial house 
price index are currently provided in an in-
complete form and with a time delay in 
some cases appears to make calculating ro-
bust results for rural areas in particular more 
diffi   cult. This is indicated by the high sus-
ceptibility to revision of the data for this dis-
trict type.5 By contrast, the corrections to 
the offi   cial results for the other district types 
are not conspicuous.
The house price index is published approxi-
mately 85 days after the end of a reporting 
quarter. This publication date is largely de-
pendent on the provision of data by the 
committees of surveyors. They provide in-
formation on notarised purchase agree-
ments to the offi   cial statistical offi   ces no 
later than 60 days after the end of the re-
porting quarter.6 The revisions illustrate that 
information is lagged on a relevant scale.7 
However, the usefulness of many data for 
house price statistics are currently limited, 
not only by when they are available but also 
by what data are provided. According to 
the Federal Statistical Offi   ce, 45% of the 
datasets provided cannot be used for index 
calculation as central price- determining at-
tributes required for quality adjustment are 
not available.8 One key factor here is that 
the committees of surveyors often only ob-
5 The revision practice for the house price index stipu-
lates that the results for the previous quarter be revised 
with the publication of the result for the current quar-
ter. Furthermore, the previous year’s result is revised 
with the publication of the fi  rst quarter of a year. See 
Federal Statistical Offi   ce (2018) p. 8. The revisions to 
the regionalised index are discussed, amongst other 
things, in Federal Statistical Offi   ce (2020a).

tain important information on real estate 
transactions through downstream postal 
buyer surveys.
Potential ways of improving the offi   cial real 
estate price statistics mainly involve creating 
the conditions for data on price- determining 
attributes to be transmitted in a timely and 
complete manner, starting with the data 
source.9 This objective could be considered 
as part of the implementation of the 
“eNoVA ” (Elektronischer Notariat- Verwal-
tungs- Austausch) project – an electronic ex-
change between notary’s offi   ces and the 
administrative bodies involved.10 The con-
cept of this project is for the administrative 
procedures for conducting real estate trans-
actions to be digitalised by establishing an 
IT portal. This would also improve the stat-
istical usefulness of the information from 
real estate purchase contracts if a corres-
ponding regulatory framework were estab-
lished in this context that ensured that stat-
istically relevant features were recorded and 
made available nationwide.
The regionalisation of the offi   cial house 
price index has extended the range of data 
available for monitoring developments in 
the residential property markets. However, 
the fact that data are, in some cases consid-
erably, susceptible to revision has so far re-
duced the usefulness of the indices for an-
alysis purposes. Considering the available 
price indicators from different sources and 
with different data coverage together still 
remains the best way to arrive at reliable 
empirical fi  ndings. Increased statistical un-
certainty in this area means that general 
caution must be applied when interpreting 
the results.
9 Furthermore, data could in principle also be obtained 
for commercial real estate – for which there are cur-
rently no offi   cial price indices – and the creation of a 
price index could be promoted. Recommendations 
from the European Systemic Risk Board (2016) and the 
G20 Data Gaps Initiative also suggest that metrics for 
the commercial real estate market are needed.

slump in economic output in the first half of 
the year have made this issue even more press -
ing. There is no doubt that uncertainty about 
further developments in the residential prop -
erty market in the short and longer term has 
increased this year. Assessments of the struc -
tural condition of the residential property mar -
ket have therefore gained greatly in import -
ance. On the one hand, this is about the fac -
tors that link the residential property market to 
macroeconomic developments. These provide 
information on the extent to which residential 
property price developments are consistent 
with economic interrelationships. On the other 
hand, this is also about assessing the size of the 
potential for correction stemming from the 
previous residential property price boom. From 
an analytical perspective, econometric models 
are available for both of these aspects (see the 
box on pp. 73 f.).
Factors influencing residen -
tial property price inflation 
from the perspective of a 
macroeconomic model 
 approach
The combination of marked price increases and 
the housing supply expansion suggests that residential property price developments were 
chiefly a reflection of the sharp rise in housing 
demand during the exceptionally long eco -
nomic upturn. The situation of a demand-  
driven rise in residential property prices can be 
modelled in a class of models in which residen -
tial property prices are determined by the 
stock- flow equilibrium of supply and demand. 
A core component of the error correction ap -
proach is a long- run relationship between resi -
dential property prices, current and expected 
household income, and interest rate develop -
ments for mortgage loans. By also taking into 
account short- term influences on price dynam -
ics, the model can be used to identify the way 
in which residential property prices and resi -
dential investment –  the latter of which in -
creases the housing supply in this model frame -
work by expanding the housing stock – typic -
ally respond to changes in the macroeconomic 
environment.
Data on the macroeconomic variables included 
in the model specification for Germany are 
available for the period from 1991 onwards. 
The residential property price index in Germany 
covering the longest available period of time is

Two models for estimating residential property prices 
in Germany
Error correction models consisting of a specifi  -
cation of the long- run price trend and one or 
several equations describing the short- term 
price dynamics form part of the toolkit for 
analysing the residential property market.1 
One of the elements that theoretically under-
pin this approach is the model of stock- fl  ow 
equilibrium in the residential property mar-
ket.2 The main conceptual relationships can 
be illustrated in a simplifi  ed error correction 
model.
The long- run equilibrium relationship links 
residential property prices (pt) with house-
holds’ disposable income (yt) and interest rate 
developments for mortgage loans (rt) as well 
as other demand- side factors such as longer- 
run GDP growth expectations ( gexp
t).3 To 
these are added supply- side factors such as 
productivity in the construction sector 
(yconstr
t ). The error term (εt) captures tempor-
ary price deviations from the long- run rela-
tionship.pt=β0+β1yt+β2rt+β3gexp
t+β4yconstr
t+"t
The housing stock is derived from the cumula-
tive changes in supply resulting from residen-
tial construction activity and the number of 
housing units that are no longer available on 
the market.4 In the fi  rst short- run equation, it 
is assumed that price increases (∆pt) tend to 
be followed by higher residential investment 
(it), enlarging the housing supply.5
it = β5∆pt–1 + β6∆cct–1 + ζt
For instance, higher demand thanks to in-
come growth would cause prices to go up, 
which would stimulate residential investment 
and increase the stock of dwellings until hous-
ing demand and supply balance each other 
out. Higher costs for construction services 
(∆cct), meanwhile, would ceteris paribus curb 
construction activity and produce additional 
price pressure; moreover, random disturb-
ances ( ζt) can occur. According to the theor-
etical approach, increased residential invest-
ment –  triggered by productivity growth or 
deregulation  – will ceteris paribus dampen 
price dynamics, though disturbances ( ηt) can 1 See Kajuth (2020), Leung (2014), Malpezzi (1999) 
and Steiner (2010). For an application for extrapolating 
residential property prices, see Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2017).
2 See DiPasquale and Wheaton (1994) and McCarthy 
and Peach (2004).
3 Variables in levels are transformed into logarithms in 
the specifi  cation. Residential property prices and the 
measure of income were adjusted for the general price 
level as measured by the defl  ator of private consump-
tion. The productivity measure refers to real hourly 
productivity in the construction sector. Interest rates 
on housing loans were adjusted for longer- term infl  a-
tion expectations using Consensus Economics survey- 
based data. The survey- based data on longer- run real 
GDP growth are obtained from Consensus Economics. 
Moreover, in the calculations volumes were placed in 
relation to the number of households.
4 Vacancies are not taken into account in the model 
framework.
5 Real residential investment is placed in relation to the 
real value of the housing stock; the ratio is entered 
into the estimation in logarithms. Moreover, the full 
specifi  cations of the short- run equations in the estima-
tion of the error correction model contain rates of 
change of the determinants in the long- run relation-
ship, lagged values of the dependent and the explana-
tory variables and, in some cases, constants or dummy 
variables.Estimation results of the error

occur here, too. This is represented by the 
second short- run equation.
∆pt = β7^εt–1 + β8it–1 + ηt
The error correction mechanism is refl  ected in 
the short- run price adjustment that is trig-
gered by previous deviations of residential 
property prices from their long- run trend  (^ εt–1). 
The coeffi   cients of these specifi  cations, in 
which the explanatory variables affect the de-
pendent variables with a time lag, can be esti-
mated by means of a conventional OLS esti-
mation.
While the analysis of actual price dynamics is 
all about explaining changes in prices as well 
as possible with given determinants, ques-
tions relating to overvaluations centre on the 
extent to which prices deviate from a level jus-
tifi  ed by the fundamentals. This can be meas-
ured using the long- run relationship of the 
error correction model without the short- run 
relationships. In this case, the assessment of 
price developments is based on its deviation 
from a trend path determined by the sustain-
able values of macroeconomic variables.6 An-
other approach to estimating the fundamen-
tal price also looks at the relationship between 
residential property prices and their determin-
ants in a cross- section of Germany’s 401 ad-
ministrative districts. In an econometric panel model, the price of residential property in ad-
ministrative district i  is explained by district- 
specifi  c variables, namely the per capita hous-
ing stock at the beginning of the year (sit), per 
capita disposable income (yit) and population 
density (dit).7 The model also incorporates 
macroeconomic data on mortgage lending 
rates (rt) and survey- based longer- run GDP 
growth expectations ( gexp
t).8
pit =  α0 + α1sit + α2yit + α3dit + α4rt +

t + ci + τit
Furthermore, ci denotes an unobserved 
district- specifi  c time- invariant fi  xed effect, and 
τit represents an error term. The coeffi   cients 
of variables that could be correlated with the 
unobserved effect are estimated in a panel 
model with random effects using the instru-
mental variables estimator.9 On the basis of 
this econometric approach, residential prop-
erty prices can be compared with the esti-
mated district- specifi  c fundamental equilib-
rium levels. The measure of overvaluation is 
based on the district- specifi  c estimation re-
siduals, which are condensed using popula-
tion shares to create different regional sub- 
aggregates and a fi  gure for the economy as a 
whole.Estimation results of the panel

6 The price deviation is not necessarily identical with 
the error correction term because, amongst other 
things, the determinants can persistently deviate from 
the level justifi  ed by the fundamentals.
7 See Kajuth et al. (2016).
8 In this case, nominal variables were adjusted for the 
general price level using the regional consumer price 
index; interest rates on housing loans were adjusted 
using survey- based data on longer- run infl  ation ex-
pectations obtained from Consensus Economics. The 
survey- based data on longer- run real GDP growth ob-
tained from Consensus Economics were converted into 
per capita values using data on population trends 
based on the Federal Statistical Offi   ce’s 14th coordin-
ated population projection. Additional district- specifi  c 
determinants were not found to have an impact.
9 This was done using the deviations of the district- 
specifi  c determinants from the administrative district- 
specifi  c mean. See Hausman and Taylor (1981). The 
usual length of the publication process means that 
data on some explanatory variables are currently only 
available up until 2018 or 2017. Where these district- 
specifi  c variables were not yet available, they were ex-
trapolated using the previous year’s percentage

start until 2003. The quality of the estimation 
of long- run relationships depends, amongst 
other things, on the data coverage of cyclical 
phases being as balanced as possible. There -
fore, in order to achieve a sample that reaches 
as far back as possible, the vdp price index was 
back- calculated to 1993 by way of approxima -
tion using a newly constructed indicator for 
residential property prices in Germany based 
on official statistics (see the box on pp. 77 f.).
According to the estimation results, residential 
property prices are fairly closely linked to longer-  
term income developments and interest rates 
on mortgage loans. Added to this is the impact 
of expected future GDP growth, which is seen 
as an indicator of expected increases in house -
hold income. Taken together, these variables af -
fect the affordability of owner-  occupied dwell -
ings, which can be measured, for example, by 
the interest burden on disposable income in the 
case of credit- financed residential property pur -
chases. It improved very strongly between 2010 
and 2016 and was also significantly more fa -
vourable in 2019 than at the start of the upturn 
in the real estate market.2 In this context, ac -
cording to the results of the analysis, mortgage 
lending rates, which –  mirroring the general 
interest rate environment in the euro area – fell 
exceptionally sharply in particular between 
2010 and 2016, had a somewhat greater im -
pact than current income growth on property 
price increases.3 On the supply side, however, 
the results show that productivity gains in the 
construction sector had no substantial impact 
on residential property price trends. Further -
more, there are no indications that looser bank 
lending standards for mortgage loans played a 
role in the rising residential property prices.4
Higher housing demand, for example stem -
ming from growth in household income, can 
result in rising prices and, indirectly, in increased 
construction activity. The estimation approach 
makes it possible to trace changes in prices and 
residential investment triggered by isolated 
changes in macroeconomic variables. The ana -
lyses show, for one thing, that stimulative price signals had a significant impact on residential 
investment.5 According to OECD data, Ger -
many is nevertheless one of the countries 
where the housing supply tends to be inelas -
tic.6 Factors that could hinder a greater expan -
sion of supply include a lack of availability of 
suitable residential building land and the tight -
ness of rent regulation.7 The more pronounced 
these are, the more difficult or less attractive 
investment in new dwellings is in the event of 
significant price increases.
On the other hand, the assessment of the 
transmission channel in the opposite direction, 
i.e. after expansions in supply, shows that add -
itional residential investment scarcely damp -
ened residential property price inflation in the 
short run, provided it was not itself attributable 
to price impulses. Viewed in isolation, stock-  
increasing residential investment actually led to 
price increases to a certain extent, contrary to 
the expected effect. The gradually increasing 
capacity utilisation in the construction sector 
reached an extremely high level last year, caus -
ing price pressure on the cost side. Moreover, 
the availability of building land, especially in the 
attractive urban regions, became scarce quite 
quickly, which meant that additional dwellings 
were increasingly built without an expansion in 
the underlying residential building land.8Empirically

3 Income variables also reflect the demand effect of the 
high level of labour market- oriented immigration between 
2011 and 2019.
4 See Geiger et al. (2016). Furthermore, owing to the lack 
of statistical data, it is not possible to determine the extent 
to which red tape, entrenched land use plans or resistance 
by interest groups prevented the expansion of residential 
building land.
5 This can be seen in the impulse responses of residential 
investment to exogenous increases in residential property 
prices.
6 See Cavalleri et al. (2019).
7 The necessary societal debate about the purpose of land 
use can also play a role here. In the case of rent regulation, 
across- the- board rent controls, in particular, risk reducing 
investment incentives.

Real estate prices comprise the cost of con -
struction work and the cost of land. It is there -
fore interesting to see which of these factors 
can explain most of the increase in residential 
property prices in recent years. To this end, 
based on the value of the housing stock, price 
dynamics can be decomposed into the contri -
butions of movements in the prices of con -
struction work and building land. The results 
suggest that the main driver of the sharp rise in 
real estate prices over the past decade has 
been the increased growth in the prices of 
building land, which outpaced construction 
prices, particularly in the second half of the 
period.
The previous analysis of the macroeconomic 
determinants of residential property prices 
overall can also be carried out separately for 
each of the two price components – construc -
tion costs and land prices. In order to assign 
the effects of the price- determining variables to 
the two components, the estimations that 
were applied to residential property prices can 
be repeated for both construction prices and 
land prices. The separate analysis shows that 
the impact of both income and interest rate de -
velopments was chiefly transmitted through 
the land component. As the contribution of the 
land component has grown in the recent past, 
the impact of income growth and declining interest rates has tended to increase. This dis -
aggregated estimate also sheds light on the 
finding that higher residential investment did 
not have a dampening effect on residential 
property prices. This is attributable to the price 
pressure on construction work caused by the 
increase in construction activity. Increased resi -
dential investment has thus pushed up the 
price of construction work, thereby contribut -
ing to the price dynamics of residential real es -
tate. This is plausible, given that capacity util -
isation in the construction sector has been ex -
tremely high for some time now. According to 
the model results, price- dampening effects are 
more likely to be achieved through the desig -
nation of additional building land. Additional 
residential building land would thus counteract 
the price pressure attributable to growing con -
struction activity.
Taken together, the findings show that price 
movements in recent years have, from a macro -
economic perspective, largely been an expres -
sion of economically plausible transmission 
mechanisms. Owing to the growing scarcity of 
residential building land, the rise in the demand 
for housing had a fairly strong price impact. In 
addition, the increases in construction prices 
triggered by higher construction activity coun -
teracted the price- dampening effect of add -
itional building land. Nevertheless, prices in the 
period under review diverged, in some cases 
markedly, from the dynamics suggested by the 
macroeconomic variables. This can be partly 
explained – from a statistical perspective – by a 
lack of data availability, for example for the 
costs of designating building land; moreover, 
the prices could also reflect temporary price ex -
aggerations.

An indicator for residential property prices in Germany 
as of 1993
Indicators that model developments in ag-
gregate residential property prices in Ger-
many and which demonstrate suffi   cient 
data quality are available from 2003 on-
wards.1 The data therefore cover mainly the 
period of the protracted economic up-
swing. In order to look even further back at 
property price trends in Germany, an add-
itional price indicator for residential prop-
erty prices can be obtained using a proced-
ure that has previously been applied to the 
United States.2 This price indicator goes 
back to 1993, thus covering a considerably 
longer period than the one for which ag-
gregate property price data for Germany 
are currently available.
The starting point for calculating this indica-
tor is the defi  nition of housing wealth 
(ph
tht), defi  ned as the capital stock of resi-
dential buildings ( ht) valued at current 
prices  ( ph
t). Its time path refl  ects the com-
binations of pure changes in the price of the housing stock and the value of stock 
changes.

In order to separate the price changes, the 
contribution made by the value of stock 
changes has to be deducted from the 
changes in housing wealth. Housing wealth 
here is defi  ned as the sum of the building 
value ( ps
tst) and the land value component 
(pl
tlt).
ph
tht=ps
tst+pl
tlt
Data for these components are available in 
the sectoral and national wealth accounts.3 
The value of the change in the housing 
stock is accordingly composed of net in-
vestment in dwellings and the value of 
growth in residential building land.4 This 
can be measured using district- specifi  c data 
on changes in the area of residential build-
1 The quality- adjusted, transaction- based price index 
for owner- occupied housing of the Association of Ger-
man Pfandbrief Banks (vdp) starts in 2003. The Bun-
desbank indicator for residential property prices in Ger-
many based on bulwiengesa AG data goes back to 
2004. Data on the Federal Statistical Offi   ce’s house 
price index that lend themselves to time comparisons 
are available as of the year 2014. See Federal Statistical 
Offi   ce (2018).
2 See Davis and Heathcote (2007) as well as Kajuth 
(2020).
3 See Federal Statistical Offi   ce (2012, 2019b). With the 
exception of the data on the value of growth in build-
ing land, the calculations are based on the total econ-
omy excluding general government. The data on the 
value of residential building area was derived from the 
ratio of the area of land used for residential purposes 
to the area used for residential, commercial or indus-
trial purposes.
4 In order to calculate the share of depreciation on 
residential buildings accounted for by the private sec-
tor, it was assumed that it matches that of private sec-
tor housing investment. Ancillary construction costs 
have to be deducted from net housing investment, 
which also comprises non- deductible turnover tax. 
These costs include charges, commissions, fees, real 
estate acquisition tax and the value of utility and ser-
vice connections and external facilities.Residential property prices in Germany

ing land combined with average prices of 
developed building land per square metre.5
Statistical data for nearly all of the neces-
sary variables are available for the period 
from 1991 onwards. However, the district- 
specifi  c data on the area of residential 
building land go back only as far as 1996. In 
the previous period, aggregate data for 
Germany are available only for 1992. The 
data for the years 1993 to 1995 have there-
fore been linearly interpolated. Looking at 
the growth in residential building land, 
1993 is therefore taken as the starting point 
for the price indicator for residential prop-
erty in Germany.
A caveat, however, is that the price indica-
tor is neither based on transaction data nor 
quality- adjusted. Up- to- date results can 
only be calculated with a time lag. More-
over, only annual data are available – which, 
for the 1990s, are partly interpolated. This 
impairs the informative value of the indica-
tor, especially for the 1990s. Nevertheless, 
according to the indicator, the residential 
property price trend is broadly consistent 
with that of the transaction- based, quality- 
adjusted vdp price index for owner- 
occupied housing over the overlapping period. The indicator shows that residential 
property prices in Germany trended moder-
ately upwards in the second half of the 
1990s, whereas they more or less stagnated 
in some years during the fi  rst half of the 
2000s. Only as from 2010 did they gain 
considerable momentum.
From this point of view, residential property 
price growth can be approximated as a 
weighted average of price increases for resi-
dential buildings and residential building 
land, with the weights referring to the value 
shares of the respective component in total 
housing wealth.6 This also enables a price 
indicator for residential building land going 
back to 1993 to be derived. According to 
this sub- indicator, building land prices rose 
moderately in the second half of the 1990s, 
whereas they barely rose at all in the subse-
quent period up until around 2010. Over 
the past decade, they have picked up 
sharply. The indicator for building land 
prices has a profi  le similar to that of the 
transaction- based, quality- adjusted building 
land price index of the Federal Statistical Of-
fi  ce, which is available for the period from 
2000 onwards. This lends plausibility to the 
new price indicator for residential property 
in Germany.Building land prices

5 The advantage of performing the calculation using 
district- level data over aggregated data is that it min-
imises the impact on the total price of residential build-
ing land caused by time fl  uctuations in the regional 
shares of land transactions. Regional data on average 
purchase prices for residential building land missing for 
some years were added or statistically extrapolated 
using data provided by bulwiengesa AG or the state 
building and loan associations on purchase prices for 
residential building plots. This is also the case for the 
missing data on the residential building land area from 
the 1997 to 1999 and 2001 to 2003 periods, which 
have been linearly interpolated.

level with a benchmark that reflects the sus -
tainable price path. Since this reference value is 
an unobserved variable and calculating it in -
volves considerable uncertainty, it is preferable 
to use various approaches to assess develop -
ments in residential property prices.
Standard indicators for assessing residential 
property include the price- to- rent and price- to- 
income ratios, where the reference value is the 
indicator’s long-  run mean. This measure as -
sumes that, in the long run, there is a fixed rela -
tionship between house price developments 
and the trend in rents and incomes. While this 
measure is easy to construct and interpret, one 
drawback is that the reference value is time-  
invariant and that there is no scope to add fac -
tors. Moreover, the informative value of these 
indicators depends heavily on the period for 
which the mean is calculated. According to this 
approach, house price valuations in German 
towns and cities were exceedingly high last 
year. The price- to- rent ratio for apartments there deviated by between 20% and 25% from 
the respective long- run average since 1990, 
while it deviated by around 30% in the seven 
big cities.9 Looking at Germany as a whole, 
apartment prices were around 20% above the 
reference value as measured by developments 
in rents for new lettings last year. Looking at 
residential properties as a whole, too, income-  
based indicators show aggregate house price 
deviations to be close to the 20% mark in 2019.
A time- varying reference value can be calcu -
lated, for example, from the long- run relation -
ship of the error correction model. From an 
economic perspective, the specification of the 
long- run relationship can be interpreted as an 
equilibrium price- income ratio that is corrected 
for the interest rate effect. This approach is 
based on the notion that the sustainable finan -
cing of residential property purchases should Valuation

be consistent with income developments in the 
long run.
Particularly looking at mortgage lending rates 
for residential property, which have been ex -
tremely low for some time now, this approach 
raises the question of the extent to which they 
reflect a decline in their sustainable component 
and how much of the decline in interest rates is 
the result of cyclical factors. Given that estimat -
ing the long- run equilibrium interest rate in Ger -
many involves considerable uncertainty, a range 
is defined with the aid of two hypothetical as -
sumptions. First, it is assumed that the natural real interest rate for housing loans is the level it 
stood at in 2009 – i.e. before interest rates em -
barked on their multi- year decline. Under this 
assumption, the marked decline in the real 
lending rate since then is a temporary phenom -
enon. While there is indeed some evidence to 
suggest that the natural interest rate in ad -
vanced economies has come down over time, 
there are also signs that the return on fixed cap -
ital did not decline as much as the risk- free 
interest rate.10 Moreover, the actual real interest 
rate in Germany is estimated to have been only 
slightly below the natural real interest rate in 
2009.11 From around this point onwards, the 
decline in interest rates on loans for house pur -
chase in Germany was largely related to crisis 
management policies in the euro area. From 
this perspective, the interest rate level of 2009 
represents an approximation of the sustainable 
mortgage lending rate in Germany. Second, it is 
hypothetically assumed that the natural interest 
rate has equalled the actual interest rate since 
2009. That would lead to the assumption that 
the current level of mortgage lending rates is 
purely structural in nature. The two assump -

for the sustainable mortgage lending rate – and 
thus also, all other things being equal, for fun -
damental residential property prices.
If the actual, low interest rate level is used to 
determine the fundamental price, there were 
no substantial overvaluations in 2019. Assuming 
the higher figure – measured in 2009 – for the 
fundamental component of the mortgage lend -
ing rate, macroeconomic prices deviated by less 
than 10% from their fundamentally justified 
level. They are thus clearly below the value ac -
cording to the simple statistical indicators.
A third approach additionally considers that 
specific regional trends in the fundamental de -
terminants may also play a role. A panel model 
is used to calculate a fundamental property 
price at the level of German administrative dis -
tricts. In this case, too, scenario calculations are 
used to narrow down the contribution of mort -
gage lending rates to the fundamental price of 
real estate by establishing a range. Assuming 
that the sustainable component of the interest 
rate is at the comparatively high level it reached 
in 2009, the calculations show residential prop -
erty prices in Germany as a whole to be just 
over 20% above the level that appears justified 
by longer- term economic and demographic 
factors. If the current, low level of interest rates 
is used as a basis, the price level in Germany in 
2019 was, on the whole, just over 10% above 
its fundamentally justified level. Assuming a 
higher fundamental interest rate, residential 
property in the seven big cities was overvalued 
by around 30% in 2019; assuming a lower fun -
damental interest rate, it was almost 20% over -
valued. According to this approach, housing in 
urban areas overall was overvalued by between 
15% and 30%, depending on the underlying 
fundamental interest rate level. The results thus 
largely confirm the findings of the simple statis -
tical indicators; they are, however, higher than 
the results based on the estimated aggregate 
long- run equation.
Looking at the big picture in terms of the indi -
cator results and taking into account the con -siderable uncertainty that the valuation ap -
proaches are subject to, residential property 
was overvalued by up to 20% on a nationwide 
average in 2019. In urban regions, overvalu -
ation was greater. However, these results de -
pend on the calculation method and are also 
strongly influenced by the underlying assump -
tions regarding the natural level of lending 
rates. If the decline in interest rates in the 
period since 2010 is interpreted as a largely 
persistent phenomenon – i.e. the prevailing 
interest rate level is seen as being close to the 
equilibrium interest rate – price deviations 
would be smaller in the aggregate.

have a destabilising effect if they lead to price 
movements that are based solely on expect -
ations of further price increases – without ref -
erence to fundamentals. Data from the Bun -
desbank Online Pilot Survey on Consumer Ex -
pectations conducted in 2019 can be used to 
gauge the extent to which there are indications 
of destabilising speculative motives.13 By defin -
ition, this might be suspected if overvaluations 
are expected to increase in a region where 
prices already exceed their fundamentally justi -
fied levels.14 Households’ expectations regard -
ing the future valuation of residential property 
can be captured on the basis of the informa -
tion that they provide on the expected price-  
to- rent ratio of residential property in their 
vicinity.15 These data can be combined with the 
results for regional overvaluations.
According to the results of descriptive evalu -
ations, the surveyed households expected a 
trend decline in price- to- rent ratios in areas 
with overvaluations, as well as in regions with -
out overvaluations. In other words, they ex -
pected overvaluations to decline. This applies 
both to Germany as a whole and to the towns 
and cities category. Using the microdata in the 
survey information on expected developments 
in the price- to- rent ratio in additional regres -
sion analyses, it is possible to quantify the 
probability of excessively strong price develop -ments in the event that house prices have al -
ready exceeded their benchmark.16 The results 
can be interpreted as the probability of desta -
bilising price trends. According to the analysis, 
the estimated probabilities of price develop -
ments that are based purely on expectations 
are low on the whole and change only slightly 
as overvaluations increase. Overall, the analyses 
do not provide any evidence of destabilising 
price trends for residential property either for 
Germany as a whole or for the aggregate of 
towns and cities. The probability that price- to- 
rent ratios will continue to rise in the future as 
overvaluations grow approaches the 50% mark 
only in individual areas where valuations have 
so far been exceedingly high. If at all, the cal -
culations show only for individual major cities a 
certain risk that speculative price components 
were a factor in the past year.

there have been no signs of a slowdown as yet.

14 In the other case –  the normal case without self-  
reinforcing price deviations  – survey- based expectations 
would show the high valuation level coming down.
15 Further evaluations of the survey data show that re -
spondents’ valuation data are positively and statistically sig -
nificantly correlated with expert estimates of the price-  to- 
rent ratio in their region as well as with the regional price 
deviations as per the panel model.

crease in the price- to- rent ratio expected) or 1 (increase in 
the price- to- rent ratio expected). Furthermore, the influ -
ence of the explanatory variables is transformed by means 
of a logistic function, which means that the estimated val -
ues of the binary dependent variable lie in the range from 
0 to 1. In addition, the influence of control variables is

year in which, as expected, price dynamics in 
the housing market had eased somewhat. In 
the seven big cities, the rate of price increase 
rose somewhat in the second quarter, at 4.6% 
on the year, according to vdp data, but was 
– like the annual average for 2019 – already 
much lower than in the preceding years. Ac -
cording to the house price index compiled by 
the Federal Statistical Office, the rise in house 
prices in the second quarter, at 6.6%, was 
somewhat greater than in the previous year.
There have so far been no major supply- side 
disruptions. Although the number of building 
permits was more or less stagnant at the be -
ginning of the pandemic in Germany, there 
was already a marked increase again in May, 
and in the period from March to the end of 
August the number of building permits was 
higher than in the same period of the previous 
year.17 In the period under review, new orders 
in housing construction returned to close to 
their pre- crisis levels following a slump in March 
and April caused by the pandemic.
Although financing conditions remain exceed -
ingly favourable, the affordability of credit-  
financed purchases of residential property is 
likely to have deteriorated on average given the 
ongoing upward pressure on prices. House -
holds’ disposable income stagnated in the 
second quarter, and the general uncertainty is 
high. Demand for housing could consequently 
ease off – at least temporarily.18 However, if 
prospective buyers believe that their income 
prospects are only temporarily lower, demand 
for housing will probably be dampened only 
marginally. Moreover, residential real estate is 
likely to remain an attractive investment option 
in the low interest rate environment.No disruption to

Conclusion
Looking at the economy as a whole, rising 
prices in the residential property market over 
the past few years have probably largely re -
flected developments in housing supply and 
demand. Additional housing construction did 
little to dampen the demand- driven pressure 
on prices, partly because it caused a sharp rise 
in the price of construction work. Land prices, 
whose contribution to house price inflation has 
risen significantly in recent years, appreciated 
even more sharply. As this, in particular, tends 
to reflect a property’s asset value, the risk 
of  price exaggerations in residential property 
also increased. Considerable overvaluations 
emerged, especially in urban areas, while some 
price deviations to the upside were also ob -
served at the aggregate level. However, further 
calculations provide little indication that house 
price developments –  both in the aggregate and in town and cities – were based to a sig -
nificant extent on destabilising, purely specula -
tive motives.
Overall, the price structure in the German hous -
ing market in 2019 can therefore be regarded 
as robust to pronounced changes in the macro -
economic environment. This is consistent with 
the fact that the pandemic has so far left little 
mark on the housing market. However, the 
macroeconomic environment is now much 
more fragile than before. In particular, the 
combination of an as yet unabated expansion 
of housing supply and weaker demand mean 
that price dynamics could, in the event of add -
itional turbulence, moderate more rapidly, and 
to a greater extent, than previously suggested. 
That said, there are no signs of an abrupt cor -
rection in house prices, provided that there is 
no serious disruption to the ongoing macro -
economic recovery.Rising prices in

State government budgets: results for 2019
The coronavirus crisis is weighing heavily on government budgets this year. The same applies to 
the governments of Germany’s federal states. Following in the steps of central government, the 
states have likewise activated the escape clause in their debt brakes, rendering them exempt from 
consolidation for the time being. This enables the states to contribute to macroeconomic stabil -
isation. At present, it is not yet possible to make a reliable assessment of what fiscal policy action 
will be needed when the crisis subsides.
Every autumn, the Bundesbank publishes a detailed report on the results of state government 
finances from the previous year. To ensure that the picture is even more comprehensive, the 
analysis also includes local governments and off- budget entities. The data are specifically pre -
pared to aid interpretation and comparability between the states as far as possible. This analysis 
covers the pre- crisis year 2019.
Looking back, the financial situation has been very favourable overall and thus constituted a 
good starting point from which to tackle the crisis. The states recorded a total surplus of €10 bil -
lion in their core budgets. Including off-  budget entities and local governments, the structural 
surplus (adjusted for cyclical effects, amongst other things) amounted to €17 billion.
Every federal state recorded a structural surplus. That said, there was still considerable heterogen -
eity, although the range had narrowed somewhat compared with the previous year. Interest 
expenditure was one of the causes of this development. A further fall in average rates of interest 
moderated the impact of the large differences in debt levels.
The states also used their surpluses to top up reserves. These special funds – some of which are 
well stocked – are earmarked to finance future investment, amongst other things. Once the 
escape clauses are no longer active and the debt brakes require the reduction of remaining fiscal 
gaps, greater use will be able to be made of these reserves. This can allow more time before 
actual consolidation is required. The fact that the federal states have, in some cases, designed 
their debt brakes very differently can also have a bearing on future consolidation requirements 
– for example, if this largely or even completely precludes cyclically- induced new borrowing.
Analyses and comparisons of state government finances based on financial statistics data alone 
are still meaningful to just a limited extent. Overviews of each state’s debt brake requirements are 
also lacking. This impairs transparency and makes it more difficult to monitor national budgets, 
which, in Germany, is the responsibility of the Stability Council. The Stability Council continues to 
be tasked with working towards establishing appropriate statistical data and information on 
planning and debt brakes. Having timely information not only on core budgets but also on the 
major off- budget entities would also be helpful. A sound data base will be even more important 
in future. Budgetary surveillance is likely to become much more challenging than in the past few 
years, when fiscal conditions were very positive.Deutsche Bundesbank

State government fiscal data
The Bundesbank’s Monthly Report discusses 
the performance of state governments’ core 
budgets every three months (in February, May, 
August and November). The preliminary result 
of the previous year is outlined in the following 
February. At this point, however, important 
data are still outstanding. In particular, data on 
closing entries as well as off-  budget entities 
and local governments, which are ultimately 
attributable to the individual states, are only 
available at a later date. For the past two years, 
the Bundesbank has therefore also prepared 
and analysed data on financial developments for comparative purposes in autumn. The Sta -
bility Council, which is responsible for budget -
ary surveillance in Germany, limits its compari -
sons of the federal states to much more nar -
rowly defined data.
The financial situation of the federal states will 
deteriorate dramatically this year as a result of 
the coronavirus crisis. This review looks at the 
good starting position last year but also points 
to the challenges that already existed at that 
time.
Federal states as a whole
Last year, state government budgets, including 
their off- budget entities and local govern -
ments, recorded a high surplus of just over €22 
billion (0.6% of gross domestic product (GDP)). 
In 2018, the surplus was larger still – by a little 
more than €7 billion (see the adjacent table, 
item 1, and chart).1 The core budgets alone 
closed 2019 with a surplus of €10 billion. In 
addition, off- budget entities accounted for just 
under €7 billion and local governments for just 
under €6 billion.2
The structural surplus, which indicates the 
underlying budgetary position, amounted to 
€17 billion. It was lower than the unadjusted 
balance due to the elimination of a positive 
cyclical effect amounting to €11 billion (see Regular compre -

a special fund using €1 billion from its core budget (credit- 
based pre- financing before the debt brake enters into 
force). Lower Saxony transferred €1½ billion of credit-  
financed funds from a new off- budget entity, in particular 
for the capital contribution to NordLB. This means that the 
off- budget entities’ surplus is €½ billion lower than in the 
financial statistics.Deutsche Bundesbank

Preparing state government data and remaining data gaps
Procedure and methodology1
Financial statistics data serve as the under-
lying dataset; the national accounts, which 
play a key role in European fi  scal surveil-
lance, do not feature any data on the indi-
vidual federal states. Alongside state gov-
ernments’ core budgets, the present analy-
sis also takes into account off- budget en-
tities and local government data. This 
allows a much more meaningful picture to 
be produced:
– Off- budget entities belong to the gov-
ernment sector in the national accounts. 
They play a major role in some cases.
– Local governments are not only subdiv-
isions of the federal states in terms of 
constitutional law: the way in which 
tasks are distributed between the state 
government and local government levels 
varies from state to state. Factoring in 
the local government level increases 
comparability. In addition, this allows the 
non- city states to be compared more ef-
fectively with the city states, which al-
ways include the local government level. 
As the city states have considerably 
higher fi  nancial requirements, a factor 
that is also refl  ected in the state govern-
ment revenue- sharing scheme, the com-
parability of population- based variables 
remains limited.
In order to improve the comparability of in-
dicators both among federal states as well 
as over time, the data are processed further. 
This allows structural budget outturns to be 
depicted in a better way:
– Financial transactions reported in the fi  -
nancial statistics that affect the fi  scal bal-ance are excluded. Such transactions 
often have a strong impact on fi  scal bal-
ances in the fi  nancial statistics, but, in 
principle, only reallocate fi  nancial assets. 
For example, when a loan is granted, re-
ceivables increase by the amount of the 
corresponding expenditure – as a result, 
net fi  nancial assets remain unchanged. 
The fi  nancial statistics, however, will 
show a defi  cit, as they do not take ac-
count of the acquisition of assets but 
only the cash fl  ows on the expenditure 
side. To this extent, the procedure se-
lected here (exclusion of fi  nancial trans-
actions) follows the basic approach of 
the national accounts.
– In order to depict the state government 
revenue- sharing scheme on an accruals 
basis, lagged settlement payments are 
taken into account: for the reporting 
year, the cash fi  gures are adjusted to in-
clude the provisional settlement pay-
ments for the previous year and the re-
porting year. These comprise transac-
tions between the state governments, 
but also payments between state gov-
ernments and central government.
– Temporary cyclical factors obfuscate the 
underlying position and are therefore 
factored out of the calculations using the 
Bundesbank’s cyclical adjustment pro-
cedure for government budgets. The re-
sults are based on the forecast published 
in June of this year.
– Finally, the results are adjusted for major 
one- off effects. The relevant fi  gures for 
the states’ core budgets are obtained

lished by the Federal Ministry of Finance.

Remaining shortcomings in the dataset 
and areas for improvement
Yet, for all these adjustments, it is still hard 
to interpret the data in places. Over the 
course of recent years, it has become in-
creasingly diffi   cult to assess the situation, 
particularly as signifi  cant reserves have been 
built up in some cases. The extent to which 
these can be used to close possible budget 
gaps in future cannot be derived from the 
fi  gures in the fi  nancial statistics. For the 
intra- year observations, matters are compli-
cated by the fact that fi  gures on key en-
tities, such as the new special funds bund-
ling all coronavirus- related costs, are only 
available with considerable lags. Monthly 
data would be desirable here. The informa-
tive value of annual data would increase 
signifi  cantly if payments between govern-
ment entities were immediately factored 
out of the respective category. Otherwise, 
fi  gures on revenue from fees and service 
purchases, for example, lose a considerable 
portion of their informative value as the 
number of off- budget entities rises. Further-
more, in several cases, government tasks 
are being performed by non- governmental 
institutions with their own sources of rev-
enue. As a result, the data on revenue and 
expenditure only cover a portion of the ac-
tivities commissioned by general govern-
ment, and the fi  nancial statistics report 
grants rather than personnel and other op-
erating expenditure. Timely fi  gures from 
state governments, local governments and 
off- budget entities on revenue and expend-
iture categories broken down by area of ac-
tivity could provide much needed informa-tion in this context. Such fi  gures have been 
newly added to the Federal Statistical Of-
fi  ce’s publication programme. However, the 
current fi  gures only extend to 2012.
Even with these kinds of adjustments and 
supplementary information, the fi  nancial 
statistics remain limited as a coordinated re-
porting system on government budgets. For 
instance, the fi  nancial data do not allow 
any direct conclusions to be drawn with re-
gard to the results accomplished by the 
payments. It would be desirable to agree 
upon suitable indicators for important ob-
jectives, which would improve the compar-
ability of developments at the state govern-
ment level. A number of different areas of 
responsibility would be ideal candidates for 
this. The values of meaningful indicators for 
educational attainment as well as for needs- 
based availability and quality of childcare 
facilities should be captured and published 
on appropriate reporting dates. Indicators 
for transport and digital infrastructure could 
also provide useful information. The bene-
fi  ts of federalism could be realised more 
readily if the experiences of each federal 
state are reported transparently and then 
used as a basis for learning how to better 
achieve objectives. This would make it eas-
ier to utilise limited public funds as effect-
ively and effi   ciently as possible.Deutsche Bundesbank

item 5 in the table).3 The opposite effect, par -
ticularly as a result of adjusting for financial 
transactions,4 (see items 2 to 4 in the table) 
was considerably smaller.5
The federal states’ finances were thus still in 
very good shape. However, the fiscal stance 
had already been eased significantly in the pre -
vious year. This is reflected in the fact that the 
structural primary surplus (the structural bal -
ance adjusted for net interest expenditure) fell 
by €8 billion (see items 7 to 9 in the table).
Individual federal states
The results of the individual federal states are 
presented below. They show that, last year, not 
only the federal states as a whole but almost all 
of the states individually recorded significant 
structural surpluses. In Saarland, the structural 
balance was only slightly positive.6 As in the 
previous year, Hamburg posted by far the high -
est surplus.
It is to be welcomed that the population- based 
range of structural budgetary positions has nar -
rowed over the past year. It still amounted to 
just over €700 (2018: €1,100). While structural 
surpluses fell in most federal states, increases 
were recorded, particularly in states that had 
been in relatively unfavourable positions be -
fore. This applies, for example, to Bremen, 
which had still recorded the poorest result in 
the previous year, but also to Lower Saxony, 
North Rhine-  Westphalia and Hesse. As was the 
case last year, Hamburg posted the highest 
structural surplus; however, this was also the 
surplus that fell by the largest amount (see the 
table on pp. 96 f., item 7).Fiscal stance 
eased markedly

3 Background information: Compared with the previous re -
port, estimates of the cyclical effect in recent years are now 
more favourable (and estimates of the structural situation 
are accordingly less favourable). The reason for this is the 
coronavirus crisis; as a result of the pandemic, the trend in 
the GDP path – which was recalculated using a filtering 
method, including retroactively – was revised significantly 
downward. GDP in 2018, too, is now thus further above 
the trend, indicating a greater positive cyclical effect on the 
economy (in the cyclical adjustment procedure used).
4 Background information: As of 2019, the financial statis -
tics no longer record claims from guarantees as loans but 
as grants. They are therefore no longer classified as finan -
cial transactions and are no longer deducted, which means 
that, to this extent, the adjusted balance is less favourable 
than in the years up to 2019. However, this break probably 
does not have a significant impact on the interpretation of 
structural changes compared with 2018. Using this ap -
proach would likewise mean that the extensive payment 
made to HSH Nordbank in this regard in 2018 would not 
be included in the structural balance; it would merely be 
deducted as a one- off effect instead of as a financial trans -
action. See also Deutsche Bundesbank (2019a), p. 44.
5 Background information: The exclusion of one-off effects 
did not change the result for the federal states as a whole 
on balance. On the one hand, Baden-  Württemberg re -
ceived revenue totalling €1½ billion stemming from fines 
issued to car manufacturers in relation to the diesel scan -
dal. On the other hand, Lower Saxony paid out capital con -
tributions of €1½ billion in the course of rescuing NordLB. 
It is unclear how this will be recorded in the financial stat -
istics as they do not yet include this off- budget entity. The 
transaction was deducted here as a one- off effect. In the 
previous year, Bavaria and Lower Saxony combined re -
ceived a similar amount of one- off revenue from such fines 
as Baden-  Württemberg did in 2019.
6 Background information: In both Saarland and Bremen, 
the structural balance would have been clearly negative 
without the last full payment of consolidation assistance 
from central government, which was made in 2019. How -
ever, the new budgetary recovery assistance that the two 
states will receive starting in 2020 will be somewhat higher 
still in the coming years.Deutsche Bundesbank

The different developments can be traced back to 
various causes. In Hamburg, for example, ad -
justed7 total expenditure rose sharply (see the 
table on pp. 96 f., item 16). This was due, in par -
ticular, to personnel expenditure and other oper -
ating expenditure (see the table on pp. 96 f., items 
11 and 12). The largest increase in the number of 
staff was in Hamburg (see the table on pp. 96 f., 
item 27), and supplementary provisions appear to 
have been made, partly due to the wage agree -
ment. At the same time, growth in adjusted total 
revenue was below average despite relatively 
steep growth in tax revenue (see the table on 
pp. 96 f., items 18 and 21). In Bremen, by con -
trast, adjusted total revenue still rose somewhat 
more strongly than adjusted total expenditure.
Interest burdens
Before the debt brake entered into force, indi -
vidual federal states were able to determine 
their own net borrowing for investment pur -poses. They were able to breach this limit rela -
tively easily without incurring repayment obli -
gations. As a result, the (per capita) debt levels 
among the states are very different – irrespect -
ive of the extensive multi- year special transfers 
in connection with particularly high debt levels. 
For example, at the end of 2019, Bremen’s 
debt exceeded the population- weighted state 
average by just over four times (see the table 
on pp. 92 f., item 22, and the adjacent chart). 
Hamburg and Saarland also recorded signifi -
cantly above average figures, while Bavaria and 
Saxony were at the lower end. Interest expend -
iture resulting from debt (see the table on 
pp.  92 f., item 13) varied from state to state 
broadly in line with debt levels.
Debt fell in most federal states in 2019 (see the 
table on pp. 96 f., item 22). However, consider -
able rises were recorded in some states, most 
notably in Bremen. It appears that Bremen had 
concluded forward transactions in the past to 
secure interest rate conditions. Consequently, 
the city state then had to finance the necessary 
collateral.8 The rise in debt in Saxony-  Anhalt re -
sulted partly from financing a capital contribu -
tion to NordLB. In Brandenburg, loans were 
taken out to finance a special fund.9Example:

7 Background information: Here, total revenue and total 
expenditure are adjusted for financial transactions as well 
as one- off effects and payments made under the state gov -
ernment revenue- sharing scheme. Cyclical effects and pay -
ments made under the state government revenue- sharing 
scheme concerning other reporting years are neutralised 
on the revenue side (see the table on pp. 92 f., items 16 
and 21).
8 See Federal Statistical Office (2020). Background infor -
mation: In the case of forward transactions, collateral is 
generally required to secure the claims arising from the 
contracts. However, the provision or receipt of collateral is 
not reported as expenditure or revenue that would affect 
the budget. If current interest rates deviate from the agreed 
rates and the market value of the derivative changes as a 
result, the collateral requirements are adjusted accordingly. 
The rise in debt in Bremen resulted from higher cash ad -
vances. Cash advances may indicate that collateral has 
been provided or received. Collateral received increases 
cash balances. However, as it is repayable, a cash advance 
is also recorded in the corresponding amount. Collateral to 
be provided is often financed using cash advances. This, 
however, entails a claim on the collateral taker in the 
amount of the collateral provided. In this way, collateral

Despite differing levels of debt, the risk pre -
miums for borrowing do not vary widely from 
state to state. The capital markets appear to 
generally assume high creditworthiness and, if 
in doubt, that assistance would be provided by 
the German state as a whole. Nevertheless, the 
calculated average rates of interest that the 
states pay for their debt differ (see the table on 
pp. 92 f., item 23). Ultimately, this is due chiefly 
to the debt structure. For instance, there are 
differences in interest rate fixation periods and 
the percentage of loans that were taken out 
during years when interest rates were higher. 
Interest rate hedging operations are also likely 
to contribute to the variance. At 3%, Bremen 
recorded the highest average rates of interest. 
Schleswig- Holstein stood at the other end of 
the scale with rates of 1½%. In 2019, the aver -
age rate of interest still recorded a further fall 
of just over 0.1 percentage point across Ger -
many as a whole.10 Low interest rates are ex -
pected to continue to significantly dampen ex -
penditure, especially for highly indebted states.
For a more comprehensive picture, account 
needs to be taken of interest income from fi -
nancial assets alongside interest expenditure 
on debt. Netting both items (to calculate net 
interest) results in the per capita range between 
the federal states decreasing from €1,000 to 
€820 (see the table on pp. 92 f., item 8, and 
the adjacent chart). Bavaria and Saxony both 
posted slightly negative net interest burdens, 
meaning that their interest income was some -
what higher than their interest expenditure. By 
contrast, in spite of high revenues, Bremen had 
the heaviest net interest burden, and was fol -
lowed some way behind by Saarland and Ham -
burg.
The structural primary balance shows the bal -
ance minus any existing (net) debt burden (see 
the table on pp. 92 f., item 9, and the chart on 
p. 98). In these terms, Hamburg recorded the 
highest surplus, closely followed by Bremen. 
Hamburg and Bremen adopted a more ambi -
tious stance in the remaining areas of their 
budgets, evidently partly in response to their high interest burdens. The opposite was true 
for federal states with low interest burdens: 
Bavaria and Saxony used their low interest ex -
penditure to pad out their budget more gener -
ously in other areas (low structural primary sur -
pluses).
The very low interest rates will also make it eas -
ier to manage the current crisis. The high level 
of borrowing to be expected can probably ini -
tially be financed without incurring a significant 
interest burden. However, while interest rates 
do not look set to see a turnaround in the short 
term and the average interest rate is likely to 
fall further to begin with, it should not be as -
sumed that today’s extremely low rates will 
persist over the long term.Average rate of

Relying on the information at hand, there are 
limits to how far it is possible to assess the way 
different interest rate paths impact state gov -
ernment finances – whether they act as a 
source of risk or offer potential for relief. Ac -
cess to supplementary details concerning the 
debt structure of each federal state would 
therefore be a desirable addition. Alongside the 
residual maturities of any outstanding debt 
amounts, data on the average interest rate of 
debt maturing in a given year as well as on any 
hedging with derivatives would be needed. De -
rivative interest rate hedges prove particularly 
problematic in the interpretation of debt statis -
tics, too (see footnote 8 for more information 
on their potential effects). It then becomes al -
most impossible to interpret the outstanding 
cash advances without explanatory notes. 
Drawing a distinction with conventional cash 
advances used to finance expenditure in the 
short term would be helpful for budget analysis 
purposes.Selected other expenditure 
categories
Personnel expenditure represents the largest 
spending category for all federal states (see the 
chart on p. 99 and the table on pp. 92 f., item 
11). Looking at the non- city states’ expenditure 
for current staff (see the table on pp. 92 f., item 
11a), there was a spread of almost €430 be -
tween the highest spender, Brandenburg, and 
the lowest, Schleswig- Holstein. Besides staffing 
levels (see the chart on p. 100 and the table on 
pp. 92 f., item 27), state- specific salaries (see 
the table on pp. 92 f., item 29) are a key factor 
behind the differences. The city states had sig -
nificantly higher numbers of staff and, as a re -
sult, higher personnel expenditure.11 However, 
the figures have to be interpreted with caution. 
A low number of staff does not necessarily in -
dicate that tasks are being performed in a cost- 
effective manner, for instance. Instead of public 
sector staff, these services could be being pro -
vided by non- governmental institutions, which 
may then be receiving government grants. In 
these cases, lower personnel and operating 
costs will be recorded in the government sector 
and, on the revenue side, usage fees can be 
collected directly from the non- governmental 
institutions concerned (see the section on rev -
enue from fees below).
Among the non- city states, expenditure on civil 
service pension benefits exhibited a similar 
spread as expenditure for current staff (see the 
table on pp.  92 f., item 11b). Given that the 
eastern federal states have no civil service staff 
of their own from the period prior to German 
reunification, they have far fewer recipients of 
civil service pension benefits (see the table on 
pp. 92 f., item 28, and the chart on p. 100). 
However, since reunification, they have em -
ployed comparatively high numbers of staff on 
salaried contracts rather than as civil servants, Information on

entailing fewer pension obligations.12 Saxony 
posted the lowest expenditure while, among 
the non- city states in western Germany, Saar -
land recorded the highest. This was due not 
least to the state experiencing population de -
cline over a number of years. Looking at the 
city states as well, pension expenditure in Ham -
burg was by far the highest.
Social benefits are the prime component of 
transfers to households (see the table on 
pp. 92 f., item 14). For this item, there was like -
wise strong variation between the states. Ex -
penditure was at its lowest in Saarland and 
Saxony-  Anhalt, with particularities in account -
ing methods playing a role.13 That said, even if 
those two states are discounted, the range in 
figures remains considerable: per capita ex -
penditure in North Rhine-  Westphalia was €400 
higher than in Baden-  Württemberg. Again, 
though, the data should be interpreted with 
caution, since they do not reflect the net bur -
den on each state. Central government par -
tially compensates the federal states (or – indir -
ectly – the local governments) for various social 
benefits, such as accommodation costs for re -
cipients of unemployment benefit II. Different 
reimbursement rates apply for different federal 
states because central government wished to 
secure specific levels of relief when unemploy -
ment assistance was abolished in 2005. In the 
case of the basic allowance for the elderly and 
for persons with reduced earning capacity, cen -
tral government even reimburses the transfers 
in full. As a result, a federal state’s net burden 
will be contingent, not least, on how the rele -
vant transfers are structured.
Particularly pronounced differences are appar -
ent when examining fixed asset formation (see 
the chart on p. 100 and the table on pp. 92 f., 
item 15). Bavaria reported by far the highest 
figures, while the lowest among the non- city 
states came from Saarland and North Rhine-  
Westphalia. Despite high additional revenue 
stemming from the state government revenue- 
sharing scheme, fixed asset formation in the 
city states of Berlin and especially Bremen also remained significantly below the national refer -
ence figure. However, the differing degree of 
outsourcing to non- governmental entities 
makes for limited informative value in this cat -
egory, too. Berlin, for instance, assigned school 
building work to a state-  owned housing con -
struction company. Since then, the correspond -
ing investment no longer appears as state gov -Broad span for

12 Background information: The pension costs reported in 
the eastern states and Berlin (eastern part) also include the 
federal states’ payments of around €200 per capita to cen -
tral government for special and supplementary pension 
payments made to former government employees up to 
1990.
13 Background information: In Saxony-  Anhalt (and appar -
ently Saarland, too), some social benefits are recorded as 
other operating expenditure. Accordingly, its figure for that 
expenditure item was the highest out of all the non- city 
states. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2019a), p.  55. There 
were also sizeable differences between the non- city states 
when it came to other operating expenditure. It is likely 
that non-  consolidated intra-  state service purchases play a 
role in rendering comparison considerably more difficult 
here.Deutsche Bundesbank

ernment expenditure.14 In any case, it is ultim -
ately not the level of investment expenditure 
which is the decisive factor. Rather, it is a case 
of evaluating whether public infrastructure is in 
line with current and foreseeable future needs 
and thus does not present a hurdle to the loca -
tion’s development. There are no robust data 
aggregated at state level on this, however.
Selected revenue categories
The state government revenue- sharing scheme 
is designed to limit differences in tax revenue 
between the federal states.15 Accordingly, the 
scheme leads to a reduction of around three-  
fifths in the range of tax revenue figures (be -
fore distribution of turnover tax receipts) re -
ported by the non- city states. Nevertheless, 
there are still significant differences in final tax 
revenue16 (range of €670 across non- city states 
and of €2,450 if city states are included, see 
also the table on pp. 92 f., item 18, and the 
chart on p. 101). Hesse exceeded the reference 
figure for the non- city states by 6½%, which 
was partly due to its above average real estate 
acquisition tax and high multipliers for local 
government taxes. Under the approach applied 
for the revenue- sharing scheme (where this is 
factored out), the corresponding figure was 
4½%. Calculated in these terms, Bavaria over -
shot Hesse by a further 2 percentage points. In 
Saxony, actual tax revenue was 7% lower than Strong conver -

Calculated for the purposes of the revenue-  
sharing scheme (i.e. adjusted, in particular, for 
Saxony’s low real estate acquisition tax), it fell 
just 1½% short, however.
Revenue from fees (see the table on pp. 92 f., 
item 19) differed to an even greater extent 
from state to state. This was due to Hamburg’s 
extremely high revenues, which were more 
than three times the national reference fig -
ure.18 Irrespective of this, higher fee revenue is 
not necessarily evidence that the general public 
is under a greater burden. Public services sub -
ject to fees may be outsourced out of the gov -
ernment sector to varying extents. One ex -
ample would be independently operated or 
privately run childcare facilities. In such cases, 
the corresponding revenue will then be ex -
cluded from the financial statistics in the same 
way that the personnel and operating costs as -
sociated with the service will not be captured. 
Government grants to offset shortfalls of rev -
enue over expenditure are recorded as trans -
fers. It is not possible to estimate the impact of 
outsourcing on the individual categories in a 
reliable manner.
Concluding remarks
Tackling the coronavirus crisis is currently the 
focal point for fiscal policy. Like central govern -
ment, all federal states are seeking to suspend 
the credit limit imposed under the debt brake. 
To this end, they are activating the escape 
clauses enshrined in state law, a move which 
appears justified in the light of the pandemic 
and its ramifications. Doing so means that the 
federal states can not only allow pandemic-  
induced burdens to pass through to the budget, 
but are also in a position to finance assistance 
measures by raising new debt. For example, 
they are participating in various tax relief meas -
ures, often granting transfers of their own to 
the corporate sector, compensating for losses 
of income resulting from provisions under the 
Protection against Infection Act (Infektions -schutzgesetz ) and purchasing personal protect -
ive equipment (PPE). Furthermore, state gov -
ernments are frequently using the escape 
clause to stabilise their local governments’ 
budgets, making it easier –  amongst other Broad spread

The future requirements of state- specifi  c debt brakes 
on state governments’ budgets
Recourse to debt brake escape clauses 
in 2020
As of 2020, the debt brake enshrined in 
Germany’s Basic Law applies to state gov-
ernments in full. In principle, this means 
they are prohibited from structural net bor-
rowing. Due to the coronavirus crisis, how-
ever, every federal state has been planning 
to make use of the escape clause in their 
state- specifi  c debt brake. Like central gov-
ernment, many federal states still aim to 
have these extended credit facilities next 
year, too.
Different future challenges
If the escape clauses cease to apply further 
down the line, each state will face different 
requirements. This is due to the following 
factors in particular:
– The federal states’ structural budget pos-
itions varied strongly even before the cri-
sis. This will also have an impact on any 
future need for action.
– Different levels of provisions formed in 
previous years (e.g. reserves) make it 
possible to spread future consolidation 
over a longer period.
– The debt brakes normally allow tempor-
ary cyclical burdens to be fi  nanced 
through new debt. The cyclical adjust-
ment procedures used and the borrow-
ing entitlement options derived from 
these vary considerably in some cases.
– The rules also sometimes differ signifi  -
cantly beyond just cyclical adjustment, 
such as regarding the inclusion of fi  nan-
cial transactions. In addition, there are 
various ways in which budgetary imple-
mentation may deviate from the regular limits. Borrowing leeway when imple-
menting a budget (especially supplemen-
tary budgets) means that fewer buffers 
have to be included within the budget, 
thereby allowing a correspondingly 
looser stance to be taken.
– Different levels of new debt based on 
the escape clause will result in different 
repayment burdens after the crisis. Re-
payment periods of different lengths are 
also planned.
Selected aspects of this are examined below 
in closer detail.
Different cyclical adjustment procedures
Under the debt brake, federal states are 
permitted to exclude cyclical infl  uences on 
their budgets. This makes borrowing pos-
sible in tougher times, while requiring ap-
propriate repayments when the economic 
situation is favourable. The procedures 
chosen by the federal states to adjust for 
cyclical infl  uences are very different and 
partly complex.1
For federal states, cyclical effects mainly af-
fect tax revenue.2 The procedures are div-
ided into three basic types (with variations 
occurring within these groups):
– Some procedures refer to the overall 
economic development expected by 
central government in relation to the es-
timated potential output (“potential out-
put method”). The calculated cyclical 
1 For more detailed information on this, see Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2017).
2 The aggregate revenue to be taken into account 
consists primarily of tax revenue after state govern-
ment revenue- sharing and of general supplementary 
central government grants. Hence, state- specifi  c cyc-
lical effects are largely offset.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
October 2020  
102

overutilisation or underutilisation is used 
to derive the cyclical impact on taxes. 
New estimates are to be included in the 
draft budgets and thus early on in many 
cases.
– Other procedures calculate deviations in 
tax revenue from its projected trend de-
rived from past years (“tax trend 
method”). This approach allows the fi  -
nancial impact of legislative changes to 
be fi  ltered out. These procedures gener-
ally permit a time adjustment of consoli-
dation efforts in the event of shortfalls in 
tax revenue.
– Other procedures are based on the level 
(and not the trend) of tax revenue in re-
cent years. They only rarely allow a dis-
tinct increase in new debt (“tax level 
method”).Looking at 2019 illustrates clearly how 
widely the range of results from cyclical ad-
justment procedures can span (see the table 
below, column 5). In Bremen, for example, 
cyclical new debt of €10 (in each case, per 
capita) would have conformed with the 
rules, whilst in Saxony taxes were €430 
higher than the calculated “normal value”, 
and in Baden- Württemberg €310 higher. 
Bavaria completely refrains from taking into 
account cyclical infl  uences, and net borrow-
ing is not permitted even in a severe eco-
nomic downturn (meaning that no corres-
ponding surpluses are needed to make re-
payments in good times).
Although these fi  gures for 2019 do not in-
dicate the future fi  scal challenges facing in-
dividual federal states once their escape 
clause expires, it is clear that, depending on 
the cyclical adjustment procedure, very dif-
ferent requirements may emerge in order to

comply with the debt brake. Tax trend 
methods can tend to extend consolidation 
requirements and initially permit larger net 
borrowing. That said, this does pose the 
risk that debt will continue to build up. Po-
tential output methods, too, would allow 
cyclical debt in the medium term (coming 
to an end by 2024). In this case, however, 
there are constantly new estimations of 
how structural revenue is developing. By 
contrast, tax level methods are likely to 
allow a rather limited scope for cyclically in-
duced debt.
Provisions available from better times
If repayment obligations become effective 
or if structural budget gaps are planned to 
be closed gradually after the escape clause 
runs out, reserves can be used here, if avail-
able. In previous fi  scally favourable times, 
the federal states formed provisions, which 
are extensive in some cases. States with lit-
tle or no new borrowing options from cyc-
lical adjustment may need to draw on these 
reserves to a greater extent in the coming 
years.
These provisions can be structured in differ-
ent ways. Some federal states formed re-
serves, for example, from unused borrow-
ing authorisations and surpluses in recent 
years (when the debt brake had not yet 
fully entered into force). The amounts re-
corded as reserves differ considerably (see 
the summary table on p. 103, columns 2 
and 3). For example, the reported per cap-
ita reserves available for balancing budgets 
ranged from just over €80 in Saarland to 
just over €960 in Mecklenburg- West Pom-
erania (by comparison, central govern-
ment’s general reserve comprised around 
€580 per capita at the end of 2019). This 
corresponds to between around 2% and 
20% of the tax revenue generated last year 
by these federal states (including their local 
governments).Furthermore, special funds primarily de-
signed to fi  nance future investment were 
often topped up.3 Existing borrowing facil-
ities under the old debt limits were also 
used to fi  ll these funds. Brandenburg, for 
example, passed a supplementary budget 
at the end of 2019 borrowing around €400 
per capita to set up an investment reserve 
as a special fund. Saarland and Bremen, 
which received considerable consolidation 
assistance, also fi  lled up these types of 
funds. This created temporary scope to im-
plement investment projects under the debt 
brake in case of a tight budget situation, 
thereby easing the overall burden on the 
budget. Investment- oriented provisioning 
differs signifi  cantly from state to state (see 
the table on p.  103, column 4): this re-
mained very limited in Baden- Württemberg 
and Rhineland- Palatinate according to the 
reports received. By contrast, provisioning 
was particularly extensive in Berlin and Sax-
ony. The state of Berlin had invested rela-
tively little over many years.
Repayment plans
At present, it is not yet possible to reliably 
estimate the level of debt that the federal 
states will incur due to the escape clause. 
This year’s borrowing authorisations4 
amount to somewhere in the region of 
€120 billion (more than €1,400 per capita). 
As with central government, a repayment 
plan must be drawn up for planned extraor-
dinary debt, and the funds for this are to be 
generated within the regular debt brake 
limit.
The repayment plans adopted so far vary 
widely. In Hesse, repayment is already 
scheduled to begin as early as 2021. Most 
federal states, however, only want to com-

special funds. They are not considered here, however, 
owing to their planned use over many years.

budgets in 2020. Borrowing authorisations to fi  nance 
special funds cover all years.Deutsche Bundesbank

mence their repayments after allowing 
slightly more time to pass after the current 
coronavirus crisis. In some federal states, 
the repayment periods are then limited to 
just a few years, meaning that they are 
quite narrow. Saxony- Anhalt, for example, 
envisages only three years to repay its 
coronavirus- related debt (given its relatively 
limited borrowing authorisations). By con-
trast, other states are extending the repay-
ment period considerably. The longest re-
payment phase compared to other federal 
states, lasting 50 years, was adopted by 
North Rhine- Westphalia. The unweighted 
state average is close to 25 years, which is 
higher than central government’s repay-
ment horizon.
The widespread prohibition of new debt in 
state budgets is a fairly strict rule. If the 
debt leveraged under the escape clause is 
reduced evenly and reliably, longer periods 
of time for its repayment do not appear to 
be a concern either. However, a very long 
period gives rise to especially large uncer-
tainties, and it might give the impression 
that simply postponing burdens is the 
underlying intention. In this respect, a very 
long repayment period might contradict the 
original legislative intent.
First stabilisation, then consolidation
As long as the COVID- 19 crisis has not yet 
been clearly resolved, it would appear ap-
propriate to make use of the escape clause. 
This means that federal states can also con-
tinue to contribute to macroeconomic sta-
bilisation, focusing on fi  scal policy meas-
ures, such as in taxation or supporting local 
governments. Additional measures may 
make sense down the line. However, these 
should be temporary in order to avoid a 
structural strain on budgets after the crisis.
It would be important to present the ex-
pected future development of state govern-
ment fi  nances regularly and in a transparent 
manner. The Stability Council should have access to updated forecasts whenever it as-
sesses general government budget devel-
opments (usually twice a year). These fore-
casts should include core budgets and be 
based on the most recent expectations 
(such as the latest offi   cial tax estimate and 
updated spending plans). In addition, infor-
mation should be provided stating which 
requirements are set by the state- specifi  c 
(and sometimes quite complicated) debt 
brakes. To this end, there would have to be 
clear illustrations as to what scope for new 
borrowing there is likely to be, whether this 
gives cause to expect fi  scal gaps as a result, 
and which budget provisions are in place in 
order to (temporarily) close these gaps. The 
full picture should also include, in particular, 
information on expected developments in 
off- budget entities, planned fi  nancial trans-
actions and estimated global revenue and 
expenditure (such as global spending cuts).5
Uncertainty about the further course of the 
pandemic and the economic constraints it 
entails remains high. It is likely that tax rev-
enue will also be structurally lower than 
was expected before the crisis, meaning 
that the debt brakes are likely to require ad-
justment measures in the future in order to 
close fi  scal gaps. However, it seems advis-
able not to adopt consolidation measures 
for the medium term at fi  rst, but to wait for 
further developments. Given the current 
uncertain situation, it is therefore not rec-
ommended to draw up budgets where the 
course of fi  scal policy is set for two years. 
First of all, it would be important to tightly 
limit the pandemic- related burden on po-
tential output and to support recovery and 
necessary structural adjustments. Specifi  c 
consolidation measures are only appropri-
ate once a draft budget has to be adopted 
without recourse to the escape clause.

things – to maintain their investment activity. 
All in all, the federal states are making key con -
tributions to macroeconomic stabilisation.
As part of the Bundesbank’s regular reporting 
cycle, this article looks back at the starting pos -
ition of federal state finances prior to the crisis. 
Overall, they were on a very favourable foot -
ing: together with their off- budget entities and 
local governments, the federal states posted a 
considerable budget surplus in 2019 – even 
after deduction of the positive cyclical effect. In 
addition, all states had prepared for the debt 
brake in Germany’s Basic Law  (Grundgesetz), 
which entered into force for them this year: 
they scaled back their structural deficits and 
also, in some cases, made extensive provision 
for harder times. As a result, some federal 
states closed 2019 with high reserve holdings. 
Based on the figures reported by the states (see 
the table on p. 103, columns 2 and 3), reserves 
expressed as a percentage of total core budget 
expenditure ranged from 2% in Saarland and 
Saxony-  Anhalt to 18% in Mecklenburg-  West 
Pomerania.
In many cases, reserves are currently being left 
untapped since the escape clauses are enabling 
temporary credit financing. As it is foreseeable 
that the crisis will continue into the coming 
year, it makes sense to make use of the clauses 
again. Moreover, further measures for tackling 
the crisis may be advisable in future. These 
should then be limited to specific timeframes, 
so as to avoid additional structural burdens in 
the post- crisis period.
Once the crisis eases and the escape clauses 
expire, consolidation measures may be neces -sary to achieve compliance with the debt brake. 
Not least, the current tax estimate suggests 
that the coronavirus crisis has opened up not 
only temporary gaps, but also structural ones. 
Such structural gaps would need closing in fu -
ture, though the existence of reserves means 
that the adjustment path can be spread over 
time.
At any rate, it is not yet the time to outline con -
crete consolidation measures; that can wait 
until the crisis eases and there is more clarity 
about the future path of events. There is a 
need for transparency with regard to the chal -
lenges currently anticipated, however. Gaining 
a clear picture of the situation is made very dif -
ficult by the complexity of state- specific sets of 
rules and the different sets of reserves. As a re -
sult, the post- crisis adjustment paths and needs 
for consolidation may vary considerably (for 
more details, see the box on pp.  102 ff.). It 
seems virtually impossible to achieve effective 
budgetary surveillance without access to suit -
able overviews of current developments and 
federal state planning, including reference to 
any need for action to maintain compliance 
with the respective provisions. For these pur -
poses, more informative data on respective 
state outturns and budgetary planning would 
be required. In its capacity as Germany’s core 
body responsible for fiscal surveillance, the Sta -
bility Council should hasten to work towards 
creating a more rigorous and meaningful data 
basis.19Federal states

* Monetary financial institutions (MFIs) comprise banks (including building and loan
associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.
3 Excluding holdings of MFIs; for the German contribution, excluding German MFIs'
portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI
participations.  7 The German contributions to the Eurosystem's monetary aggregates
should on no account be interpreted as national monetary aggregates and are
therefore not comparable with the erstwhile German money stocks M1, M2 or M3.

the German contribution, the difference between the volume of euro banknotes

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

an agreed maturity and all loans excluding revolving loans and overdrafts, credit card

credit card debt: new business is collected in the same way as outstanding amounts for

interest.  7 Estimated. The volume of new business is extrapolated to form the
underlying total using a grossing-up procedure.  8 Including non-financial corporations’
