Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The improvement in corporate sentiment ob -
served since November did not continue in 
March. Firms somewhat scaled back both their 
assessment of the current situation and their 
forward expectations, which was not really sur -
prising given the preceding sharp improve -
ment. By contrast, the consumer climate has 
stabilised at a fairly high level. This is consistent 
with the fact that, on the one hand, new orders and industrial output have not yet broken free from the depressed level seen in the final quar -
ter of 2012 but that, on the other hand, house-
holds’ income prospects have brightened on the back of growing employment subject to 
social security contributions and rising negoti -
ated rates of pay. Although the industrial sector 
probably provided no growth impetus in the 
first quarter of 2013, it is likely that the services 
sector expanded further. Total valued added 
may have increased as a result. However, this 
presupposes that the impact of the particularly 
cold winter weather, which was evident, for example, in the construction industry, was 
limited. The relatively robust sentiment overall, the ongoing growth in employment and the re-newed boost in demand for capital goods sug-
gest that the pick- up in the German economy 
will continue in the second quarter. Catch- up 
and backlog effects may play a role if it turns 
out that marked weather- related output losses 
occurred in the first quarter.
Industry
In the first two months of 2013, after seasonal 
adjustment, industrial output failed to exceed 
the low level recorded in the fourth quarter of 
2012. While industrial output in February was 
up 0.5% on the month, the January figure was 
distinctly revised downwards by 0.8% com -pared with the original figure and thus fell short of the average of the previous quarter. 
Whereas slightly more capital goods were pro-
duced, the output of intermediate goods and 
consumer goods declined again somewhat.
In the first two months of 2013, mirroring in -
dustrial output, industrial enterprises’ turnover 
was likewise down slightly on the final quarter of 2012 in seasonally adjusted terms. Although 
domestic sales increased slightly, sales to non- 
euro- area countries shrank further. Turnover 
generated with euro- area countries stagnated 
at a low level.
The value of imports and exports, which had 
shown a steep seasonally adjusted rise in Janu-ary, did not even attain the low December level 
in February. However, as both import and ex -
port prices have meanwhile eased distinctly in 
seasonally adjusted terms, the level of the 
fourth quarter of 2012 was more or less main-
tained in real terms on an average of January 
and February. Compared with the final two months of 2012, which were particularly low, 
both imports and exports actually registered a 
distinct increase in price- adjusted terms.
Although industrial orders in February largely 
recovered from the setback in January, this was primarily due to large orders in the other trans-
port equipment segment. These ensured that, 
taking the average of January and February, the total volume of orders received by German in-
dustry – showing a decrease of ½% – almost 
matched the average of the final quarter of 
2012. Excluding other transport equipment, the 
decline would have expanded to ¾%. Whilst 
domestic orders were again pointing upwards 
as a result of rising demand for capital goods, foreign demand weakened again.German eco-

Construction
Seasonally adjusted construction activity in Feb-
ruary was clearly down on the favourable Janu-
ary figure, doubtless in part as a result of the cold winter. The average of the first two months of the year was only slightly higher 
than the prior- quarter average in seasonally ad-
justed terms. In addition, the very high initial 
report for finishing trades in January was sub-
ject to a major downward revision and, accord-ing to provisional figures, the activity of the fin-ishing trades in February was weak.
The main construction industry received signifi-
cantly more orders in January than on an aver -
age of the fourth quarter of 2012. Demand for 
housing construction and public sector con -
struction recorded a particularly robust in -
crease. By contrast, commercial construction 
continued to decline.
Labour market
In spite of the subdued macroeconomic devel-opment, enterprises again recruited more new staff. According to initial estimates by the Fed-eral Statistical Office, the number of persons in 
work rose by a seasonally adjusted 44,000 in 
February vis- à- vis January. The year- on- year rise 
amounted to 282,000, or 0.7%. This was ac -
companied by a shift to regular jobs subject to 
social security contributions, which in January 
rose by as much as 395,000 or 1.4% on the year. Companies’ hiring intentions remained 
moderately expansionary.
While unemployment increased somewhat in 
March in seasonally adjusted terms, this is likely 
to have resulted from the particularly unfavour -
able weather conditions. Unemployment has 
held steady over the last six months at a rate of 
6.9%. The number of unemployed persons 
claiming insurance benefits (unemployment 
benefit I), which fluctuates in line with the cyc-
lical swings, increased slightly, whereas the number of unemployed persons receiving the Weather- related

The contribution of the accommodation services sub-index 
to explaining the current deviations between CPI and HICP inﬂ  ation rates
Between January and March 2013, the year- on- 
year rates of price increase as shown by the Con-
sumer Price Index (CPI) and the Harmonised 
Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) differed consid-
erably in Germany by between 0.2 percentage 
point and, most recently, 0.4 percentage point. 
One of the main causes of these deviations are 
methodological changes made to the accommo-
dation services sub- index, which were intro-duced with the switching of the CPI base year from 2005 to 2010 and came into effect as of 
January 2013.1 The CPI is revised every fi  ve years. 
New information about consumption habits is 
taken into consideration and the methodology is 
adapted. The CPI is recalculated retrospectively 
from the beginning of each new base year. Al-
though the HICP infl  ation measure in Germany is derived from the same basic data as the CPI and 
the same detailed weighting schemes are used, 
the basic HICP weightings are updated every year and methodological changes are also in-
corporated on an ongoing basis. European regu-
lations do not specify that back- calculations 
must be performed. Unlike the CPI fi  gures, HICP year- on- year infl  ation rates are therefore derived from index data that are not completely consist-
ent in terms of methodology and weighting. In 
individual cases, this can lead to marked statis-
tical distortions and can seriously hamper the 
comparability of the CPI and HICP fi  gures.
This year’s rebasing of the CPI to 2010 was ac-
companied by methodological changes in meas-uring the prices of holiday fl  ats, which funda-mentally altered the seasonal profi  le of the ac-
commodation services sub- index. Because inter-net surveys now allow data to be collected from smaller service providers, which are less likely to 
charge seasonal premiums than larger providers, 
the results show signifi  cantly smaller seasonal 
fl  uctuations than previously. In particular, the July- August and December price peaks have 
been largely eliminated. Unlike the CPI, this 
change was applied to the HICP as of January 
2013 without performing back- calculations. Be-
cause the annual sub- indices for the HICP are chain- linked via the month of December, the 
new price series, which does not display strong 
seasonal fl  uctuations, is linked to the seasonal 
high of the old price series. This has far- reaching 
consequences. While the (consistently calcu-
lated) CPI showed a price increase of 2% for ac-
commodation services in the fi  rst quarter of 2013, the HICP (distorted by statistical breaks) showed a year- on- year increase of 20% in the 
corresponding sub- index. With a weighting of 
1.19% in the overall HICP index, accommodation 
services have thus driven up HICP headline infl  a-tion by around 0.3 percentage point, which ac-
counts for most of the discrepancy between HICP and CPI infl  ation in the fi  rst quarter of 
2013.
This distortion of the year- on- year HICP rate will 
continue throughout most of 2013. In the sum-
mer months of July and August, however, it will be signifi  cantly reduced owing to negative base-
line effects resulting from the unrevised 2012 
seasonal profi  le. The year- on- year HICP rate will 
then contract accordingly. The effect will drop 
out altogether from December 2013, when con-
sistently calculated index values will once more 
be compared when calculating the year- on- year HICP rates, too.
1 Another reason for deviations in the year- on- year in-
fl  ation rates could be the fact that the weight of hous-ing rents in the HICP is only half that of the CPI. While 
owner- occupied housing is captured in the CPI using 
equivalent rents, it is not covered by the HICP . Because 
rents have been increasing at a distinctly slower pace 
than general infl  ation in recent years, the infl  ation 
rates calculated according to the CPI often remained 
lower than those measured according to the HICP .Prices of accommodation services

fit II) declined.
Prices
Crude oil prices showed a clear decline in March against the backdrop of a weakening 
global economic outlook and a higher supply. 
They fell against February by 6% in US dollar 
terms, though only by 3% in domestic currency in the wake of the depreciating euro. Crude oil prices eased again substantially in the first half 
of April. As this report went to press, they 
stood at US$99 per barrel. At the same time, 
the discounts on crude oil futures decreased 
considerably. They narrowed to US$1¼ for six- month forward deliveries and US$2¾ for deliv-eries in 12 months’ time.
Seasonally adjusted prices at the upstream 
stages of the economy fell in February follow -
ing the euro’s appreciation at the turn of 2012-13. Whilst the negative year- on- year change in 
import prices widened to 1.6% in February, the 
positive year- on- year change in domestic pro -
ducer prices narrowed to 0.4% in March. The 
more favourable development was evident in the prices of both energy and intermediate 
goods.
Consumer prices showed no further seasonally 
adjusted increase in March. A substantial drop in energy prices offset a marked rise in the cost 
of food, other goods and services. The fall in energy prices can only partly be explained by 
corresponding fluctuations in crude oil prices; it was reinforced by a compression of profit mar -
gins in the first three weeks of the month. Mar -
gins only expanded again when demand began 
to pick up at the start of the Easter holidays. 
The fairly strong price hike for services is like -
wise related to the fact that Easter fell early this 
year. While inflation as measured by the na -
tional Consumer Price Index (CPI) decreased 
further to 1.4% in March, it remained at 1.8% 
according to the Harmonised Index of Con -
sumer Prices (HICP). The relatively large devi -ation between the two measures can primarily 
be explained by a methodologically incompar -
able chain-  linking of price series for hotel ser -
vices in the HICP in December 2012 (see the 
box on page 7).
Public finances1
Local government finances
In the final quarter of 2012, local government 
(core budgets and off- budget entities) posted a 
surplus of just under €2½ billion. This was simi-
lar to the outturn 12 months previously. Rev -
enue rose by 3% (just under €2 billion), primar -
ily as a result of the rise in tax receipts (by 6%, or €1½ billion). Following strong growth in the 
previous quarters, net local business tax rev -
enue was down slightly on the year, but this was far outweighed by the sharp rise in the 
municipal share of income tax. Payments from 
state government (partly passed on from cen -
tral government funds) increased by 2½% (€½ 
billion), although the phasing out of central government’s 2009 investment programme 
continued to have a dampening effect. By the 
same token, on the expenditure side, fixed asset formation once again recorded a sharp decline (-10½%). Nevertheless, total expend
-
iture rose significantly on balance (by 3½%, or 
€2 billion). This increase was due not only to sharper growth in spending on personnel (+5½%) and social benefits (+6%), but also 
inter alia to a €½ billion rise in expenditure on financial asset acquisition.
For 2012 as a whole, local government re -
corded a surplus of €1 billion, compared with a 
deficit of €3 billion one year previously. Rev -
enue rose by 3% (€6 billion). This was mainly Crude oil prices

1 In the short report on public finances, which regularly 
appears in the Monthly Report, the emphasis is on recent 
outturns. The quarterly editions of the Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and November), by 
contrast, contain a detailed description of general govern-ment budget trends during the preceding quarter. For de-tailed statistical data on budgetary developments and pub-lic debt, see the statistical section of this report.Deutsche Bundesbank

attributable to the rise in tax revenue (by 6½%, 
or €4½ billion), which, in turn, was due in 
 almost equal measure to growth in income tax 
(+9%) and local business tax (+6% after deduc-
tion of the revenue shares accruing to other government levels). Despite the steep decline in the volume of investment grants received, 
funds from state government also rose by 2½% (€1½ billion). Expenditure went up by just over 
1% (€2½ billion). The sharp decline in fixed asset formation (by 11%, or €2½ billion) fol
-
lowing the expiry of the economic stimulus 
programme was offset by growth in personnel expenditure (by 4%, or €2 billion) and, in par -
ticular, other current transfers (not least due to 
the rise in social benefits, by 2½%, or €1 bil -
lion).
Despite posting a fiscal surplus, local govern -
ment (gross) debt (including debt to other gov-
ernment sectors) was up by €3 billion on the year at the end of 2012. The volume of cash 
advances, which are actually only intended for 
bridging short- term liquidity shortfalls, in -
creased by almost €3 billion. At the end of 
2012, cash advances accounted for nearly €48 
billion of the total debt (€139 billion). They  recorded particularly strong growth in those 
federal states that had already been making the greatest use of this form of borrowing. Local governments in the federal states of North Rhine-  Westphalia, Rhineland- Palatinate 
and Saarland recorded increases in the volume of cash advances from €80 to €90 per inhabit-ant. In Hesse, the growth was around twice as high.
The particularly difficult financial situation in Hesse is also illustrated by local government per capita budget balances. While the com
-
bined figure for all non- city states in 2012 was 
+€10, Hesse posted a negative peak value of 
-€310. The task of identifying the causes of the 
high deficits through a cross- state comparison 
is hampered by the fact that the extent to 
which tasks, and consequently expenditure, are 
assigned to local governments varies greatly 
among the federal states.2 In this respect, the figures for the western states3 should at least 
be roughly levelled out by deducting state gov-
ernment refunds and transfers (which are below average in Hesse) from total revenue and expenditure in order to correct for such 
distortions. Per capita revenue available to local 
governments in Hesse was well above average 
both before and after such adjustment (un -
adjusted, compared with the average figure for all non- city states: +6½%; adjusted, compared 
with the average figure for western states: as 
much as +14½%). Thus, according to the cash 
statistics, the above- average deficits in Hesse 
are primarily due to the very high level of ex -
penditure per inhabitant. The latter exceeded Further rise in

2 However, now that the reporting population has been 
expanded, the variations in the spin- off of entities from 
municipal core budgets, which have significantly hampered comparisons of federal states in recent years, are no longer likely to produce any large- scale distortions.
3 In the eastern states, the payments passed on within the 
framework of the state government revenue- sharing 
scheme (in the broader sense) in order to compensate for weaker finances – irrespective of the degree to which tasks are decentralised – have a decisive impact.Deutsche Bundesbank

the average figure for all non- city states by 
one- fifth. After deducting transfers, it sur -
passed the value for western states by nearly 
one- third. Compared with local governments in 
non- city states as a whole, Hessian local gov -
ernments recorded higher payments for other 
operating expenditure and social benefits, in 
particular. These exceeded the average values 
per inhabitant by €150 and €120, respectively. 
However, loans granted and personnel expend-
iture were also both €70 per inhabitant higher.4 
The federal state of Hesse has now set up a 
partial debt assumption programme for local 
governments facing particularly severe financial 
difficulties (just under a quarter of all local gov-
ernments in Hesse). The programme aims to 
eliminate a total of almost €3 billion of old 
debt (15% of cash advances and credit market 
debt of all local governments at the end of 
2012). The assistance is being granted subject 
to substantial annual budgetary cuts (target 
value: €100 per inhabitant). As a general rule, 
this should result in a balanced budget being 
achieved by the end of the current decade at 
the latest. If it is rigorously implemented, the programme is likely to be a key pillar in the  necessary consolidation of Hesse’s local gov
-
ernment finances. However, the other local 
governments in Hesse must also make the 
 adjustments required in a timely manner.
Securities markets
Bond market
Gross issuance in the German bond market in 
February 2013 almost reached the level of issu-
ance in the previous month. Overall, domestic 
debt securities worth €125.6 billion were 
 issued, compared with €128.2 billion in Janu -
ary. After deducting redemptions, which were 
considerably lower than in the previous month, 
and taking account of changes in issuers’ hold-
ings of their own bonds, the volume of out -
standing domestic bonds increased by €17.4 
billion. Foreign debt securities worth €4.3 bil -
lion net were placed in the German market, so that the outstanding volume of debt securities in Germany increased overall by €21.7 billion.
In the month under review, the public sector 
increased its stock of bond market liabilities by 
€9.5 billion. Central government in particular 
(including the resolution agency which is classi-fied as part of it) tapped the capital market for €14.4 billion net. It issued mainly five- year Fed-
eral notes (Bobls) worth €5.7 billion, but also two- year Federal Treasury notes (Schätze) 
worth €4.6 billion, as well as 10-year and 
30-year Federal bonds (Bunds) worth €3.1 bil -
lion and €1.3 billion respectively. The Federal 
states redeemed debt securities amounting to 
€4.9 billion in net terms.
In February, domestic enterprises increased their capital market debt by a net amount of 
€7.1 billion, following net redemptions of €5.5 
billion in the previous month. Non- financial 
corporations in particular took advantage of 
the favourable financing conditions and issued new bonds worth €5.3 billion net.
Credit institutions issued debt securities total -
ling €0.9 billion net in February. On balance, 
this was exclusively attributed to debt securities issued by specialised credit institutions, the out-standing volume of which rose by €14.1 billion. 
By contrast, there were redemptions of public 
Pfandbriefe (€4.8 billion), other bank debt  securities (€4.5 billion) and mortgage Pfand
-
briefe (€3.9 billion) in net terms.
Foreign investors were the main buyers in Feb-
ruary, stepping up their purchases of German 
debt securities by €20.7 billion. Domestic non- 
banks also acquired bonds amounting to €10.7 billion. On balance, these were exclusively for -
eign securities. Resident credit institutions, by 
contrast, reduced their bond holdings by €8.0 Net issuance of

Equity market
In the month under review, new shares total -

equity market by listed and non- listed enter -
prises in almost equal measure. In addition, the outstanding amount of foreign equities in Ger -
many fell by €2.0 billion. Non- resident investors 
dominated the buyers’ side of the market in February, purchasing €5.0 billion worth of 
shares. Resident credit institutions and domes-
tic non- banks, meanwhile, recorded net sales 
of €5.4 billion and €1.3 billion respectively.
Mutual funds
In February, €8.5 billion flowed into domestic 
mutual funds, down on the €11.9 billion in the 
previous month. The inflows benefited mainly 
specialised funds reserved for institutional in -
vestors (€5.6 billion). Of the funds open to the 
general public, it was mainly mixed securities-  
based funds that recorded inflows (€0.9 bil -
lion). Foreign mutual funds sold fund shares 
worth €3.8 billion in the German market. Ger -
man non- banks were practically the sole buyers 
of mutual fund shares (€13.6 billion). On bal -
ance, foreign investors acquired German mu -
tual fund shares amounting to €0.2 billion, while domestic credit institutions sold fund 
shares with a value of €1.5 billion.
Balance of payments
In February 2013, the German current account 
recorded a surplus – in unadjusted terms – of 
€16.0 billion, which was €6.3 billion above the level of the previous month. This increase was 
primarily due to an expanding trade surplus, coupled with the fact that invisible current 
transactions, which comprise services, income 
and current transfers, reverted to a surplus.According to provisional calculations by the Federal Statistical Office, in February the for
-
eign trade surplus was up by €3.2 billion on the 
month to €16.8 billion. After adjustment for seasonal and calendar variations, this surplus 
rose by €1.5 billion to €17.1 billion. While the 
value of exports fell by 1.5%, the value of im -
ports dropped by an even greater margin (-3.8%). Throughout January and February, 
seasonally adjusted exports remained stable at 
their average level of the last quarter of 2012 
while imports shrank by around 1%. Mean -
while, the price of exported and imported 
goods declined.
Invisible current transactions posted a surplus of €0.9 billion in February, compared with a 
deficit of €1.9 billion in January, thanks to im -
provements in the balances of the services and 
income sub- accounts. On the services side, 
January’s €1.6 billion deficit reverted to a sur -
plus of €0.4 billion in February. The surplus in

€7.3 billion, mainly on account of rising earn -
ings from mutual fund shares (+€0.8 billion). 
Moreover, dividend payments to non- residents 
declined by €1.1 billion. The deficit in current 
transfers, meanwhile, widened from €5.8 bil -
lion to €6.8 billion.
Following a period of broadly upbeat senti -
ment in the international financial markets in 
January, the lower- than- expected redemption 
of the second three- year tender and the polit-
ical discord concerning how to overcome the 
sovereign debt problems in the United States 
led to tensions in February. Hence, cross- border 
portfolio investment resulted in net capital im-
ports (€17.2 billion), after generating outflows 
in January (€30.2 billion). This shift was chiefly 
triggered by the investment activity of non-  
residents who purchased securities in Germany in the amount of €25.8 billion during February, 
after parting with such paper just one month 
earlier (€8.0 billion). They showed a keen inter -
est in German debt securities (€20.7 billion), 
with a strong preference for bonds and notes 
(€15.0 billion), in particular public sector bonds. In addition, they not only acquired money mar -
ket paper (€5.7 billion) but also switched to purchasing equities (€4.9 billion) after having disposed of these in January (-€5.7 billion). Meanwhile, German investors purchased 
smaller quantities of foreign securities outside 
Germany (€8.6 billion compared with €22.2 billion in January), primarily adding foreign 
bonds and notes (€4.7 billion) and mutual fund shares (€3.8 billion) to their portfolios.
Direct investment resulted in net capital out -
flows in February (€3.8 billion), largely because 
German firms provided their foreign affiliates 
with funds (€6.9 billion). On the one hand, this 
funding took the form of intra- group credit 
transactions (€4.8 billion), with around half of 
this amount being channelled via trade and  financial credits. On the other, German firms 
reinvested earnings (€4.2 billion). However, they also reduced their equity capital abroad (€2.0 billion). Similarly, foreign investors sup

The US economy in the current  
economic upturn
Aggregate US output has grown only sluggishly following the severe recession of 2008-09. Its 
growth has fallen far short of levels reached, in particular, during the strong upswings in the mid-
1970s and early 1980s that likewise followed sharp slumps in activity. The moderate growth of the past few years is being interpreted by many as cyclical weakness, which even the extremely expansionary monetary policy has been unable to eliminate, however.
It is indeed possible to identify a series of demand- side factors which have weighed on aggregate 
growth. Private residential construction was unable to maintain its usual role as the engine of 
economic recovery because the processes of adjustment in the real estate markets were still 
ongoing following the excesses of the preceding cycle. Experience has shown that such correc-
tions take a relatively long time. It is only in the past few quarters that a solid upward tendency 
has taken hold in private residential construction, although the low level of activity means it is 
unable to make itself felt across the economy as a whole. Moreover, the rapid expansion of fiscal policy, with which general government sought to halt the sliding economy in 2008-09, has been scaled back over the past few years. Given the still- rising debt ratio and still- yawning fiscal gaps, 
further consolidation measures appear necessary in order, among other things, to protect the 
sustainability of public finances.
Moreover, private consumption is often perceived as a key weak link in the current upswing 
because consumers were trying to deleverage as well as to rebuild wealth. This was offset, how-ever, by the positive stimulus from the extremely loose monetary policy. Since, on balance, saving did not increase any further during the economic recovery, households were able to step up their consumer spending in line with their incomes. Seen in that light, the moderate increases in con-
sumption over the past few years are probably less of a brake and more of a reflection of the 
subdued expansion in incomes and employment.
Ultimately, what weighs more than the various cyclical factors is the fact that there has been a 
considerable slowdown in the underlying pace of aggregate growth. It is largely weaker growth of production capacity that lies behind the slower real GDP growth than during the recoveries of the 1990s and the beginning of the new millennium. The chief factors here are the corrections of 
earlier excesses in the real estate markets and, in particular, profound demographic change, 
which is not only dampening growth of the potential labour force but also indirectly holding back capital formation. Although the ripple effects emanating from the recession are subsiding and an upswing has now begun in residential construction, the pace of aggregate economic growth will 
probably pick up only slightly, especially as the necessary fiscal consolidation has not yet been 
completed.Deutsche Bundesbank

The current upswing in the 
public and academic debate
Measured in terms of the growth of real gross 
domestic product (GDP), the current cyclical 
upswing in the United States is the weakest since the end of the Second World War.
1 Ac-
cording to the current (seasonally adjusted) 
data, aggregate economic output in the final 
quarter of 2012 was no more than 7½% higher 
than in spring 2009, dated by the Business 
Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau 
of Economic Research (NBER) as the end of the 
last recession. In the two preceding phases of 
cyclical recovery in the early 1990s and at the 
start of the new millennium, economic output had gone up over the same 14-quarter period 
by as much as 11¼% on average. Those were 
already being regarded as relatively flat expan-sions following quite mild recessions. Given the 
collapse of economic activity in the 2008-09 
downturn, when real GDP dropped by no less 
than 4¾% in a six- quarter period, recent devel-
opments seem all the more surprising as severe recessions are usually followed by strong recov-
eries.2 The expansions in the mid-1970s and 
the early 1980s, in particular, fit that pattern: 
aggregate output grew by an average of 20% within three and a half years. The latest figures appear even more meagre if per capita GDP is 
used as the measure; real per capita income 
rose by a mere 4½% up until autumn 2012, thus, as before, falling markedly short of its 
end-2007 level, the most recent cyclical peak.3
In this context, international organisations such as the International Monetary Fund have been 
pointing out repeatedly that recessions associ -
ated with severe financial crises are followed by 
very sluggish recoveries. The research to sup -
port this view is provided, in particular, by the 
studies of Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and Re-inhart and Reinhart (2010) on various countries’ 
historical experiences of financial crises. How -
ever, these analyses are, in some cases, con -
fined to comparisons of the severity and dur -
ation of the downturn, at most implying that 
financial crises leave deep and permanent scars in the levels of macroeconomic metrics.4 Al-
though the authors also find that real per cap-
ita GDP growth in the decade following the 
onset of a severe financial crisis is significantly 
dampened compared with the preceding ten-  
year period, this result is due to the way in 
which the observation period is defined. By de-
fining the cyclical peak as the reference point 
for the study, the depth of the downturn is off-
set against the rise in the recovery path.5 If, 
however, the analysis is restricted to US busi -
ness cycles, there is, in fact, a very pronounced 
relationship between a severe contraction and 
a strong recovery following a financial crisis.6 It 
is therefore by no means clear- cut that the 
weakness of the current economic upswing is 
only following the usual empirical pattern, thus obviating the need for any further analyses.
The preceding financial crisis is frequently cited 
in an attempt to explain the moderate progress 
of recovery in terms of a slower intrinsic mo -Weakest

3 By contrast, real per capita GDP rose by 11½% on an 
average of the four recoveries of 1975-78, 1983-86, 1991-94 and 2002-05, surpassing the preceding peak by 8¾%. The expansion of 1980-81 has been omitted here as it was already over after four quarters.4 See C M Reinhart and K S Rogoff (2009), The Aftermath

study that the cyclical upswing (seen in isolation) which 
begins in the cyclical trough is not much different following a financial crisis than a similar phase following another type 
of recession. See G Howard, R Martin and B A Wilson (2011), Are Recoveries from Banking and Financial Crises

mentum of private sector economic activity 
due to financing restrictions and asset- side ad-
justments. An alternative approach is to attrib-
ute the subdued pace of growth to external 
retarding factors. Factors deserving of mention 
in this context include, in particular, the oil 
price surges that have occurred repeatedly in the past few years, which resulted from the interplay between robust growth in demand 
for oil in the emerging market economies, on 
the one hand, and actual and feared supply 
cutbacks, on the other.7 For a country such as 
the United States which, on balance, imports large quantities of crude oil, but only exports limited quantities of goods to the emerging 
market economies, the primary impact of even a purely demand- driven rise in oil prices is likely 
to be an erosion of purchasing power. It was 
particularly US new car sales which, in the past, 
responded strongly to sharp surges in fuel prices. In spring 2011 in particular, when real household consumer spending on motor ve
-
hicles and motor vehicle parts was down by more than 5% on the quarter, stoppages in output in the motor vehicle industry were an 
added factor in the wake of a temporary inter -
ruption in international supply chains following the severe Tohoku earthquake in Japan. In the 
past year, the euro area’s problems and the 
global slump in the manufacturing sector were 
also emphasised as straining factors.8 Some 
economists also noted that increased uncer -
tainty about the economic and fiscal policy 
path is impacting negatively on private sector 
firms’ and households’ propensity to invest.9 
This line of argument gained particular promin-
ence in the summer of 2011 and autumn of 2012 amidst the escalating conflict between the executive and various legislative branches 
of government concerning public finances. At 
the end of 2012, a warning was made publicly about the danger of a looming recession owing to the “fiscal cliff”.
10
What must be emphasised, however, is that, despite the various factors weighing on the 
economy, there has not been a renewed eco -
nomic downswing thus far. This is all the more remarkable given that other advanced econ -
omies, which were by no means the focal point 
of the preceding financial crisis, have slipped 
back into recession following a brief recovery. 
Although real GDP growth in the United States 
faltered at times, most recently in the final 
quarter of 2012, real private final demand, the actual engine of the upswing, has been show-
ing constant and relatively solid growth since 
the winter of 2010, albeit at only a moderate 
average pace.
Against this background, it is reasonable to as-
sume that it is not so much cyclical factors that 
have retarded aggregate growth but, rather, Despite impres-
sion of fragile upswing, econ-omy has thus far not slipped back into reces-sion

the debate on the impact of government activism. See S R Baker, N Bloom and S J Davis (2012), Measuring Economic

that there has been a slowdown in the under -
lying trend growth. In this context, the term 
“new normal” has already been coined to de -
scribe the post- crisis era.11 It is quite possible 
for an earlier severe recession to have a tem -
porary impact on potential output. Even so, in 
addition, there are indications that the cyclical 
fluctuations of the past few years have ob -
scured a flattening of the trend path, which is 
due to fundamental and long- term shifts on 
the supply side of the economy. Stock and 
Watson (2012), in particular, have attempted to 
identify the importance of individual drivers in 
the past recession and the subsequent up -
swing.12 According to their analysis, the com -
paratively weak employment growth during 
the current recovery is being caused more by a 
slowdown in trend job growth than by cyclical 
factors. Since productivity growth was rela -
tively nondescript by historical standards, this implies a relatively weak upward tendency in 
trend output. They ultimately regard profound 
demographic change as being the cause. Look-
ing at potential growth in the next 20 to 50 
years, and abstracting completely from the lat-est financial crisis and its potential fallout, Gor -
don (2012) predicts a secular slowdown in real per capita income growth.
13Demand- side factors
In order to approach the factors affecting the 
current cyclical recovery from the demand side, it makes sense to compare the average contri-
butions to growth made by the individual ex -
penditure components of real GDP with those 
of earlier expansions.14 On the whole, the rise 
in aggregate output, which averaged 2% over 
the past three and a half years, was sustained 
by household consumption and business in -
vestment alike, whereas private residential con-
struction had only a marginal positive impact. 
On the other hand, public demand and foreign 
trade both markedly curbed GDP growth. A 
comparison specifically with the two preceding 
business cycles shows that not all demand 
components were developing more unfavour -
ably over the past few years; in fact, firms ex -
panded their investment markedly more 
strongly, owing not only to comprehensive re -
stocking following the severe recession but also to their higher spending on equipment 
and software. This fosters doubts about the oc-
casional assertion that the recovery has been 
hampered by financing constraints, particularly 
on small business. In addition, foreign trade 
has not been weighing on aggregate output as 
heavily as in earlier recoveries.15 By contrast, Private residen-
tial construction, public demand and private con-sumption weak compared with earlier business cyclesExpenditure components of real US GDP compared with previous recoveries

ation. See J H Stock and M W Watson, Disentangling the

In fact, the average (negative) contribution made by im -
ports to growth in the current recovery is consistent with 
historical experience. However, exports have been more 
positive. This could be due mainly to a relatively large de-
gree of synchronicity between economies in the latest re -
cession and the subsequent countermovement.Deutsche Bundesbank

private residential construction, public demand 
and private consumption – each seen in terms of their average contribution to growth – have 
remained, in some cases, well short of their 
levels during previous recoveries, which is why they will be examined in more detail below.
Real estate market and  private 
residential  construction
Given the real estate market’s role as the epi -
centre of the financial crisis, it is not much of a surprise that, in the past few years, private resi-dential construction was unable to play its typ-
ical role as the engine of economic recovery. 
The temporary government programmes which 
afforded tax relief for the purchase of owner-  
occupied housing were simply a cyclical “flash 
in the pan”. Only since the 2011 Q4 to 2012 
Q1 period has a rather strong upturn in invest-ment become entrenched in this area.
It is particularly problems stemming from earl -
ier undesirable developments which are likely to have had a retarding impact, as were re
-
flected in the pent- up oversupply in the real es-
tate market. The stock of uninhabited housing 
units up for sale skyrocketed beginning in 
2006, peaking in the winter of 2008. This stock 
of real estate was not substantially reduced 
until after the summer of 2011. In addition, the 
“shadow inventory”, ie housing units which, owing to the poor price environment, have 
been temporarily taken off the market, is likely 
to have limited the need for investment.16 
Moreover, only minimal positive stimuli were 
generated by the demand side of the real es -
tate market in the early stages of the economic recovery. Young adults, in particular, were hesi-tant to establish households and purchase resi-dential property, owing to the situation on the job market and tight lending standards.
17
Only in the last year and a half has the invest-ment climate in the housing market seen a dis-tinct improvement. Progress was made initially in reducing the oversupply. The stock of vacant owner- occupied homes up for sale is returning 
to pre- crisis levels. House prices, too, are show-
ing a tendency towards resurgence in both nominal and real terms. In keeping with the more favourable underlying conditions, resi
-
dential construction investment has picked up 
sharply of late. Its average growth of 12% over 
the past year even outpaced that of all other demand components of GDP . The valuation level is still comparatively low, and there is pent- up demand owing to household forma
-
tion being deferred; these factors currently ap-pear to indicate a continuation of the housing market upswing. However, the relative restrict-ive conditions for real estate lending could pos-sibly act as a brake; that said, returning to the lax lending standards of earlier years is hardly a Residential con-

16 Owing to a lack of data, the size of the shadow inven-
tory can only be estimated. It is typically understood as 
comprising those housing units which have been included 
in banks’ balance sheets as collateral for defaulted mort -
gage loans and those which are still in foreclosure. Accord-
ing to analyses by Fed staff, this shadow inventory has 
markedly restrained the recovery in the housing sector. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, 12-13 September 2012.
17 Thus, only ½ million households were established on 
average over the 2008-10 period. The annual average fig-ure for the 2003-07 period had been as high as 1¼ million. The number of households in which the head of the house-hold is below 30 years of age has, in fact, been in a con-tinuous decline since 2008. The home ownership rate, too, has been showing a downward tendency since as long ago as autumn 2006.Deutsche Bundesbank

desirable alternative. On the whole, the direct 
growth stimuli emitted by residential construc-
tion investment to the economy as a whole are 
likely to remain moderate for the time being 
because of their low level relative to aggregate 
demand. This share has dropped by 3¾ per -
centage points from its cyclical peak at the end 
of 2005 to 2½% at the end of the period under review. For that reason, even the strong growth of private residential construction investment in 
2012 raised the aggregate growth rate by no 
more than ¼ percentage point.
Fiscal policy
The effects of the recent recession were allevi-ated markedly by a strongly expansionary fiscal policy. The starting fiscal situation at the cyclical peak was by no means favourable; at the end 
of 2007, aggregate gross debt was around 
two- thirds of GDP , whereas the deficit ratio had 
already surpassed the 3% mark. The automatic 
stabilisers, along with extensive economic stimulus packages, then caused the deficit to rise sharply, with the deficit ratio peaking at 
nearly 13% in spring 2009. Although the esti -
mates of the budget gap, adjusted for cyclical 
factors, differ in their details, they, too, indicate a sharp rise.
18 At the same time, the debt ratio 
has risen very sharply and is now over 100%.
Since the beginning of the economic recovery 
and especially in the last two years, however, the expansiveness of fiscal policy has been 
scaled back.19 In this respect, the latest cycle is 
different from, in particular, the preceding 
cycle, when the adjusted deficit even went up 
considerably in the cyclical recovery.20 Admit -
tedly, from the vantage point of fiscal stabilisa-
tion of the economy, it is quite appropriate to 
reduce the stimuli in the wake of economic re-covery. Looking at current developments in the 
United States, it should be taken into account 
that the cyclically adjusted deficits in the past 
year were considerably higher than in 2007 
and that public budgets were thus still geared 
towards strong expansion in comparison with the beginning of the downturn. Timely consoli-
dation is also appropriate, not least to ensure 
the sustainability of government finances given a high and still rising debt ratio.
The reduction in the cyclically adjusted deficit 
means that fiscal policy has put the brakes on 
the economic recovery. One key transmission 
channel is through individual state and munici-
pal public demand; institutional rules and regu-
lations are applying relatively strong pressure 
on these entities to balance their budgets. Re-
cently, though, muted federal government de-
mand has been gaining importance. Public fi -
nances affect not only government consump -
tion and investment but also economic devel -
opments, especially through taxation and transfer payments to households and firms.

18 The fiscal balance is to some degree a reflection of the 
business cycle, with, for instance, fluctuations in employ -
ment leading to fluctuations in tax revenue and spending 
on unemployment assistance, thus causing cyclical swings 
to be dampened automatically through income effects. 
Additional stimuli are evident in changes in the balance as 
adjusted for cyclical factors. One thing to be taken into account is that there are various approaches to cyclically adjusting government budgets, the results of which may 
vary widely owing to the uncertainty involved and which 
are prone to revision at the current end, particularly with 
regard to the cyclically adjusted deficit level. It should also 
be emphasised that changes in the structural fiscal or pri -
mary balance cannot be equated with the financial impact of active fiscal policy measures. Instead, they may be attrib-
utable to developments which are not directly associated 
with current fiscal policy. See, for example, Deutsche Bun-
desbank, A disaggregated framework for analysing public 
finances: Germany’s fiscal track record between 2000 and 
2005, Monthly Report, March 2006, pp 61-76. The esti -
mated cyclically adjusted balance assumed here is per -
formed separately for revenue and expenditure as mod -
elled in the national accounts of the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis (BEA) for both the federal government and the 
level of individual states and municipalities. The underlying 
data on potential output are taken from data supplied by 
the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). See also pp 23-25 for a discussion of the cyclical adjustment method.19 See B Lucking and D Wilson (2012), U. S. Fiscal Policy: 
Headwind or Tailwind?, Federal Reserve Bank of San Fran-cisco, Economic Letter, No 2012-20.20 Spending on military actions is also likely to have been 
a key reason for the difference in the focus of fiscal policy 
in the two cycles. It should also be noted that the debt ratio has risen to a worrisome level in the current cycle, both in terms of the sustainability of public finances and 
with respect to the effectiveness of additional fiscal stimu-lus measures.Deutsche Bundesbank

transfer payments. The swing in the cyclically 
adjusted deficit is probably, at least in part, a 
reflection of the expiry of this extensive pack -
age of measures.
Such temporary measures to prop up demand 
are intended to stabilise real GDP in a cyclical 
downturn but cannot lift aggregate output higher than its underlying path in the long term. Once its impact on the level of output 
has peaked, growth is no longer spurred rela -
tive to its underlying pace but retarded. Ac -
cording to data from the Congressional Budget 
Office (CBO) and also Bundesbank simulations 
performed using the NiGEM global economic model developed by the National Institute of 
Economic and Social Research (NIESR), the cyc-lical impact of the 2009 fiscal package is likely to have undergone a turnaround during 2010. Although estimates vary as to the extent of the 
retarding effect, they are all the larger, the 
higher the preceding positive impact is rated.21
Private consumption
On the expenditure side, the perceptible slow-down in the pace of real GDP growth was as-
sociated with a slowdown in household con -
sumption, for which over two- thirds of aggre -
gate income is spent in the United States. All the same, a comparison with typical behav
-
ioural patterns in the cycle shows that this ex-
penditure component has recently been tend -
ing to show positive growth (see box on pages 23 to 25). In addition, the national ac
-
counts directly show a clear dichotomy within 
(real) household consumer spending between a 
relatively strong recovery of the consumption 
of goods and a merely muted upward growth 
in the consumption of services. Since this is at-
tributable in large part to a virtual standstill in 
the accommodation subsector, it is probably a 
reflection of earlier unsound developments in 
the real estate market.22
Nevertheless, many observers see households’ 
asset- side adjustments, particularly their efforts to deleverage, as the driving force behind the 
dampening of household consumption 
growth.23 Owing to falling property prices and

21 The CBO is required by law to assess the impact on em-
ployment and output of the American Recovery and Re -
investment Act (ARRA). Looking at real GDP , no direct em-
pirical evidence is cited. Instead, the effects are estimated 
based on the impact of similar measures in the past and 
with the help of models. A high and a low setting are de-signed to reflect uncertainty about the extent of the actual 
impact. The outcome of our NiGEM simulation is largely 
within the range of the CBO estimates, albeit closer to the lower bound. However, it hinges decisively on the assump-tions that monetary policy will not respond to the assumed fiscal policy measures and that households do not form ex-pectations in a forward- looking manner. If, by contrast, an 
endogenous interest rate response, or forward- looking ex-
pectations of households are permitted, the GDP response will be even weaker. The shocks underlying the simulation 
are based on BEA data on the size and distribution over 
time of the federal government sector transactions associ-ated with the ARRA. See Bureau of Economic Analysis, Ef-

22 Compared with the average of the two preceding re -
coveries, the contribution of private consumption to an -
nual real GDP growth was ¾ percentage point lower in the 
past few years. Of this deficit, more than ½ percentage 
point can be attributed directly to services, of which ¼ is 
due to accommodation, which is defined as containing not only actual and imputed rents but also home care.23 See eg R Glick and K J Lansing (2009), U. S. Household

2008 saw consumers being suddenly con -
fronted with a perceptible erosion of net 
wealth and a matching rise in indebtedness. In 
order to reduce their debt and offset the severe 
wealth losses, the conventional wisdom has it 
that households save a larger percentage of their income than in the past. In contrast to given income growth, the expansion of con
-
sumer spending falls while the saving rate rises. Although there is indeed empirical evidence of 
a relationship between the saving rate and 
households’ net wealth as a percentage of dis-
posable income,24 what should not be over -
looked is that, in reality, it is not only the saving 
rate which adjusts: net wealth is also in flux 
through the relevant prices. Owing to the 
strong recovery of stock prices in the past few 
years, households’ financial wealth has now 
even returned to pre- crisis levels. This positive 
impact on consumption growth is likely to have 
offset potentially dampening effects caused by real estate markets.
25The term deleveraging is often used, however, with reference to a reduction in debt that goes further than restoring the earlier debt ratio as a 
motive for cutting back on consumption. It is 
held that the violent upheaval in the financial 
markets and in the macroeconomic environ -
ment – specifically, for instance, in the wake of the drying- up of credit flows, massive downsiz-
ing and rapidly rising uncertainty – has reduced the debt ratio desired by households compared 
with pre-  crisis periods. Indeed, households’ 
turnaround from amassing debt to deleverag -
ing is likely to have played a major role in the 
2008 cyclical downswing, over the course of 
which the saving rate shot up by 4 percentage 
points and real consumer spending was cut 
back considerably. Since then, the saving ratio 
has tended slightly downwards, if anything, 
and has thus ultimately not done anything to 
dampen the growth of consumer spending.26 
Whereas only the change of the saving ratio is of major relevance to the business cycle – simi-lar to the line of argument surrounding the fis-
cal balance  – deleveraging only requires in -
come to exceed expenditure by a sufficient margin. Hence the continuing deleveraging, 
along with an elevated but henceforth largely 
constant saving ratio, has been causing con -Deleveraging

ences, not least monetary and fiscal policy influences, which could have counteracted one another. Statistically, 
saving is determined only as a residual from the difference between income and expenditure and is thus highly prone to revision. Since income is regularly underreported initially, 
the saving ratio has tended to be revised upwards in the 
past. Given the difficulty of finding macroeconomic evi -
dence of the impact of deleveraging on consumption, Dy-
nan (2012) attempts to collect microeconomic evidence.

Is private consumption in the USA following its typical 
 cyclical pattern?
Private consumption is often seen as a sig-
nifi  cant weakness in the US economy’s cur-
rent upswing. Many would argue that households’ efforts to deleverage and to rebuild wealth have dampened real con-sumption growth and in turn hampered 
growth of overall economic output.1 On the 
other hand, due to the intertwined nature 
of these elements, it is possible that the 
subdued growth in consumption is less of a 
burden on and more of a response to the restrained expansion in income and em-ployment, which is ultimately due to the levelling out of the underlying trends (see box on pages 31 to 35) and to a modest 
 recovery in cyclical output overall.
To neutralise the effect of the slower under-
lying pace, the expenditure components of gross domestic product (GDP) can be meas-ured against potential output. The contribu-
tion of each of the expenditure compon-ents to the output gap, ie to the percent-age difference between actual GDP and potential output, can then be calculated, 
facilitating a comparison of the current up-
turn with previous recoveries. In 2012, the 
Congressional Budget Offi   ce (CBO) estab-lished in such an analysis that public de-
mand in particular but also private residen-
tial investment and private consumption 
were behind the comparatively modest re-
duction in the negative output gap in previ-
ous years. The CBO indicated losses in wealth and households’ dwindling confi  -
dence as well as a decline in the wage ratio as reasons for the subdued contribution of consumption to increasing the cyclical out-put.
2
As private consumer spending essentially 
depends on income, it is certainly also pos-sible that this subdued contribution is itself 
a refl  ection of the modest recovery in cyc-
lical output. To identify cyclical burdens, 
we can examine how the ratios of expend-
iture components to potential output be-
haved in general depending on the aggre-
gate output gap.3 The actual (nominal) 
ratios of GDP expenditure components to potential output are then adjusted for the estimated cyclical effects. Shifts between 
the resulting percentage shares of potential 
output can then indicate specifi  c develop-ments in the individual expenditure com-ponents. Nonetheless, it should be noted 
that such an analysis cannot as such explain 
the modest recovery in cyclical output in 
the current upswing; rather, it is assumed to 
be exogenous. The analysis only looks at 
the  extent to which the individual expend-
iture components have deviated from cyc-

The U. S. Recovery from the Great Recession: A Story 
of Debt and Deleveraging, Bank of Canada Review, 
Winter 2012-13, pp 13-26.
2 In its analysis, the CBO examined real GDP expend-iture components against its estimate for real potential 
output. See Congressional Budget Offi   ce, What Ac-
counts for the Slow Growth of the Economy After the Recession?, November 2012.3 The starting point for the analysis is the CBO’s most 
recent estimate of nominal potential output, against 
which the values for the expenditure components are 
examined. The ratios were regressed on the output 
gap, with linear trends additionally included segment- 
by- segment. The cyclical effect was then calculated 
using estimated regression coeffi   cients for the output 
gap. The underlying observation period for the estima-tion runs from spring 1953 to 2007 Q4. This comprises 
complete business cycles, which, for this analysis, are 
measured from peak to peak, as defi  ned by the NBER. The analysis examined whether the cyclical effect is de-pendent on the sign of the output gap. However, evi-dence to this effect could only be found in private resi-dential construction and in net exports, if at all; a sym-metrical approach was therefore assumed for the rest of the analysis. Additionally, a similar calculation based 
on real ratios was performed at the same time. This 
analysis came qualitatively to similar results. However, 
as the real ratios could not be interpreted as shares, 
the calculated changes and contributions do not add 
up.Deutsche Bundesbank

lical patterns, compared with previous aver-
ages.
In this regard, the CBO’s estimates of po-
tential GDP suggest that aggregate capacity utilisation fell by 7½ percentage points over 
the last recession. Consequently, based on 
previous business cycles, a decline of 
3¼ percentage points in private consump-
tion relative to potential output would have 
been expected. In reality, however, private 
consumption slid by 5 percentage points 
relative to potential output, thus emphasis-ing the exceptionally weak consumption in the last downturn. According to the CBO’s 
calculations, capacity utilisation has gone 
up by only 1½ percentage points since the cycle hit its trough in spring 2009. Looking 
at previous cycles, private consumption should have improved by ¾ percentage 
point relative to potential output. However, 
with an increase of 1¾ percentage points, 
this has more than doubled. Thus, private consumption has not weighed on the re-
covery; on the contrary, it has been an im-portant driver of growth. However, this im-
provement should be seen against the 
background of the slump in consumption in 
the previous recession. Since then, two- thirds of the cyclically adjusted decline in consumption relative to potential output 
has been recovered.
A breakdown of private consumption ac-
cording to spending on goods and spend-
ing on services also returned some inter-
esting results. While both ratios fell more sharply in the most recent recession than 
had been expected based on previous downturns, the decline in the consump-
tion of goods was somewhat greater than the fall- off in demand for services. On the other hand, during the recovery, only the 
consumption of goods increased relative 
to  potential output; demand for services 
did not. When adjusted for the impact of the aggregate output gap, the consump-tion of goods over potential output is, in fact, higher at the current end than it was 
during the last cyclical peak. Conse-
quently, the  demand for services taken by itself was  remarkably weak in the current recovery. A more in- depth analysis shows that this applies in particular to the hous-
ing subsector of services and is directly 
related to the problems in the real estate market.

A similar pattern can also be found in the 
other expenditure components. If the cyc-

housing have fallen relative to potential output by just 
over ½ percentage point over the last three and a half years, which explains fully the decline in the equivalent 
ratios for services as a whole. When adjusted for the 
impact of the output gap, the residual subcomponents of service consumption show a slight increase relative to potential output. However, the current values repre-
sent an overall balance and are not indicative of whether individual subcomponents developed posi-
tively or negatively.Actual and cyclically adjusted ratios of private consumption to potential output in the USA

lically adjusted changes in the GDP com-
ponents relative to potential output during 
the last recession are plotted on the hori-
zontal axis of a coordinate system and the 
equivalent changes during the current re-
covery are plotted on the vertical axis, the 
expenditure components, whose values 
have fallen relative to potential output in both phases, will show up in the south- 
west quadrant. This is indicative of a loss in structural importance. In addition to private 
residential construction, this implies only 
those subcomponents which are related to the real estate market, specifi  cally compon-
ents which involve private demand for ser-
vices (predominantly in the housing sector) 
and private non- residential construction. 
Owing to their procyclical behaviour in the downturn as well as in the upswing, aggre-gate business gross investment and private consumption are to be found in the north- 
west quadrant. In contrast, public demand 
and net exports, located in the south- east 
quadrant, had a stabilising effect: their cyc-
lically adjusted value relative to potential 
output increased during the recession, but 
decreased during the  recovery.
When adjusted for typical cyclical effects, it 
is evident that the expenditure components 
have deviated from previous patterns both 
in the recent downturn and the current up-
swing. Private residential construction in-
vestment diminished in importance in both phases, which can be attributed to the ne-
cessary adjustment processes on the real estate market. In addition, public demand 
and net exports have had a greater damp-
ening effect than usual on both the upward and downward cyclical swings. By contrast, private consumption and business gross in-
vestment have intensifi  ed the fl  uctuations 
compared with the typical cyclical pattern. 
This means that these components grew relatively favourably during the economic recovery, following an above- average loss 
of importance during the recession.Changes in the cyclically adjusted ratios

sumption to rise at the same pace as income 
during the upswing.27
Reasons why (real) income has grown only 
moderately are to be found in the labour mar -
ket, which was hit particularly hard by the last 
recession.28 In the recession and at the begin -
ning of the upswing, firms undertook major ef-
forts to reduce their labour costs and thus re -
store their profitability. Although this adjust -
ment is considerably different from the path 
taken, for instance, by firms in the United King-
dom (see the box on pages 28-30), it was a 
necessary precondition for the strong recovery 
of business investment in machinery and equip-
ment, a key pillar of the US economy in the 
past few years. What is surprising is that cost 
cutting – at least in the macroeconomic aggre-
gates – was achieved solely by cutting jobs and not at all by slashing wages. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), aver -
age nominal hourly wages in the private (non- farm) sector even continued their steady rise. It was only under the weight of high unemploy-ment that their growth slowed down, although it stabilised quickly at a rate near the Fed’s cur -
rent inflation target of 2%. This macroeco -
nomic finding could be a sign of strong resist-Continuing

28 Thus, in the wake of the economic downswing, total 
hours worked in the commercial sector, which is calculated 
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, was cut back by nearly 
9%, whereas the output produced by this sector fell by 
only just under 7%. Restricting the observation period to 
the recession as dated by the NBER even obscures the ex-
tent of the gloom because the number of hours worked peaked prior to aggregate output but only hit its trough 
after output. In actual fact, the number of hours worked in the commercial sector was reduced by more than 10% be-
tween spring 2007 and autumn 2009; at the same time, 
however, hourly productivity was up by 6¼%. Even though massive downsizing in connection with great leaps in prod-uctivity initially engendered fears of a renewed and drawn- out “jobless recovery”, the job market began to recover in 
2010. Despite a rise of 6% in total over the past three years, total hours worked in the commercial sector re

ance to nominal wage cuts.29 From a macro -
economic perspective, forgoing wage cuts 
probably worsened downsizing, with simula -
tions using macroeconomic models suggesting 
that the employment gains resulting from a 
downward adjustment in wages would ultim -
ately have more than offset the nominal in -
come losses of wage and salary earners in their 
impact on real GDP as well as on households’ 
real incomes and consumer spending.30
Supply- side factors 
The moderate growth in employment over the 
past few years could also indicate a slowdown in trend growth, however. Whereas it is mainly demand- side factors which cause short- run de-
viations and fluctuations, aggregate output fol-
lows a long- run growth path which is deter -
mined by the supply side. In order to abstract 
from cyclical factors and estimate an econo -
my’s potential output, a variety of procedures 
are used in practice, though none can be clas-
sified as ideal (see box on pages  31 to 35). 
However, an approach on the basis of a simple production function showing how labour, cap-
ital and technology are combined to produce goods and services illustrates the key factors which drive aggregate production capacity 
growth.
Potential hours worked, in particular, are 
shaped by longer- term developments, not least 
because a substantial role is played not only by 
labour force participation, working hours and unemployment, as would result from normal utilisation of aggregate capacity, but also by the growth and structure of the population.  Although the United States is still performing 
favourably in terms of population growth com-
pared with many other industrial countries, this 
perspective obscures the profound structural 
change taking place within the US population. Since 1998, the growth of the entire working- 
age (aged 16 and up) residential population is 
outpacing that of the group aged 25 to 54, which accounts for the majority of employed persons. According to data from the Census 
Bureau, the number of persons in this “prime 
age group” has been stagnant since 2010, 
whereas the total employment- age population 
has been growing by nearly 1% annually. The 
share of persons aged 25 to 54 in the residen-tial population according to this definition was 
five percentage points lower in 2011 than in 
1997, whereas the percentage of older persons rose by virtually the same amount. This demo-graphic change is being driven by the ageing of 
the “baby boomers”, the name given to the generation born during the period of surging Aging of “baby

Weak productivity performance in the United Kingdom 
in comparison with the United States
While the United States economy is experi-
encing a moderate upswing, the growth 
path of the United Kingdom has been no-
ticeably fl  attened for quite some time now. 
In price- adjusted terms, the aggregate out-
put of the UK economy has been expand-
ing by 1% on average over the past three 
years, compared with annual growth in real GDP of just over 2% in the United States. It is striking that the British economy has been creating new jobs in spite of the stagnation over the past quarters. According to the La-bour Force Survey of the UK Offi   ce for Na-
tional Statistics, employment in the United 
Kingdom at the end of 2012 was up on its pre- crisis level, and thus also up on its pre-vious all- time high of 2008. In line with this, 
developments in labour productivity have 
been subdued. In the context of the typical cyclical pattern, where employment follows 
overall output, this is generally referred to as a “productivity puzzle”. By contrast, US 
fi  rms began recruiting more staff only after growth in real economic output had picked up again noticeably.
Although it is not unusual for European economies to undergo a longer period of depressed labour productivity than in the United States (among the reasons for this are particular institutional features of the 
different labour markets and national wel-
fare and social security systems), the British case stands out in terms of its marked per-
sistence. It is important in this context to distinguish how much temporary factors 
are currently hampering labour productivity or if its long- term trend path has fl  attened. 
Having said that, it is all but impossible to 
quantify the size of the productivity gap, 
ie the difference between actual productiv-
ity and its trend level. Estimations by the Bank of England suggest that the level of productivity is more than 10% below its 
long- term path at present.1 Conversely, it is 
unclear ex ante how much structural dam-
age was suffered by the British economy 
during the 2008 recession and how much 
smaller the gap is that needs to be closed. 
Since the assessment of overall production 
capacities plays a major role in this regard, 
these questions concern key areas of eco-
nomic policy. In view of the complexity and 
scope of these relationships, it may be as-
sumed, however, that there is no single 
cause. It is more likely that the interplay of 
a large number of factors has contributed to the slowdown in British productivity 
growth.
The British labour market, which in recent 
years has been marked by growth in private 
sector employment, is a key explanatory 
factor in this. The number of public sector 
employees, however, has been falling 
steadily since the end of 2009 and recently 
hit a ten- year low. In the private services sector, in particular, which accounts for more than three- quarters of employment, 
the number of jobs remained stable during 
the past recession and recently went up again. It is possible that enterprises in the 
United Kingdom – unlike fi  rms in the United 
States  – held on to staff during the eco-

nomic downturn and used other channels 
of adjustment instead. The common hy-
pothesis of labour hoarding is contradicted, however, fi  rstly by the marked gross aggre-
gate employment fl  ows, ie the continuing high number of recruitments and lay- offs 
along with a net increase in the number of 
persons in work. Secondly, it is to be ex-pected that a cyclical hoarding of labour should dampen labour productivity only 
temporarily.
The structure of the UK working population 
has shifted signifi  cantly since 2008. For ex-
ample, the number of self- employed per-
sons had risen by almost 10% by the end of 2012 and is still trending upwards. Further-
more, there has been an increase in the 
 importance of part- time employment both 
in the period before the Olympic Games in 
London and afterwards. In the United States, there has admittedly been an even 
sharper increase in the number of persons 
who,  either voluntarily or involuntarily, work only reduced hours. Their percentage share 
in total employment has been declining again since 2009, however, and stood at 
less than one- fi  fth at the end of the period 
under  review. In the United Kingdom, by 
contrast, already more than one- quarter of all employed persons are in part- time work. 
Nonetheless, the increase in part- time jobs 
can at most only partly explain the weak-
ness of output per person employed, since productivity relative to the number of hours worked is depressed, too.
According to a study by the Offi   ce for  National Statistics, enterprises, especially 
those in the services sector, are increasingly 
operating in an environment characterised 
by weakening competitive pressure.2 From 
an intra- sectoral perspective, differences in 
productivity between individual fi  rms have thus increased without ineffi   cient enter-
prises having been pushed out of the mar-
ket. This may also have something to do with the currently relatively low lending rates and the disinclination of many ailing 
banks to write off credit claims. The exist-ence of “zombie fi  rms” – depending on the scale and duration – can generate consider-
able macroeconomic distortions and ultim-
ately lead to misallocations of capital.3 
 Together with the restricted lending of the 
 fi  nancial sector, the opportunities for new innovative fi  rms to enter the market is  reduced and investment activity is damp-
ened.
In actual fact, private non- residential gross 
fi  xed capital formation has shown markedly 
weaker growth than in the United States following the cyclically induced downturn in 2008. The latest reading was 10¼% down on its pre- crisis level, whereas US 
business investment was only 4¼% below 
its level of early 2008 and is still on an up-
ward trend. Numerous factors could have 
played a part in the persistently gloomy UK 
investment climate. Besides the aforemen-
tioned frictions in the allocation of capital, 
heightened cyclical uncertainty and stag-
nating private consumption may have pre-

birth rates following the Second World War. 
Since labour force participation drops quite rapidly from the age of 55, this shift in the 
population structure would have led to a per -
ceptible decline in the aggregate labour force 
participation rate even if the last few years had 
not seen changes in gender- specific and age-  
specific labour force participation.31
To make matters more difficult with regard to 
demographic change, the gender- specific and 
age- specific labour force participation rates 
have been developing less favourably in terms 
of the aggregate potential labour force. Par -
ticularly the process of integrating women into 
employment, which gave a boost to the total 
labour force participation rate up until the turn 
of the century, appears to have been com -
pleted now. The slight downward trend in the 
labour force participation rate of middle- aged 
men is continuing at the same time. Although 
the number of older persons remaining in the 
labour market longer than usual is increasing, the labour force participation rate of youth and young adults is falling owing to longer periods 
of education and training. Given this long- run 
trend, the often- cited assertion that a large 
part of the decline in the aggregate labour 
force participation rate in the past few years is 
cyclically related seems questionable. Indeed, the participation rate of 63.7% for 2012 was 
forecast as the trend participation rate by Aar -
onson et al (2006) years before the economic 
and financial crisis.32 The BLS now assumes 
that the labour force participation rate, which 
peaked at 67.1% in 1997-2000, will fall further 
to 62.5% by 2020 and even as low as 58.5% … and less 
 favourable  development  
of age-specific labour force participationvented British fi  rms from substantially ex-
panding their capital stock. Therefore, the 
ratio of utilised capital to employment has 
declined, which is also likely to have had an adverse impact on labour productivity. Con-
versely, low productivity stifl  es enterprises’ 
investment activity through high unit labour costs and reduced profi  tability.
Substitution effects in favour of the factor 
 labour are also likely to have contributed sig-nifi  cantly to dampened productivity. Whereas 
the total number of hours worked in the 
United States at the current end continues to fall signifi  cantly short of its pre- crisis level, it has recovered perceptibly more quickly in the 
United Kingdom since 2008 –  even when compared with earlier economic down-
turns – and was recently up on its previous 
cyclical peak again. The  variability in the average number of hours worked can be viewed as an indication of the fl  exibility on 
the British labour market in recent years. At 
the same time, the average nominal hourly wage in the private sector has been growing 
at a depressed rate similar to that in the 
United States. Given that consumer price in-fl  ation has been greater than the rise in the 
nominal wage over the past few years, 
households have had to accept a fall in their 
real labour incomes. Furthermore, asset 
losses may have prevented members of the 
labour force from exiting the labour market, 
with British fi  rms therefore having access to 
a large supply of  labour.
All things considered, only individual pieces 
of the British productivity puzzle can be 
 explained. A clear solution to the puzzle as 
a whole, however, has remained elusive to 
date. It may possibly be a refl  ection of an 
adjustment process towards a new macro-
economic balance. The extent to which 
structural or cyclical factors are the driving 
force behind this depressed productivity growth is a question whose answer de-
pends on how long the phenomenon per-
sists.

Determining aggregate trend output in the USA
It is not possible to pinpoint with certainty 
the location of an economy in the cycle at 
the current end. There are two main rea-
sons for this: fi  rst, important data are not always readily available and second, these data are sometimes subject to revision many years down the line. This is com-pounded by the fact that it is not always 
possible to determine unequivocally, on the 
basis of the observed data changes, to what extent these refl  ect a change in the underlying trend, the economic cycle, or disturbance terms. With regard to the 
monthly and quarterly data typically exam-
ined in a business cycle analysis, the change in the growth trend between individual ob-
servation points is generally very small and 
therefore barely identifi  able. Shifts in the 
underlying pace can, however, be seen over 
a longer period of time. In the event of a 
marked deceleration, for example, the cyc-lical component would ultimately be incor-
rectly evaluated if an unchanged growth 
trend were extrapolated. Against the back-drop of only moderate growth in real gross 
domestic product (GDP) in the USA in re-cent years, a number of methods used in 
practice to determine the growth in and the 
level of aggregate trend output are pre-
sented below.
It is not uncommon to use purely statistical 
methods for the purpose of trend extrac-
tion. The simplest approach involves calcu-
lating the average rate of change in aggre-
gate output over a certain period of time. 
This is equivalent to approximating the trend growth by taking the gradient of a 
straight line which has been adjusted to the logarithmic time series of real GDP . A trend 
output level is also derived in the process. 
The log- linear trend of economic activity in the USA is sometimes calculated for the fi  ve or ten- year period leading up to the last cyclical peak in the fi  nal quarter of 2007 and then extrapolated. Real GDP has not 
been anywhere close to this level since the severe one- and- a- half-year recession, which lasted from the beginning of 2008 up until 
the second quarter of 2009. Such a com-parison has nonetheless been ventured in 
order to illustrate the serious repercussions 
of the economic and fi  nancial crisis. Work-ing on the assumption that this dampening effect primarily affects real business activity itself and not so much the trend, this would result in a substantial underutilisation of ag-gregate capacity.
However, great caution should be exercised 
when analysing such trend rates and any 
comparisons based thereon. Constellations 
in which real GDP did not return to its thus 
determined previous trend path can be con-
structed for numerous other US recessions 
over the last few decades. This is ultimately due to the diffi   culties involved in selecting a 
suitable reference period for determining 
the trend growth. Although the period dir-
ectly succeeding the most recent cyclical 
peak fully encompasses the last (severe) re-
cession, it only covers part of the current 
expansion phase if it is assumed that no re-
newed downturn is currently underway or 
imminent. By contrast, the reference period up to the fi  nal quarter of 2007 with a time 
span of fi  ve years is based purely on a 
period of expansion; the ten- year segment 
would cover the entire expansion phase, 
the mild recession at the beginning of the 
millennium and part of the preceding up-
swing. Owing to the asymmetric cyclical ef-fects, it is not surprising that the calculated trend growth in the reference period is rela-
tively high and that real GDP has failed to 
reach the extrapolated trend path of late. It Deutsche Bundesbank

is therefore important to ensure when gen-
erating average rates or (log) linear trends 
that they are based on a complete eco-
nomic cycle, ie measured from peak to peak or trough to trough.
1,2
This leads to an interesting thought experi-
ment. Had the US economy slipped back 
into recession at the beginning of 2013, it 
would have been possible to compare real 
GDP in the fi  nal quarter of 2012 with that 
of the fi  nal quarter of 2007, which would 
have yielded a virtually fl  at trend. However, the longer the current expansion phase per-
sists, the steeper the trend determined in 
this way could become. What is then ultim-ately classed as a trend is therefore also de-
pendent on how the economy develops. 
This means that forecasts of future develop-ments are therefore also relevant at the cur-rent end.
One known problem is that of the end point in connection with the widely used trend extraction method based on the 
Hodrick- Prescott fi  lter (HP fi  lter).3 If the time 
series ends in proximity to its cyclical peak, 
the impact of the upswing biases the trend 
determined using this statistical procedure 
upward. If it ends close to its cyclical trough, however, the trend will be shown as being 
too weak against the backdrop of the re-
cession. If the HP fi  lter is used for the period 
up to the fi  nal quarter of 2007, for the 
period up to the fi  nal quarter of 2009 or for 
the period up to the current end, the ex-
tracted trend paths for real US GDP are ac-
cordingly either steep or fl  at.4 A common 
way of alleviating the end point problem is 
to smooth the time series that have been 
projected into the future. If the GDP series 
is extrapolated using the rather favourable 
forecasts of the participants at the recent 
meeting of the Federal Open Market Com-
mittee (FOMC), the trend at the current end 
becomes somewhat steeper, though no perceptible decline in aggregate output is apparent when compared with its derived 
trend path. Only subdued growth in trend 
output is shown for the period from 2007 
to 2011, as the fi  lter does not sift out the impact of the comparatively long and se-vere recession if the usual value of the smoothing parameter for quarterly data is 
being used.
The procedures presented so far are purely 
statistical instruments. They do not provide 
an economically substantiated analysis of

2 Given that the recent recession is thought to have 
been triggered by undesirable macroeconomic devel-
opments in the preceding boom period, among other 
factors, measuring the trend rate from one cyclical 
trough to the next might turn out to be the preferable approach.3 See OECD (2009), The Sensitivity of Output Gap Es-
timates to the End- Point Treatment, Economic Out-
look, No 85, pp 225-226.4 When applying the HP fi  lter to real- time data for real US GDP up to the fi  nal quarter of 2007, for example, as were made available at the beginning of 2008 and 
are today provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, this results in a marginally higher trend 
path. According to Bundesbank calculations, however, the effect resulting from the subsequent data revision appears to be weaker for the previous years than the impact of the extended observation period.Log-linear trends for real US GDP

the forces which drive growth in aggregate 
production capacity and thus ultimately de-termine the trend in output along the lines 
of the potential output. By contrast, pro-duction function- based approaches allow 
the trend developments of the supply- side 
factors required for the manufacture of 
goods and services to be factored in when 
deriving the growth trend.5 Nevertheless, 
statistical trend extraction methods are also used here, albeit on a different level, when 
adjusting individual determinants, such as 
age- specifi  c labour force participation rates 
or total factor productivity, for cyclical fac-
tors.
An estimate based on a simple Cobb- Douglas production function with two input factors, as used by the CBO (2001), will be outlined below.
6 A Cobb- Douglas 
function postulates constant production elasticities for labour and capital input, which are approximated using the corres-
ponding income shares. A major difference 
between this function and the CBO’s ap-
proach is that the production function used 
here is not restricted to the corporate sec-
tor, but is applied to the economy as a whole. Furthermore, important time series 
are fed into the HP fi  lter after extrapolation with medium to long- term projected values 
in order to adjust for cyclical factors, 
whereas the CBO estimates linear trends for 
those cycles that are measured from peak 
to peak. Specifi  cally, the most recent projec-tions of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 
for 2020 serve as the reference point for 
the forecast of the age group- specifi  c la-
bour force participation rate.7 The size and 
structure of the population develop in line 
with the Census Bureau’s middle scenario 
with regard to birth rate, life expectancy and net immigration. The natural rate of 
unemployment is derived using the Kalman 
fi  lter and is projected into the future as a constant.
8 Unlike in the past, no further downward trend in the number of hours 
worked per employee is expected in view of 
the marked recovery which followed the sharp drop during the last recession. The 
estimates of capital input are based on BLS data
9 and the assumption that capital input

participation rate from the previously determined 
 potential labour force participation rate serve as obser-vations here. The estimate, which is also based on cer-
tain assumptions with regard to starting values and

in the household and public sectors has 
been affected over the last years by damp-
ening effects stemming from the problems 
in the real estate market and the fi  scal con-
solidation measures.10 In order to forecast 
capital input for the economy as a whole 
over the medium to long term, use is made 
of a previous trend in capital intensity. With 
regard to growth in total factor productiv-
ity, a return to the long- term average rate is 
expected, after only comparatively modest 
progress was achieved in the years immedi-ately prior to the onset of the recent reces-sion.
11
Under these not implausible assumptions, US production capacity could grow by 
around 2% on average up until 2020. The 
main reason for the subdued underlying pace by historical standards is the rather modest growth in potential labour input, 
which is also dampening growth in capital 
input. Growth in aggregate potential out-
put has been considerably weaker over the past few years owing to the ripple effects of 
the recession and previous undesirable 
macroeconomic developments. This fore-
cast is at the lower end of the spectrum 
when compared with other estimates of 
potential growth. The range of the various results illustrates the uncertainty associated with such estimates.
12
That said, there is even greater uncertainty 
surrounding the estimation of the level of potential output at the current end and 
thus also the output gap, defi  ned as the dif-
ference between real GDP and potential output. This is due, in part, to the way in which the starting level is fi  xed. Further-more, small differences in the estimated 
growth rates of potential output can accu-
mulate over a longer period of time and re-
sult in substantial differences between 
levels. The estimation presented here, for 
example, at just under -2% of late, implies 
a signifi  cantly lower underutilisation of ag-
gregate capacity in the USA than in the es-timates published by international organisa-

2012-18.12 In its Economic Outlook from November 2012, the 
OECD forecast that potential growth in the US econ-
omy would accelerate by 2.0% on average in 2013 
and 2014. By contrast, the IMF forecasts for real GDP and the output gap published in the World Economic 
Outlook of October 2012 imply that aggregate cap-
acity will grow by an average of 2.2% between 2013 and 2017. In line with its most recent Budget and Eco-
nomic Outlook of February 2013, the CBO is also ex-
pecting potential growth to increase by 2.2% on aver-age between 2013 and 2023. Fernald (2012) estimates an underlying pace of 2.1% for the coming years. The estimates of the participants at the recent meeting of 
the US Federal Open Market Committee regarding long- term growth in real US GDP ranged from 2.0% to 3.0%. The central tendency, in which the three highest and lowest values are excluded, was 2.3% to 2.5%. According to the estimate presented here, 
one reason for the comparatively low potential growth rate could be that this estimate is already based on the 
current demographic projections of the Census Bur-
eau. Compared with previous estimates, the statistical 
offi   ce is projecting signifi  cantly less favourable demo-
graphic developments. See Census Bureau, What a

by 2050.33 It must admittedly be noted with 
regard to such projections that labour force 
participation is also affected by factors such as 
real wage growth, legal regulations and net im-
migration flows, which are difficult or impos -
sible to predict.
On the whole, slower population growth, the 
shifting age structure and the unfavourable de-
velopment of age- specific labour force partici -
pation imply that the potential labour force is 
currently expanding, and will continue to grow, only at a fraction of the pace in earlier decades. 
In fact, even if potential labour productivity 
continues to make advances at an unchanged 
rate, the growth of aggregate production cap-
acity has to be considerably lower.34 What 
needs to be taken into account, however, is 
that, given slower growth of cyclically adjusted 
hours worked, capital input does not need to 
be expanded to the same degree as previously 
and is therefore likely to also be making a re -
duced contribution to growth.Above and beyond these long- run develop -
ments, the turmoil churned up by the recent 
recession is likely to have temporarily affected 
… are reasons 
for relatively weak growth  
of the potential labour forcetions.13 In light of such discrepancies, it is 
advisable to treat these data with caution. 
Experience has shown that, owing to the 
unreliability when estimating the trend out-
put at the current end, subsequent revisions of the output gap can be equally as large as the output gap itself.
14
On the whole, current estimates suggest that, by historical standards, the US econ-
omy is expanding at a subdued underlying 
pace. The expansionary forces are likely to 
have weakened, especially in view of the demographic change, which is probably also having an indirect impact by way of 
the slower expansion in capital input. Given 
the lesser signifi  cance of the accumulation 
of the factors of production, growth in ag-gregate trend output will largely depend on 
developments in total factor productivity, 
which are diffi   cult to predict.13 In October 2012, the IMF estimated the gap be-
tween real US GDP and potential output last year to 
stand at -4.1%, compared with the OECD’s estimate of 
-3.7%. The most recent estimates of the CBO for 2012 indicate an output gap of as much as -5.7% of poten-tial output. The persisting high level of underutilisation of aggregate capacity is one reason why these organ-
isations are anticipating a signifi  cant increase in real 
GDP growth in the coming years. For further informa-tion on the treatment of negative output gaps in con-nection with forecasts, see Offi   ce for Budget Responsi-bility, Is It Plausible to Assume a Negative Output Gap after Five Years?, Economic and Fiscal Outlook, March 2013, pp 45-46.

34 Not only the potential labour force but also the natural 
unemployment rate and potential average hours worked are key factors affecting potential total hours worked. It should be noted in this connection that hours worked per employee have returned to normal following the sharp decline during the recent recession. The long- term downward trend of this 
metric seems to have been halted, thereby counteracting to some degree the weaker growth rate of the potential hours worked. According to the latest CBO estimate, the potential labour force is likely to increase by only ½% on average for the years 2013-23, compared with an annual increase of just 
over 1½% from 1950 to 2001. Given a more or less stable 
increase in potential labour productivity, defined here as the 
ratio of potential output to the potential labour force, the 
middle growth rate of cyclically adjusted real GDP falls from 3½% to 2¼%. For the 2002-12 period, the CBO expects the potential labour force to grow by an annual average of ¾% and potential output to rise by an annual average of likewise 2¼%, with potential labour productivity hence increasing by 
1½%. See Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2013 to 2023, February 
2013, pp 44-45.Deutsche Bundesbank

the growth of potential output.35 A rise in the 
natural unemployment level, ie unemployment 
even under normal capacity utilisation, has 
been the subject of particular public debate. 
The waste of human capital through long- term 
unemployment, a “mismatch” between labour 
supply and labour demand owing to sectoral shifts, and extended unemployment benefits 
could have contributed to such an increase. Al-
though estimates of the size of this effect vary 
considerably, plausible approaches show that 
the rise in the actual unemployment rate is largely due to cyclical factors.
36 Furthermore, 
the slump in investment during the recession 
put the brakes on growth of the capital stock. In the private household sector, the real estate 
crisis is likely to have constrained the use of owner- occupied housing,
37 whereas public 
capital input growth has probably been held back recently by fiscal consolidation. Lastly, 
total factor productivity growth may also have 
weakened owing, for instance, to constraints in the reallocation of resources across eco
-
nomic sectors, firms’ research and develop -
ment activities or workers’ efforts to acquire new skills.

Deutsche Bundesbank35 In a recent empirical study, Haltmaier (2012) observed 
that recessions perceptibly dampen the growth of potential 
output in the subsequent period. For advanced economies, the size of the effect depends on the depth of the preced-ing downswing. See J Haltmaier (2012), Do Recessions Af-
fect Potential Output?, Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, International Finance Discussion Papers 
No 1066.

(2012), A Search and Matching Approach to Labor Mar -
kets: Did the Natural Rate of Unemployment Rise?, Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol 26, pp 3-26.37 Steindel (2009) estimates that, even under rather strong 
assumptions, the slower growth in housing, the contrac -
tion of financial services and conceivable spillover effects taken together could lead to a reduction in annual GDP growth of not more than around ¼ percentage point. See C Steindel (2009), Implications of the Financial Crisis 
for Potential Growth: Past, Present, and Future, Federal Re-serve Bank of New York, Staff Reports, No 408.38 See Congressional Budget Office, Lasting Effects of the 
Recent Recession and the Ensuing Economic Weakness on Potential Output, An Update to the Budget and Economic 
Outlook: Fiscal Years 2012 to 2022, August 2012, pp 40-
41. All in all, CBO (2012) has reduced its projection for the level of potential output in 2022 by 1½% owing to various recession effects. It has lowered its projection by a total of 
around 7% since 2007, however. According to the data, 
the revision is due in large part to a reassessment of long- term trends.Deutsche Bundesbank

duced capital growth which is likely to have 
been holding back potential output growth to 
a considerable extent during the recent reces-
sion and subsequent recovery.39 If energy is re-
garded as a factor of production in its own 
right, the sharp oil price rises and resulting cut-
backs in consumption are likely to have had a 
dampening effect, too.40
On balance, the weaker real GDP growth over 
the past three and a half years compared with the two preceding cyclical recoveries can be at-tributed largely to slower growth in aggregate 
production capacity; this explains, at the very 
least, a large part of the gap behind the previ-ous recoveries. In the long term, it is, above all, 
profound demographic change which lies be -hind this flattening of the potential output 
path. In addition, over the short term, it is the 
considerably reduced growth in capital input which, more than anything, is likely to have 
exerted a retarding influence. As the underlying 
pace slows down, there is a growing threat that exogenous factors will push the growth rate of real GDP down to or below the zero 
line, which is critical for the standard definition 
of a recession. Slower produc-
tion capacity growth is the reason for weaker GDP growth

Macroprudential oversight in Germany: 
framework, institutions and tools
The Act on Monitoring Financial Stability (Gesetz zur Überwachung der Finanzstabilität), also 
referred to as the Financial Stability Act (Finanzstabilitätsgesetz), came into force at the beginning 
of 2013, establishing a legal framework for macroprudential oversight in Germany. The Financial Stability Committee (Ausschuss für Finanzstabilität) was set up as Germany’s national macropru-dential institution and convened for the first time in mid- March. This has created a new institu-
tional structure for cooperation between the Federal Government, the Federal Financial Supervis-ory Authority (BaFin) and the Deutsche Bundesbank in the field of financial stability. The Financial 
Stability Act bestows important functions on the Bundesbank. The Bank is responsible, in particu-
lar, for analysing factors that are key to financial stability, identifying risks, making proposals to 
the Financial Stability Committee regarding the issuing of warnings and recommendations, and 
evaluating the implementation of such warnings and recommendations.
The need to set up macroprudential institutions with clearly defined mandates and to develop a 
corresponding toolkit are two key lessons learnt from the financial crisis, as misalignments within 
the financial system provided the root causes of why the financial crisis was so persistent and 
severe. This experience has served as a reminder of the importance of systemic risk. The macro-
prudential dimension of financial supervision and regulation therefore aims to restrict systemic 
risk and thus to help to maintain financial stability.
At present, there are a number of challenges facing macroprudential oversight in Germany. A 
coherent strategy will need to be developed, including an analytical framework for identifying 
and evaluating risks as well as a system of intermediate objectives and, where possible, oper -
ational targets. New EU legislation is about to be passed on important macroprudential tools. 
Further economic analyses will be needed to document as fully as possible how these tools 
would work – and what the side effects would be – should they be deployed. When using macro-prudential instruments, it is essential to weigh up the pros and cons of applying a discretionary versus a rules- based approach.Deutsche Bundesbank

Framework
The macroprudential 
 approach: a lesson learnt from 
the financial crisis
The financial crisis began in 2007, when nu -
merous financial institutions suffered losses on 
structured securities, bringing some to the 
verge of collapse. Prior misalignments then 
came to light, such as an erosion of credit 
standards for mortgage loans in the United States or questionable practices in assigning credit ratings. At the same time, weaknesses 
became apparent in the business models of 
some banks which were heavily reliant on 
short-  term funding and had accumulated a 
high level of concentration risk. Following the 
collapse of US investment bank Lehman Broth-ers in the autumn of 2008, the turmoil spread, 
escalating into a systemic crisis. As banks rap -
idly lost confidence in one another, important 
bank funding markets dried up. Consequently, 
central banks felt compelled to substantially in-crease their provision of liquidity to the banking 
system. At the same time, failing banks – in -
cluding some in Germany – had to be bailed 
out by the state.
Misalignments within the financial system itself 
evidently provided the root causes of why the 
financial crisis was so persistent and severe. 
This experience has served as a reminder of the 
key influence of systemic risk on the macroeco-nomic costs of financial instability. The financial system is not only affected passively by external 
misalignments (“exogenous shocks”) stem -
ming, for example, from the real economy or 
from fiscal policy; the internal workings and 
structures of the financial system itself can also 
actively encourage stability risks to build up and 
instability to spread and intensify. These en -
dogenous mechanisms which originate in the 
financial system and can cause or amplify crises 
are called systemic risks.1
The literature on financial stability distinguishes 
between two features of systemic risk.2 The first is the “time dimension” of systemic risk, 
where procyclical forces in the financial system 
lead to a gradual build- up of potential vulner -
abilities. This procyclicality encourages a se -
quence of ever greater excesses. In such 
periods of exuberance, market participants are willing to take high risks, or they systematically 
underestimate the riskiness of financial invest-
ments. This increases market liquidity and im -
proves financing conditions, but also promotes 
private sector debt. If doubts then emerge about the sustainability of this trend, the tide 
may turn, triggering a flight to safety. Market 
participants then largely shy away from risk, 
which can cause risky assets to fall in value dra-
matically. At the same time, the liquidity situ -
ation and financing conditions worsen, causing 
an additional drag on macroeconomic activity. 
Furthermore, risk concentrations mean that once disruptions have occurred, they spread throughout the financial system (the “cross-  
sectional dimension” of systemic risk). A num -
ber of different phenomena play a role in this 
development, including unidirectional risks at 
numerous individual financial institutions, inter -
connectedness via central markets or infra -
structures, the existence of systemically import-
ant entities and the domino effects that these 
entities trigger if they experience financial dis -
tress.3
Ensuring the solvency of each individual finan-
cial institution is key for the stability of the fi -
nancial system as a whole, yet that alone is not 
enough to maintain financial stability. Each in -
dividual financial institution may well continue 
to fulfil solvency requirements even as serious 
systemic risks are building up. If these systemic risks ultimately materialise, substantial solvency problems may arise – often affecting several fi-nancial institutions at the same time. As well as Misalignments

ensuring the solvency of individual financial in-
stitutions, it is therefore also necessary to de -
tect and effectively limit systemic risk as early as 
possible in order to safeguard financial stability. Consequently, it is imperative to add a macro-
prudential perspective and suitable macropru-
dential tools to regulation and supervision. The 
need to set up macroprudential institutions with clearly defined mandates is thus one of 
the key lessons learnt from the financial crisis.
Aims of macroprudential  policy 
and its links with other policy 
areas
The ultimate goal of the macroprudential di -
mension of supervision and regulation is to 
contribute to financial stability4 and thus to 
promote overall economic growth and employ-
ment. To achieve this, macroprudential over -
sight and policy are tasked with limiting sys -
temic risk. As this risk can take a number of different forms, however, a fully- fledged 
macroprudential strategy needs to be based on 
a whole range of intermediate objectives and 
operational targets. To address the time dimen-
sion of systemic risk, operational targets such 
as avoiding inappropriately high credit growth 
or excessive debt among economic agents are 
likely to play a role in such a strategy. For the 
cross- sectional dimension of systemic risk, pre-
venting a build- up of concentration risk and 
ensuring stable financial infrastructures5 are 
two important intermediate objectives. The de-bate among academics and practitioners as to what system of objectives would be most suit-able is still in full swing.
Like other economic policy objectives, the sta-
bility of the financial system can be impacted 
by other areas and policy spheres; conse -
quently, there are important overlaps between macroprudential oversight and policy and other 
fields – notably microprudential supervision, 
monetary policy and fiscal policy.Given that they both monitor the financial sys-
tem and financial institutions, there is a close 
link between macroprudential oversight and 
microprudential supervision, and it is therefore 
important to ensure close coordination be -
tween the two. Findings on potential macro -
prudential vulnerabilities help microprudential 
supervisors to identify and address institution-  
specific risks at an early stage. By the same 
token, macroprudential overseers benefit from 
information provided by microprudential super -
visors. For example, certain risks may accumu-
late at individual financial institutions which 
would not be noticed in a purely aggregate 
analysis but become systemically important be-
cause these institutions are interconnected 
with other financial intermediaries. Part of this 
coordination between macroprudential over -
sight and microprudential supervision occurs 
within the Bundesbank as, pursuant to section 7 of the German Banking Act (Gesetz über das 
Kreditwesen), the Bundesbank is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of institutions. In addition, the Bundesbank has numerous ties with BaFin, including through BaFin’s Risk 
Committee, whose meetings Bundesbank rep -
resentatives are regularly invited to attend.
There are also reciprocal effects between macroprudential oversight and other policy 
areas. For instance, monetary policy decisions 
also have an impact on financial stability, eg through their effect on asset prices. Further

4 The Bundesbank defines financial stability as the ability of 
the financial system to smoothly fulfil its key economic 
functions – in particular, the efficient allocation of financial 
resources and risks along with the provision of a well-  
functioning financial infrastructure – at all times, including in stress situations and periods of structural upheaval. See Deutsche Bundesbank, Financial Stability Review 2010, p 7.
5 The Bundesbank makes its own independent contribu -
tion to financial stability through its oversight of financial 
market infrastructures (payment settlement and securities 
settlement systems, central counterparties etc). The macro-prudential policy authority works in close cooperation with 
the parties responsible for overseeing financial market in -
frastructures in order to identify and, where necessary, ad-
dress systemic risk originating in this area. See Deutsche 
Bundesbank, The new CPSS- IOSCO Principles for financial 
market infrastructures, Monthly Report, July 2012, pp 33-

guarding monetary stability, a central bank 
helps to ensure a stable financial system, as in-
vestment decisions are not distorted by uncer -
tainty regarding future monetary value. Con -
versely, a stable financial system ensures that 
the channels of monetary policy transmission function smoothly, thus enabling the primary 
task of monetary policy – safeguarding monet-ary stability – to be fulfilled in a more targeted 
manner. Monetary and financial stability are therefore complementary objectives over the 
longer term.
Given the complementary nature of monetary 
and financial stability, macroprudential meas -
ures can ease the burden on monetary policy. 
In the absence of a macroprudential policy, 
monetary policymakers can easily come under 
pressure to use their toolkit to safeguard finan-
cial stability even though it is ill-  suited to the 
task. Furthermore, despite being complemen -
tary in the long term, the two objectives may 
clash in the short term: a measure that is advis-
able from a monetary policy perspective may 
not necessarily also be suitable for combating 
risks to financial stability. By contrast, macro -
prudential policy generally encompasses a 
broad set of instruments for achieving its aim 
of financial stability and should, therefore, be 
able to counteract specific misalignments in the 
financial system in a more targeted manner 
than through interest rate policy, for example. 
This is especially true of the euro area, where 
the single monetary policy has to be geared to 
conditions in the monetary union as a whole 
and can respond to developments in individual sectors or member states only where these af-fect aggregate euro- area inflation.
Macroprudential policy interacts with fiscal pol-
icy, too. A successful macroprudential policy 
makes financial crises less frequent and less in-
tense, thus lowering the costs of fiscal policy 
crisis measures. Conversely, fiscal policy meas -
ures can have an impact on financial stability. In 
particular, tax policy decisions may lead to 
shifts in financial resources between different 
types of investment: the tax treatment of mort-gage rates, for example, may incentivise invest-
ments in real estate which, in turn, may en -
courage excesses on the real estate markets.
Furthermore, as the sovereign debt crisis has 
shown, there is often a close negative feedback 
loop between a government and its domestic 
banking sector. This is because banks are key 
government creditors, holding large amounts of government debt in the form of securities and loans. Moreover, in the euro area, the 
banking sector accounts for the lion’s share of 
lending to the non- financial private sector. If 
credit institutions’ lending to the real economy 
were restricted unduly because of a financial 
crisis, this could consequently have a consider -
able negative impact on growth and employ -
ment, and thus ultimately on a country’s fiscal position.
Macroprudential institutions
International level
Much progress has already been made in con-
ferring macroprudential mandates on institu -
tions. At a global level, the responsibilities of 
the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Inter -
national Monetary Fund (IMF) include monitor -
ing the risk situation and risk trends within the international financial system. The FSB and the 
IMF have intensified their collaboration in this 
area at the behest of the G20: the IMF is pri-
marily responsible for identifying macrofinan -
cial vulnerabilities, ie risks stemming from the 
interaction between the real economy and the financial sector, while the FSB – in collaboration 
with national authorities – focuses on detect-
ing vulnerabilities within the financial system 
itself. The aim is to identify shortcomings in the 
international financial system, to develop pro -
posals to rectify them and to oversee any ac -
tion to implement these proposals. The FSB is 
responsible for coordinating regulatory and 
supervisory policy at the international level and 
for heightening cooperation and the exchange Macroprudential

of information between the institutions in -
volved.
The FSB has drawn up a Compendium of 
Standards for sound financial systems,6 which 
contains “key standards” considered to be de-
serving of priority implementation. The FSB’s 
member countries are obliged to meet these standards and to maintain stable, transparent 
and open financial systems. Furthermore, they 
undergo regular international peer reviews of their national financial sectors and participate in the Financial Sector Assessment Program 
(FSAP) run by the IMF and the World Bank.7
At the EU level, the European Systemic Risk 
Board (ESRB)8 took up its duties at the begin -
ning of 2011. It forms the macroprudential pil-
lar of the new European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS), with the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) making up the 
microprudential part.9 The ESRB draws on the 
combined expertise of the EU’s national central 
banks and supervisory authorities to identify 
and evaluate systemic risk. Where necessary, it issues warnings and recommendations – to EU 
institutions, national governments and super -
visory authorities10 – regarding remedial action 
in response to identified risks to financial stabil-
ity. The addressees of recommendations are 
obliged to inform the ESRB and the European 
Council of the action taken to implement them 
or to provide detailed justification for their in -
action (“act or explain” mechanism), thus mak-
ing them accountable to the EU institutions 
and the public at large.
Cooperation between  
the national and the EU level
In view of the EU’s single market and the fact 
that macroprudential measures often have 
cross- border effects, it makes sense to harmon-
ise the terms and criteria for deploying macro-
prudential instruments and to coordinate their 
use at an EU level. This will not only ensure that 
the single EU financial market functions smoothly and efficiently, but will also prevent 
national protectionism. The use of macropru -
dential tools in the EU will, therefore, be gov -
erned by the Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV) and the Capital Requirements Regula-
tion (CRR). The EU’s legislative procedure is 
about to be completed for both of these legal instruments.
The CRD IV and CRR define a single set of har -
monised prudential rules for the EU based on 
the Basel III Framework set out by the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). At 
the same time, they allow the EU’s national 
macroprudential authorities scope for policy -
making at their own discretion, eg in relation 
to the countercyclical capital buffer and sec -
toral risk weights. It is essential to allow na -
tional macroprudential authorities such leeway to stave off threats to the financial system – es-
pecially in a monetary union. National author -
ities have considerable expertise in analysing the national stability situation. In addition, 
measures may need to be tailored regionally to 
the varying legal and economic circumstances 
in the individual member states. By fine- tuning

When the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) 
is set up – from mid-2014 onwards based on 
the current stage of negotiations – national au-
thorities will retain their responsibilities and 
their ability to take action with their own na -
tional macroprudential policies. The SSM will confer asymmetric powers of intervention on 
the European Central Bank (ECB), enabling it to tighten the macroprudential measures imposed 
by an SSM member country but not to water 
down the macroprudential requirements below 
the level set by the national macroprudential 
authority. This will allow national supervisors to take action to protect their financial system but will also ensure that they cannot shield domes-
tic banks inappropriately (“inaction bias”). The 
original measures taken by national macropru-
dential authorities and any stricter measures 
imposed by the ECB will both trigger a formal 
information and consultation mechanism.11
Design of Germany’s 
 institutional framework
Germany began to apply the lessons learnt 
from the financial crisis to its financial regula -
tion soon after the crisis broke out, setting up 
individual resolution agencies for credit institu-tions’ non- performing assets,
12 creating a fund 
for recapitalising and restructuring financial in-
stitutions and imposing a temporary ban on naked short selling for certain types of secur
-
ities. In addition, the adoption of the Financial 
Stability Act,13 which entered into force at the 
beginning of 2013, was another step promot-
ing lasting stability in Germany’s financial sys -
tem.
The Financial Stability Act provides the legal 
framework for the Financial Stability Commit -
tee, Germany’s newly established national 
macroprudential institution. The Federal Minis-
try of Finance, BaFin and the Bundesbank each have three voting representatives on the Finan-
cial Stability Committee, while the Federal 
Agency for Financial Market Stabilisation (Bun-desanstalt für Finanzmarktstabilisierung) has 
one non- voting advisory member.
The Financial Stability Committee discusses the 
factors that are key to financial stability, strengthens cooperation between the institu
-
tions represented on it, advises on the handling 
of warnings and recommendations issued by the ESRB and reports annually to the lower house of Parliament (the Bundestag) on the 
situation regarding and developments in finan-
cial stability as well as on its own activities. In 
particular, the Financial Stability Committee is able to issue warnings and recommendations to all public bodies in Germany in order to promptly combat any adverse developments 
which may cause risks to financial stability. As 
with the ESRB’s recommendations, the ad -
dressees of these recommendations must ad -
here to the “act or explain” mechanism.
The Bundesbank performs important functions 
within the Financial Stability Committee and 
brings its expertise in macroprudential and macroeconomic analysis as well as in the mi
-
croprudential supervision of financial institu -
tions and infrastructures to bear. The Bank ana-
lyses factors that are key to financial stability 
and identifies risks which may impair financial 
stability. In addition, it prepares the Financial 
Stability Committee’s annual report to the Bun-destag on the situation regarding and develop-ments in financial stability in Germany. Lastly, it 
makes proposals to the Committee regarding 
the issuing of warnings and recommendations and evaluates their implementation by the ad-
dressees. The Bundesbank maintains its inde -
pendence in all of the tasks designated to it as a member of the Financial Stability Committee. … will be main-

does not advocate, as the Financial Stability 
Committee cannot take key decisions contrary 
to the votes of the Bundesbank representatives

Germany’s Financial Stability Act has imple -
mented the ESRB Recommendation on the 
macroprudential mandate of national author -
ities,15 which calls on EU member states to des-
ignate an authority entrusted with the conduct 
of macroprudential policy and to mandate it 
with the corresponding tasks. The Recommen-
dation gives member states two options for 
their institutional arrangements: the macropru-
dential authority can either be a single institu -
tion or a board composed of several institu -
tions. Whichever option a member state 
chooses, it must establish mechanisms for co -
operation among all authorities whose actions 
have a material impact on financial stability and 
ensure that the central bank plays a leading 
role in macroprudential policy.16
By conferring the national macroprudential 
mandate on the Financial Stability Committee, 
Germany has opted for a board composed of 
several institutions. This structures and – as re-
quired by the Recommendation – ensures co -
operation among the different institutions 
whose actions have a material impact on finan-cial stability. At the same time, it takes account of the complex nature of financial stability. The ultimate goal of safeguarding financial stability involves a whole range of intermediate object-ives which may relate to markets, intermediar -
ies or financial infrastructures. Moreover, meas-ures in a number of different policy areas have an impact on financial stability. This complexity is the reason why the macroprudential author -
ity has been given the power to issue warnings 
and recommendations, while the entities en -
trusted with primary tasks have retained their 
competencies. Ultimate responsibility for safe -
guarding financial stability lies with political 
bodies.Macroprudential tools
Alongside a clear regulatory and institutional 
framework, an efficient macroprudential policy 
also requires effective and efficient tools. To prevent evasive reactions and regulatory arbi
-
trage, this macroprudential toolkit must gener -
ally be applicable to all financial market partici-
pants – not only the banking sector but also 
insurance companies and areas of the financial 
market which have been less regulated up to 
now.
Macroprudential instruments can generally be 
categorised according to the legal strength of 
the intervention that they entail, ranging from 
“soft” (communication) to “intermediate” (warnings and recommendations) and “hard” 
(intervention).
Communication
As in other policy areas, public communication 
is an important tool with regard to macropru -
dential policy. As a “soft” instrument, however, 
it does not involve direct intervention in the 
business activities of market participants but in-fluences, in particular, how they form their ex-pectations. This tool should, therefore, be used at an early stage of risk formation, although its 
success depends largely on the reputation of the macroprudential institution in question. The formal obstacles for its use are low, its 
legal implications are minor – especially in com-
parison with other types of instrument – and 
the danger of unwanted side effects is usually 
small. The Bundesbank publishes its own ana -
lyses and assessments of financial stability, pri-Germany has

dential policy must not be allowed to undermine the cen-tral bank’s independence in accordance with Article 130 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (rec-ommendation B, subsection 3).Deutsche Bundesbank

marily in its Financial Stability Review but also 
in research papers, press releases and speeches.
Public communication also ensures that macro-
prudential policy is transparent. In terms of 
macroprudential oversight, this means that 
strategies and decision- making structures must 
be disclosed and macroprudential authorities held publicly accountable for their actions. Consequently, in its recommendation on the macroprudential mandate of national author
-
ities, the ESRB explicitly calls on member states 
to ensure “that the macroprudential policy strategies are set out and published by the 
macro- prudential authority”.17 It is essential for 
macroprudential policymakers to be transpar -
ent vis- à- vis the general public and market par -
ticipants. The Financial Stability Committee 
meets this obligation, in particular, by submit -
ting an annual report to the Bundestag on its 
activities and on the situation regarding and 
developments in financial stability.
Warnings and 
 recommendations
If a threat to financial stability becomes more 
concrete, however, public communication is 
generally unlikely to suffice. Macroprudential policymakers can then make use of formal communication tools, namely warnings and recommendations. These “intermediate” in
-
struments are the key policy tools for both Ger -
many’s Financial Stability Committee and the 
EU’s ESRB. Warnings flag existing risks to finan-cial stability without yet giving any instructions 
on how to address them. Recommendations, by contrast, offer specific guidance on what 
measures to take. This action may involve mak-
ing full use of existing possibilities (eg activation 
of a countercyclical capital buffer) or may be 
aimed at eliminating deficiencies in the regula-
tory and institutional framework.
The Financial Stability Committee can issue 
warnings and recommendations either publicly 
or directly to addressees. As macroprudential policy is required to be transparent and predict-able, it can be assumed that warnings and rec-
ommendations will generally be made public. In isolated cases, however, it would also be 
conceivable to keep warnings or recommenda-tions confidential, particularly if there is a dan-
ger of their publication triggering reactions 
which could initially have a marked destabilis -
ing effect.
Intervention tools
Tools of intervention, such as additional capital 
buffers or greater risk weights for certain credit 
claims, are classified as “hard” instruments (see 
the box on pages 50 to 53). These instruments 
must be enshrined in law and their use made 
subject to democratic supervision. The toolkit should, in principle, be as simple as possible but as broad as necessary to adequately ad
-
dress the various threats to financial stability 
while keeping unwanted side effects to a min-imum.
As an alternative to categorising macropruden-
tial instruments as “soft”, “intermediate” and 
“hard”, they can also be classified according to 
the dimension of systemic risk that they seek to address: time or cross- sectional.
Numerous instruments aimed at reducing the cyclical components of systemic risk are cur
-
rently under discussion at an international level. In addition to time- varying capital and liquidity 
requirements, these tools include the introduc-
tion of a leverage ratio, options for increasing 
the risk weights for certain asset classes, the 
adjustment of loan collateral standards and dy-
namic credit risk provisioning. Discussions re -

liquidity ratios aimed at encouraging stable 
sources of funding, and market infrastructure 
measures (see the box on pages 50 to 53). The 
list above provides an initial selection of pos -
sible macroprudential tools for containing sys -
temic risk. It is based on the lessons learnt from the financial crisis and the international debate on the design and structure of macroprudential regulation, but it is by no means exhaustive.
Outlook and challenges
The ultimate goal of macroprudential policy is 
to contribute to financial stability. This defined 
objective throws up a number of challenges. 
First, a system of intermediate objectives is re-
quired to define macroprudential policy’s con -
tribution to financial stability in more detail. Second, it must be established whether there are any deviations from the intermediate ob
-
jectives which require action to be taken. To 
achieve this, an analytical framework is needed, possibly containing operational targets. Finally, 
suitable tools must be available to correct any 
deviations from the objectives, as well as sound analyses of how these tools work.
Analysis of tools
To be able to select suitable intervention tools, policymakers must analyse the potential threat 
posed by a specific stability risk, the impact 
chain (or “transmission process”) via which an 
instrument helps to achieve the operational tar -
get or intermediate objective in question, and 
the legal framework for the instrument’s use. 
To ensure that instruments are employed effi -
ciently, this analysis of the transmission process 
(“transmission map”)18 must cover, in particu -
lar, the possible side effects of their use and any interaction between tools that are de
-
ployed in parallel.
A number of factors must be borne in mind 
when deciding whether the use of an instru -
ment is efficient. In addition to macropruden -tial tools, the list of conceivable measures could 
well encompass other forms of intervention outside of the macroprudential policy remit. 
For instance, tax regulations can play a key role 
in respect of excesses on the real estate mar -
kets and adjusting them would have relatively 
few side effects. Within the realm of macropru-
dential policy, it would be conceivable over the 
longer term to use several macroprudential 
tools at once to avoid expected but undesirable side effects caused by using certain instruments in isolation. However, an approach of this kind makes the measure more complex, as both the 
effects of the individual tools and their inter -
action with each other would have to be taken 
into account. Finally, ongoing reviews are needed to monitor whether the available 
toolkit itself is adequate: it should be enhanced 
in line with any advances in measuring and analysing the modus operandi of macropru
-
dential instruments.
Binding rules versus 
 discretionary scope
Decisions on when to activate or deactivate 
tools or sets of tools which have been deemed 
adequate can be taken following a rules- based 
or a discretionary approach. Under a rules-  
based regime, the first step is to establish suit-able indicators. They must provide, where pos-
sible, forward- looking information on the ac -
tual risk situation and be influenced in their development by the macroprudential tool in question. The next step is to set appropriate thresholds for these indicators which, if 
breached, activate the predefined tool or set of 
tools. If this successfully brings the indicators back below the thresholds, the tool or set of 
tools is deactivated. Alternatively, decisions on 
whether to activate or deactivate intervention 
tools can be taken entirely at the discretion of Impact analysis 
as a basis …

efficient use of tools18 For a detailed description of possible transmission pro-
cesses for different macroprudential instruments, see also

Macroprudential instruments
The following is a list of some of the macro-
prudential tools that can (potentially) be put 
to use by authorities. Generally speaking, 
macroprudential instruments can infl  uence 
balance sheet totals, the balance sheet 
structures of fi  nancial institutions, or market structures as a whole.
Capital- related instruments
– countercyclical capital buffer (CCB)
– leverage ratio (LR)
Defi  nition: CCB: an additional capital add- 
on applied contingent on the economic 
cycle; defi  ned as a ratio of common equity 
tier 1 (CET 1) capital to risk- weighted assets. 
LR: ratio of tier 1 capital to the sum of all on- balance sheet and off- balance sheet 
items.1
Transmission: Capital- related instruments 
chiefl  y infl  uence the fi  nancial system via 
three transmission channels. (i) Given an ad-
equate level of capital, accumulating a risk 
buffer during an upswing in the risk cycle dampens growth in fi  nancial institutions’ 
total assets. (ii) Tighter capital requirements 
increase fi  nancial intermediaries’ marginal funding costs, provided that the cost of 
raising equity is higher than the cost of debt 
fi  nancing. This typically boosts institutions’ 
expected return on assets, thereby slowing the pace of balance sheet growth. (iii) Risk 
buffers raise fi  nancial institutions’ potential 
for absorbing losses.
Benefi  ts: Research suggests that capital 
buffers enhance the resilience of fi  nancial 
institutions.2 Moreover, the Basel III Frame-
work prescribes the principle of reciprocity3 
for the CCB, thereby limiting the scope for 
regulatory arbitrage. Non- risk- weighted 
measures are not something that banks can infl  uence by varying the calculation methods 
used, making them a meaningful general 
threshold for balance sheet growth.
Drawbacks: Capital- related instruments 
that do not weigh the risk of assets, or do so inadequately, may prompt fi  nancial insti-tutions to shed low- risk assets so as to free 
up equity for risky and higher- yielding ex-
posures.
Historical experience: Credit institutions 
that came close to collapsing during the fi  -
nancial crisis tended to be more highly le-veraged before the outbreak of the crisis 
than those which, in retrospect, turned out 
to be stable. The results produced by risk- 
based capital ratios, by contrast, are not quite as conclusive.
4 In Canada, the LR 
moderated balance sheet growth at domes-tic banks.
5 Empirical estimates of the CCB’s 
impact on lending conditions are not totally 
1 Capital- related instruments can be adapted to the 
demands of fi  nancial stability policy by varying the def-
inition of capital.2 See Committee on the Global Financial System, Op-
erationalising the selection and application of macro-
prudential instruments, CGFS Papers, No 48, Decem-
ber 2012, and Basel Committee on Banking Supervi-sion, An assessment of the long- term economic im-pact of stronger capital and liquidity requirements, 
August 2010.
3 If, for example, Germany were to impose a certain 
buffer for claims on domestic borrowers, other coun-
tries would have to impose the same buffer on their 
banks for cross- border claims on German borrowers. 
Jurisdictional reciprocity is obligatory up to a buffer of 2.5%.

brating regulatory minimum capital requirements and 
capital buffers: a top- down approach, October 2010.5 See A Crawford, C Graham and É Bordeleau, Regula-
tory Constraints on Leverage: The Canadian Experi-
ence, Financial System Review, Bank of Canada, June

clear, although they tend to indicate that 
the effects are only minimal.6
Sustainability- related instruments
– loan- to- value (LTV) cap
– loan- to- income (LTI) cap; debt- to- income (DTI) cap
Defi  nition: LTV: ratio of the loan principal 
to the loan value of an asset serving as col-
lateral; LTI: ratio of the loan principal to a 
borrower’s disposable income; DTI: ratio of 
a borrower’s total debt to his/her dispos-
able income.
Transmission: Over and above the option 
of realising the collateral provided by a bor-rower in default, loan- to- value caps help to 
limit creditor institutions’ exposure to loss. 
Caps on the LTI and DTI ratios reduce the risk of borrower default by enhancing the 
sustainability of debt servicing.
Benefi  ts: In practice, LTV, LTI and DTI caps 
can be clearly defi  ned for different sectors. They can be set regardless of the creditor’s 
funding strategy and require little coordin-
ation at the international level.
Drawbacks: Realising loan collateral can 
sometimes be time- consuming and costly, 
and exposes creditors to price risk. There is 
also the danger of creditors taking evasive 
action by shifting their focus towards un-
secured loans.
Historical experience: Empirical evidence 
tends to suggest that caps on LTV, LTI and 
DTI ratios reduce credit default rates and curb price exaggerations in certain asset 
markets.7Liquidity and funding ratios– liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)
– liquid assets ratio (LAR)
– net stable funding ratio (NSFR)
Defi  nition: LCR: ratio of the stock of high 
quality liquid assets (HQLA) to net cash out-fl  ows under stress; LAR: ratio of the stock of 
HQLA to total assets; NSFR: ratio of the available amount of stable funding to the 
required amount of funding.
Transmission: The idea behind laying down 
specifi  cations for the liquidity of fi  nancial in-
stitutions is to ensure that, if necessary, 
 liquid assets can be converted into cash to 
cover short- term outfl  ows of funds. Obli-
ging fi  nancial institutions to use stable funding sources, meanwhile, aims to cap 
the amount of funding that can potentially 
be withdrawn at short notice. Since stable 
funding sources tend to be available to 
 fi  nancial institutions over the long term, 
these measures also limit fi  nancial institu-
tions’ scope for transforming maturities.
Benefi  ts: Defi  ning the degree of liquidity of 
assets held reduces the likelihood of liquid-
ity crises occurring, thus counteracting 
short- term contagion risks within the fi  nan-
cial system. Having criteria for the reliability 
of the funding sources used is a means of

infl  uencing the extent to which fi  nancial 
 institutions transform maturities as well as 
the associated risks.
Drawbacks: Liquidity ratios necessitate an 
appropriate defi  nition of liquidity weights. 
Without such a defi  nition, a fi  nancial insti-
tution’s solvency may not be ensured if and 
when required. Added to this, creditors 
might shift their focus away from loans to 
households and towards the purchase of  liquid securities, thereby curtailing the 
 supply of credit to the real economy. Intro-
ducing requirements for fi  nancial institu-
tions’ funding sources may also restrict the 
availability of certain short- term deposit 
 vehicles.
Historical experience: Research indicates that obliging credit institutions to hold 
higher levels of liquidity during an economic 
upturn can help to lean against liquidity- 
driven credit growth.8 There is also evidence 
that increasing the LAR exerts a contrac-
tionary effect on fi  nancial institutions’ lend-ing conditions.

Sectoral risk weights
Defi  nition: The risk weights assigned to 
 individual asset classes can be adapted as part of the calculation of risk- weighted assets, thereby varying the capital buffer 
 required for these assets.
Transmission: Tighter capital requirements 
for sector- specifi  c assets increase fi  nancial 
institutions’ potential for absorbing losses. 
Where the additional capital requirements raise the creditor institution’s marginal funding costs, an incentive is also created 
to limit exposure to these asset classes.
Benefi  ts: Sectoral risk weights are a means 
of directly curbing the emergence of risks to 
fi  nancial stability in individual asset classes.Drawbacks: The use of sectoral risk weights 
is predicated on being able to clearly attrib-ute the risks to fi  nancial stability to specifi  c sectors. The data requirements are thus cor-
respondingly high. It can also not be ruled 
out that risks will be displaced to other sec-tors once regulatory action has been taken (the “water bed effect”).
Historical experience: Research suggests that sector- specifi  c credit growth is re-strained.
10 However, it is impossible to 
 attribute the effects exclusively to the sec-
toral risk weights as these are normally im-plemented in tandem with other measures.
Capital add- ons for systemically 
important banks (SIBs)
Defi  nition: SIBs are required to maintain a 
larger capital buffer.
Transmission: Tighter capital requirements 
increase SIBs’ potential for absorbing losses should credit default rates rise. At the same 
time, institutions might see their marginal 
funding costs increase, thereby reducing or even eliminating any competitive edge they may have on account of an implicit bail- out guarantee.
Benefi  ts: Contagion risks potentially eman-
ating from SIBs are curbed. Competitive dis-
tortions might also be eliminated. An incen-
tive for credit institutions to reduce their systemic importance may be created, not-
ably on account of the graded nature of the 
add- ons.

macroprudential decision- makers, eg by raising 
or lowering thresholds on a discretionary basis 
depending on the situation in hand instead of 
applying fixed thresholds. Various combin -
ations of these two juxtaposed approaches 
would also be conceivable.
An entirely rules- based regime improves trans-
parency, increases the influence of policymak -
ers on market participants’ expectations and 
makes macroprudential decisions more predict-
able, as all market players are familiar with the indicators and thresholds implicated in the use 
of the tools. It ensures that all market partici -
pants are treated equally and that the use of 
instruments is consistent over time. However, 
the high degree of uncertainty involved in iden-
tifying suitable indicators makes it difficult to 
apply rules- based approaches systematically. 
This uncertainty is caused by factors which af-
fect other policy spheres too, including time 
lags between the collection and publication of 
relevant data, contradictory information pro -vided by different indicators and the infre -
quency of comparable situations.
Under a discretionary regime, the criteria ap -
plied by macroprudential decision- makers to 
interpret the available information on the cur -
rent risk situation vary over time. Like in rules- 
based regimes, discretionary approaches may 
also include thresholds for the indicators under 
observation, but these do not automatically 
trigger deployment of an instrument; instead, 
they may be considered cause for more in-  
depth analyses, such as stress tests or simula -
tions of financial institutions’ recapitalisation needs. Discretionary approaches are highly 
flexible and allow a prompt regulatory response 
to sudden changes in the situation regarding 
risks to financial stability. However, they are less transparent than rules- based regimes, may not 
have the desired effect on market participants’ 
expectations and are more prone to criticism 
and accusations of unequal treatment.Rules- based 
 decisions …… or discretion-ary regime?Drawbacks: Measuring individual banks’ 
systemic importance is subject to uncer-
tainty; this status also varies over time. Add-
itionally, banks’ owners and management 
face incentive problems, particularly in the 
areas surrounding the threshold values.
Historical experience: Research fi  ndings 
confi  rm that specifi  c capital buffers raise 
marginal funding costs and point to tighter 
lending conditions as well as a minimal 
negative impact on economic growth dur-
ing phasing- in. The probability of systemic 
crises occurring falls.11
Historical experience regarding the use of 
macroprudential instruments is still rather scarce compared with other policy areas. 
Additionally, instruments are often deployed 
in tandem with other measures so as to 
tackle any evasive reactions.12 This normally 
complicates efforts to identify the marginal stability impact of each measure in isolation. 
The results available to date also indicate 
that the success and effectiveness of macro-
prudential instruments hinge on country- specifi  c factors.
13 However, the heterogen-
eity of the economic framework conditions 
not only means that individual instruments 
must always be judged in a national con-
text, but also underscores the need for na-
tional fl  exibility in macroprudential policy.
11 See Macroeconomic Assessment Group, Assess-
ment of the macroeconomic impact of higher loss 
 absorbency for global systemically important banks, Report, October 2011. The results of the simulations are highly dependent on the assumptions made (eg 
regarding the extent to which SIBs’ business activities 
can be substituted by other fi  nancial institutions).12 For example, the LR might be deployed as a hedge 
alongside the CCB to offset any calibration errors in 
the risk weights when calculating risk- weighted assets for the purposes of the CCB.

When using macroprudential instruments, it is 
essential to weigh up the pros and cons of 
 applying a discretionary versus a rules- based 
approach. Each financial cycle exhibits both 
generic and unique characteristics, which must 
always be evaluated using qualitative informa-tion as well as empirical indicators. Some scope for discretion is therefore needed when decid-ing the timing and intensity of macroprudential measures. At the same time, it must be ensured 
that macroprudential policy is predictable for 
market participants and that instruments are 
deployed in an appropriate and transparent 
fashion. Monetary policy theory and practice suggest that policymaking is most effective 
when it is predictable, transparent and consist-ent.Deutsche Bundesbank
