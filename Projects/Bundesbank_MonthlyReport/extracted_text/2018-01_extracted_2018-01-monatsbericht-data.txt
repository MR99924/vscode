Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Germany’s economy is continuing to expand at 
an exceptionally strong underlying pace. The 
rate of growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 
might be slightly lower than it was in the pre -
ceding quarter, however, with the brief lull in 
economic activity due to two “bridge” days in 
October playing a part in this. This will do noth -
ing to dent the basic underlying strength and 
breadth of the upturn in economic growth in 
Germany. Industrial orders and labour market 
conditions are in excellent shape, as are busi -
ness and consumer sentiment.
The provisional figures of the Federal Statistical 
Office indicate that gross domestic product 
(GDP) increased by 2.2% in real terms in 2017 
(2.5% after calendar adjustment). This means 
that the aggregate expansion showed a further 
marked strengthening following the already 
quite strong growth of 1.9% in 2016. This was 
primarily the result of a perceptible upturn in 
global activity, which allowed German indus -
trial exports to thrive on a broad basis. This led 
to a substantial rise in industrial capacity utilisa -
tion levels and businesses stepping up their in -
vestment in new machinery and equipment. 
Construction investment provided additional 
stimuli, particularly in the first six months of the 
year. The construction sector was probably in -
creasingly approaching its capacity limits as the 
year progressed, however. Not least, given the 
favourable outlook for employment and in -
comes, private consumption also remained a 
key pillar of the strong and broad- based upturn 
in economic activity in 2017.
Industry
Industrial output in November 2017 showed a 
very substantial seasonally adjusted increase of 4¼% on the month. This more than offset the 
cutbacks in production in October, when out -
put was weak owing to an exceptional calen -
dar constellation with two “bridge” days. On 
an average of October and November, there 
was now a perceptible increase of ½% com -
pared with the previous quarter. Manufacturers 
of chemical products stood out with the 
strongest gains in output (+2¾%). German 
mechanical engineering firms, too, expanded 
their production substantially (+1¼%). Car 
manufacturers suffered a significant drop in 
output, however (-1%). Overall, output thus in -
creased most in the intermediate goods indus -
try (+1%). By contrast, manufacturers of capital 
goods reported only a slight rise in output of 
¼%, and consumer goods output was, in fact, 
slightly down on the third- quarter level (-¼%).
Seasonally adjusted industrial orders in Novem -
ber contracted slightly on the month (-½%). 
However, the decline should be seen against 
the backdrop of the extremely dynamic inflow 
of orders in the months beforehand. On an 
average of October and November, the volume 
of orders increased steeply compared with the 
third quarter (+2¾%). For German industrial 
firms, the order situation looks exceptionally 
favourable  at the moment, and the impulses 
are broadly based. In regional terms, demand 
rose strongly in all the major economic areas. 
While there was a considerable increase of 
1¼% in domestic orders, the inflow of orders 
from the euro area (+4%) and non-  euro area 
countries (+3¾%) showed an even more sub -
stantial rise. Across all the sectors too, a large 
number of orders landed on firms’ books, first 
and foremost in the capital goods sector with 
substantial growth of 3¾%, followed by pro -
ducers of consumer goods (+2¾%) and of 
intermediate goods (+1½%). It is true that large 
orders played a disproportionately big role in 
the overall sharp rise in new orders, but even if 
they are excluded there was still a considerable 
increase in the inflow of orders (+1¾%).German econ-
omy continues to grow at strong under-lying pace

After the weak October, industrial sales fol -
lowed the major countermovement in indus -
trial manufacturing in November and were 
strongly up on the previous month’s level in 
seasonally adjusted terms (+4¾%). On an aver -
age of October and November, there was per -
ceptible growth of ¾% compared with the 
average of the third quarter. Broken down by 
sector, manufacturers of intermediate goods 
posted the strongest growth in sales. Producers 
of consumer goods also strongly boosted sales. 
By contrast, capital goods manufacturers had 
to cope with severe losses of business. This was 
mainly due to weak sales in the automotive 
sector, which experienced a lull following quite 
considerable growth in the third quarter. In re -
gional terms, sales figures in the non- euro area 
countries remained at the same level as in the 
previous quarter, while German enterprises re -
corded higher sales in Germany and in euro 
area countries. In November, nominal exports 
increased sharply on the month by a seasonally 
adjusted 4¼%. On an average of October and 
November, they were also significantly above 
their level in the third quarter (+2¼%). In real 
terms, there was a somewhat smaller increase 
of 1¾%. At 2¼%, growth in nominal imports 
in November was clearly weaker than it was in 
exports, but the stronger previous month 
meant that there was a similarly sharp increase 
when comparing the average of October and 
November with the average of the third quar -
ter. In real terms, however, significantly lower 
growth was recorded (+¾%).
Construction
Construction output rose steeply in November 
2017 in seasonally adjusted terms (+1½%). 
Even so, on an average of October and Novem -
ber, it was still slightly down on its third- quarter 
level (-¼%). This was mainly due to a marked 
decline in activity in the main construction sec -
tor (-¾%). By contrast, construction output in 
the finishing trades showed a distinct rise 
(+½%). Despite this slight decline, however, 
construction sector activity remains at a very Major counter-

high level overall. Construction firms’ order 
books also continue to be well filled. The fact 
that there was a marginal decline in orders re -
ceived in the main construction sector in Octo -
ber – data are available up to then – compared 
with the third quarter does not alter this pic -
ture.
Labour market
The prolonged and strong growth in employ -
ment continued in November 2017. The sea -
sonally adjusted number of persons in work in 
Germany went up by around 50,000 on the 
month. Nevertheless, this increase failed to 
match the very steep growth seen in the fourth 
quarter of last year, and the year- on- year figure 
declined marginally to a still very strong 
+613,000 employees, or +1.4%. Growth in 
total employment was sustained by the steep 
increase in the number of jobs subject to social 
security contributions. By contrast, there was a 
continuation of the downward trend in the 
number of persons working exclusively in low- 
paid part- time jobs and of the self- employed. 
Leading indicators of the demand for labour 
such as the Ifo employment barometer, the 
Federal Employment Agency’s BA-  X job index 
and the labour market barometer of the Insti -
tute for Employment Research (IAB) all showed 
a further rise from an exceptionally high level. 
These reflect both the expansionary recruit -
ment plans of enterprises as well as their in -
creasing difficulties in filling vacant positions.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment underwent 
a relatively steep month- on- month decline in 
December. There were 2.44 million persons 
registered as unemployed with the Federal 
Employ ment Agency, 29,000 fewer than in 
November  . The unemployment rate was 5.5%. 
Compared with the previous year, 183,000 
fewer persons were out of work, and the un -
employment rate was 0.5  percentage point 
lower. Overall underemployment, which also 
counts the number of persons taking part in 
active labour market policy measures, also showed a sharp fall on the month. The latest 
figures of the IAB labour market barometer 
suggest that unemployment will go on falling 
over the next few months.
Prices
Crude oil prices continued to rise in December 
2017; on a monthly average they were 2½% 
higher than in November. There was a further 
marked increase in prices in the first half of 
January. As this report went to press, the price 
of a barrel of Brent crude oil stood at just over 
US$69. The discount on crude oil futures was 
US$1¾ for deliveries six months ahead and 
US$3¾ for deliveries 12 months ahead.
In November, import prices increased markedly 
in seasonally adjusted terms mainly due to 
more expensive energy imports. In the case of 
other goods, however, the earlier price inflation 
almost came to a standstill. Domestic producer 
prices, for which data up to December are al -
ready available, showed a similar picture, even 
though the rise in these energy prices was 
clearly weaker. The annual rate of inflation at 
these two upstream stages of consumer prices 
showed little movement overall in this instance 
and stood at +2½% in each case.
Consumer prices (HICP) rose distinctly by 0.3% 
in seasonally adjusted terms at the end of the 
year. In the case of services, the prices of travel, 
which are prone to fluctuate, were consider -
ably higher than is usual in December. The 
prices of non- energy industrial goods were ris -
ing somewhat more strongly than in the pre -
ceding months, partly as a result of higher 
prices for clothing. Housing rents continued to 
be raised moderately and energy and food 
prices showed little change. Annual headline 
HICP inflation went down from +1.8% to 
+1.6%, because energy prices had undergone a 
steep rise in December 2016 (CPI up to +1.7% 
from likewise +1.8%). Excluding food and en -
ergy, however, the figure was 1.4%, compared 
with 1.2%. The surge in the overall rate from Strong increase

+0.4% in 2016 to +1.7% on an average of 2017 
was due chiefly to the energy price trend turn -
ing positive.1 In the current year, the energy 
component is likely to make no more than a 
minor contribution to overall inflation. In the 
case of the other components, inflation, which 
hit 1.6% in 2017, is likely to accelerate further, 
however, owing to growing aggregate overuti -
lisation.
Public finances2
Local government finances
Local governments’ core budgets3 recorded a 
surplus of just under €2 billion in the third 
quarter of 2017, compared with a deficit of 
close to €½ billion in the same period one year 
previously. This clear improvement was mainly 
due to the continued strong growth in tax rev -
enue (+7½%, or €1½ billion) – particularly in 
the municipal share of income tax and, to a 
somewhat lesser extent, in local business tax. 
By comparison, the increase in both revenue 
from general grants from state government 
(+4½%, or €½ billion), which are essentially 
pegged to growth in state tax revenue, and in 
receipts from fees (+2%) was more moderate. 
Overall revenue growth totalled just under 
4½% (€2½ billion).
By contrast, growth in total expenditure went 
up only slightly (+½%, or just under €½ billion). 
Staff costs and other operating expenditure in -
creased moderately (+2½% and +2%, respect -
ively) and fixed asset formation actually rose 
significantly (+5%). However, spending on so -
cial benefits declined slightly (-½%), probably 
largely due to reduced expenditure on support 
for refugees, and interest expenditure fell 
sharply once again (-14½%). Other expend -
iture, which is not broken down further in the 
reported benchmark figures, also declined con -
siderably overall.
After three quarters, the surplus of the local 
governments’ core budgets in 2017 already stood at €1½ billion. The improvement on the 
core budgets’ results for 2016 amounted to 
€5½ billion. As the final quarter of 2016 was 
unusually strong, the rise for the year as a 
whole could turn out to be somewhat lower, 
however. The Federal Ministry of Finance’s esti -
mate for 2017, presented to the Stability Coun -
cil in December, assumes an increase of €3 bil -
lion in the surplus of the core budgets, bringing 
them to €7½ billion. Significantly positive – al -
beit somewhat more moderate – results are ex -
pected for 2018 and the period up to 2021. 
This assumption takes into account that the 
Federal Government’s permanent financial as -
sistance package will enter into force this year, 
providing additional relief of €2½ billion net. 
Greater expenditure growth for fixed asset for -
mation is anticipated for local government in 
2018. This seems plausible given the politically 
identified needs and the financial means gener -
ally available, although the volume of the latter 
differs among municipalities. For instance, cen -
tral government’s fund to promote municipal 
investment, which it has equipped with a total 
of €7 billion, is available to financially weak 
local governments. Numerous planned projects 
are set to be completed this year, making use Significant

2 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter. 
For detailed data on budgetary developments and public 
debt, see the statistical section of this report.
3 As opposed to the usual description of local government 
finances in the short commentaries, the following report is 
based solely on the core budgets. As this report went to 
press, no cash data, including local government off- budget 
entities, were yet available from the Federal Statistical Of -
fice. Recently these entities exhibited only minor (mostly 
positive) fiscal balances on a regular basis. However, the 
growth rates of various revenue and expenditure categor -
ies were given a distinct boost by the reporting group 
being expanded.Deutsche Bundesbank

of the relevant resources.4 Additional transfers 
from central government, which would result 
in a further marked improvement of local gov -
ernment finances, are planned in the event that 
a new Federal Government is formed on the 
basis of the agreements reached in the latest 
exploratory talks. Should any fee reductions 
and a legal entitlement to all- day childcare for 
children of primary school age be agreed upon 
here, it will probably be up to state govern -
ments to offset any resulting budgetary strains 
in accordance with the principle of related ac -
tions (a constitutionally enshrined commitment 
that any allocation of tasks by state to local 
governments be accompanied by the necessary 
resources). On the whole, there is scope not 
only for additional investment, but also for 
lowering the local business tax in order to re -
duce tax burdens for enterprises, for example.
In line with the overall positive budgetary situ -
ation, the municipalities’ total debts (including 
their off- budget entities)5 decreased by €1½ 
billion to just under €145 billion between the 
end of June 2017 and the end of September 
2017. The bulk of this decline was accounted 
for by cash advances, the volume of which fell 
to €47½ billion. The heavily indebted munici -
palities throughout North Rhine-  Westphalia 
were primarily affected. However, the overall 
highly indebted local governments of Saarland, 
Rhineland- Palatinate and Hesse reduced the 
volume of their outstanding cash advances in 
part, too. Cash advances are actually only in -
tended to fulfil liquidity coverage requirements 
on a temporary basis. High stocks of advances 
accumulated over a number of years highlight 
chronic fiscal imbalances. The reduction in cash 
advances is therefore a positive development. 
However, the persistently high volume in many 
municipalities demonstrates the need to con -
sistently pursue fiscal consolidation. The rele -
vant state government is generally called upon 
to take action in parallel to the respective mu -
nicipality. In the case of high outstanding cash 
advances at the local government level 
throughout a federal state, in addition to more 
effective budgetary supervision, it would seem appropriate to submit the municipal revenue-  
sharing scheme to a particularly thorough an -
alysis in the light of the chosen division of tasks 
between the state and local government.Stronger

4 In a first step, central government stocked the fund with 
financial assistance in the amount of €3½ billion for special 
investments in infrastructure in the period from 2015 to 
2020. Although only €½ billion of this was called on by the 
end of 2017, 87% of the funds had been earmarked as at 
the reporting date in mid-2017. The small outflows are 
being attributed, first, to the fact that funds are only paid 
out following implementation and invoicing. Second, cap -
acity bottlenecks in the construction sector and in local 
government administration are being highlighted (see also 
Federal Ministry of Finance, Förderung von Investitionen 
finanzschwacher Kommunen durch den Bund, Monthly 
Report , December 2017, pp  27-34). The supplementary 
budget for 2016 made additional assistance of €3½ billion 
available for investment in schools over the years up until 
2022. Once the funding provisions have been defined, it 
will probably only be possible to invoice projects during the 
current year.

Securities markets
Bond market
In November 2017, issuance in the German 
bond market stood at €86.3 billion in gross 
terms (previous month: €93.6 billion). After de -
ducting redemptions, which were relatively 
low, and taking account of changes in issuers’ 
holdings of their own debt securities, the out -
standing volume of domestic bonds rose by 
€22.1 billion. Foreign debt securities worth 
€5.2 billion net were sold in the German mar -
ket. The funds raised from sales of domestic 
and foreign debt securities in the German mar -
ket therefore amounted to €27.3 billion.
The public sector issued bonds totalling €14.8 
billion net in the reporting month. This was at -
tributable primarily to central government, 
which issued mainly two- year Federal Treasury 
notes (Schätze: €5.9 billion), five- year Federal notes (Bobls: €3.4 billion), and ten-  year and 
thirty- year Federal bonds (Bunds: €3.4 billion 
and €2.2 billion respectively). Meanwhile, re -
demptions of federal state bonds were low, to -
talling €0.1 billion
Domestic enterprises also increased their cap -
ital market debt in November – by €6.3 billion 
in net terms. On balance, this involved almost 
exclusively bonds with a maturity of more than 
one year.
The outstanding volume of debt securities is -
sued by domestic credit institutions rose by 
€0.9 billion in the reporting month. On bal -
ance, mainly other bank securities that can be 
structured flexibly were placed on the market 
(€1.6 billion), while debt securities issued by 
specialised credit institutions were redeemed to 
the tune of €1.3 billion net.
On balance, domestic investors were the main 
buyers of debt securities in November. The 
Deutsche Bundesbank was the primary buyer, 
acquiring debt securities in the amount of 
€13.4 billion under the Eurosystem’s asset pur -
chase programmes. Domestic non-  banks in -
creased their holdings of bonds by €6.2 billion, 
investing more or less equally in domestic and 
foreign securities. Non- resident investors added 
bonds worth €4.4 billion net to their portfolios. 
In addition, domestic credit institutions ac -
quired debt securities totalling €3.4 billion.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed €0.1 billion worth of new shares in the 
German equity market. The outstanding vol -
ume of foreign shares in the German market 
rose by €1.7 billion over the same period. Equi -
ties were purchased predominantly by domes -
tic non- banks and domestic credit institutions 
(to the tune of €1.4 billion and €1.2 billion re -
spectively). By contrast, foreign investors sold 
German shares in the amount of €0.8 billion.High net

Mutual funds
In November 2017, domestic mutual funds sold 
shares totalling €8.6 billion net in the German 
market (previous month: €11.0 billion). On bal -
ance, fresh funds were injected chiefly into spe -
cialised funds reserved for institutional invest -
ors (€6.0 billion). Among the various asset 
classes, mixed securities funds in particular re -
corded inflows (€5.8 billion), as did, albeit to a 
lesser extent, equity funds and open- end real 
estate funds (both to the tune of €1.5 billion). 
By contrast, bond funds redeemed their own 
shares (€1.5 billion). Foreign mutual funds sold 
shares worth €2.2 billion in the German market 
in the reporting month. On balance, domestic 
non- banks were the sole purchasers, adding a 
net €15.7 billion worth of mutual fund shares 
to their portfolios. Foreign investors disposed 
of German mutual fund shares totalling €4.8 
billion net. Domestic credit institutions were 
only marginally active in the German market, 
on balance.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €25.4 billion in November 2017, putting it 
€6.6 above the October level. This was caused 
by an increase in the goods account surplus 
along with a higher invisible current transac -
tions balance, which comprises services as well 
as primary and secondary income.
The November surplus on the goods account 
was €4.5 billion up on the month at €25.4 bil -
lion, with exports of goods rising more sharply 
than imports of goods.
Invisible current transactions posted a balanced 
account in November, compared with a deficit 
of €2.0 billion one month earlier. This was pri -
marily due to a narrowing of the services ac -
count deficit by €2.8 billion to €0.6 billion, 
largely on account of the usual seasonal de -
cline in travel expenditure, which greatly out -
stripped the month- on- month drop from the German mutual 
funds record inflows

very high level of receipts derived from the use 
of intellectual property of October. At the same 
time, net receipts in the primary income ac -
count went up slightly by €0.3 billion to €5.9 
billion, in large part because of reduced ex -
penditure in the area of investment income. In 
the secondary income account, by contrast, 
the deficit widened by €1.0 billion to €5.2 bil -
lion. This was mainly attributable to higher pri -
vate sector expenditure.
In November, the international financial mar -
kets were influenced by more upbeat global 
economic expectations and the firm prospect 
of tax reforms being implemented in the United 
States. Against this backdrop, Germany’s cross- 
border portfolio investment generated net cap -
ital exports in the amount of €9.9 billion, com -
pared with €24.7 billion in October. German 
investors acquired foreign securities worth €8.6 
billion net, purchasing bonds (€6.7 billion), in -
vestment fund shares (€2.2 billion) and regular 
shares (€1.2 billion), while disposing of money 
market paper (€1.5 billion). In the reporting 
month, foreign investors divested themselves 
of German securities totalling €1.3 billion net. 
These instruments encompassed investment 
fund shares (€4.8 billion), money market paper 
(€2.0 billion) and shares (€0.8 billion). In con -
trast to this, and alongside an elevated level of 
net issuance, foreign investors acquired Ger -
man bonds emanating from both the public 
sector (€3.8 billion) and the private sector (€2.6 
billion).At €0.1 billion, direct investment generated 
modest net capital imports in November, fol -
lowing net capital exports of €8.3 billion one 
month earlier. Net funds flowing into Germany 
in the shape of direct investment came to €7.8 
billion, of which €3.2 billion was dedicated to 
investments in equity –  including reinvested 
earnings – while €4.6 billion was earmarked for 
intra-  group loans. Domestic enterprises sup -
plied their affiliates abroad with funds worth 
€7.7 billion net, doing so by augmenting their 
equity capital (€6.3 billion) and expanding their 
intra- group lending (€1.4 billion).
Other statistically recorded investment, which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments, experienced net 
capital exports of €16.7 billion in November. 
This result arose from outflows in the banking 
system (€12.8 billion), enterprises and house -
holds (€2.2 billion) and at the general govern -
ment level (€1.6 billion). While credit institu -
tions recorded   net capital inflows (€17.3 bil -
lion), the Bundesbank’s net claims rose by 
€30.2 billion, of which €7.1 billion was ac -
counted for by higher TARGET2 claims. Further -
more, the Bundesbank’s external liabilities de -
creased, inter alia as a result of lower short-  
term deposits on the part of foreign (non- euro 
area) central banks.

The impact of the internationalisation 
of German firms on domestic investment
The increasing internationalisation of Germany’s economy is multifaceted. Key aspects of inter -
nationalisation that frequently court controversy in the public arena are production offshoring 
(hereinafter referred to simply as offshoring) and German foreign direct investment (FDI). One 
oft- repeated assertion is that offshoring and FDI crowd out domestic production and hamper 
investment in Germany. This article presents two recent studies that shed some light on the rela -
tionship between the internationalisation of German firms and domestic investment. The studies, 
which consider different aspects of German firms’ international interconnectedness, find both 
positive and negative effects on domestic investment and show that, overall, the quantitative 
implications for aggregate investment in Germany are small.
One study examines the issue of how offshoring affects the production factor capital and, in par -
ticular, investment in various capital goods in Germany. The findings indicate that, as a result of 
offshoring, domestic demand for capital has shifted away from traditional capital goods in favour 
of information and communication technologies. One possible explanation for this effect is that, 
once production stages requiring low- skilled labour have been moved offshore, the requisite cap -
ital goods are no longer needed to the same extent as previously. Overall, offshoring by German 
firms is likely, in aggregate terms, to have had a slightly negative impact on domestic investment 
– at least until the onset of the 2007-08 financial crisis.
FDI represents another field in which firms are active abroad. Studies based on Bundesbank firm- 
level data and focusing on the impact of FDI on domestic investment show that the establishment 
or acquisition of a new foreign affiliate by a domestic parent firm is, on average, associated with 
higher domestic investment by said firm in the same year. This effect is linked, in particular, to 
better funding conditions in the host country, as well as tax- related factors in some cases. How -
ever, the comparatively small number of new affiliates abroad mean that the impact on aggre -
gate investment in Germany is also likely to be fairly small.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The internationalisation of Germany’s economy 
has progressed at a rapid pace over the past 
two decades. Lower trade and communication 
costs have made it possible for German firms to 
organise their production within global value 
chains and focus their domestic activities on 
production stages that provide a comparative 
advantage.1 Furthermore, German firms have 
taken advantage of the increasing liberalisation 
of cross- border capital flows – where signifi -
cant progress had been made, especially prior 
to the onset of the 2007-08 global financial cri -
sis – to acquire existing firms abroad and estab -
lish new foreign affiliates.2
At the same time, firms’ investment in Ger -
many has been rather subdued recently. In 
addition to being of significance in terms of fu -
ture economic growth potential, investment 
has a direct impact on the German current ac -
count surplus, which, owing to the level that it 
has reached, has been the subject of an annual 
in- depth review conducted by the European 
Commission since 2014 as part of its procedure 
for the prevention and correction of macroeco -
nomic imbalances.3 One oft- repeated assertion 
in this regard is that offshoring and FDI by Ger -
man firms hamper domestic investment in Ger -
many.Unlike portfolio investment, FDI is characterised 
by a long- term investment horizon and is aimed 
at influencing and controlling the business ac -
tivity of investment companies abroad.4 Pos-
sible motives for FDI include the scope for pro -
ducing certain products (or parts of products) 
more efficiently abroad (vertical FDI) or the 
wish to tap new sales markets (horizontal FDI).5

grounds of cost and efficiency.6 This can take 
place within corporate groups or via supply 
contracts with legally independent suppliers, 
with the former case being identical to vertical 
FDI. The protection of copyright and transac -
tion cost considerations play a major role when 
deciding where to locate the outsourced activ -
ity.7
Econometric analyses can be used to explore 
the relationship between the internationalisa -
tion of the German economy and investment 
activity in Germany.8 The first empirical study 
looks at the impact of offshoring on the com -
position of domestic demand for capital using 
a cross- country dataset. On the basis of an -
onymised Bundesbank microdata, a second 
study investigates whether German firms’ FDI 
has caused these firms to scale back their do -
mestic investment.
Business investment 
developments  in Germany
One commonly used measure of changes in 
fixed capital formation in the German corpor -
ate sector is the business investment- to- output 
ratio, ie expenditure on gross fixed capital for -
mation as a percentage of gross value added. 
In nominal terms, this has been in decline since 
the early 1990s.9 While it averaged just over 
19½% in the period between 1991 and 1999, 
it has stood at no more than around 17½% on 
average over the past decade. It is not least 
due to this decline in the nominal investment 
ratio that the German economy has been 
deemed to have been suffering from weak in -
vestment in recent years.10
However, it should be noted that price trends 
for capital goods and gross value added dif -
fered during this period. For example, while the 
rise in prices of capital goods between 1991 
and 2016 averaged less than ½% per annum , 
the increase in the gross value added deflator 
was significantly higher in the same period, at 
just over 1% per year. Consequently, changes in the nominal investment ratio do not necessarily 
make it possible to draw conclusions about 
underlying real investment. In fact, the price-  
adjusted investment ratio – in contrast to the 
nominal ratio – shows no discernible trend and 
has largely fluctuated around a constant value 
since German reunification.Analysis of

In addition, structural changes can have an im -
pact on both the level and composition of busi -
ness investment in Germany. In particular, the 
significance of intangible assets with respect to 
domestic investment has increased consider -
ably since German reunification. For example, 
investment in research and development (R&D) 
as a percentage of gross fixed capital formation 
rose from 8½% to almost 14% between 1991 
and 2016, which points to an ongoing shift in 
the composition of investment spending.11 The 
impact of such a shift on the level of invest -
ment as a whole, however, is not clear- cut.12
Offshoring and domestic 
 demand for capital
Offshoring is a potential factor in both the level 
of investment and the shift in the composition 
of investment in Germany, as the restructuring 
of the production process has made it possible 
to focus on certain production stages in Ger -
many.13 The steady decline in trade and com -
munication costs has played a part in funda -
mentally transforming the production process 
over the past few decades. While the produc -
tion of goods was constrained by the regional 
availability of production factors throughout 
much of the last century, technological ad -
vances in the fields of transportation and tele -communication have increasingly enabled firms 
to coordinate complex value chains across time 
and space and split the production process into 
smaller stages.
Offshoring and the resulting emergence of 
cross- border production networks go hand in 
hand with international trade in intermedi -
ates.14 According to data from the WIOD,15 
intermediates accounted for almost two- thirds 
of the global trade in goods and services in 
2014. Overall, imported intermediates held an 
8¼% share in global production in 2014, while, 
in Germany, this share stood at 11¾%. Com -
pared with other large EU countries, such as 
France, Italy and the United Kingdom, the Ger -
man economy is relatively well integrated into 
international production chains. And, at only 
4½% in 2014, the share of imported intermedi -
ates in production in China and the United 
States, the two largest economies in the world, 
was also well below the German figure.
The share of imported intermediates varies 
considerably by economic sector in Germany. 
In manufacturing, the level of international in -
terconnectedness measured in this manner 
stood at one-  quarter in 2014, after almost 
doubling over the past two decades in some 
manufacturing sectors. By contrast, the share Effects of a

11 Investment in other assets as a whole (intellectual prop -

capital formation rose from just over 11½% to 19% during 
the same period.
12 Substitution effects could raise the share of investment 
in intangible assets at the expense of traditional capital 
goods and lift capital stock productivity as a result of the 
higher productivity of intangible assets. While higher cap -
ital productivity probably dampens necessary capital forma -
tion to a certain extent at a given production level, it could 
nevertheless increase the relative demand for fixed capital 
formation at the same time.

of imported intermediates is much lower in the 
service sectors, as there are limits on the extent 
to which some of the services they offer can be 
provided directly across borders – due to lan -
guage barriers or country- specific require -
ments, for instance.
Imported intermediates in Germany come 
largely from neighbouring countries, as the 
geographical proximity simplifies the coordin -
ation of complex production processes and 
minimises transportation costs. After the fall of 
the Iron Curtain, central and eastern European 
countries (CEECs) were increasingly integrated 
into the German production network. How -
ever, the significance of intermediates from 
China has also increased markedly over the 
past two decades. Besides supplier relation -
ships with EU countries, intermediates from the 
United States also play an important role – par -
ticularly in the high- tech sector.Foreign locations are attractive for offshoring if 
the benefits that can be derived from focusing 
on core competencies at home and from cost 
savings resulting from factor price differences 
outweigh the additional coordination and trade 
costs associated with the fragmentation of the 
production process. Accordingly, certain pro -
duction stages show greater potential for off -
shoring than others. For example, routine tasks 
that do not require personal contacts or geo -
graphical proximity are more likely to come into 
consideration, while production stages that are 
interactive or difficult to coordinate are off -
shored less often.16 The restructuring of the 
production process at the domestic location as 
a result of offshoring may also have an impact 
on the composition of labour demand. Empir -Significance of

ical studies show that, for example, in the 
United Kingdom and the United States, off -
shoring has played a key role in the decline in 
demand for low and medium- skilled workers 
and in the increase in the pay gap between 
those workers and high- skilled workers.17
However, to date, little is known about the im -
plications of offshoring for domestic demand 
for the production factor capital and its com -
position. If production stages that require the 
use of certain capital goods are moved off -
shore to cut costs, this could cause redundan -
cies in the domestic capital stock. It is conceiv -
able, for example, that moving production 
stages offshore would reduce the need for cer -
tain machinery, equipment and commercial 
properties, causing investment in these goods 
to fall. At the same time, specialisation in stra -
tegic and high value  added functions such as 
development and marketing would likely at -

goods ICT, non- ICT and R&D capital is exam -
ined in an empirical study.19 The study is based 
on a panel data analysis of 32 economic sec -

are available for these countries for the period

ates.20 These are used to estimate a system of 
relative factor demand equations in which, in a 
departure from the majority of existing studies, 
the production factor capital is considered a 
variable input factor in order to make it pos -
sible to directly determine elasticities of substi -

relative demand for a certain input factor is de -
fined – in keeping with the literature – as its 
compensation relative to gross output.

The results of the empirical analyses point to a 
shift in the demand for capital by asset class. 
While offshoring significantly decreases the 
non- ICT share in production, it has only a 
slightly negative effect on R&D capital.22 By 
contrast, no statistically significant relationship 
is observed between ICT capital and offshoring. 
A large number of sensitivity analyses, relating 
to individual variable definitions and econo -
metric specification, for example, confirm these 
findings. A specification with more disaggre -
gated asset classes also shows that the relative 
factor demand for machinery, equipment and 
commercial property correlates negatively with 
offshoring, while there is no significant rela -
tionship for any of the ICT asset classes. Al -
though the empirical study is based on cross-  
country data, additional analyses suggest that 
the results for Germany do not differ substan -
tially with regard to the shift in demand for 
capital. Unlike the estimate for the broad group 
of countries, however, a similar estimate based 
exclusively on German data shows a slightly 
positive coefficient for R&D capital.
One possible explanation for the decline in the 
non- ICT share in production is its complemen -
tarity with the factor labour in the offshored 
production stages.23 As in other studies, the re -
sults of further estimations suggest that off -
shoring reduces the domestic share of low and 
medium- skilled workers. There are also indica -
tions that changes in capital and labour inputs 
are related. For instance, the negative impact 
on the share of the input factors non- ICT cap -
ital and low and medium- skilled labour is par -
ticularly pronounced in sectors with a high pro -
portion of production stages with low skill 
require  ments. If, in addition to this, imported 
intermediates are divided into two groups 
according  to the skill level of labour, the off -
shoring of production stages with low skill re -
quirements has a particularly negative impact 
on non- ICT capital and the use of low and 
medium- skilled workers in Germany.
The results obtained so far consider the partial 
effect of offshoring on the demand for capital, but neglect additional repercussions for firms. 
For instance, offshoring might strengthen the 
competitiveness of the firms and their profit -
ability, which would suggest a strengthening of 
domestic demand for investment. However, in 
the approach chosen here, these feedback 
mechanisms can only be estimated indirectly as 
the path of the demand for investment without 
offshoring is not directly observable. To none -
theless gauge the aggregate importance of off -
shoring for investment in Germany, actual 
growth in real gross fixed capital formation is 
compared to a hypothetical scenario in which 
cross- border production did not become more 
interconnected in the period from 1995 to 
2014.24 On the one hand, the absence of the 
estimated substitution effect would mean that 
the capital share of production would be higher 
than the actual values in this hypothetical scen -
ario. On the other hand, without productivity 
gains and cheaper imported intermediates, 
growth in gross output would probably have 
shown flatter development.25 Without these 
scale effects, the rate of change for real gross 
fixed capital formation in Germany in this hypo -
thetical scenario, excluding offshoring, would 
be 0.09 to 0.13  percentage point per year 
higher on average than the actual values, de -Shift in demand

22 An increase in the share of imported intermediates by 
10  percentage points is associated with a reduction of 
1.7 percentage points in the non- ICT share of production. 
In the case of R&D capital, the corresponding decline 
amounts to just 0.4 percentage point.
23 Even so, reductions in the price of the factor labour 
abroad could lead to a direct substitution of capital in Ger -
many. All other things being equal, this would mean a re -
duction in the capital share of production abroad. How -
ever, empirical evidence suggests that the share of capital 
tended to increase in both advanced economies and emer -
ging market economies in the period from 1995 to 2009.

24 For the sake of simplicity, the calculations in this section 
are based on estimations using a production function with 
just three variable input factors (labour, capital and inter -
mediates).
25 This hypothesis disregards potential and difficult- to- 
quantify price effects which may arise from changes in the 
terms of trade and a reduction in demand for capital in 
Germany. By contrast, interactions between the substitu -
tion effect and the scale effect resulting from the inclusion 
of gross output in the factor demand equations are taken 
into account. See G  M  Grossman and E  Rossi- Hansberg

pending on the estimation.26 Applying realistic 
scale effects, which are derived here from the 
relevant literature, would result in a higher 
growth rate for gross fixed capital formation of 
between 0.05 and 0.08 percentage point; in 
the case of the Germany- specific estimation, 
this would correspond to an average of around 
€9 billion per year, or 1¾% of the gross fixed 
capital formation of the respective years.27 If 
very large scale effects through offshoring are 
assumed, this could possibly even lead to a 
positive relationship between offshoring and 
the domestic demand for capital.28 In summary, 
it can be concluded from the estimations that 
offshoring over the period from 1995 to 2014 
had a slightly negative impact on investment in 
Germany. This effect is likely to have been 
mainly concentrated on the period before the 
onset of the 2007-08 global financial crisis 
given that offshoring was significantly less 
common in the following years as measured by 
the ratio of imported intermediates.
FDI and domestic investment
Over the last two decades, the internationalisa -
tion of German firms has taken place not only 
through offshoring, but also in the form of FDI. 
According to international standards, FDI is de -
fined as a cross- border participation in the cap -ital or voting rights of a firm of 10% or more. 
The stock of German firms’ FDI rose from €412 
billion in 1999 to €1,444 billion in 2015.29 At 
the same time, certain countries have grown in 
terms of economic importance. China, in par -
ticular, as well as the central and eastern Euro -
pean countries of the Czech Republic, Poland 
and Hungary are playing an increasingly im -
portant role. In these countries, the FDI stock 
has risen by several times the average of other 
countries. Based on the UNCTAD (United Na -
tions Conference on Trade and Development) 
statistics, it is striking in an international com -
parison that the share of the global FDI stock 
held by Germany has remained largely con -
stant, while the share held by many other ad -
vanced economies, such as the United States 
and the United Kingdom, has declined given 
the increasing importance of large emerging 
market economies such as China, as direct in -
vestors amongst other things.
German firms use FDI – which is a rather long- 
term instrument – to pursue a range of stra -
tegic objectives. In a survey by the Association 
of German Chambers of Commerce and Indus -
try (DIHK) of member firms in the manufactur -
ing sector, 45% of the companies surveyed re -

26 The offshoring coefficient for the factor capital varies 
between a cross-  country estimate and an estimate for 
which only the data for Germany are used.
27 On the basis of estimates taken from the literature, the 
contribution of offshoring to the growth rate of gross out -
put is calculated to be 0.06 percentage point per year in 
the period from 1995 to 2014. See M Amiti and S-  J Wei 
(2008), Service offshoring and productivity: evidence from 
the US, The World Economy, Vol 32, pp 203-220.
28 This would mean that the scale effect of the growth in 
production would more than offset the decline in the cap -
ital share of output through offshoring. This is the case if 
the contribution of offshoring to the growth rate of the 
production volume is assumed to be at least around three 
times the figure of 0.06 percentage point per year esti -
mated for Germany.
29 In this article, FDI includes both primary and secondary 
foreign direct investment. The aggregate figures are based 
on the Microdatabase Direct investment (MiDi). The figure 
of €1,444 billion in 2015 is comparable to the current fig -
ure for “claims arising from outward foreign direct invest -
ment” as reported in: Deutsche Bundesbank, Foreign direct 
investment stock statistics, Special Statistical Publication 
10, April 2017. However, the claims arising from affiliated

vices was their main reason for investing 
abroad in 2017.30 Furthermore, investing in for -
eign production sites for market development 
(response given by 31% of firms) was a key mo -
tivating factor. Only just under a quarter of the 
firms surveyed said that they mainly invested 
abroad to save costs, which was the reason 
most often given at the beginning of the 
2000s.
The academic literature provides no clear indi -
cation yet as to whether FDI tends to crowd 
out or complement domestic investment. 
Based on macroeconomic data, some studies 
point to a positive relationship, whilst other re -
search identifies a substitution effect in the 
long term.31 Only a few empirical studies are 
based on firm- level microdata which, unlike ag -
gregate data, allow conclusions to be drawn 
about the direct impact of an investment 
abroad on the domestic investment decisions 
of the individual firms. The results of studies 
such as these tend to show a positive relation -
ship between investment abroad and at 
home.32
A recent study by the Bundesbank links two 
datasets with detailed information on German 
firms.33 While the Microdatabase Direct invest -
ment (MiDi) provides information about indi -
vidual investment relations to firms abroad, the 
corporate balance sheet statistics ( Unterneh -
mensbilanzstatistik,  or Ustan) report, amongst 
other things, the level of a firm’s gross fixed 
capital formation in Germany. An econometric 
analysis of the relationships at the firm level 
suggests that, on average, there is a positive 
relationship between German FDI and the 
gross fixed capital formation of a firm in Ger -
many (see the box on pages 22 and 23).
There are several possible explanations for this 
complementarity. For instance, although FDI 
can be a tool for cost- driven offshoring, it may 
also lead to an increase in the productivity of 
the domestic parent firm. Nonetheless, the 
overall impact of FDI on domestic investment is 
uncertain, since scale effects are counterbal -anced by potential substitution effects between 
domestic and foreign capital.34 However, these 
findings provide no indication that vertical FDI 
contributes to the expansion of domestic in -
vestment. Estimates which examine vertical 
motives for investing abroad or the change in Literature has

The relationship between foreign direct investment and 
 domestic investment at the fi  rm level*
Two Bundesbank datasets are used to 
examine the relationship between foreign 
direct investment (FDI) and domestic invest-
ment at the fi  rm level: the Microdatabase 
Direct investment (MiDi) and the corporate 
balance sheet statistics (Unternehmens-
bilanzstatistik, or Ustan). Domestic fi  rms are 
legally obliged to report information on their foreign affi   liates to the Bundesbank. 
The MiDi database contains various balance 
sheet items, country information and the foreign affi   liates’ industry classifi  cations. 
The dataset allows a distinction to be made as to whether or not a domestic parent fi  rm has established (or acquired) a new foreign affi   liate in a given year. In addition, country- 
specifi  c information, such as foreign tax 
rates, is linked to the MiDi database.
The Bundesbank’s Ustan statistics comprise 
balance sheet data and information from 
the profi  t and loss accounts of German fi  rms. The dataset also contains data on gross fi  xed capital formation in Germany. Other empirical studies tend not to have 
this information at their disposal as a fl  ow 
variable, which means that investment is, in 
these cases, determined as the change in the stock of fi  xed assets on the balance 
sheet. The calculated fi  gure is then more in 
line with net fi  xed capital formation, as it 
already includes depreciation.
The MiDi data are merged with the Ustan 
data using a correspondence table provided 
by the Bundesbank’s Research Data and Service Centre (RDSC).
1 Firms’ investment 
decisions may depend on various regional 
factors. With that in mind, specifi  c regional 
information from the national accounts at 
the state level and from the Federal Statis-tical Offi   ce’s GENESIS database are also im-ported.
One diffi   culty in estimating the relationship 
between domestic and foreign investment 
at the fi  rm level stems from the fact that a 
fi  rm’s foreign and domestic investment de-
cisions are not generally independent of one another. Simply comparing domestic gross fi  xed capital formation between do-mestic parent fi  rms that have, in a given year, established (or acquired) a new for-
eign affi   liate and other fi  rms that have not 
done so would therefore paint a distorted 
picture. In order to account for potential se-lection and simultaneity bias, the probability 
of a domestic parent fi  rm establishing (or acquiring) a new foreign affi   liate is deter-
mined in a fi  rst step. This is done using the following estimation equation:
2
(1) Treatit =  αXi,t–1 + δZs,t–1 + βCk,t–1 
+ γMl,t–1 + ϕt + ψs + εit
The binary variable Treatit assumes a value 
of one if a domestic parent fi  rm i  estab-
lishes (or acquires) a new foreign affi   liate in 
period t. Otherwise, the value is zero. The 
specifi  cation is based on the assumption

that establishing (or buying) a new foreign 
affi   liate depends on fi  rm- specifi  c variables 
at the domestic parent fi  rm i (Xi,t–1), sector 
characteristics s (Zs,t–1), and regional vari-
ables at the county level k  (Ck,t–1) and the 
municipal level l  (Ml,t–1) in the previous 
period. In addition, the estimation controls 
for time- specifi  c (ϕt) and sector- specifi  c 
(ψs) fi  xed effects. Equation (1) is estimated 
using a probit model. Based on the estima-
tion coeffi   cients and the explanatory vari-
ables, a propensity score can be calculated 
for every fi  rm. These scores can be used to 
isolate the effect of foreign investment by 
forming two groups of fi  rms with the same 
attributes, which differ solely in terms of 
the presence of a new foreign affi   liate.3 
Finally , a second step is undertaken to test 
whether domestic investment activity dif-
fers signifi  cantly between the two groups.
The estimation results suggest that a do-mestic parent fi  rm establishing (or acquir-ing) a new foreign affi   liate is, on average, 
associated with a €458,000 increase in do-
mestic investment (as measured by the change in gross fi  xed capital formation). The effect at the fi  rm level is likely to be relevant in economic terms, as this fi  gure 
equates to around 4% of the average gross 
fi  xed capital formation within the group 
under review (in this case, domestic parent 
fi  rms that set up or acquire a new affi   liate 
abroad). Alternative measures of domestic 
investment activity largely yield qualitatively similar results. The results do not change in 
various robustness tests. Consequently, 
there appears to be a positive relationship 
between FDI and domestic investment for 
German fi  rms.

the total factor productivity of multinational 
firms as further possible causes for domestic in -
vestment do not substantiate this hypothesis.
Another explanation for the positive relation -
ship between FDI and domestic investment are 
the potential tax savings arising from the in -
crease in internal debt vis- à- vis foreign affiliates 
or from transfer pricing. Empirical studies sug -
gest that multinational firms use international 
tax differentials to shift corporate profits from 
high- tax to low- tax countries.35 Theoretical 
studies show that, in the context of investment 
decisions, shifting profits from one location to 
another can reduce a firm’s cost of capital and thus facilitate investment in countries with 
higher tax rates, such as Germany.36 In line 
with this theory, the results at hand show that 
the impact of FDI on investment at home varies 
depending on the tax rate – the more German 
firms benefit from a low tax rate in the host 
country of their affiliates, the more those firms 
also invest domestically. Affiliates in countries 
with a lower tax rate than at home can there -
fore reduce the effective capital costs of the 
parent firm, thus freeing up additional re -
sources that can be used for domestic invest -
ment. Consistent with this, domestic parent 
firms that invest abroad by establishing a new 
affiliate pay less tax overall. The higher the par -
ent’s liabilities to the foreign affiliate, for ex -
ample through intra- group lending, the more 
the parent will save on tax. Amongst other 
things, the (limited) tax deductibility of borrow -
ing costs is an important factor in that regard.
In addition, the financing opportunities in the 
host country may also be of relevance. Al -
though some studies conclude based on the 
assumption of financial market frictions that 
– all other things being equal – an increase in 
investment abroad raises the cost of capital for 
investment at home,37 recent empirical studies 
conversely emphasise that multinational firms 
mainly fund their investments via the global 
and internal capital markets, meaning that ac -
cess to financial resources in a given country 
does not necessarily limit business activity, but 
that improved access to the international finan -
cial markets can even reduce the cost of capital

throughout the group.38 According to the Bun -
desbank’s estimates, the positive relationship is 
likely to be more pronounced if the level of 
financial  market development in the host coun -
try is higher – measured here in terms of stock 
market capitalisation. The results also suggest 
that the domestic parent company’s internal 
liabilities  increase more, the higher the ratio of 
lending to the private sector relative to gross 
domestic product and the higher the stock 
market capitalisation is in the host country. This 
would appear to indicate that improved access 
to foreign capital goes some way towards ex -
plaining the positive relationship between FDI 
and domestic investment.
Two additional reasons for direct investment 
(rated as important in the DIHK survey) are 
sales/ customer service and market develop -
ment. However, the microdata available do not 
contain any specific information about the rea -
sons for foreign investments, meaning that this 
aspect cannot be analysed separately here.
The impact on aggregate investment can also 
be roughly gauged from the available estima -
tion results. In this case, we assume that the 
estimated average effect applies to all parent 
firms with new foreign affiliates39 and that FDI 
does not generate any additional indirect spill -
over effects to other domestic firms. According 
to this estimation, FDI would increase aggre -
gate domestic gross fixed capital formation by 
€687 million per year on average.40 Compared 
to Germany’s total annual gross fixed capital 
formation, which amounted to €490 billion on 
average during the period from 2000 to 2013, 
this is a relatively small figure. This does not 
contradict the estimated impact of €458,000 
at the firm level, which is economically signifi -
cant to the parent firms in question in terms of 
their gross fixed capital formation. The extrapo -
lation results at the macro level merely reflect 
the relatively small number of German firms 
with new affiliates abroad.Conclusion
The internationalisation of German firms has 
repercussions for domestic investment. The re -
sults of the analysis presented in this article 
suggest that, in order to assess the impact of 
the internationalisation of the corporate sector 
on investment at home, a differentiation by 
both type of foreign activity and domestic asset 
is required.
The effects of offshoring on demand for capital 
at home differ depending on asset type. The 
results suggest that offshoring does reduce the 
non- ICT capital share in production but does 
not have any noticeable impact on the ICT cap -
ital share in output. Across countries, offshor -
ing is likely to have caused a slight decline in 
the share of R&D capital in production, al -
though the R&D share may have increased 
somewhat in Germany. One possible explan -
ation for the variation of the effect by asset 
class are redundancies in the complementary 
asset classes on the capital input side which 
occur once production stages with low skill re -
quirements have been moved offshore. Fur -
thermore, offshoring allows countries to spe -
cialise in areas in which they enjoy a compara -
tive advantage, which for advanced economies 
is mainly likely to be in the areas of high- skilled 
labour, and ICT and R&D capital. In future, the 
expected decline in the labour force in Ger -
many and the resultant potential shortage of 
skilled workers could see firms decide to off -
shore production stages requiring higher- skilled 
labour, too. Nonetheless, rising labour costs 
abroad and new manufacturing opportunities 
at home through technological advances could 
also lead to production reshoring in some 
cases.Effects of

on a smaller sample of parent firms.

The restructuring of the production process, 
which can also take place via supply contracts 
with legally independent suppliers, is likely to 
have had a slightly negative effect on aggre -
gate business investment in Germany in the 
past. This was probably particularly true in the 
decade before the 2007-08 financial crisis 
broke out, given that offshoring has developed 
at a markedly more subdued pace since then. 
By contrast, offshoring is not the only reason 
for establishing or acquiring new foreign affili -
ates – they also provide German firms with ac -
cess to new markets, open up additional fund -ing opportunities and can sometimes allow tax 
savings if profits are shifted abroad. Here, the 
results of the analyses point to a positive overall 
firm- level relationship between FDI and gross 
fixed capital formation at home. All things con -
sidered, it is therefore possible to identify op -
posing transmission channels through which 
the various types of foreign activity by firms in -
fluence domestic demand for investment. 
However, both studies have in common that 
the quantitative impact on overall domestic in -
vestment is small.Offshoring and

The importance of bank profitability and 
bank capital for monetary policy
The financial and sovereign debt crisis has now also increasingly shifted the banking system’s 
capital and profitability towards the centre of monetary policy analysis as both factors are closely 
linked to monetary policy. On the one hand, weak profitability, which implies a reduced ability on 
the part of banks to generate capital, can lead to more restrictive lending policies, thus reducing 
the impact of accommodative monetary policy measures. On the other hand, monetary policy 
can also influence banks’ profitability and capital through interest rates and the term structure. 
Empirical studies illustrate the relevance of this bank capital channel. The net interest margins 
generated by banks, which constitute a significant part of their profitability, can come under pres -
sure in prolonged periods of accommodative monetary policy and low interest rates. At the same 
time, low interest rates can also have a positive impact on profitability, eg in the form of reduced 
loan loss provisions; however, these effects may not be strong enough to compensate for decreas -
ing net interest margins.
The relationship between monetary policy and bank profitability is particularly important if bank 
capital is already on the lower side, ie close to regulatory capital requirements, and if the ability 
to raise capital in the market is limited. Whereas the banking system’s capital endowment has 
improved considerably over the past few years in the euro area, the stock of non- performing 
loans (NPLs) – despite a gradual decline at the current end – is still very high in some countries. 
The potential future losses resulting from this high volume of NPLs could entail implicit capital 
constraints.
In an environment of low interest rates, it is thus conceivable that a low level of bank capital 
could lead to a situation where accomodative monetary policy measures could, at least in the 
longer term, not stimulate but instead dampen lending. Hence, the impact of an accommodative 
monetary policy measure transmitted through the bank capital channel would weaken the desired 
policy effect. It is, therefore, of key importance for banks to have a good capital endowment, not 
only from a financial stability standpoint, but also from a monetary policy perspective.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The financial and sovereign debt crisis in the 
euro area has left a clear mark on the European 
financial system. Since 2008, the environment 
in which monetary policy makers and banks 
have been operating has witnessed major 
change. Even today, many banks remain con -
fronted with large stocks of non- performing 
loans (NPLs) on their balance sheets, which in -
crease their capital needs by the same measure 
that additional loan loss provisions (LLPs) are 
required. Moreover, the implementation of 
Basel  III has tightened regulatory capital re -
quirements. In the past, it was the government 
which stepped in to address serious capital 
shortfalls in an emergency by introducing re -
capitalisation measures. However, with the 
entry into force of the European rules for the 
recovery and resolution of credit institutions 
(Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, or 
BRRD) and the regulation establishing the Sin -
gle Resolution Mechanism (SRM), this should 
no longer be possible in the same way.
Monetary policy makers, too, are now increas -
ingly focusing on bank profitability and capital. 
These factors are important elements in the 
monetary policy transmission process, their role 
in maintaining the financial system’s stability 
and proper functioning being just one reason. 
The currently low and, in some cases, negative 
interest rates –  attributable, amongst other 
things, to the accommodative monetary pol -
icy – weigh on interest income and, all other 
things being equal, bank profitability and, con -
sequently, their ability to internally generate 
capital from earnings.
As exclusive monetary policy counterparties of 
the Eurosystem, banks play a key role in the 
transmission of monetary policy measures to 
the real economy and to inflation. Although al -
ternative sources of funding have become in -
creasingly relevant for non- financial corpor -
ations over the past few years, bank loans are 
of major importance in the euro area’s primar -
ily bank- based financial system as they provide external funds to the non- financial private sec -
tor.1 However, a significant proportion of the 
non- financial private sector is still unable to 
substitute their bank loans in part or in full with 
other sources of funding. One of the main rea -
sons for this imperfect substitutability is the in -
formation asymmetry that generally exists 
between  lenders and borrowers.2 Banks reduce 
this asymmetry in their function as lenders by 
checking and monitoring their borrowers and 
by establishing long- term customer ties, for ex -
ample. At the same time, the relevance of 
banks in the realm of private sector financing 
goes beyond bank loans, also because banks 
provide funds to the private sector via other 
segments of the financial market.3
Given the key role banks play in monetary pol -
icy, a stable and smoothly functioning banking 
system is essential to the effectiveness of mon -
etary policy. Bearing that in mind, the primary 
responsibility for ensuring the stability of indi -
vidual institutions and the banking system as a 
whole lies with microprudential and macropru -
dential regulators, eg by subjecting banks to 
binding minimum capital requirements. Con -
versely, however, standard and non- standard 
monetary policy measures also affect banks’ 
economic environment and thus their financing 
costs, profitability and capital position. This, in 
turn, largely determines how banks conduct 
their business, including the setting of credit 
standards and interest rates. It is, indeed, likely 
that the overall impact of monetary policy 
measures on economic activity and inflation 
depend to a great extent on these relationships 
(see the chart on page 29).Increase in

In order for capital to fulfil its guarantee and 
insurance function,4 regulators require banks to 
hold a specified minimum amount of capital 
against outstanding loans which is positively 
linked to the riskiness of the loan exposures.5 
Besides these regulatory provisions, investor 
behaviour, too, substantially influences the 
scope of the capital endowment, in particular, 
say, when investors are not prepared to provide 
banks with external or own funds because they 
regard the bank’s capital as insufficient. If bank 
capital is only just enough, or even insufficient, 
to cover losses, this may constrain bank lend -
ing.6
From a bank’s perspective, there are two ways 
to avoid lending constraints by building up cap -
ital. The first one is to retain earnings; the 
second is to issue equity instruments (eg 
shares).7 As a general rule, both approaches 
have their limitations, which are influenced by 
monetary policy, amongst other things. Earn -
ings can only be retained at the pace at which they are generated and investors are unlikely to 
be willing to purchase unlimited quantities of 
newly issued equity instruments.8Low capital 
endowment may lead to lending  constraints

built up in two ways: by retain-ing profits and by issuing equity instrumentsTransmission mechanism of monetary policy

also to other firms.

lems play a role, as banks are usually better informed about 
the quality of their assets and the sustainability of their

from equity instruments are limited to uncertain profit dis -
tribution, information asymmetries are particularly relevant 
in this type of financing. Non-  financial corporations, too, 
face information problems when raising capital. See

Bank capital and risk- taking 
channel
Of the bank- side transmission channels dis -
cussed in the literature, a particularly bright 
light has recently been shined on the bank cap -
ital channel as the main focus for monetary 
policy transmission through this channel is on 
banks’ profitability and capital endowment. 
Here, it is postulated that monetary policy 
measures impact directly on bank profitability 
and thus also banks’ ability to build up capital.9 
With the aim of maximising profits, banks in 
the bank capital channel adjust their lending 
volume according to the development of their 
capital position, provided that the latter consti -
tutes a binding restriction.10 By impacting on 
banks’ profitability and capital position, monet -
ary policy measures also affect banks’ lending 
business (for a discussion of a theoretical model 
for analysing the role of banks’ profitability and 
capital endowment on transmission in the con -
text of a monetary policy purchase programme, 
see the box on pages 31 to 34).
The transmission mechanisms described by the 
bank capital channel become relevant from a 
macroeconomic perspective when capital en -
dowment becomes a binding constraint on 
lending for a sufficiently high share of banks. 
This is the case when banks’ capital endow -
ment is initially small and information asym -
metries between banks and potential investors 
are so strong that building up capital by issuing 
equity instruments is constrained or, in some 
cases, even altogether impossible. The model 
developed by Van den Heuvel (2007) uses a 
partial analysis to explain the potential relation -
ship between banks’ capital endowment and 
the strength of the bank capital channel.11 The 
decisive factor is the size of the excess capital 
buffer at the time when the monetary policy 
measure is introduced. The excess capital buf -
fer is the difference between the actual capital 
ratio and that required by regulators, with the 
latter depending on the volume of loan expos -
ures. If the initial excess capital buffer is low, 
banks are bound by capital constraints.12 The excess capital buffer is not static in the model; 
instead, it reflects banks’ past performance.13 
Since a bank’s net lending is restricted by its 
buffer, it is unable to grant new loans if it has 
only a very small buffer or none whatsoever. 
Therefore, in the case of a poorly capitalised 
bank, an accommodative monetary policy 
measure will have no effect in the short term. 
However, there is a certain likelihood that, by 
retaining profits, the capital position of a poorly 
capitalised bank will recover in the medium 
term; in principle, this should enable the bank 
to grant (more) loans again. This likelihood 
changes with a monetary policy measure’s im -
pact on profitability. Conversely, in the case of 
well capitalised banks, the effect of a monetary Bank capital 
channel models transmission of monetary policy measures to bank capital through profit -
ability
Bank capital 
channel effective 
when access to 
capital on the 
market is limited 
and initial capital  
endowment is low9 In addition, bank capital is regarded as an important de -
terminant of banks’ funding costs. Hence, a worse (better) 
capital position increases (decreases) a bank’s credit risk 
and correspondingly leads to higher (lower) risk premiums 
to be paid by the bank when acquiring funds. Borrowing 
funds becomes more costly if banks pass on the higher risk 
premiums to borrowers. See also P  Disyatat (2011), The 
bank lending channel revisited, Journal of Money, Credit 
and Banking 43 (4), pp 711-734.
10 See S J Van den Heuvel (2007), The bank capital channel 
of monetary policy, Working Paper, Wharton School, Uni -
versity of Pennsylvania. See also the following papers 
where the term “bank capital channel” is not explicitly 
mentioned, but which nevertheless describe a channel 
through which monetary policy measures are transmitted 
via the banking system’s profitability and capital position, ie 
R Chami and T F Cosimano (2010), Monetary policy with a 
touch of Basel, Journal of Economics and Business 62, 
pp 161-175; and M Woodford (2010), Financial intermedi -
ation and macroeconomic analysis, Journal of Economic 
Perspectives, 24(4), pp 21-44; and P Disyatat (2011), op cit.
11 See S J Van den Heuvel (2007), op cit. The model is 
based on the assumption that capital is generated by re -
taining profits alone and not by issuing equity instruments.
12 Van den Heuvel demonstrates that capital constraints 
become binding before the buffer is actually exhausted. A 
higher or lower probability of falling below minimum cap -
ital requirements in the future may already affect lending in 
the present. See S J Van den Heuvel (2002), Does bank cap -
ital matter for monetary transmission?, Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York Economic Policy Review, May 2002, 
pp 259-265.
13 A key difference compared with the model logic of the 
bank lending channel is the development of the capital 
ratio. In the bank lending channel, the capital ratio is as -
sumed to be exogenous and therefore does not change in 
response to a monetary policy measure. The adjustments 
to banks’ lending volume as a result of a monetary policy 
measure occur in the form of changes in deposit holdings, 
above all by households. Monetary policy thus changes the 
opportunity costs of holding deposits. For more on the 
bank lending channel, see, for example, L  Gambacorta 
(2005), Inside the bank lending channel, European Eco -
nomic Review 49 (7), pp 1737-1759. For a comparison of 
capital in the bank capital channel versus the bank lending 
channel, see S Van den Heuvel (2002), op cit.Deutsche Bundesbank

The role of the bank capital channel in the transmission 
of non- standard monetary policy measures
The bank capital channel will be examined 
from the perspective of a macroeconomic 
general equilibrium model with a fully 
fl  edged fi  nancial market.1 The purchase of 
government bonds is considered a non- standard monetary policy measure in this context. For the sake of simplicity, it is as-sumed that the central bank makes these purchases unexpectedly within a specifi  c 
period and then reduces the acquired stock again over time. Although the exact charac-
teristics of the measures considered here 
differ somewhat from those of the Eurosys-tem’s asset purchase programme (APP), the 
macroeconomic and fi  nancial variables re-spond in the same way.
2 There are, how-
ever, differences in the magnitude of the 
effects.
In the model presented here, households 
decide how much they want to work, con-sume, and save. They either invest their sav-
ings in interest- bearing bank accounts or purchase long- term government bonds. The banks fi  nance themselves via equity 
and debt capital, with the debt capital cor-
responding to the households’ deposits. They use these funds primarily to issue loans to non- fi  nancial corporations. How-ever, like households, they can also pur-chase long- term government bonds and 
– to a lesser extent – bonds issued by non- 
fi  nancial corporations.3 Non- fi  nancial cor-
porations invest their equity and debt in risk- bearing capital goods, which are pro-cessed into intermediate goods using the labour supplied by households. Typically, 
this type of model is based on the assump-
tion that the producers of intermediate 
goods and suppliers of labour services have (limited) market power in their sectors, and 
can therefore infl  uence the price of their goods and their wage rate respectively, al-
though this may occur with a slight time lag in some cases.
4
An important building block in this model is that debt contracts are concluded between 
non- fi  nancial corporations and banks as well as between banks and households. The debt contracts between non- fi  nancial corporations and banks are characterised by the fact that borrowers (non- fi  nancial 
corporations) are generally better informed 
about “their” project than lenders (banks). 
This means that information about the pro-
ject is distributed asymmetrically. Under 
these circumstances, lenders would have to bear a signifi  cant fi  nancial burden to inves-
tigate the reasons for a potential payment 
default. Another feature of debt contracts is 
that it can be very costly, or even impos-sible, to recover arrears using coercive measures. Such a loan agreement is con-cluded between banks and households in the model. In both cases, loans are there-
1 A New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilib-
rium (DSGE) model, as described in Kühl (2016), is 
used. See M Kühl, The effects of government bond 
purchases on leverage constraints of banks and non- 
fi  nancial fi  rms, Deutsche Bundesbank Discussion Paper, No 38/ 2016.2 The quantitative effects of the APP were examined in 
the Deutsche Bundesbank’s June 2016 Monthly Re-
port. See Deutsche Bundesbank, The macroeconomic 
impact of quantitative easing in the euro area, Monthly Report, June 2016, pp 29-53.3 In the model, there are two different groups of cap-
ital producers. The fi  rst group exclusively uses bank loans as debt capital, while the second group only 
issues corporate bonds.
4 The real sector therefore resembles a typical New 
Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium 
model. In this context, the producers of intermediate 
goods and suppliers of labour are only able to set their profi  t- maximising price with a certain level of probabil-ity (known as Calvo pricing). See F Smets and R Wout-
ers (2003), An estimated dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of the euro area, Journal of the 
European Economic Association, 1 (5), pp 1123-1175.Deutsche Bundesbank

fore usually only issued if borrowers con-
tribute their own funds to the project. This 
means that leverage is a key variable for 
both issuing bank loans as well as the will-
ingness to hold deposits.5 For these rea-
sons, the economic agents in the present 
model –  the owners of banks and non- fi  nancial corporations  – must contribute 
their own capital.6 The higher the leverage 
of the non- fi  nancial corporation, the higher the lending rate will be, as the lender would want to offset any potential losses.
7 The ac-
counting scope of the fi  nancial and non- fi  nancial corporations is therefore limited 
(balance sheet constraint). If the banks’ le-
verage in the model increases – triggered 
perhaps by a decline in capital – this leads 
to the households withdrawing part of their deposits from their accounts.
8 The liabilities 
side of the banks’ balance sheets erodes 
and, inversely, the banks must reduce their total assets. A process of deleveraging takes hold.
The specifi  c impact of unexpected asset purchases by the central bank within this 
model will be explored further below. As an 
initial reaction to the additional demand 
from the central bank, the prices of govern-ment bonds rise and their yields fall accord-
ingly.9 As securities are marked to market, 
thereby increasing the volume of assets on the balance sheet, the amount of capital on the liability side of the banks’ balance sheets also grows. Due to the falling leverage, the 
households are now more willing to hold 
deposits with the banks. Banks respond to 
the changed structure of prices and bal-ances by rebalancing their portfolios (see 
chart on page 42). The banking sector as a 
whole offers an increased volume of loans 
to non- fi  nancial corporations, and at better borrowing conditions than before the asset 
purchases began, as the market for loans 
would otherwise not be cleared.10 This en-
ables non- fi  nancial corporations to more easily service debts through decreased lend-
ing rates. Their profi  t and capital increase, initially allowing them to fi  nance new in-
vestment projects primarily with these own funds.
11 Consequently, there is no substan-
tial change in lending to the non- fi  nancial 
corporations in the period immediately fol-lowing the asset purchases.
5 Leverage is defi  ned as the ratio of total assets to cap-
ital. An increase in leverage therefore increases total 
assets relative to capital, which ultimately implies a rise 
in the relative signifi  cance of debt capital.
6 The modelling of fi  nancial frictions in non- fi  nancial 
corporations is based on B S Bernanke, M Gertler and S Gilchrist (1999), The fi  nancial accelerator in a quanti-
tative business cycle framework, in J  Taylor and M Woodford (eds.), Handbook of Macroeconomics, 
pp 1341-1393, while the fi  nancial frictions in the bank-
ing sector follow M  Gertler and P  Karadi (2011), A 
model of unconventional monetary policy, Journal of 
Monetary Economics, 58, pp 17-34.
7 Ultimately, higher leverage means that loans are 
fi  nanced  by less capital.8 The infl  ow or outfl  ow of deposits also plays a crucial 
role in another monetary policy transmission channel 
– the bank lending channel. However, in this case, it is triggered by changes in the opportunity costs of hold-ing deposits or by a shortage of central bank reserves. 
Within the context of the model discussed here, the infl  ows and outfl  ows are, by comparison, predomin-
antly the result of changes in bank leverage. Therefore, 
it is investors –  rather than, say, supervisors  – who ultimately  force the bank to comply with minimum 
capital requirements in the model.
9 In this model, government bonds and other assets 
are imperfect substitutes, ie they differ in terms of 
transaction costs and degree of liquidity, for example. In this case, there are limits to arbitrage, which allows sustainable price reactions to be triggered (contradict-ing the assumptions of Wallace neutrality). An account 
of this topic can be found in H Chen, V Cúrdia and 
A Ferrero (2012), The macroeconomic effects of large- 
scale asset purchase programmes, The Economic Journal , 122, pp F289-F315; as well as in Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2016), op cit, pp 36-37.
10 In the model, assets are purchased regardless of 
developments in the real economy. This modelling ap-
proach makes it possible to measure the impact of 
asset purchases directly. In the real world, the central 
bank reacts to economic developments using non- 
standard measures in order to achieve its objectives. It may therefore be the case that any excess demand for 
loans is mitigated by portfolio rebalancing. However, 
the effects outlined here must be considered solely in relation to the underlying scenario.11 In the case of old loans with longer maturities, this 
effect occurs with a time lag, as the lower lending 
rates only apply to new loans. The effect described in 
the main text is not fundamentally changed by this, 
but merely softened. See M Andreasen, M Ferman and 
P Zabczyk (2013), The business cycle implications of banks’ maturity transformation, Review of Economic 
Dynamics, 16 (4), pp 581-600.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

In the case of the banks, declining credit 
and capital market rates cause a fall in the 
net interest margin – the difference be-
tween the interest received on their assets 
and the interest paid on their debt.12 Thus, 
after the initial positive stimulus, bank cap-
ital is weakened and even drops relatively 
quickly in the medium term to below its starting level. Their leverage rises accord-ingly. The mechanisms of the bank capital channel described above now operate in 
the opposite direction. The banks’ liability- 
side business comes under pressure as the 
households are less willing to hold deposits with the banks. In this way, the households 
prevent a constant rise in bank leverage. The banking sector then needs to scale 
down its total assets to a greater extent. In the present model, it does this solely by re-
ducing its stocks of government bonds.13 
The net interest margin goes back up and lending slowly increases. The main reason behind this development is non- fi  nancial corporations’ now increased demand for credit. An expansionary stimulus on gross 
domestic product and infl  ation is the ultim-ate, indirect outcome of asset purchases in 
this model framework. At the same time, 
the model simulations also show that asset 
purchases reduce interest margins and thereby put a strain on bank capital (see 
above chart).
Initial experiences of the APP in practice in-
dicate that this is not just the case in the-
ory.14 For the monetary policy analysis, it is 
therefore all the more important to assess 
the signifi  cance of the bank capital channel 
12 Once again, it should be stressed that the effects 
weaken only if a maturity structure is assumed and the 
interest rate effect only applies to new loans.13 As the assets on the banks’ balance sheets are im-
perfect substitutes, the APP leads to a reduction in 
total assets in the model. This effect is now even more pronounced.14 See the ad hoc questions on the APP contained in 
the European Central Bank’s Bank Lending Survey for 
2015 Q3, 2016 Q1, 2016 Q3, 2017 Q1, and 2017 Q3.Effects of an asset purchase programme on the real economy and the financial sector*

described above for the transmission of 
monetary policy stimulus. A counterfactual 
analysis is appropriate here. This type of 
analysis  is a notional experiment in which a 
monetary policy stimulus acts on model 
variables, but its effect on capital is elimin-
ated. The “actual” and “counterfactual” re-
sults described above are then compared (see chart above).
15 There are signs that, 
above all, the credit volume is highly sensi-
tive to changes in bank capital in the me-dium and long term. In terms of the con-
stancy of capital, the credit volume rises not 
only more strongly but also more persist-
ently – almost doubling at its peak.16 Gross domestic product also exhibits a different 
reaction. The initial rise in real economic ac-
tivity is indeed less pronounced, but con-tinues for a signifi  cantly longer period of 
time.
The present model provides crucial insight into the extent to which (non- standard) monetary policies are transmitted to bank 
capital and leverage as well as the magni-
tude of their effects on the real economy 
and infl  ation. However, the model does not 
contain all of the variables and channels 
that matter in the real world. For instance, even before the start of the APP , the Euro-
system had already introduced measures 
that affected bank liabilities.17 The introduc-
tion of negative interest rates on central 
bank reserves is also not taken into consid-
eration. Finally, neither regulatory policy concerns regarding asset purchases nor political- economic aspects are refl  ected in 
the framework presented in this article.
15 Bank capital remains constant in as much that an-
ticipated shocks prevent change. A transfer of re-
sources in order to keep bank capital unchanged 
therefore does not take place. The model also remains unchanged.16 In terms of the constancy of capital, there is now a 
persistent decline in leverage in the banking sector. Admittedly, the profi  t margins in the banking sector continue to shrink. By nature, however, there is no negative effect on capital in the medium term. This 
ultimately prevents an increase in leverage. While there 
are hardly any differences in lending shortly after the 
start of the asset purchase programme, there are, as is 
the case with leverage, larger deviations in the me-dium term. This is due to the fact that, during this 
period, the non- fi  nancial corporations fi  nance their in-
creased investing activities predominantly using their 
own funds.17 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2016), op cit.Significance of bank capital for the transmission of an asset purchase programme

policy measure on profitability has hardly any 
bearing on bank lending, as those banks are 
unlikely to fall short of the regulatory capital 
requirements, at least in the short term (for de -
tails on the importance of capital and the ex -
cess capital buffer from an economic and mon -
etary policy point of view, see the box on 
pages 36 and 37).
The bank capital channel is closely linked to 
what is known as the risk- taking channel. The 
underlying assumption is that risk perception or 
tolerance by economic agents – and thus also 
banks  – varies with interest rates, amongst 
other factors.14 These economic agents may be 
willing to tolerate greater risks to compensate 
for any negative effects on profitability stem -
ming from low interest rates, thus helping to 
achieve certain profitability or return objectives. 
In this case, the low- interest- rate environment 
affects risk tolerance via profitability.15 An ele -
vated risk tolerance by banks can, for instance, 
be reflected in an expansion of the lending vol -
ume to riskier borrowers or in the tolerance of 
higher interest rate risk. In conceptual and em -
pirical terms, there is not always a clear separ -
ation between the risk- taking channel and the 
bank capital channel. The willingness to take 
on greater risk in the form of granting more 
loans as a result of a monetary policy- induced 
improvement in the capital position, which, 
from a macroeconomic perspective, can have 
repercussions for the pricing of risk, can be 
understood as a manifestation of the risk-  
taking channel as well.16
Non- performing loans and 
bank capital: situation in the 
euro area
Bank capital ratios in the euro area have been 
improving continuously since the global finan -
cial crisis of 2008-09.17 Against this backdrop, 
it could be assumed that the banking system 
has extricated itself from a situation where cap -
ital constraints are relevant for the effectiveness 
of monetary policy. However, more stringent regulatory requirements were another factor in 
improved capital ratios. Whether or not capital 
constraints are in place cannot necessarily be 
directly derived from the capital ratio; instead, 
a comparison of the actual capital ratio and the 
regulatory capital ratio is needed. An increase 
in capital ratios is thus not a direct indicator of 
any existing capital constraints being mitigated.
In addition, the increase in capital ratios oc -
curred at a time when the stock of NPLs grew 
significantly, particularly in the southern euro 
area countries. NPLs affect banks’ capital ratios 
in a number of ways. For one, they have a dir -
ect adverse effect on profitability, reducing the 
ability to build up capital.18 A burdening effect 
on profitability occurs when loans stop per -
forming because the borrower is no longer 
able to meet interest payments and principal 
repayments in full, causing the loan to drop in 
value.19 This loss in value is reflected in loan 
loss reserves, the amount of which is deducted 
from the loan’s book value in the balance Risk- taking 
channel cap-tures monetary policy transmis-sion through perception and tolerance of risk

ment has im -proved since the crisis, while cap-ital requirements have become stricter …… and the  
stock of NPLs has increased

18 This applies to strengthening the capital position by re -
taining profits. Yet the ability to strengthen the capital pos -
ition by issuing equity instruments is likewise contingent on 
profitability. Weak profitability tends to go hand in hand 
with a lower market value and thus also with a reduced 
ability to consolidate the capital position in this way. For 
more information on this topic, see, for example, European 
Central Bank, Financial Stability Review, November 2017.

Authority (EBA), non- performing exposures are those that 
are more than 90 days past due in terms of a debtor’s

future. For more information, see European Banking Au -

Bank capital
Capital is not only a source of funding but 
also plays an important role in insuring any 
losses that occur. The higher the leverage of 
a fi  rm, the more prominent capital’s func-
tion as insurance becomes, at the expense 
of the original function of providing fi  -
nance. For banks, unlike non- fi  nancial cor-
porations, it is not capital’s funding func-
tion which is more important, but rather its guarantee and insurance function. In a nor-mal business environment, it primarily instils confi  dence, enabling a bank to borrow the 
funds it needs.1 Whereas, for any given 
bank, an individual target ratio of equity to debt fi  nance can thus be derived from capi-
tal’s business management functions, this 
ratio is additionally dependent on the regu-
latory, tax and macroeconomic environ-
ment.
Seen from an economic perspective, high capital ratios are benefi  cial when taken in isolation, especially since they strengthen banks’ ability to absorb losses and reduce the likelihood of distressed banks and the need for government rescue measures.
2 
Here, the steering function of capital re-
quirements is the most prominent feature: 
given limited opportunities to procure cap-
ital, high capital requirements, so the rea-
soning goes, would naturally constrain the 
bank’s size and contain the distortionary impact of guarantees and subsidies.
3 It is 
only the reported capital ratio that is rele-vant to banks’ ability to absorb losses caused by negative price and profi  tability 
shocks; this metric provides for a given ratio 
of equity fi  nancing irrespective of the assets’ 
risk. Over time, this ratio remains relatively 
stable and generally rises in line with regu-
latory capital requirements. This would ap-
pear to indicate that banks generally at-
tempt to maintain a given buffer in excess of regulatory capital requirements, ie they 
strive for a higher internal target capital 
ratio.4
The size of this excess capital buffer is not 
shaped by stricter regulatory requirements but is chosen freely by banks within the framework of their business decisions. 
There are at least three reasons for them to 
maintain such buffers: fi  rst, in order to be 
able to take advantage of sudden lucrative 
investment opportunities,5 second, as “in-
surance” against adverse capital shocks6 
and third, owing to existing market pres-
sure and to signal the bank’s own solvency.7 
The fi  rst two reasons are largely independ-

institute, Frankfurt a. M., pp 165-171.2 One very prominent proponent of this line of argu-

ent of the amount of the regulatory capital 
requirements. Put differently: banks prob-
ably keep their buffers constant even given 
higher regulatory requirements. If market 
pressure declines as regulatory capital ratios 
increase, the third reason might actually 
tend to argue in favour of reducing the ex-
cess capital buffer. One example where this 
could be the case is if market participants regard a certain reported capital ratio as being adequate for the bank and stricter regulatory requirements lead to this ratio 
being achieved, on the whole, even with a lower excess capital buffer.
Whereas the aforementioned reasons could 
be an argument for banks to choose a rela-
tively large buffer, tax incentives militate 
against the idea of banks voluntarily setting 
a high buffer. By distorting banks’ funding 
costs, the tax advantage of debt fi  nancing 
over equity fi  nancing is currently diminish-
ing banks’ incentive to use capital to fund 
their assets.8 Other risk mitigation measures 
taken by banks, too, reduce their desired 
target capital ratio. Risk sharing (diversifi  ca-tion: by type of asset, location, or organisa-tionally), risk compensation (through hedg-ing) and transfer of risk to third parties (de-
rivatives) are strategies typically employed by banks to reduce the amount of capital deemed necessary.
9 The larger the bank, 
the better able it is to use these risk mitiga-tion measures.
Banks’ excess capital buffers matter for monetary policy. Since higher buffers give 
banks more leeway and also boost the mar-
kets’ confi  dence, they reduce cyclicality in the fi  nancial system.
10 Theoretically, the 
benefi  ts to monetary policy of larger buffers 
could, for instance, be motivated via the bank capital channel.
11 Monetary policy is 
most likely to be able to act independently 
of profi  tability in the banking system if the 
banks are far removed enough from a situ-ation in which they are constrained by cap-ital requirements.
The concept of equity which “breathes” 
over the business cycle is also the basis for the counter- cyclical capital buffer as part of the toolkit of macroprudential instruments, 
which is designed to enhance resilience to 
systemic risks created by excessive lending 
and thus to mitigate the risk of fi  nancial cri-
ses.12 Empirical studies provide evidence 
that a better capital base of banks impacts 
positively on lending.13

sheet.20 In turn, the loan loss reserves are rec -
ognised in profit or loss as LLPs, ie a compon -
ent of profitability. Albeit to a lesser extent, 
NPLs also affect net interest income as the lack 
of interest income they cause represents a bur -
den as well. Furthermore, NPLs affect risk-  
weighted assets and, by extension, the denom -
inator of regulatory capital ratios given that 
other, often higher, risk weights should be used 
for the non- value- adjusted share of NPLs than 
for performing loans.
As long as any losses which might be caused by 
NPLs are fully covered at all times by appropri -
ate loan loss reserves in the balance sheet, the 
repercussions of NPLs are already factored into 
the specified regulatory capital ratios. However, 
if further losses from these loans are expected 
to materialise in the future and have not yet 
been covered by loan loss reserves, then the 
stock of NPLs contains additional information 
with regard to potential future capital con -
straints. Banks could, for example, put off form -
ing loan loss reserves for NPLs to avoid falling 
below the regulatory minimum capital require -
ments or the capital level tolerated by the mar -
kets. In this context, it is conceivable, for in -
stance, that banks continuously roll over loans 
to borrowers who can, in reality, no longer be 
classified as creditworthy in order to avoid a de -
fault and the recording of losses this would en -
tail (the box on pages 39 and 41 addresses the 
question of the extent to which NPLs influence 
banks’ lending policies and monetary policy 
transmission when the reported capital ratio is 
taken into consideration).21 In the euro area, 
the ratio of the stock of NPLs to the sum of cap -
ital and loan loss reserves for significant institu -
tions under the direct supervision of the ECB 
came to just under 60% at the end of 2015, 
with some countries reaching values above 
100%.22 Although a gradual decline – not least 
due to various policy measures – in the stock of 
NPLs and thus a turnaround in dynamics has 
been observed since then, the level continues to 
be very high.23 This demonstrates that potential 
losses arising from NPLs which are not yet in -
cluded in reported capital may well entail cap -ital constraints in the future and implicitly even 
in the present.
Impact of interest rates 
on bank profitability
The interest rate level and term structure are 
influenced by the use of monetary policy in -
struments. While it is not their sole driver, mon -
etary policy can exert significant influence over 
interest rates in the money market, at least in 
the short term. Changes in short- term interest 
rates are accompanied by a parallel shift in the 
term structure if they are replicated by interest 
rates at the long end. If not, or if not to the 
same extent, the slope of the yield curve will 
change accordingly. In response to the financial 
and sovereign debt crisis, the Eurosystem aug -
mented its set of standard monetary policy in -
struments with non- standard measures. After 
the zero lower bound had been reached at the 
short end, the purchase programmes, in par -
ticular, aimed at lowering the longer- term 
interest rate level.24 A reduction in longer- term 
interest rates is passed through to banks via a 
range of channels (see the chart on page 42).
Both the level of interest rates and the slope of 
the yield curve influence the financial perform -NPLs can be

20 In the case of loan loss reserves, both the gross value of 
the original figure and the bank’s value adjustment are re -
corded. Alternatively, the loan can also be amortised, elim -
inating this amount from the balance sheet.
21 In the literature, such practices are referred to as “ever -
greening” or “zombie lending”. For evidence regarding 
Japan and the adverse effects on its real economy, see

May 2016. The ratio mentioned in the text is also referred 
to as the “Texas ratio”. It is the ratio of the gross volume

which is calculated as the sum of loan loss reserves and

The impact of non- performing loans on the pricing 
of new loans
In the course of the fi  nancial and sovereign 
debt crisis, the stock of non- performing loans 
(NPLs) on the balance sheets of banks in the 
euro area increased sharply. As a result, the 
signifi  cance of NPLs as a potential obstacle to 
lending and to the functioning of monetary 
policy transmission came to the fore.1 With 
this in mind, this box examines the impact of 
NPLs on the pricing of new loans to enter-prises. Of interest here are the effects pro-
duced when explicitly the capital position of 
the surveyed banks is controlled for. Losses arising in connection with non- performing 
loans, which have already been reported by 
banks by means of a corresponding amount 
of loan loss provisions, are therefore fi  ltered 
out of the analysis.
In order to obtain a more accurate picture of 
the importance of the above factors in the 
euro area, the interest rates on new loans to 
enterprises at the level of individual banks as a 
function of various bank- related factors – in-
cluding the stock of non- performing loans 
and the capital position – were modelled in an 
econometric analysis.2 The required data were 
sourced from the Eurosystem’s individual 
MFI Interest Rate (iMIR) database, two private- 
sector data providers – Bankscope (now Orbis 
Bank Focus) and SNL (now S&P Global Market 
Intelligence) – and the Eurosystem’s Central-
ised Securities Database (CSDB). The following equation is estimated:
LRi,t =  αi + δLRi,t–1 + β´NPLj,t–1 
+ γ´xi,j,t,t–1 + εi,t
According to this equation, the average lend-
ing rate on new loans to enterprises LR at 
bank i in year t is explained by its own history 
and by various other variables. The variables in 
the vector NPL  capture the stock of non- 
performing loans of banking group j, to which 
bank i belongs, and the interaction of this 
stock with a short- term market interest rate 
(the one- year overnight index swap (OIS) 
rate). The gross value of NPLs is broken down into the net stock (that part not covered by 
loan loss reserves) and loan loss reserves 
(LLRs).3 Owing to the potential endogeneity 
of the variables, values from the previous year 
are used in each case. The vector x contains 
not only the regulatory capital ratio lagged by 
one year but also further lagged balance 
sheet metrics of banking group j, macroeco-
nomic determinants for the home country of 
bank i (either year fi  xed effects and various 
macroeconomic variables or year- country 
fi  xed effects) and the average interest rate fi  x-
ation period for the new loans to enterprises 
granted by bank i. The vector x also contains 
the market funding costs of banking group j, 
which are not lagged by one year.4,5 When 
interpreting the results, it should be noted 
that effects which the stock of one bank’s 
NPLs could have on another bank’s credit pri-cing policy are not modelled.

ported in the balance sheet which were booked as 
loan loss provisions in earlier periods in the profi  t and 
loss account.

debt securities less the maturity- matched risk- free 
interest rate.
5 The structure of the data permits multiple banks to 
belong to the same banking group j. Therefore, the 
error term ε is clustered at the level of the particular 
banking group when calculating the standard errors of the coeffi   cients.
6 It is thus conceivable, for example, that a bank L 
with a large stock of NPLs will adjust its lending rates upwards. Thanks to its competitor’s measure, bank S, with a small stock, sees greater scope for price- setting and responds by likewise raising its lending rates. The analysis can only identify that particular effect of NPLs 
which is refl  ected in the difference between both 
banks’ lending rates but not the higher level of lending rates overall caused by bank L’s large stock of NPLs.Deutsche Bundesbank

The estimation is performed both with bank 
fi  xed effects and using the system- generalised 
method of moments (GMM) approach, in 
which the lagged endogenous variable and 
the variables specifi  c to the banking group 
(except for the funding costs) are instru-mented by their own further lagged values. 
Macroeconomic factors are controlled for 
using year- country fi  xed effects or year fi  xed 
effects and various macroeconomic variables.7
The results are shown in the above table and 
in the chart on page  41. Whereas the net 
stock of NPLs is accompanied by higher lend-
ing rates in three of the four specifi  cations, 
there tends to be a negative relationship be-
tween the LLRs and lending rates.8 The overall 
impact of an increase in the net stock of NPLs 
and the LLRs –  assuming that the ratio be-
tween these two metrics matches the average 
in the sample used – is not signifi  cantly differ-ent from zero. On the whole, therefore, the results indicate that a high level of non- 
performing loans, specifi  cally in a scenario of 
low LLRs, is associated with higher lending rates. What the results also show, further-
more, is that the interaction terms between 
the short- term market interest rate and the 
net stock of NPLs and the LLRs, with the ex-
7 Although the year- country fi  xed effects specifi  cation 
appears to be more compelling, since it implicitly cap-tures all macroeconomic factors, it entails the use of a 
large number of degrees of freedom, rendering the Hansen statistic, which tests the validity of assump-
tions made with regard to the instruments in the sys-tem GMM approach, unreliable.
8 Note that the net stock of NPLs and the LLRs are 
highly correlated, with a correlation coeffi   cient of 
around 0.8. However, the results are relatively robust 
to a random variation of the sample. Moreover, the 
overall impact is more or less equivalent to the effect 
that results if, instead of the net stock of NPLs and the 
LLRs, only the gross stock (sum of the net stock of 
NPLs and LLRs) is used in the estimation.Estimation of the impact of non-performing loans on lending ratesfor new loansº

ception of one specifi  cation, are insignifi  cant. 
This implies that the impact of monetary pol-
icy measures which pass through to market 
interest rates – defi  ned as the difference be-
tween the lending rate in a situation with a 
measure and the lending rate in a hypothet-
ical situation without a measure – is not con-
strained by NPLs in an analysis at the level of 
individual banks, in which macroeconomic 
factors are seen as given.9
The results of the estimates barely change 
when the funding costs specifi  c to the bank-
ing group are excluded from the estimate. 
This suggests that funding costs are of little 
signifi  cance to the relationship between the 
stock of NPLs and the pricing of new loans. It 
should be borne in mind that macroeconomic 
effects are controlled for in the estimations. As a result, the funding costs variable pre-
dominantly captures the component of fund-
ing costs specifi  c to the banking group and 
not the country- specifi  c component. The po-
tential impact of non- performing loans on lending rates brought about by the country- 
specifi  c share of funding costs (which can be 
observed in macroeconomic variables such as 
the risk premium on government bond yields) 
is not included in the empirical study.
Overall, the results of the estimates indicate that banks make their lending conditions 
more restrictive if they fear that further losses 
may result from the stock of NPLs in future, 
and thus that the relevance of capital restric-
tions might increase later on. Provided a posi-
tive relationship can be identifi  ed between 
non- performing loans and lending rates, then 
this is attributable to the net stock of NPLs. Net NPLs ultimately indicate the extent to 
which further losses may be incurred in the 
future.

centage points (roughly equivalent to the average increase in 
the period from 2009 to 2015 in the sample used) on  the

ance and profitability of banks.25 In this con -
text, developments in net interest income 
– calculated as the difference between interest 
received and interest paid – and in LLPs depend 
especially on the interest rates in an economy. 
For example, lower interest rates reduce bor -
rowers’ interest burden and increase the 
present value of their collateral, which should 
reduce aggregate credit default risk, thereby 
having positive effects on LLPs in banks’ lend -
ing business (and vice versa) .26 At the same 
time, however, the relation postulated in the 
risk- taking channel could also occur, according 
to which low interest rates raise banks’ risk ap -
petite, which ought to have a negative impact 
on their LLPs.27 Furthermore, changes in the 
interest rate level have a one- off effect on the 
value of marked- to- market assets held by 
banks. A decrease in interest rates is typically 
associated with higher market values and 
therefore has a positive impact on profitability.
Net interest income is the most significant 
component of operating income for the major -
ity of banks in the euro area.28 In general, 
banks generate their net interest income from 
three different sources: a mark-  up on lending 
rates calculated using the potential yield for a 
comparable alternative money or capital mar -
ket investment (asset- side margin contribution), 
a discount on deposit rates calculated using a comparable funding alternative via the money 
or capital market (liability- side margin contribu -
tion), and earnings from maturity transform -
ation (structural contribution).29 The latter item 
is the result of the typically longer interest rate 
fixation periods for loans issued and securities 
held by banks compared with those for their 
debt. Owing to the different maturities on the 
asset and liability sides of banks’ balance 
sheets, the structural contribution has a posi -
tive dependency on the slope of the yield curve.… and, hence, 
the profitability of banks

interest income can be broken down into three componentsChannels via which a decrease in longer-term interest rates is transmitted to banks

28 In 2016, net interest income accounted for just over 
60% of euro area banks’ total operating income. For bank -
ing groups which rely mainly on traditional lending busi -
ness, such as Germany’s savings banks and credit coopera -
tives, this ratio is approximately 76%. See European Central 
Bank, Report on financial structures, October 2017; and

Changes in the interest rate level usually affect 
banks’ lending rates as well as their funding 
costs. Since interest rate fixation periods on the 
liability side of banks’ balance sheets are shorter 
than on the asset side, however, this means that 
these kinds of changes are reflected more quickly 
in interest paid than in interest received. When 
rates fall, this relieves pressure on net interest in -
come to begin with, but over time, the “old”, 
higher- interest loans expire and are increasingly 
replaced by lower- yielding loans. The shorter the 
interest rate fixation period is on the asset side, 
the faster the initial positive effect on net interest 
income is likely to wear off. Thus, the impact of 
lower interest rates on banks’ loan portfolio de -
pends on the banks’ maturity transformation 
levels. While banks benefit from higher-  yielding 
loan contracts with long interest rate fixation 
periods when interest rates fall, a rise in the 
interest rate level can put pressure on them.
The overall effect on net interest income of an 
increase in interest rates also depends on the 
different sensitivity of bank lending and deposit 
rates to market interest rates (see the above 
chart). For instance, the empirical literature 
shows that the pass- through of changes in the 
market rate is less complete for deposit rates 
than for lending rates; in other words, there is 
greater friction associated with the pricing of 
deposits.30 Assuming a symmetrical incomplete pass- through – that is to say, irrespective of the 
direction of the change in the interest rate 
level – it follows that the liability- side margin 
contribution will contract with a decrease in 
interest rates.31 One reason for the lagged reac -
tion of deposit rates to a change in market 
interest rates is the long length of time deposits 
are actually held at the bank. Customer deposits 
are usually one of the most stable sources of 
funding for banks, despite depositors’ ability to 
access them quickly and at low cost.32Impact of a

31 J C Driscoll and R A Judson (2013) demonstrate that, for 
the US banking sector, the degree to which deposit rate 
adjustments lag can vary depending on a number of fac -
tors, such as deposit type or bank size, when interest rates 
either rise or fall. See J C Driscoll and R A Judson (2013), 
Sticky deposit rates, Finance and Economics Discussion Ser -
ies 2013-80, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System (US).
32 Drechsler et al (2016) offer another explanation for an 
incomplete interest rate pass- through to deposits. Accord -
ing to the theoretical model outlined in this paper, banks’ 
market power in respect of setting deposit rates diminishes 
when interest rates fall, since the opportunity cost of hold -
ing cash declines and it becomes increasingly more attract -
ive to hold cash than to hold deposits. This is reflected in a 
lower liability- side margin contribution – defined as the dif -
ference between deposit rates and market rates – and im -
plies an incomplete pass- through of the reduction in mar -
ket rates to deposit rates. See I  Drechsler, A  Savov and 
P Schnabl (2016), The deposits channel of monetary policy,

In a low- interest- rate environment, the liability- 
side margin contribution – at least in retail busi -
ness – is under particular pressure, owing to 
the existence of a zero lower bound for deposit 
rates. For example, Busch and Memmel (2017) 
find that, in the case of German banks, the 
low- interest- rate environment of the past few 
years has caused margins for customer de -
posits to drop more steeply than in the pre-  
financial crisis period.33 The results of the Bun -
desbank and the Federal Financial Supervisory 
Authority (BaFin) low- interest- rate survey 
among small and medium- sized German credit 
institutions show that a decreasing liability- side 
margin contribution weighs on profitability in a 
low- interest- rate environment.34 When a zero 
lower bound exists for deposit rates, the 
liability- side margin contribution can even be 
an expense (rather than income), thus causing 
–  in extreme cases  – net interest income to 
erode (see the chart on page 45).35 Banks may 
combat this risk in a low- interest- rate environ -
ment, inter alia , by factoring a mark- up into 
their lending rates, thereby strengthening the 
asset- side margin contribution, if competition 
permits, or generating higher profits from the 
structural contribution.36 In this way, unhedged 
interest rate risks can stabilise profitability in 
the short term. In the current low- interest- rate 
environment, it is clear to see that some cat -
egories of banks have expanded their maturity 
transformation.
In addition, the interest rate level has an impact 
on aggregate demand for credit: when viewed 
in isolation, falling interest rates lead to a gen -
eral rise in demand for credit.37 Thus, banks are 
able to sell a higher volume of loans and raise 
their net interest income –  all other things 
being equal – while the asset- side margin con -
tribution remains constant. Banks could also 
use this higher demand to increase the asset-  
side margin contribution, although this is likely 
to dampen the boost in lending.
A low- interest- rate environment is exceptional 
not only with regard to the effect of interest 
rate decreases as a result of the zero lower bound on deposit rates, but also in terms of 
the impact of rising interest rates on net inter -
est income. It appears that an increase in the 
level of interest rates, particularly coming from 
a low- interest- rate environment, has a positive 
effect on net interest income (see the box on 
pages 47 to 51). The reduction in income from 
maturity transformation resulting from the rise 
in interest rates is likely to have a narrowing 
effect on net interest income only in the short 
to medium term. The negative effect of sub -
dued credit demand and the positive impact of 
an increase in the liability- side margin contribu -
tion on net interest income, however, prevail 
over the longer term. The positive impact of a 
higher liability- side margin contribution is likely 
to be significant, particularly following a period 
of persistently low interest rates. Overall, de -
pending on the extent of banks’ maturity trans -
formation, an increase in interest rates should 
negatively affect net interest income in the 
short to medium term, but positively influence 
it over the longer term.38
The net interest margin is typically at the centre 
of empirical analyses on the influence of the 
interest rate level on the profitability of banks. 
It is calculated as the ratio of net interest in -
come to the volume of average earning assets.Liability- side

Average earning assetst
In empirical studies, average earning assets are 
often approximated by total assets or the lend -
ing and securities portfolios, since information 
is very limited as to the exact volume of non-  
trading- book assets from which banks gener -
ate interest income.39 On account of the sub -
dued demand for credit, average earning assets 
are expected to decline when interest rates 
rise, and vice versa  when rates fall. If the re -
duction in net interest income (the numerator) 
outweighs the decline in average earning assets 
(the denominator), an interest rate hike would 
have a negative impact on the net interest mar -
gin in the short to medium term. However, an 
interest rate rise would have a positive impact 
on the net interest margin if either the average 
earning assets fell less sharply than net interest 
income or if the increase in interest rates were 
to raise net interest income, which would then 
cause the quotient to grow because the nu -
merator and the denominator are moving in 
opposite directions. Where the volumes of 
average earning assets and interest- bearing 
liabilities   are identical, the net interest margin 
would change solely on the basis of price ad -
justments by banks.
In the majority of cases, recent empirical stud -
ies have found a positive relationship between 
the net interest margin and interest rate levels 
as well as the slope of the yield curve.40 On top 
of this, some studies also look into the specific 
case of a low- interest- rate environment.41 They 
reveal that the sensitivity of the net interest 
margin to market rates increases in a low-  
interest- rate environment, which suggests that 
the relationship between banks’ net interest 
margin and the interest rate level in an econ -
omy is non- linear. The consensus of these stud -
ies is that a prolonged period of low interest 
rates, when viewed in isolation, erodes banks’ profitability as measured by their interest busi -
ness.
The impact of the interest rate level on LLPs is 
not clear a priori  (see the chart on page 43).

Empirical studies indicate that the pressure on 
earnings from LLPs is relieved when interest 
rates fall, therefore running in the opposite di -
rection to the factors depressing earnings with 
respect to the net interest margin.42 LLPs are 
linked to banks’ assessment of their credit risk, 
which may involve a certain degree of discre -
tion when determining them. The pressure on 
banks’ profitability following a decrease in the 
net interest margin could give them an incen -
tive to make a more optimistic assessment of 
their credit risk in order to compensate for this 
pressure.43 Overall, the findings of the relevant 
literature suggest that a decrease in the level of 
interest rates has a greater impact on the net 
interest margin than on the return on assets.44 
Some studies were no longer even able to 
identify an effect on the latter.45
Empirical analysis for the 
euro area of the relationship 
between the interest rate 
level and the net interest 
margin
The empirical analysis presented in the box on 
pages 47 to 51 examines the link between euro 
area banks’ net interest margin and short- term 
interest rates as well as the slope of the yield 
curve for the years 2007 to 2016, ie a period 
which was, for the most part, characterised by 
a low- interest- rate environment. The study 
does not break down the net interest margin 
into the previously mentioned components 
(asset- side and liability- side margin contribu -
tions and the structural contribution).
The analysis concludes that the interest rate 
level and the slope of the yield curve have a 
positive impact on the net interest margin of 
banks in the euro area and that the relationship 
is concave. Thus, the positive relationship be -
tween short- term interest rates and the net 
interest margin exists only if the short- term 
interest rate level is low. This finding is consist -
ent with the above- mentioned results in the empirical literature. According to the estima -
tion results, a persistent low- interest- rate envir -
onment, all other things being equal, erodes 
the net interest margin, at least with respect to 
traditional lending and deposit business. This 
can be explained by the fact that an interest 
rate decrease pushes down the net interest 
margin over not only the short term but also 
the longer term, since the remaining stock of 
high- interest loans will increasingly be replaced 
by new loans at lower interest rates as time 
goes on. The longer the low- interest- rate envir -
onment persists, the more likely the zero lower 
bound on deposit interest rates is to weigh on 
the net interest margin. In addition, the analy -
sis shows that the slope of the yield curve be -
comes even more significant for the develop -
ment of the net interest margin, the longer the 
periods of interest rate fixation in the loan port -
folio are.
The strong positive relationship between the 
interest rate level and the net interest margin in 
the low- interest- rate environment implies that 
rate rises have a positive impact on the net 
interest margin of euro area banks, despite the 
countervailing effect produced by subdued de -
mand for credit. In other words, banks are able 
to increase their average net income per asset 
as a result of interest rate rises. Beyond a cer -
tain level of higher interest rates, however, this 
relationship is either no longer significantly dif -
ferent from zero or negative. Thus, interest rate 
rises would have a restrictive effect on banks’ 
profitability when the interest rate level is Lower interest 
rate level tends to have positive effect on LLPs

Empirical study on the impact of the interest rate level 
and the slope of the yield curve on euro area banks’ net interest margin
The individual Balance Sheet Items (iBSI) mi-
crodatabase (the source of the individual 
balance sheet items) and the individual MFI  Interest Rate (iMIR) microdatabase 
(based on which the net interest margin of outstanding business is calculated) are used 
to examine the impact of the interest rate 
level and the slope of the yield curve on 
euro area banks’ net interest margin.1 Since 
the iBSI and iMIR data are reported monthly, 
it is possible to calculate the net interest margin on a monthly basis rather than 
quarterly or annually. In comparison to the 
net interest margin from the profi  t and loss 
account, this admittedly comprises only 
traditional banking business; however, ana-
lysing the impact of the interest rate –  a 
high- frequency variable – on the net inter-
est margin at a more frequent interval is ad-
vantageous from an empirical perspective. 
As the analysis does not have to rely on 
data published in the annual fi  nancial state-ments of large banking groups, the sample also includes many smaller banks for which 
net interest income is typically by far the 
most relevant income component. Restrict-
ing this analysis to the traditional banking 
business is also not so critical because this is 
the focus of the theoretical literature and 
the discussions on the potential burden of 
the low- interest-rate environment (includ-
ing loss of the liability- side margin contribu-
tion, for instance). However, there are no monthly data available that would enable total profi  tability to be analysed empiric-
ally.2
The benchmark model takes the following 
form:
yi,t=2X
n=1βnYi,t–n+λX i,t1+!Yj,t+γ1σt
+γ2rt+γ3r2
t+γ4✓j,t+γ5✓2
j,t+#1,where yit represents the net interest margin 
for bank i in month t. The use of quadratic 
terms makes it possible to include certain 
types of non- linearities.3
Country- specifi  c variables are indexed with 
j. Alongside the interest rate variables –  rt 
represents the three- month overnight index swap (OIS) rate and 
θj,t the country- specifi  c 
slope of the yield curve4  – the dynamic 
model is based on the fi  rst two lags of the net interest margin 
yi,t–1 and yi,t–2, on a vec-
tor Xi,t–1 of bank- specifi  c variables (capital 
ratio, loan loss provisions5 over average 
total assets, government bonds over total 
assets, customer deposits over liabilities and 
log total assets (excluding capital))6, on a 
vector Yj,t of country- specifi  c macroeco-
nomic variables (Herfi  ndahl concentration 
index, GDP growth rate, stock index growth

2 Other studies use lower- frequency data to analyse 
total profi  tability; see, inter alia, C Altavilla, M Bouci-
nha and J L Peydró (2017), Monetary policy and bank 
profi  tability in a low interest environment, ECB Work-
ing Paper Series No 2105.3 See C Borio, L Gambacorta and B Hofmann (2015), The infl  uence of monetary policy on bank profi  tability, BIS Working Paper No 514.4 The difference between the ten- year country- specifi  c 
sovereign bond yield and the three- month OIS rate 
represents the slope of the yield curve. The source of 
data on the ten- year sovereign bond yield is the ECB  Statistical Data Warehouse; that of the three- 
month OIS rate is Thomson Reuters Datastream.5 Loan loss provisions is a fl  ow variable which, if posi-
tively signed, represents earnings (eg release of loan 
loss provisions) and, if negatively signed, represents an expense (eg formation of loan loss provisions).
6 Earnings and capital metrics (capital ratio, loan loss 
provisions over average total assets) are based on an-
nual data (interpolated from monthly data) and are 
sourced from the S&P Global Market Intelligence (for-
merly SNL Financial) and Orbis Bank Focus (formerly Bankscope) databases. These data are linked to the

rate)7 and of the volatility of the short- term 
interest rate σt.8 ϑi is the term for bank fi  xed 
effects which corrects for individual, time- 
constant and unobserved factors. The re-gressions were estimated using OLS (Within- 
estimator) and cluster- robust standard 
errors at bank level.9,10 Owing to potential 
endogeneity between the dependent vari-
ables and the other bank- specifi  c variables, the latter are fed into the estimation with a lagged term. In the case of the interpolated annual data, the fi  rst lagged observation is 
the preceding year. The estimation period 
runs from August 2007 to December 2016. 
Government authorities’ responses to the fi  nancial and sovereign debt crisis, which 
occurred during this period, included enor-
mous government rescue packages for 
banking sectors. By that token, the relation-
ship between the capital ratio and the net 
interest margin in the empirical study is likely to be biased if there is no check for government recapitalisation measures.
11 
The banks concerned are thus included in 
the regressions only after successful recapit-alisation.
12 In addition, the dataset was ad-
justed to remove Greek, Cypriot and Esto-
nian banks since either no data were avail-able on long- term government bond yields 
or they took on extreme values over a 
lengthy period owing to the sovereign debt crisis. On the whole, the banking sample of

8 The volatility of the short- term interest rate is the 
12-month moving standard deviation of the three- 
month OIS rate.
9 To analyse for robustness, the estimation was also 
performed using two- way clustering (at bank level and, at the same time, using an interaction term 
(country * month)). The results remained virtually un-
changed.
10 The Nickell bias could theoretically bias standard 
errors. However, for panel estimations with a large 
time dimension – where the average T of the model is 69 – this bias tends to be negligible. See, for example, J Breitung, The analysis of macroeconomic panel data, 
in B H Baltagi (2015), The Oxford Handbook of Panel 
Data, Oxford University Press, pp 453-492.11 For more information on the effects of government

the estimation covers around 50% of the 
stock of loans granted to the private non- 
fi  nancial sector in the euro area.
In line with the results of the empirical lit-
erature, the results of the benchmark model 
show that the level of the short- term inter-
est rate and the slope of the yield curve 
have a positive impact on euro area banks’ 
net interest margin (see the table on 
page 48). The coeffi   cients of the quadratic 
terms are also signifi  cantly different from zero. They are negatively signed meaning that the relationship between the interest 
rate level and the net interest margin is con-
cave. The adjacent charts give a graphic 
representation of this development13 using 
the fi  rst derivatives of the short- term inter-
est rate and the slope. The relationship be-
tween the short- term interest rate and the 
net interest margin is positive only for lower values of the short- term interest rate. Borio et al (2015) ascertain similar fi  ndings in their analysis of globally active banking groups.
14 
What is striking is the dependent variables’ 
high degree of persistence, indicating that 
monthly new business only has a minor im-pact on the net interest margin. Moreover, during the fi  nancial and sovereign debt cri-
sis, euro area banks took a rather cautious 
approach to new lending, which – all other 
things being equal  – is likely to have in-creased the estimated persistence of the net interest margin compared to a non- 
crisis period.15
The negative relationship in the short run, 
which Busch and Memmel (2017) show em-
pirically and Alessandri and Nelson (2015) 
show theoretically, suggests that there are 
temporal frictions in the pricing of loans due to the longer interest rate fi  xation 
periods, and these, in turn, suggest that the 
dynamics of the model are more complex 13 Concavity exists when the fi  rst derivative falls 
monotonically and the second derivative is negative. 
Both charts therefore implicitly show a concave rela-
tionship.14 See C Borio et al (2015), op cit.
15 Persistence in empirical literature that uses quarterly 
and annual data is lower, but still the coeffi   cient often 
lies between 0.8 and 0.9. For more information on 
credit growth in the euro area during the crisis period,

To check the validity of the dynamics of the 
empirical model, the lagged interest rate 
variable is thus included in the regression by 
means of a robustness analysis. Further-
more, consideration is also given to the het-
erogeneity of the European banking sector,

Van den Heuvel (2007), who models the reac -
tions of banks on the basis of interest rate 
levels of 5% and 6%.
Conclusion
Bank profitability and capital have, for a num -
ber of reasons, been receiving greater attention 
of late, including from monetary policymakers. 
One reason for this is that banks play a central 
role in the transmission of monetary policy 
measures, and the stability and functioning of 
the banking system are therefore of key im -
portance for monetary policy’s effectiveness. 
Another is that recent research with differenti -
ated modelling of bank- side transmission chan -
nels has revealed the existence of a two- way 
relationship between monetary policy and bank 
profitability and capital. By influencing the 
interest rate level and slope of the yield curve 
using their standard and non- standard meas -ures, central banks have an impact on the de -
velopment of bank profitability and capital. 
However, the balance sheet situation of banks 
(including their stock of NPLs and their capital 
endowment) as well as the prevailing interest 
rate level are decisive for the effectiveness of 
monetary policy.
In light of the increased capital requirements of 
banks since the crisis and the persistent low-  
interest-  rate environment, the finding pre -
sented in this article of a non- linear relationship 
between interest rates and banks’ net interest 
margin is of particular interest. According to 
the empirical studies discussed, a strong posi -
tive relationship exists between the two vari -
ables when interest rates are at a low level, ie 
the net interest margin becomes even lower, 
the lower the interest rate level is. The net 
interest margin is closely tied to net interest in -
come, which is generally the most significant 
component of operating income and is a key 
driver of a bank’s overall profitability. In add -Impact of 
monetary  policy decisively dependent on banks’ balance sheet situationIn the low- interest- rate environment, decrease in interest rate level can  negatively affect 
bank profitabilitycountries where long interest rate fi  xation 
periods are highly dominant in banks’ stock 
of loans (Belgium, Germany, France and the Netherlands).
17
The signifi  cance of the coeffi   cients of the lagged short- term interest rate and the 
lagged endogenous variable shows that the 
dynamics of the short- term interest rate 
provide additional explanatory content (see the table on page 50).
18 Overall, in terms of 
quality, the results are robust; the quantita-
tive importance of the short- term interest 
rate and the slope of the yield curve for the net interest margin varies, however. For the 
countries affected by the crisis, where the 
banking system is characterised by variable interest rates and short interest rate fi  xation periods for the stock of loans, the impact of the short- term interest rate on the net inter-est margin, including the quadratic term, is 
–  as expected  – rather pronounced com-pared to the other specifi  cations; con-versely, the country- specifi  c slope of the yield curve has virtually no impact on the 
net interest margin.19 The structurally high 
share of long interest rate fi  xation periods 
in Belgium, Germany, France and the Neth-erlands is also refl  ected in the high import-
ance of the slope of the yield curve. The relationship between the short- term inter-est rate and the margin of the banks in 
these countries, on the other hand, is much 
weaker and linear; the coeffi   cient of the 
quadratic term is insignifi  cant.
17 Data on the interest rate fi  xation periods for out-
standing business are not available at individual bank 
level in the iBSI microdatabase.
18 Since the correlation between the contemporan-
eous short- term interest rate and its fi  rst lag is ap-
proaching one, caution should be exercised when in-
terpreting the level of the estimated coeffi   cient owing 
to multicollinearity.19 In these countries (Spain, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and 
Slovenia), loans with short interest rate fi  xation periods 
and a variable interest rate make up around 80% of 
the stock of loans.Deutsche Bundesbank

ition, the latter is dependent on further com -
ponents, such as LLPs or effects on the valu -
ation of marked- to- market assets. While profit -
ability is only impacted once by the effects on 
market prices induced by changes in the inter -
est rate level, the effects on LLPs may also per -
sist over the longer term. However, it is unclear 
whether these are sufficient to compensate for 
the narrowing of the net interest margin when 
the interest rate level is reduced in an environ -
ment of already low interest rates.
Hence, in a low- interest- rate environment, a 
situation may arise where expansionary monet -
ary policy measures could, at least in the longer 
term, weigh on profitability, whereas restrictive 
measures would support profitability, impact -
ing accordingly on banks’ ability to build up 
capital and thus, in principle, also on lending. 
Ultimately, this means that, in the long term, 
the effect of a monetary policy measure trans -
mitted through the bank capital channel would 
end up weakening the effect that was actually 
intended. This scenario is not consistent with 
previous analyses of this channel in the litera -
ture, which had considered the bank capital 
channel to be an amplifier of monetary policy. 
It should be emphasised, however, that these 
past studies did not factor the historically un -
usual environment of persistently low interest 
rates into their assumptions and they therefore postulated a contrasting relationship between 
monetary policy measures and the profitability 
of banks. On account of the demonstrated 
non- linear relationship, the empirical results of 
the analyses presented here show that when 
the general interest rate level is high, increases 
in central banks’ official interest rates also have 
a restrictive effect. This is consistent with the 
findings of previous literature on the bank cap -
ital channel.
The bank capital channel is likely to be particu -
larly effective when banks’ capital endowment 
is low – ie when they are operating at levels of 
capital close to those specified by regulatory re -
quirements – and in addition, when access to 
capital in the market is constrained. It is pre -
cisely because the intended effects of monet -
ary policy measures could be weakened by the 
bank capital channel in a low- interest- rate en -
vironment that good capital endowment 
–  which is sufficiently above the regulatory 
minimum and which helps to ensure financial 
stability – is crucial from a monetary policy per -
spective. The worse the capital position of 
banks is, particularly in a low- interest- rate en -
vironment, the stronger any adverse reactions 
of the banks to monetary policy measures are 
likely to be, and the harder it will become for 
monetary policymakers to achieve their object -
ive of maintaining price stability.Bank capital 
channel can thus weaken monetary policy transmission in low- interest- rate environmentGood capital endowment in banking system crucial for monetary  policyDeutsche Bundesbank

Developments in corporate financing 
in the euro area since the financial and 
economic  crisis
In the wake of the financial crisis, the financing structure of non- financial corporations in the euro 
area as a whole and in the four large member countries (Germany, France, Italy and Spain) in 
particular, has changed significantly. Three main developments have been observed. First, in all 
of the countries considered in this article, a shift has occurred from funds raised externally (exter -
nal financing) to financing with internally generated financial surpluses (internal financing). 
Against the backdrop of somewhat subdued investment overall, this development has been 
driven by relatively weak inflows through external financing and by, in some cases, a marked 
expansion of internal financing, which has largely been attributable to the fall in interest pay -
ments. Second, external financing has experienced a move away from borrowed capital towards 
equity capital, notably in Spain and Italy. In these countries, this shift can be seen as a reaction 
to the debt overhangs accumulated in the run- up to the financial and economic crisis and the 
European debt crisis. In doing so, enterprises addressed the rise in the risk of insolvency resulting 
from deteriorating sales opportunities and asset positions. Third, financing through bank loans, 
not least in Italy and Spain, has been substituted by other forms of debt such as loans from non- 
banks and debt securities. This development has mainly been caused by temporary supply con -
straints at banks.
The shift towards a higher share of internal and equity financing combined with a more diversi -
fied debt financing structure is likely to help make the financing of non- financial corporations as 
a whole less vulnerable to temporary financial constraints at individual sources of financing, par -
ticularly banks. The envisaged creation of a European capital market union could further advance 
this process. For monetary policy, it is important with regard to the transmission of monetary 
policy impulses through the various transmission channels to continuously monitor and analyse 
changes in financing behaviour and the associated financing structure of non- financial corpor -
ations.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Financing conditions for non-  financial corpor -
ations have a significant impact on their invest-
ment behaviour, which is of great importance 
for both the short-  term and the long-  term de -
velopment of the economy. Business invest -
ment, which is much more volatile than other 
components of gross domestic product (GDP), 
has a major impact on the business cycle. 
Moreover, through the development of the 
capital stock, it also plays a part in shaping the 
growth potential of the economy.
Financing conditions, for their part, are af -
fected by factors such as monetary policy. A 
change in the monetary policy stance impacts 
on the overall financing environment and thus 
also on enterprises’ financing costs. Changes in 
financing costs, in turn, have an impact on the 
profitability of investments and thus on de -
mand for financing. At the same time, con -
straints at capital providers can affect the sup-
ply of financing for non-  financial corpor ations, 
thereby impairing their investment activity. The interplay of these factors is ultimately reflected 
in the financing structure of enterprises.
In the context of the financial and economic 
crisis, the financing structure of euro area non-  
financial corporations has in some cases shifted 
significantly. Against the backdrop of rather weak investment activity overall, three main 
trends have emerged despite a certain degree 
of country-  specific heterogeneity.
– First, there has been a shift away from funds 
raised externally (external financing) to the 
use of surpluses generated through enter -
prises’ operations (internal financing).
– Second, external financing has tended to ex-
perience a shift from borrowed capital to 
equity capital.
– Third, bank loans have lost some of their im-
portance as a debt financing instrument compared with other forms of debt such as 
loans from non-  banks and debt securities.
These three developments are described in de -
tail and placed in context below. As the euro 
area aggregate in some cases masks different 
national changes, developments at the country 
level are also examined. Remarks are confined 
to the four large member countries of the euro 
area, ie Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Be -
cause of their economic importance, these four 
countries account for the majority of changes 
at the euro area level and at the same time re -
veal country-  specific differ ences. The primary 
data source for the following remarks are the 
results of the financial accounts. The period under review is divided into two periods: the acute phase of the financial and economic 
crisis  t ogether with the subsequent recovery 
(2008 Q1 to 2011 Q2) and the subsequent 
period from the third quarter of 2011 up to the current end (2017 Q2). This breakdown is based 
on the business cycle in the euro area and 
comprises a complete upturn and downturn in 
each case.1 Finally, possible macroeconomic 
and economic policy implications of a change 
in financing structure are discussed.
Theory of corporate 
 financing

to explaining the financing behaviour of non-  
financial corporations: the pecking order theory Financing

and the trade- off theory.2 The former posits 
that non- financial corporations gear their fi -
nancing along a hierarchy. Thus, they make 
use, first, of their internally generated payment 
surpluses (internal financing) and then use ex -
ternal funds in the form of borrowed capital 
only if the internal funds are insufficient to real -
ise the targeted volume of non- financial asset 
formation.3 Only as a last resort, according to 
this theory, do enterprises finance themselves 
through equity. The financing hierarchy is justi -
fied by the higher cost of the types of financing 
along the hierarchy; these, in turn, are mainly 
attributed to information and incentive prob -
lems between capital providers and the man -
agement of enterprises.4 Amongst other things, 
this approach implies that when it comes to 
external financing, non- financial corporations 
chiefly make use of debt financing instruments.
Conversely, enterprises which largely finance 
themselves through borrowed capital show 
only a low level of equity. This gives rise to the 
danger that even small losses may erode the 
enterprise’s capital buffer, potentially resulting 
in its insolvency. This aspect is addressed by the 
trade- off theory, which states that enterprises 
build up a capital buffer to avoid the costs of a 
possible insolvency and, at the same time, to 
give them flexibility in increasing their leverage 
for future investment decisions.5 This approach 
involves a conflict of objectives in that bor -
rowed capital is preferable to equity because 
interest costs are tax- deductible. These two 
factors are weighed up to produce the optimal 
equity ratio. In this context, the (perceived) risk 
of insolvency very much depends on macro -
economic conditions, meaning that the opti -
mal equity ratio may vary over time.
Shifts within and between the two categories 
of borrowed capital and equity may be attrib -
utable, inter alia,  to structural and institutional 
factors such as, for instance, the size, age or 
business sector of an enterprise.6 For example, 
it is easier for established large enterprises to 
place shares and debt securities on the capital 
markets, whereas young, small enterprises tend to be more dependent on bank loans or other 
equity, such as business shares and participat -
ing interests.
In addition to these demand- side factors, 
supply- side conditions can generally also affect 
the choice between various debt instruments 
through changes in the relative financing costs. 
In this context, the interest payable by non-  
financial corporations depends on the finan -
cing costs and the risk premiums demanded by 
lenders. These, for their part, are closely linked 
to the balance sheet constraints and the risk 
appetite of investors.7 Changes in these factors 
or adjustments to the regulatory framework, 
which affect the various capital providers in dif -
ferent ways, can have a crucial impact on their 
refinancing conditions and on the pricing of 
the funds they provide to non- financial corpor -
ations. This subsequently influences the relative 
attractiveness of the various financing instru -
ments, which may ultimately lead to a change Equity as a 
capital  buffer to 
avoid insolvency

3 Both theories are therefore limited to the need for exter -
nal financing in order to form non- financial assets. Further -
more, however, external financing can, in principle, also be 
raised to build up financial assets, for example in the form 
of equity investments.

in demand. Moreover, financial and regulatory 
restrictions at capital providers may completely 
deny non- financial corporations access to cer -
tain financing instruments, forcing them 
–  where they can  – to substitute them with 
other forms of financing.

 financing
Total financing
The chart on page 56 provides an overview of 
total financing, broken down by internal and 
external financing, of non- financial corpor -
ations. It shows flow figures which, in the case 
of external financing, correspond to transaction- 
related changes in outstanding liabilities. In -
ternal financing derives from the economic ac -
tivity of the business sector and corresponds to 
the sum of retained earnings and the equiva -
lent of the depreciation of the capital stock.8 In 
the case of external financing, external capital 
providers make funds available to enterprises in 
the form of both borrowed capital and equity 
capital. Borrowed capital can be further subdiv -
ided into debt instruments – bank loans, loans 
from non- banks, trade credits and advances, 
insurance technical reserves and debt secur -
ities – as well as other borrowed capital. With regard to equity capital, a distinction can be 
made between listed shares, unlisted shares 
and other equity such as business shares and 
participating interests. Listed shares and debt 
securities are often also subsumed under the 
term “market financing”.
The internal financing of euro area non-  
financial corporations has grown steadily since 
the end of the 1990s and accounted for 67% 
of total financing  at mid-2017 (see the chart on 
page 57).9 The main contribution came from 
the steady growth in depreciation, which ac -
counted for an average of over 85% of total 
internal financing over the entire period under 
review.10 On the other hand, internal financing 
fluctuated considerably in the wake of the re -
cessions of 2008-09 and 2011-13 due to swings 
in retained earnings. Growth of internal finan -
cing gathered momentum slightly from 2008 
as a result, in particular, of an accelerated ex -
pansion of retained earnings. This pushed the 
share of internal financing accounted for by Accelerated 
growth in internal finan-cing since 2008

depreciation down to well below 80% at the 
current end.
At the country level, internal financing was 
stepped up in all four of the countries under 
review compared to the pre-  crisis years, 
whereby the increases were especially pro -
nounced in Germany and, even more so, in 
Spain. From the end of 2009, internal financing 
fully covered gross investment in both coun -
tries, which – according to the pecking order 
theory – in principle limits the need for external 
financing. This surplus of internal funds through 
investment expenditure implies that, contrary 
to what is commonly assumed in macroeco -
nomic theory, the non- financial corporate sec -
tor provided the other sectors of the economy, 
including sectors abroad, with financing in net 
terms.
By contrast, gross investment in France and 
Italy exceeded internal financing on average 
over the entire period under review, implying a 
fundamental need for external financing for 
fixed asset formation. Whereas in France this 
was primarily due to strong investment activity 
by historical and international standards, in 
Italy it was mainly down to the comparative 
weakness of internal financing. That said, non- 
financial corporations in Italy steadily increased 
their internal financing from mid-2012, cover -
ing gross investment in its entirety from mid-
2016.
The external financing of euro area non-  
financial corporations has experienced signifi -
cantly stronger cyclical fluctuations than in -
ternal financing; at the current end it stood at 
around 12% of gross value added, which was 
well below the levels recorded during previous 
upturns. Moreover, compared to the years be -
fore the global financial and economic crisis, 
the momentum has been considerably weaker 
as a whole since 2008. The decline was seen to 
be especially pronounced in Spain and, to a 
lesser extent, in Italy. The debt overhangs accu -
mulated in both countries in the run- up to the 
financial and economic crisis, and the European debt crisis probably played a significant role in 
this.11 As a result, the financing structure ex -
perienced a shift from external to internal fi -
nancing. Moreover, within external financing as 
a whole there were, in some cases, opposing 
developments and marked shifts (for details, 
see the remarks on pages 60 to 71).
Components of internal 
 financing
In order to identify the factors that contributed 
to the rise in growth of internal financing, it is 
broken down into its contributions to growth. 
The key components of internal financing in 
the national accounts (NA) are gross value 
added and the compensation of employees.

between interest payments and interest in -
come), other net property-  related expenditure 
(difference between distributions to sharehold -
ers and revenue from participating interests) as 
well as a number of other factors such as taxes, 
transfers and social security contributions can 
affect the scope for internal financing.12 The 
above chart shows the average change in in -
ternal financing in the two periods defined 
above, together with the individual compon -
ents’ contributions to growth.
For the euro area as a whole and for Germany 
and France in particular, gross value added pro -
vided the most significant positive contribution, 
whereas the compensation of employees made 
clearly negative contributions to the develop -
ment of internal financing. Unlike in the other 
countries considered here, the compensation 
of employees paid by non- financial corpor -
ations in Spain declined significantly given the 
tense labour market situation despite the in -
crease in gross value added, and thus had a positive impact on internal financing. In Italy, 
by contrast, the compensation of employees 
continued to rise between 2008 and 2011 and, 
viewed in isolation, reduced internal financing, 
while gross value added stagnated and conse -
quently did not constitute a positive contribu -
tion to growth.
Especially in the period following the onset of 
the financial and economic crisis, the internal 
financing of euro area non- financial corpor -
ations grew, above all in Italy and Spain, as a 
result of the accommodative monetary policy 
measures not least due to a reduction in net 
interest payments. However, this effect was 
only very small in Germany due both to the 
great importance that borrowers attached to 
fixed- rate loans and to the low debt levels. 
Lower net property- related expenditure like -
wise contributed to the rise in non- financial 
corporations’ internal financing in Germany 
and, above all, in Italy between 2008 and 2011. 
In Italy, this effect was mainly due to a reduc -
tion in profit distributions. In addition, a de -
crease in taxes paid led to a significant increase 
in internal financing in Italy and Spain.
Combined, internal financing in the euro area 
as a whole and at the country level in Germany, 
France and Spain has therefore gone up since 
the financial and economic crisis as a result, 
mainly, of an increase in value added compared 
with the compensation of employees.13 By con -
trast, the marked rise in internal financing at 
non- financial corporations in Italy is primarily 
driven by financial factors, first and foremost 
the low interest rates. This means that their po -
tential for internal financing could decline again 
in an environment of rising interest rates.Gross value

12 A distinction has to be made between the determinants 
according to the NA and the economic determining factors

Development of external 
 financing
The external financing of non- financial corpor -
ations in the euro area weakened considerably 
following the onset of the financial and eco -
nomic crisis (see the above chart). While the 
inflows between 1999 and 2008 still averaged 
around 22% of gross value added and were 
driven, above all, by dynamic (albeit unsustain -
able) bank loan growth, they dropped by 
roughly half following the onset of the financial 
and economic crisis. According to the pecking 
order theory, this development should have 
been due to the lower demand for external fi -
nancing as a result of subdued investment and 
higher availability of internal financing. How -
ever, restricted access to bank loans is also 
likely to have played a temporary role and, 
taken in isolation, may in turn have contributed 
to the weak investment dynamics (for further 
details, see the remarks on pages 60 to 71).Against the background of very high inflows in 
the pre- crisis years, the decline in external 
financing  is very pronounced, notably in the 
case of non- financial corporations in Spain. The 
reduction in external funds raised may be inter -
preted as a consequence of weaker invest -
ment, the marked rise in internal financing op -
portunities and an active deleveraging process. 
In the case of non- financial corporations in 
France, by contrast, inflows remained com -
paratively strong. According to the pecking 
order theory, this can be explained by the de -
velopment of internal financing, which was 
weak compared with the strong investment by 
historical and international standards. In Italy, 
external financing decreased markedly from 
2008 and in the wake of the European sover -
eign debt crisis even experienced significant 
outflows. Whereas low investment activity by 
historical and international standards, when 
viewed in isolation, dampened the need for ex -
ternal financing, the fact that internal financing 
was also weak led to positive net demand for Fall in external

external financing. With the exception of the 
second half of 2009, non- financial corporations 
in Germany recorded a consistently positive de -
velopment in external financing, albeit some -
what weaker than before the crisis. The re -
duced recourse to external financing is attribut -
able to the increase in internal financing paired 
with moderate investment growth which, 
taken in isolation, lowered the need for exter -
nal financing.
Shift from financing with 
 borrowed capital to equity 
 financing
From the onset of the financial and economic 
crisis, the structure of external financing in euro 
area non- financial corporations shifted from 
borrowed capital to equity. This contrasts, in 
part, with the shifts seen in other highly de -
veloped currency areas (for details, see the box 
on pages  61 to 63). This change was driven 
mainly by developments in Italy and Spain; in 
both countries it can be interpreted as a reac -
tion to the debt overhangs accumulated prior 
to the crisis.14 While this adjustment process 
got underway in Spain following the onset of 
the financial and economic crisis, in the case of 
non- financial corporations in Italy it only began 
in the wake of the European sovereign debt cri -
sis and was significantly less pronounced.15 The 
take- up of equity capital took place, in particu -
lar, in the form of unlisted shares as well as of 
business shares and participating interests. Ac -
cording to the trade- off theory, enterprises 
reacted to an increase in the risk of insolvency 
resulting from deteriorating sales opportunities 
and asset positions in the wake of the crises.
In Germany, by contrast, the structure of exter -
nal financing has shifted slightly in favour of 
borrowed capital since 2008. The increased 
use of borrowed capital can be interpreted, on 
the one hand, as a response to the improved 
solvency of non- financial corporations in Ger -
many in light of the favourable economic de -
velopments which, generally speaking, allow for higher leverage. On the other hand, the low 
financing costs for borrowed capital are also 
likely to have played a part. With regard to 
non- financial corporations in France, inflows of 
equity and borrowed capital roughly balanced 
each other out, as they had done pre- crisis. The 
financing structure was therefore unchanged.
Substitution by debt 
 instruments
Debt financing experienced, at times, counter -
vailing developments. In 2009 and between 
2012 and 2015, there were net outflows of 
bank loans at the euro area level, contrasting 
with simultaneous inflows of funds through 
other debt instruments. At the country level, 
this constellation was particularly pronounced 
in Italy and Spain. Non- financial corporations in 
Italy mainly raised funds through debt secur -
ities and loans from other financial institutions. 
In addition to the latter, Spain also made large- 
scale use of loans from foreign capital pro -
viders. Considered together with the findings 
of the empirical literature, this suggests that, in 
both time periods, supply- side restrictions 
probably made it harder for non- financial cor -
porations in Italy and Spain to access bank Shift from

The fi  nancial and economic crisis was of 
global proportions and had an impact not 
only on the fi  nancing structure of non- 
fi  nancial corporations in the euro area, but 
also on other major currency areas. Just as 
the fi  nancing structures had already dif-fered prior to the crisis, the nature of the 
shifts brought about as a result of the crisis also varied to some extent.
The chart on page 62 shows the develop-
ment of selected external fi  nancing instru-
ments for non- fi  nancial corporations in the euro area, the United Kingdom, the United 
States and Japan. Whilst equity fi  nancing 
has, when viewed in isolation, decreased in 
all the currency areas under consideration 
since the fi  nancial crisis, the change in the 
importance of equity in the different cur-rency areas in relation to the likewise de-clining trend in overall external fi  nancing 
varies. On the one hand, equity has consist-
ently served as a relevant fi  nancing instru-
ment in the United Kingdom and the euro 
area and also, to a lesser extent, in Japan 
and has gained in importance since 2008 as an external fi  nancing instrument, especially in the euro area, not least as a result of the 
need for deleveraging which became ap-
parent during the crisis.1 On the other hand, 
no additional equity was raised in the 
United States. On the contrary, the transac-tions related to equity resulted, on average, in a decline both before and after the crisis. One of the main reasons for this is likely to 
have been share buy- backs, which have 
played a major role in the United States in 
recent years, partly fi  nanced by borrowed 
capital.2 Overall, the United States – unlike 
the other currency areas – has seen a shift 
from equity capital to fi  nancing by means 
of borrowed capital since the year 2000.The heterogeneous nature of developments 
in the various currency areas is also re-
fl  ected in fi  nancing through borrowed cap-
ital, which alongside bank loans comprises 
other borrowed capital, including loans 
from other lenders and debt securities, but 
also other accounts payable that are diffi   -
cult to interpret from an economic perspec-tive. While net infl  ows in the form of other 
borrowed capital in the euro area have 
dwindled since the fi  nancial and economic 
crisis and have even reverted to outfl  ows in Japan, other borrowed capital in the United 
Kingdom and the United States has largely 
remained stable. In the United Kingdom, 
this was due, among other things, to loans from non- banks such as other non- fi  nancial 
corporations, and in the United States to 
debt securities. In the case of the latter, in 
particular, other accounts payable through-out the entire period under review also con-
tributed signifi  cantly to the fact that other 
borrowed capital played an exceptionally 
important role compared with other coun-
tries.
A somewhat more homogenous picture 
emerges with regard to fi  nancing via bank 
loans, which has been signifi  cantly lower in 
all countries since 2008 than in the pre- 
crisis period. At the same time, the infl  ows between 2008 and 2017 remained positive

on average across the board, with the ex-
ception of the United Kingdom. This gen-
eral observation does, however, conceal the 
large- scale slumps in fi  nancing via bank 
loans that occurred around the year 2009 in all the currency areas under consider-ation. This was partly due to temporary 
bank loan supply restrictions in the context 
of the fi  nancial and economic crisis.3 
Against this backdrop, equity fi  nancing in 
the United Kingdom and the euro area has 
gained slightly in importance since the 
fi  nancial  crisis, which – consistent with the 
trade- off theory  – is likely to have been prompted by the increased risk of insolv-ency following the crisis. That said, how-
ever, this stood in contrast to developments 
in the United States. While fi  nancing via 
bank loans to non- fi  nancial corporations in the United Kingdom and the euro area was 
still lagging behind the pre- crisis trend at 
the current end, the recovery in bank lend-
ing following the crisis was comparatively quick and strong in Japan and the United States. In this setting, the sustained great 
importance of total debt fi  nancing, espe-
cially in the United States, has generated a 
gradual increase in the debt ratio since 
2012.4
As a subtype of external fi  nancing, non- 
fi  nancial corporations also have recourse to 
funding via fi  nancial instruments traded on the capital market, such as listed shares and 
debt securities. With regard to market- based fi  nancing, the United Kingdom and 
the euro area differed fundamentally from 
Japan and the United States. In the United 
Kingdom and the euro area, infl  ows via 
market- based funding in the years leading 
up to the fi  nancial crisis, and in particular at the start of the millennium, were compara-
tively strong, but later fl  attened out some-
what between 2008 and 2017. Measured in 
terms of overall external fi  nancing, how-
ever, infl  ows rose in both regions and con-
tinued to account for a signifi  cant share, 
especially in the United Kingdom.5 In Japan 
and the United States, on the other hand, 
market- based liabilities were scaled back on 
balance over much of the period under consideration, which in the case of the United States, in particular, was mainly caused by share buy- backs, compounded

loans, and that these were substituted by other 
debt instruments.16
In line with this, the Eurosystem’s quarterly 
Bank Lending Survey (BLS) shows that credit 
standards for loans to enterprises were tight -
ened in 2009 as well as in 2011-12. The major -
ity of enterprises participating in the European 
Central Bank (ECB) Survey on the access to fi -
nance of enterprises (SAFE) also reported a de -
terioration in their access to bank loans during 
this period.
This situation generally prevailed in all of the 
four major euro area economies.17 In 2012, 
however, bank supply constraints were espe -
cially marked in Italy and Spain. Unlike French 
and German banks, Italian and Spanish credit 
institutions were experiencing particular strains 
owing to the debt crisis. For example, since the 
onset of the financial crisis – and particularly 
when the European debt crisis was raging  – 
banks’ financing costs had been rising mark -edly due to the interconnectedness of the gov -
ernment and banking sectors in both Italy and 
Spain.18 Added to this were the large amounts

offerings since the turn of the millennium.6 
Since the fi  nancial crisis, however, outfl  ows 
have decreased on average in both Japan and the United States (in the case of the latter, this arose, in particular, from an in-
crease in the issuance of debt securities).7
Although the evolution of external fi  nan-
cing in the non- fi  nancial corporate sector in the euro area is in some ways similar to the 
situation in other currency areas, an inter-
national comparison reveals a clear hetero-geneous pattern on the whole. While equity 
funding in the United Kingdom and the euro area was consistently positive, the United States has seen a shift from equity capital to borrowed capital since the year 
2000, which has not reversed in the wake 
of the fi  nancial and economic crisis. Enter-
prises in the United Kingdom and the euro 
area also responded to temporary restric-
tions on access to bank loans in the context of the fi  nancial and economic crisis by, inter 
alia, building up equity, whereas in Japan 
and the United States bank loans played a 
more important role and recovered more 
quickly and strongly in the aftermath of the crisis. Parallel to this, in contrast to the situ-
ation in the United Kingdom and the euro 
area, non- fi  nancial corporations in Japan and the United States did not record any positive infl  ows of capital from market- based funding instruments over the entire 
observation period.

of non- performing loans in their banking sys -
tems, which had an adverse impact on the 
banking industry’s financing conditions.19 Since 
the end of 2012 there has been a steady im -
provement in the general financing situation in 
the periphery countries. Along with the lower -
ing of monetary policy rates, the non- standard 
monetary policy measures adopted by the Eu -
rosystem, in particular, also helped to bring 
down financing costs.
Temporary bank supply restrictions on finan -
cing conditions and the availability of external 
financing are likely to have had a stronger im -
pact on small and medium-  sized enterprises 
(SMEs) than on larger firms. This is due to the 
fact that SMEs typically have only limited access 
to alternative sources of financing, such as 
debt securities. The ECB’s SAFE survey on en -
terprises’ access to finance confirms the suspi -
cion that SMEs are exposed to significantly 
larger financial constraints than large enter -
prises (see the above chart). This situation was particularly pronounced in the case of very 
small, unproductive and highly indebted enter -
prises.20 At the same time, a number of empir -
ical studies indicate that SMEs were able to 
substitute banks loans, above all, by means of 
increased recourse to trade credits.21 This

means that, at least in some cases, SMEs were 
in a position to substitute bank loans with al -
ternative forms of financing.
Bank supply- side constraints at the aggregate 
level now appear to have become markedly 
less important in all the four large member 
states. Since 2016, positive inflows of bank 
loans have been seen again in the euro area, 
with this development being driven mainly by 
non- financial corporations in France and Ger -
many. As a result of the Eurosystem’s Corpor -
ate Sector Purchase Programme (CSPP), there 
was also a rebound in the net issuance of debt 
securities.22 The most significant inflows in this 
instance were likewise recorded for the non-  
financial corporations in France, which were al -
ready strongly active in the capital market.
The maturity of borrowed 
 capital
Besides the changes in the financing structure 
discussed above, there have latterly also been 
marked adjustments to the maturity of the bor -
rowed capital. The adjacent chart shows the 
share of long- term borrowed capital in relation 
to the total amount of borrowed capital at the 
beginning and the end of the observation 
period (2008 Q1 to 2017 Q2).23 An increasing 
percentage of long- term debt is apparent at 
the euro area level. While the increase in Ger -
many was smaller than in the euro area as a 
whole, there has been a marked rise in this per -
centage above all in Spain and, according to 
the latest data available, it was also at a higher 
level than in the other countries under consid -
eration here.
The increases are due in each case to country- 
specific developments with regard to the finan -
cing instruments. In the euro area as a whole 
and at the country level in France and Ger -
many, the growing share was due principally to 
stronger recourse to long- term loans and debt 
securities. In France and Germany, there was, in 
addition, also an expansion of short- term debt instruments, although this was not as great as 
the increase in long- term debt financing. In 
Italy and Spain, on the other hand, the rising 
percentage was driven in large part by a per -
ceptible decline in short- term debt instruments. 
In this context, the lower overall amount of 
borrowed capital, particularly in Spain, is also Bank supply- side

to be seen, not least, against the backdrop of 
the marked increase in internal financing. With 
regard to the interest rate fixation period for 
bank loans, given very low long- term interest 
rates, it is apparent that bank loans with vari -
able interest rates declined as a percentage of 
total borrowed capital in the euro area.24
The highlighted trends in maturity and interest 
fixation could ultimately also have repercus -
sions for the structure of corporate financing. 
Owing to the longer maturities with simultan -
eous longer fixation of the current low rates of 
interest, the interest expenditure of the non-  
financial corporations might increase some -
what more slowly during the monetary policy 
normalisation process and thus, taken in isol -
ation, reduce internal financing only to a lesser 
extent.
Implications for the balance 
sheet structure
A persistent shift in the relative importance of 
various external financing instruments is re -
flected over the medium term in the stocks of 
liabilities, too. Against this background, the 
above chart shows the structure of the liabil -
ities of non- financial corporations in the euro 
area and in its four large member states, with the liabilities being divided into bank loans, 
other debt capital and equity capital.25 Add -
itionally, the share of market- based funding 
– the sum of debt securities and listed shares – 
is shown.
At the euro area level, bank loans accounted for 
less than 18% of total liabilities in mid-2017.26 
This means that, at the euro area level, bank 
loans have a significant but, at least in terms of 
quantity, not a dominant position in the struc -
ture of non- financial corporations’ liabilities . 
This holds true not only for big non- financial 
corporations but also for SMEs.27 With the ex -
ception of France, bank loans have also become 
less important at the country level, with this de -
velopment being especially marked in Spain. By 
contrast, market- based financing gained slightly 
in importance except in the case of non- finan -
cial corporations in Germany, with this being at -
tributable primarily to an increase in debt secur -
ities. In both France and Germany, market-  
based instruments played a larger part than 
bank loans in the financing of non- financial cor -
porations. In Italy and Spain, on the other hand,

iture might increase some-what more slowly as a result of monet -

24 According to the ECB’s monetary financial institutions 
balance sheet statistics, compared with 2014 Q1 variable 
interest bank loans as a share of total debt had fallen by 
2.6 percentage points to 57.0% in 2017 Q2. In this con -
text, variable interest loans comprise loans with an original 
or residual maturity of less than 12 months as well as loans 
with an interest rate adjustment date of 12 months.
25 Initial stocks extrapolated by cumulative transactions 
are used for this purpose. This avoids price fluctuations dis -
torting the importance of individual liabilities. The category 
of other debt capital is produced by the difference be -
tween total liabilities and the individually considered instru -
ments.
26 If the liabilities are measured at market prices, bank 
loans as a share of total liabilities amount to around 13%.
27 The data of the BACH database of the European Com -
mittee of Central Balance-  Sheet Data Offices (ECCBSO) 
confirm that even the balance sheets of small and medium- 
sized enterprises display a structure similar to that of large 
enterprises and that bank loans do not have a pre- eminent 
position. Accordingly, in 2015 SMEs’ share of bank loans in 
total liabilities was just over 25%, with corresponding fig -
ures of just under 17% in France, 18% in Italy and 19% in 
Spain. See also Deutsche Bundesbank, An international

bank loans continued to play a more important 
role than market- based financing.
At the euro area level, there has been an in -
crease in equity capital as a percentage of total 
liabilities, although this development was 
shaped by non- market- based equity instru -
ments, such as shares and investments and was 
heterogeneous in form at the country level. 
The percentage declined slightly in the case of 
non- financial corporations in France and Ger -
many, but showed a marked rise in Italy and, 
especially, in Spain.
Macroeconomic and 
 economic policy implications 
of a changed financing 
 structure
The preceding comments have highlighted the 
fact that euro area non- financial corporations 
have seen a shift in their external financing and 
balance sheet structure from borrowed to 
equity capital. At the same time, there has 
been a marked reduction in the importance of 
bank loans and market- based borrowed capital 
has become slightly less important. What im -
pact could this have on the medium- term 
growth outlook for the euro area and its larg -
est member states? Answers to this question 
are provided by the literature on the connec -
tion between financing and growth. Here, 
there had long prevailed the view that the size 
of the total volume of funding made available 
to the private non- financial sector has a unam -
bigiously positive impact on economic growth, 
irrespective of whether it is provided by banks 
or markets.28
More recent studies, however, come to the 
conclusion that it is only up to a certain point 
that economic growth can be boosted by an 
increase in debt. Stepping over a certain thresh -
old of debt turns the positive relationship into a 
negative one, with this being irrespective of 
whether the debt comprises bank loans or 
other debt instruments.29 This is mostly attrib -uted to the fact that increasing debt leads to a 
misallocation of resources, which ultimately re -
duces productivity growth.30 These results 
imply that, starting from a level of debt beyond 
the threshold value, a reduction in debt is likely 
to foster growth over the medium term. A 
comparison of current figures for debt as a 
ratio of GDP , for example, with the threshold 
value of 90%, calculated by Cecchetti et al 
(2011), above which debt has a negative effect 
on economic growth, shows that the non-  
financial corporations in the euro area and in all 
four observed countries lie markedly above it in 
some cases.31 At the same time, debt ratios Increase in the

cial systems: which is better?, Journal of Financial Inter -
mediation 11, pp 398-428. From a theoretical perspective, 
too, it is unclear whether banks or markets ensure higher 
growth. See R Levine (2005), Finance and growth: theory 
and evidence, in P Aghion and S Durlauf (eds), Handbook 
of Economic Growth, Vol 1A. More recent studies highlight 
the fact that bank- based financial systems have a stabilising 
impact on real economic activity in normal recessions. If 
the recession is accompanied by a financial crisis, however, 
economic recovery sets in earlier in market- based financial 
systems. See L  Gambacorta, J  Yang and K  Tsatsaronis 
(2014), Financial structure and growth, BIS Quarterly Re -
view, March 2014. At the same time, the positive effect of 
securities markets becomes stronger with the level of eco -
nomic development, while it weakens for bank loans. See

30 There is, furthermore, a related literature which is con -
cerned with the significance of debt for the economic 
cycle. In this it is argued that excessive debt is accompanied 
by the build- up of a debt overhang. This leads to the eco -
nomic actors actively reducing their debt, which dampens 
economic growth because of weakened demand. See

the non- financial private sector as a whole. Taking into 
consideration the fact that different definitions of indebt -
edness are used in some cases, all the studies nevertheless

have shown a very obvious decline from their 
peaks in Spain and, to a lesser extent, in Italy.32 
The reduction in debt that has taken place over 
the past few years combined with the shift in 
corporate financing towards equity, taken in 
isolation, could therefore have strengthened 
the medium- term growth potential.33
This is also the context in which to see the Euro -
pean Commission’s plan, launched in 2015, to 
create a capital markets union, which is de -
signed to promote the development of a single 
market for financing instruments in the Euro -
pean Union.34 In light of the findings regarding 
the connection between financial developments 
and economic growth, it seems reasonable to 
focus on the expansion and cross- border inte -
gration of markets for equity capital. Besides 
the potential positive growth impulses, this 
should strengthen non- financial corporations’ 
resilience to negative shocks, as the value of 
equity capital and profit distributions – unlike in 
the case of borrowed capital – can adjust dir -
ectly to changed economic conditions.35
The divers fication of the financing structure of 
non- financial corporations that has taken place 
over the past few years could also have a sta -
bilising impact with regard to short- term cyc -
lical fluctuations. Theoretical studies, for in -
stance, show that the possibility of substituting 
bank loans by using other financing instru -
ments, such as debt certificates, mitigates the 
real economic consequences of restrictions on 
the supply of bank credit.36 In line with this, 
empirical analyses for the euro area indicate 
that a bank loan supply shock has a clearly 
negative effect on real corporate investment 
only if there is no possibility of substituting 
bank loans with other financing instruments 
(see the box on pages 69 to 71).
The shifts in the financing structure of non-  
financial corporations might also have implica -
tions for the transmission of monetary policy. 
The reduced importance of bank loans in cor -
porate financing combined with a more diversi -
fied financing structure is likely, taken on its own terms, to weaken the direct transmission 
of monetary policy measures through bank 
credit.37 At the same time, however, the 
strengthened role of other sources of financing 
and the slight increase in the direct provision of 
funds via the financial markets imply that 
market- related variables, especially asset prices, 
have a greater importance in monetary policy 
transmission.38 In turn, when viewed in isol -
ation, this should heighten the effectiveness of 
monetary policy measures to the extent that 
changed asset prices are reflected in the quality 
of the financial intermediaries’ balance sheets 
and, through this, in their funding costs. Taken 
altogether, there is likely to have been a change 
in the relative importance of individual trans -
mission channels owing to developments in en -
terprises’ financing structure.39Capital markets 
union could be used to expand equity markets
Diversification of 
the financing 
structure makes 
enterprises less dependent on constraints in the supply of bank loans …i
… and probably 
changes the relative import -
ance of individ-ual monetary policy transmis-sion channels32 Cecchetti et al (2011), loc cit, calculate their threshold 
value of 90% of GDP based on a very broad definition of 
debt, which comprises all borrowed capital. The following 
values can be recorded for 2017 Q2: Germany 96%, Spain 
139%, France 166%, Italy 116% and the euro area 139%. 
The highest levels were 105% in Germany (2009 Q1), 
188% in Spain (2007 Q4) and 128% in Italy (2012 Q4). For 
non- financial corporations in France, the value at the cur -
rent end is the highest level. For the euro area, the value 
has been fluctuating around 140% since early 2008.
33 Empirical studies come to the conclusion that well-  
developed stock markets have a monotonically positive im -
pact on real per capita income. For more information, see

well as O Peia and K Roszbach (2015), Finance and growth:

ity 19, pp 105-118. It is nevertheless unclear whether these 
findings with regard to stock markets can be transferred to 
equity capital in the wider sense.

Substitution of bank loans and investment activity
in the euro area
During the fi  nancial and economic crisis as 
well as the European debt crisis, the euro 
area saw bank loans being substituted by other debt instruments and equity. This raises the question as to whether the op-
tion of having recourse to alternative fi  nan-
cing instruments is, in principle, able to mitigate the negative effects of restrictive 
bank loan supply shocks on the real econ-
omy.1 This question can be examined by 
means of a vector autoregression (VAR) 
method. This time series model is based on 
the simultaneous estimation of several equations of the endogenous variables to 
be examined, which are described by means of their own historical values and by the his-torical values of the other endogenous vari-ables. This makes it possible to estimate the interdependencies between a large number of variables. The residuals calculated on the 
basis of individual equations are then con-
verted into shocks that can be interpreted economically by setting theory- motivated 
restrictions. These shocks can then be used 
as a basis for estimating how the variables 
in the model respond to exogenous 
changes, such as changes to the supply of 
bank loans. The model used here employs 
Bayesian methods for estimation, where ex-ogenous shocks are identifi  ed by combining sign and zero restrictions.
2
In addition to the real investment by non- 
fi  nancial corporations in the euro area, the 
defl  ator for aggregate gross fi  xed capital formation, the overnight interbank rate EONIA and the bank loan rate for non- 
fi  nancial corporations, the empirical model 
also includes fl  ows of bank loans to non- 
fi  nancial corporations and fl  ows from other fi  nancing instruments (calculated as the dif-
ference between total external fi  nancing and bank loans).3 The model covers the ob-
servation period from the fi  rst quarter of 
2000 to the fi  rst quarter of 2017.4
The effects of two bank loan supply shocks 
which have been identifi  ed differently are 
compared: while for one of the shocks it is assumed that bank loans are substituted by 
other fi  nancing instruments, such a substi-
tution is not permitted for the other shock. 
Comparing how real investment by enter-
prises responded to these two shocks may 
indicate whether a substitution of bank 
loans by other fi  nancing instruments is able 
to mitigate the negative real economic re-
percussions.
A restrictive bank loan supply shock with 
substitution effects is identifi  ed by a decline in the fl  ows of bank loans, a rise in lending rates and an increase in the fl  ows of other 
fi  nancing instruments. The identifi  cation of 
a bank loan supply shock via opposing sign 
restrictions in bank lending rates and bank 
lending volume can be deduced from a

and R Unger (2017), External fi  nancing and economic activity in the euro area – why are bank loans special?, Deutsche Bundesbank Discussion Paper, No 04/ 2017.
2 The estimations are made using the BEAR toolbox. 
For more information, see A Dieppe, R Legrand and B van Roye (2016), The BEAR Toolbox, ECB Working 
Paper Series No 1934. Both prior and posterior distri-
butions are of the frequently used normal- inverse- 
Wishart type. The sign restrictions set out below apply contemporaneously.
3 The other fi  nancing instruments thus include, 
amongst others, shares, other equity, debt securities, 
loans from non- banks, trade credits and advances.
4 The number of lags is two periods. Except for the 
fl  ows of bank loans and other means of fi  nancing, the 
variables are entered into the equation in the (log) level. Unlike in the existing literature, the fi  nancing variables are used as the fi  rst differences of the log 
level. The level variables are calculated by extrapolating 
the base level with transactions in order to exclude non- transaction- related changes in the fi  nancing in-
struments.Deutsche Bundesbank

large number of theoretical models and is 
widespread in the empirical literature.5 The 
positive sign restriction on the other fi  nan-
cing instruments is inspired by the work of 
Becker and Ivashina (2014), who postulate 
that a negative bank loan supply shock 
necessarily  goes hand in hand with an in-crease in demand for other sources of fi  nancing .
6 This is compared with a bank 
loan supply shock in which the decline in 
bank loans is not simultaneously substituted 
by other fi  nancing instruments. This is im-
plemented technically by imposing an add-itional zero restriction to the fl  ows of other fi  nancing instruments.
7
The chart above shows the response of real 
investment by enterprises to the bank loan 
supply shock with and without substitution 
effects by other fi  nancing instruments. The continuous lines show the median and the 
dotted lines show the 16th and 84th per-
centiles of the distribution of potential de-velopments of real investment. The median 
of the distribution can be regarded as a central trend within the possible develop-ments. If the bulk of the probability distri-bution, delineated by the 16th and 84th percentiles, runs below (above) zero, it is 
assumed here that the effect of the shock 
on the respective variable is with a high de-gree of probability negative (positive).
The estimation results suggest that a re-strictive bank loan supply shock in which 
bank loans are not substituted by other fi  -
nancing instruments is highly likely to result in a sharp decline in real investment by en-
terprises. The decline hits bottom after 
5 Theoretical models which can be used to derive 
opposing  sign restrictions for bank lending rates and 
bank lending volumes include, for example, V Cúrdia 
and M Woodford (2010), Credit spreads and monetary 
policy, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking 42 (S1), 
pp 3-35; and A Gerali, S Neri, L Sessa and F Signoretti 
(2010), Credit and Banking in a DSGE model of the 
euro area, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking 42 
(S1), pp 107-141. Empirical studies that use these sign 
restrictions include, for example, U Busch, M Schar-
nagl and J Scheithauer (2010), Loan supply in Germany 
during the fi  nancial crisis, Deutsche Bundesbank Dis-
cussion Paper, No 05/ 2010; N Hristov, O Hülsewig and

of International Money and Finance 31 (3), pp 569-592; L  Gambetti and A  Musso (2016), Loan supply shocks and the business cycle, Journal of Applied 
Econometrics, Vol 32 (4), pp 764-782; and Deutsche

area non- fi  nancial corporations, Monthly Report, Sep-tember 2015, pp 15-39.
6 See B Becker and V Ivashina (2014), op cit. In the 
literature cited above, both fi  nancing instruments may in principle move in the same direction in the event of 
credit supply shocks. Consequently, only a subset of 
these shocks are covered.
7 In order to distinguish the bank loan supply shock 
from goods supply and demand shocks, additional 
zero restrictions are also placed on real investment by 
enterprises and the defl  ator for aggregate gross fi  xed 
capital formation in both specifi  cations. For a similar 
approach, see, for example, M Breitenlechner, J Schar-ler and F Sindermann (2016), Banks’ external fi  nancing

Conclusions
The financing structure of non- financial corpor -
ations in the euro area has clearly changed 
over the past few years. External financing in 
the 2000s was marked primarily by inflows of 
borrowed capital, predominantly in the form of 
bank loans. With the outbreak of the financial 
and economic crisis, external financing shifted 
from borrowed to equity capital and, within 
borrowed capital, from bank loans to other 
debt instruments. External financing simultan -
eously became less important in relation to in -
ternal financing.
The shift towards a larger share of internal and 
equity financing combined with a more diversi -fied debt financing structure is likely to help 
make the funding of non- financial corporations 
as a whole less vulnerable to temporary finan -
cial constraints at individual providers of finan -
cing, particularly banks. The envisaged creation 
of a European Capital Market Union could fur -
ther advance this process. With regard to the 
transmission of monetary policy impulses 
through the various transmission channels, it is 
important for monetary policy that there is a 
continuous monitoring and analysis of changes 
in financing behaviour and of the associated 
financing  structure of non- financial corpor -
ations.Since 2008 shift 
from borrowed to equity capital and from bank loans to other debt instru-ments, …… which could make non- financial corporations in the euro area 
more resilientaround nine quarters. The effect of the 
shock then slowly peters out. If the declin-
ing bank loans are substituted by other fi  -
nancing sources, however, the fall in invest-
ment becomes less intense in the median of 
the distribution and is considerably less likely to enter negative territory. Thus, the results of the empirical study indicate that 
the option of substituting bank loans with 
other sources of fi  nancing could mitigate the negative effects of a restrictive bank 
loan supply shock on the investment activ-
ity of non- fi  nancial corporations.8

ings in F De Fiore and H Uhlig (2015), op cit, and the 
microeconomic fi  ndings in B  Becker and V  Ivashina

Finalising Basel III
On 7 December 2017, the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) 
concluded an intensive and difficult round of negotiations by endorsing the final Basel III package 
of reforms. This wrapped up the fundamental reform of the global regulatory framework for 
banks which had been initiated in response to the financial crisis. The first part of the Basel III 
reform package, which defined far stricter capital, liquidity and leverage ratio standards, was 
adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision back in 2010. The December 2017 round 
of reforms amend the requirements for the calculation of credit and operational risk which banks 
are expected to back with capital. Updated minimum capital requirements for market risk had 
been adopted by the GHOS at the beginning of 2016.
The idea behind the reform package was to make the Basel standards more risk- sensitive and to 
limit the scope available to institutions which quantify risk – and thus determine their capital 
requirements – using their own internal models. These regulatory constraints, it is hoped, will curb 
unwarranted variation in calculation results across banks. Furthermore, the new rules will require 
institutions to comply with binding leverage ratios, with a surcharge being added for global sys -
temically important banks (G-  SIBs). Negotiations on the Basel III reform package proved to be 
particularly contentious over the calibration of an output floor requirement for institutions which 
use internal models for measuring risk. That output floor limits the extent to which the capital 
requirements calculated using banks’ internal models can vary from the capital requirements 
derived under standardised approaches. One group of countries was pushing for banks’ internal 
risk measurement models to play a more prominent role in the calculation of capital require -
ments, while another wanted to place greater constraints on their use. In the end, it was agreed 
to calibrate the output floor at 72.5%. What this means is that the capital benefit which a bank 
can gain from using an internal risk measurement model can be no more than 27.5% of the cap -
ital requirement computed solely on the basis of the standardised approaches.
The new Basel standards are scheduled for implementation on 1 January 2022, though a phase- 
in period running until 1 January 2027 will ease transition to the new output floor, giving banks 
plenty of time to acclimatise to the new regulatory setting. Implementing the stricter standards 
will pose a challenge for German institutions, but their sound capital base and the extended 
phase- in period should make it a manageable task.
The new global Basel III standards will add to the resilience of international financial markets and 
make for a more level playing field in global markets. Now it is a question of implementing the 
endorsed standards rigorously and in good time across all the member countries of the Basel 
Committee.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The Basel III reform package1 finalised in De -
cember 2017 by the Basel Committee on Bank -
ing Supervision (the “Basel Committee”)2 forms 
part of an array of measures which address the 
vulnerabilities that the 2007-09 financial crisis 
had exposed in the international regulatory 
architecture for banks. By endorsing this reform 
package, the Basel Committee has imple -
mented standards formulated in the action 
plan aimed at strengthening the resilience of 
the financial system, which the G20 leaders 
had adopted in November 2008 in response to 
the financial crisis and specified at later sum -
mits. The initial phase of the Basel III reforms, 
which was concluded in December 2010,3 saw 
the Basel Committee adopt stricter capital rules 
(definition, capital ratios, introduction of capital 
buffers) and uniform global liquidity standards, 
besides introducing a leverage ratio.4 In Eur -
ope, these measures were implemented by 
way of the EU- wide Capital Requirements Dir -
ective (CRD5) and Capital Requirements Regula -
tion (CRR6), which both entered into force on 
1 January 2014.7
The Basel Committee then turned its attention 
to risk matters – in other words, to the tech -
niques used to calculate risk- weighted assets (RWAs). These are the subject of the December 
2017 reform package finalising Basel III.
Not covered by the current reform package is 
the regime governing exposures to central gov -
ernments and other sovereign entities, which 
the Basel Committee is discussing as a separate 
item (see the box on pages 77 and 78).
One key objective of the reform package final -
ising Basel  III was to reduce unwarranted vari -
ability in RWA calculations across banks in an 
effort to restore faith in the results those calcu -
lations produced, which had evaporated during 
the financial crisis. The Basel Committee sought 
to achieve this goal by enhancing the robust -
ness and risk sensitivity of the standardised ap -
proaches for credit and operational risk, curb -
ing the use of internal models, and comple -
menting the risk- weighted capital ratio with a 
finalised leverage ratio and a revised, more ro -
bust output floor.8
A range of studies by the Basel Committee had 
found wide variation in the capital require -
ments or RWAs which institutions calculated Goals: reducing 
RWA variability and curbing model risk while maintaining the balance between risk sensitivity and regulatory  complexity

banks. It comprises high- level representatives from central 
banks and authorities with formal responsibility for the 
supervision of banking business from 28 countries (see 
https://www.bis.org/bcbs/membership.htm ). The Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision usually convenes every 
three months. Its standing secretariat is located at the Bank 
for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel. Germany is 
currently  represented by Dr Andreas Dombret from the 
Deutsche Bundesbank and Raimund Röseler from the Fed -

using internal models that could not be ex -
plained solely by differences in the riskiness of 
their portfolios. A degree of variability is un -
problematic for supervisors, given that it can be 
attributed to idiosyncrasies in individual banks’ 
risk management practices. In an effort to curb 
undesirable excessive variability in the calcula -
tion of RWAs, the Basel Committee fundamen -
tally revised the relevant areas of the regulatory 
architecture, singling out the rules governing 
the calculation of capital requirements for 
credit and operational risk as well as the stand -
ards for market risk. Another new feature is the 
introduction of a surcharge on the minimum 
leverage ratio for global systemically important 
banks (G-  SIBs).
The expectation articulated by the GHOS that 
finalising Basel III should not, on average, sig -
nificantly increase overall capital requirements 
posed a particular challenge while wrapping up 
the Basel III package. Differences in financial 
systems across stakeholder countries made it 
difficult to strike a universally acceptable bal -
ance. One example of the difficulties the Basel 
Committee faced was the calibration of the 
output floor, where it was only possible to 
reach a compromise following intensive and 
difficult talks.9
Standardised approach 
for credit risk
The regulatory standardised approach for credit 
risk (CRSA) is a methodology used for calculat -
ing a bank’s minimum capital requirements for 
credit risk. In future, banks using internal 
ratings- based (IRB) approaches to calculate 
their credit risk will be expected to quantify 
their capital requirements under the CRSA as 
well, since the latter will then be used to deter -
mine the output floor. This will make the CRSA 
significantly more important, including for large 
institutions. In light of this development, the 
revision primarily set out to forge stronger links 
between the CRSA and the internal model 
methods (eg by harmonising the definitions used), enhance risk sensitivity by boosting the 
granularity of risk weights, and adjust the 
CRSA’s calibration to incorporate recent loss 
experience.
The fourth major objective – reducing mechan -
istic reliance on external ratings – was put on 
the backburner after it came in for heavy criti -
cism from many members of the Basel Com -
mittee and the banking community. The idea of 
doing away with external ratings altogether as 
a means of calibrating CRSA risk weights was 
rejected because alternative risk drivers (finan -
cial metrics such as revenues and leverage in 
the case of exposures to corporates) are neither 
straightforward nor sufficiently risk- sensitive. 
What is more, external ratings of corporates 
and banks had proven to be a valuable source 
of information in the past. Institutions will, 
however, be expected to perform due diligence 
on the ratings released by external credit rating 
agencies and also raise their risk weights as ap -
propriate.
The revised CRSA offers two techniques for de -
termining the capital requirements for inter -
bank exposures: the external credit risk assess -
ment (ECRA) approach and the standardised 
credit risk assessment (SCRA) approach. In a 
move that is aimed at loosening the sovereign- 
bank nexus, it will now no longer be possible 
to derive the risk weight of the obligor bank 
from the risk weight of the jurisdiction in which 
it is incorporated. While the risk weight can 
continue to be determined using the external 
rating of the obligor bank itself under the ECRA 
approach, the ratings used here are not allowed 
to incorporate any assumptions of implicit gov -
ernment support. The SCRA is used for any ex -
posures without an external rating and in juris -
dictions which no longer use external ratings 
for regulatory purposes, such as the United 
States. In the SCRA approach, the lending 
bank, having taken into account the prudential 
capital and liquidity metrics and performed due GHOS expect -
ation that final-
ising Basel III should not  significantly increase capital requirements posed a particu-lar challenge

Regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures
In parallel to the publication of the fi  nalised 
Basel III standard, the Basel Committee on 
Banking Supervision published a discussion 
paper on the regulatory treatment of sover-
eign exposures.1 While the Basel reforms 
were fi  nalised, the issue of sovereign expos-
ures was handled separately, as they play a 
special role in many ways. Take, for ex-
ample, the importance of exposures to cen-tral banks and central governments for the 
implementation of monetary policy meas-
ures. What is more, these exposures often 
have a key role to play in fi  nancial markets, 
as collateral and reference instruments for 
fi  nancial market transactions.
Currently, the regulatory treatment of sov-
ereign exposures is more favourable than that of other asset classes in various re-
spects. The Basel framework allows for sov-ereign exposures denominated and funded in domestic currency to be given a zero risk 
weight under the standardised approach for credit risk. This means that no capital 
has to be held against them. Moreover, sov-
ereign exposures are exempted from the large exposure limit of 25% of Tier 1 cap-
ital, which applies to other exposure classes.
However, sovereign exposures entail vari-
ous risks, which can affect the banking sys-
tem and the broader economy through a 
number of channels. In particular, an overly strong sovereign- bank nexus poses a risk to fi  nancial stability, as high levels of sovereign 
exposures on bank balance sheets could 
threaten the solvency of those institutions if 
sovereign debt sustainability were to deteri-
orate. Because credit and concentration risk 
are not taken into account, banks’ sover-
eign bond portfolios often lack diversifi  ca-
tion. Regulation should therefore aim to re-duce the sovereign- bank nexus through 
suitable measures.
The discussion paper centres on three re-
form elements: a better defi  nition of sover-
eign counterparties, and capital require-
ments for both credit risk and concentra-
tion risk. The special economic functions of 
sovereign exposures outlined above mainly 
apply to exposures to central governments. It is therefore appropriate to afford this ex-
posure class preferential treatment. The 
conditions under which this treatment can 
be extended to include other sovereign en-
tities, such as regional and local govern-ments, is a key component of the discus-
sion paper. In this context, it is necessary to 
bear in mind that the institutional settings 
of implicit and explicit guarantees between 
other sovereign entities and their central 
government differ from one country to the next.
The paper discusses positive risk weights for 
sovereign exposures as a way to take credit risk into account. As described above, cen-
tral governments would receive a positive 
risk weight, preferential to other sovereign 
entities, depending on their rating. Other sovereign entities could receive the same regulatory treatment as central govern-ments provided they are either supported 
by their central government or are autono-
mous. Sovereign entities which receive guarantees from their central government 
would meet the support criterion. The au-
tonomy criterion would allow other sover-
eign entities to receive the same regulatory treatment as central governments provided

that those entities are able to service their 
liabilities autonomously, by levying taxes, 
for example, and thus without the support 
of the central government. In this case, the 
other sovereign entity would also be given 
a preferential risk weight, but based on its 
own credit rating – in other words, it would 
be treated as a central government in its own right. All remaining other sovereign entities would receive a non- preferential, and therefore higher, risk weight to cover 
credit risk.
As for the mitigation of concentration risk, 
the paper does not propose upper limits, but instead discusses incremental risk weight add- ons that would vary based on the exposure amount. This kind of price- 
based approach sets incentives to limit ex-
cessive exposures to a sovereign entity. The 
exposures that would be consolidated to determine the risk weights for concentra-tion risk would hinge on the above defi  n-
ition of sovereign entities. All exposures to 
other sovereign entities that meet the sup-
port criterion would be combined with ex-
posures to their central government. The 
capital add- on for concentration risk would 
therefore be higher. Exposures to “autono-
mous” entities would be treated separately. 
Exposures to all remaining other sovereign 
entities would be subject to a 25% Tier 1 capital limit. This approach sets incentives for banks to hold more broadly diversifi  ed 
sovereign portfolios.
As constitutional and economic settings of 
liability between a country’s sovereign en-tities vary widely across the world, the 
aforementioned criteria will have to be sub-ject to national discretion. Allocating an en-
tity to the central government would re-
duce risk weights for credit risk. But if cap-
ital requirements for concentration risk were introduced at the same time, this 
would result in higher risk weight add- ons for this risk, as described, leading national 
authorities to weigh up their decision on 
sovereign defi  nitions.
The discussion paper envisages that expos-
ures to central banks will continue to be ex-empted from any regulatory treatment. This 
refl  ects the cash- like nature of a deposit 
with the central bank and prevents any po-
tential friction with the conduct of monet-
ary policy. Interested stakeholders are now 
invited to comment on the ideas presented 
in the discussion paper by responding to 
the specifi  c questions it contains, and thus 
to actively inform the Basel Committee’s thinking.
2 Even though the Basel Commit-
tee has made clear that it does not currently intend to change the existing rules for sov-
ereign exposures, a complete overhaul at the global level is a possible option in the 
long term. In the shorter term, ideas on this 
topic could be taken up at the national or 
European level, and this debate is already 
underway, especially in the European con-
text. Amongst others, a recently published 
study commissioned by the European Par-
liament outlined similar approaches to miti-
gating concentration risk as those offered 
in the discussion paper.3 In the continuing 
discussions about deepening the banking 
union, Europe needs to actively debate risk 
reduction. The Bundesbank considers the regulatory treatment of sovereign expos-
ures to be a pivotal issue in this debate.4

diligence, is required to assign the obligor bank 
to one of three risk weight buckets, which indi -
cates the appropriate risk weight to be applied.
A fresh addition to the Basel framework is a 
separate exposure class for covered bonds, for 
which the relevant risk weights are derived 
either  from the issue- specific external rating of 
the covered bond or from the issuing institu -
tion’s risk weight. These requirements are es -
sentially consistent with the legislation which is 
already in force in the European Union in the 
shape of the CRR.
A more granular approach has also been intro -
duced for the corporates exposure class. In fu -
ture, it will be possible to apply a risk weight of 
85% to exposures to small and medium- sized 
enterprises (SMEs), ie entities with consolidated 
annual revenues of less than €50 million. This 
provision acknowledges that while these ex -
posures are often secured, the collateral usually 
cannot be taken into account in determining 
an institution’s minimum capital requirements. 
In addition, specialised lending exposures 
– loans where the primary source of repayment 
is the income generated by the financed assets 
or projects – should also be allocated to a sep -
arate exposure class. As hitherto, the risk 
weights of all corporate exposures will be 
based on external ratings (eg 20% for an exter -
nal rating of between AAA and AA-). A flat risk 
weight of 100% is assigned, as before, to un -
rated exposures and to the bulk of unrated 
specialised lending exposures. Here again, 
there is a procedure for jurisdictions that no 
longer permit the use of external ratings for 
regulatory purposes which allows a risk weight 
of 65%, rather  than 100%, to be applied if the 
lending bank assesses the corporate in ques -
tion to be “investment grade”. That procedure 
is only available if the corporate in question has 
securities listed on an exchange, however.
To account for the higher risk of loss from sub -
ordinated exposures and equity, these risk pos -
itions will likewise be assigned to a separate 
exposure class in future. The risk weight treat -ment here varies by riskiness, and can be as 
high as 400% for speculative unlisted equity 
exposures, for example.
The future prudential treatment of retail expos -
ures distinguishes between revolvers (where 
credit is typically drawn down) and transactors 
(where the facility is solely to facilitate transac -
tions). The latter category includes credit card 
claims, for instance. If the bank can demon -
strate that drawdowns of a transacting credit 
facility are repaid regularly, supervisors will as -
sume that there is a lower risk of loss and apply 
a risk weight of 45%, rather than the flat 75% 
risk weight normally applied to retail expos -
ures.
The most extensive, and, for Germany’s bank -
ing sector, particularly significant changes 
made by the Basel III reform package affected 
the treatment of real estate exposures. First,

ognition of real estate collateral were specified Covered bonds –

in greater detail in the CRSA as well so as to 
bring them into line with the existing rules 
under the IRB approach. For instance, a bank 
wishing to count real estate as collateral in its 
calculation of minimum capital requirements 
must now ensure the legal enforceability of the 
collateral agreement as well as the prudent 
valuation of the property, and make sure that 
the value of the property does not depend ma -
terially on the performance of the borrower 
and that the borrower is able to service the 
debt. Exposures secured by mortgages must be 
assigned to separate exposure classes.
A distinction must be made between residen -
tial and commercial real estate collateral. Fur -
thermore, banks are required to assess whether 
the mortgage loan can be repaid out of the 
borrower’s income (“classic” real estate expos -
ure) or whether repayment is materially de -
pendent on cash flows generated by the prop -
erty or properties. This is an area where the 
Basel Committee has taken note of a phenom -
enon observed in a large number of countries 
during the financial crisis, namely that the latter 
exposure type (income- producing real estate) 
can be more at risk of default than the “classic” 
variety. Income- producing real estate will there -
fore be subject to stricter capital requirements 
in future.In the CRSA approach, the risk weight applied 
to real estate exposures is determined by the 
loan- to- value ratio (LTV) – the higher the LTV 
ratio, the higher the capital requirements. In 
the case of “classic” real estate exposures, na -
tional authorities implementing the Basel re -
gime can choose between two techniques for 
determining the minimum capital requirements. 
The first, the whole loan approach, provides 
separate LTV buckets to which the entire ex -
posure is assigned according to its LTV ratio 
and which show what risk weight should be 
applied.
The second technique, the loan-  splitting ap -
proach, is already used in the European Union. 
In this approach, a portion of the exposure (LTV 
of up to 55%) is deemed to be secured by the 
property and is assigned a fixed risk weight 
(20% for residential real estate exposures and 
60% for commercial real estate exposures). The 
remainder of the exposure is treated as un -
secured and is assigned the same risk weight 
that would be applied to any other unsecured 
exposure to the same obligor (eg 75% in the 
case of a retail obligor in a residential real es -
tate exposure). The risk weight of the entire ex -
posure is then calculated as the weighted aver -
age of the risk weights for the “secured” and 
“unsecured” portions of the exposure. Since

risk indicatorReal estate exposures in the revised standardised approach for credit risk (CRSA)

pendent on cash flows generated by the prop -
erty or properties are not based on the obli -
gor’s underlying capacity to service the debt 
from other sources, only the whole loan ap -
proach is normally permitted in these cases. If, 
however, loss rates from commercial real estate 
lending in a given country do not exceed cer -
tain ceilings (based on what is known as the 
“hard test”10), national competent authorities 
may allow the rules for “classic” real estate 
exposures , ie the loan- splitting approach as 
well, to be applied. The option of applying the 
loan- splitting approach, together with the hard 
test, take greater regulatory account of condi -
tions in national property markets.
The third category of mortgage loans intro -
duced by the Basel III package of reforms con -
cerns loans to companies or special- purpose 
vehicles (SPVs) financing land acquisition for 
development and construction purposes, or 
development and construction of any residen -
tial or commercial property (ADC exposures). 
Here again, the prudential risk assessment is 
geared to the property value, which means 
that these exposures are assigned fixed risk 
weights regardless of the borrower’s credit -
worthiness. As a general rule, a risk weight of 
150% is applied to ADC exposures.
Also new is a risk weight multiplier for un -
hedged foreign currency exposures, ie expos -
ures where the lending currency differs from 
the currency of the borrower’s source of in -
come. This currency mismatch multiplier is ap -
plied to regulatory retail exposures and residen -
tial real estate exposures and covers the risk 
that a marked appreciation in the value of the 
lending currency against the currency of the 
borrower’s source of income might leave the 
borrower unable to service its debts.
In a departure from the Basel II regime, com -
mitments that are unconditionally cancellable 
at any time (UCCs), which currently are not 
subject to capital requirements, must be recog -
nised as an exposure under the revised CRSA 
by applying a credit conversion factor (CCF) equal to 10% of their nominal amount and be 
backed with capital according to the borrow -
er’s risk weight. The previous rationale for ex -
empting institutions from the requirement to 
set aside capital, which gave credit institutions 
the ability to cancel the commitments of cus -
tomers whose creditworthiness had deterior -
ated as a way of preventing them from draw -
ing down the credit line, is not considered feas -
ible in practice. To guarantee that the credit 
line can always be cancelled in good time (for 
only then would exemption from the require -
ment to set aside capital truly be justified), the 
institution would have to be in a position to 
judge the customer’s creditworthiness, and any 
changes in that status, better and more quickly 
than the customer itself.
Changes were also made to the rules govern -
ing how collateral is treated when calculating 
minimum capital requirements. For one thing, 
the supervisory haircuts applied when counting 
financial collateral have been brought into line 
with market developments observed of late. 
For another, institutions using the CRSA will be 
required to apply the supervisory haircuts, ra -
ther than their own estimates, in future.Capital require-

Internal ratings- based (IRB) 
approaches
IRB approaches allow credit institutions to use 
their own internal parameters to calculate their 
capital requirements for credit risk. A distinc -
tion is made between the foundation IRB ap -
proach, under which institutions are only per -
mitted to use their own borrower PD (probabil -
ity of default) estimates, and the advanced IRB 
approach, which allows them to also estimate 
LGD (loss given default) as well as CCFs (credit 
conversion factors) for off- balance- sheet items. 
The Basel Committee revised the IRB ap -
proaches primarily with a view to reducing ex -
cessive RWA variability among banks. RWA 
variability occurs when different institutions as -
sess similar risks in different ways, resulting in 
varying levels of capital requirements. Those 
differences can occur, for instance, if risk par -
ameters are estimated on the basis of poor 
data or different practices are used in the de -
velopment and approval of internal models.
The Basel Committee’s deliberations on redu -
cing RWA variability sought to get to the bot -
tom of a fundamental question: in which port -
folios does it make sense to use internal mod -
elling in the first place? Low- default portfolios 
especially (ie portfolios exhibiting only small 
numbers of loss events) were sometimes found to differ significantly across institutions in terms 
of parameter estimates, even though those 
portfolios had a similar profile.
In light of the problems observed in the estima -
tion of LGDs and CCFs for low- default port -
folios, the Basel Committee decided to no 
longer permit the use of the advanced IRB ap -
proach in the banks and financial institutions 
exposure classes. In the corporates exposure 
class, its use is confined to corporates with 
consolidated annual revenues of €500 million 
or less. The advanced IRB approach will be re -
tained for the retail and specialised lending ex -
posures classes and for sovereigns. Since the 
treatment of sovereign exposures was excluded 
from the finalisation of Basel III, the new rules 
fail to address a problem which might face the 
low- default portfolio of sovereign exposures – 
that of inappropriate internal modelling and 
instable parameter estimates whenever loss 
event data are scarce.
While the new rules constrain the use of in -
ternal models overall, banks will still be able to 
use them for the bulk of their portfolios in 
future .
The second key measure aimed at reducing 
RWA variability was the adoption of minimum 
input floor values for bank- estimated risk par -IRB approaches

ameters. The thinking behind this measure was 
as follows: the smaller a parameter value – the 
PD of a low- default portfolio, for example – the 
greater the number of observations needed to 
validate that parameter value to a statistically 
significant degree. However, since observations 
are often scarce in practice, it is not possible to 
sufficiently validate small parameter values, 
hence the risk of underestimating the risks in -
volved. One impact of the use of input floors, 
though, is that the resulting increase in param -
eter values will primarily affect risks previously 
deemed to be minor. As a result, there is the 
danger that institutions will tend to take on 
greater risks which promise superior  returns 
but will lead to similar capital requirements on 
account of the input floor.
The existing input floor for PD was raised from 
three to five basis points, while an input floor 
equal to half of the corresponding CCFs from 
the CRSA has been introduced for the CCFs in 
the advanced IRB approach. As regards LGDs, the input floor calibration varies by exposure 
class for unsecured exposures and by collateral 
type for secured exposures.
Furthermore, the new rules change a number 
of technical details. The foundation IRB ap -
proach, which will now play a greater role due 
to the constraints placed on the advanced IRB 
approach, has been recalibrated to account for 
the regulatory LGD parameter values. This will 
slightly reduce the overall capital requirements 
under the foundation IRB approach for the ex -
posures in question.
The Basel Committee also decided that the 
1.06 scaling factor currently applied to risk 
weights under the IRB approach will no longer 
apply. Introduced in 2004, this scaling factor 
prevented an excessive reduction in capital re -
quirements under the IRB approach adopted as 
part of Basel II. Following the comprehensive 
recalibration of the CRSA and the IRB approach, 
that scaling factor is now no longer required.Foundation IRB

Operational risk
In the area of operational risk, the capital re -
quirement can currently be determined using 
three approaches. Two of them, the basic indi -
cator approach and the standardised approach, 
use the institution’s average gross income for 
the last three years as a basis on which the cal -
culations for operational risk are made. The 
capital requirement is then determined as a 
percentage, prescribed by supervisors, of this 
average income. In the third option, the ad -
vanced measurement approaches, institutions 
may determine their capital requirement them -
selves using internal models, provided these 
have been audited and approved by super -
visors.
In the course of the revision of the rules, it was 
found that gross income is not a suitable proxy 
for operational risk in a financial crisis. In the 
case of banks which use an advanced measure -
ment approach, no uniform methodology 
could be established, which led to the calcu -
lated capital requirements varying excessively. 
Against this background, banks may now de -
termine their capital requirements only on the 
basis of a single, new standardised measure -
ment approach; internal approaches are no 
longer permitted for this purpose.The new standardised measurement approach 
is similar to the basic indicator approach in its 
main features. The capital requirement is calcu -
lated as a percentage of the three- year average 
of a relevant indicator. Gross income will no 
longer be used as this indicator, instead being 
replaced by the business indicator. This is made 
up of three components:
– Net interest income including income from 
leases
– Maximum of fee income and fee expenses 
as well as maximum of other operating in -
come and other operating expenses
– Net profit and loss on the trading book and 
the banking book.
All components feed into the indicator with a 
positive sign, which means that even if the 
trading book result is negative, for example, 
the indicator increases.
As large institutions are exposed to compara -
tively higher operational risk, a variable super -
visory coefficient will be used for the first time. 
For example, the capital requirement for small 
institutions is just 12% of the business indica -
tor, whereas it can be up to 18% for large insti -
tutions. In order to increase the risk sensitivity 
of the standardised measurement approach, a 
loss component has been newly introduced. 
The capital requirement increases if the losses 
incurred by an institution are higher than aver -
age in a long- term comparison. If the losses in -
curred are relatively low, the capital require -
ment for operational risk can be reduced by 
just under half. However, the loss component is 
not mandatory and can, at national discretion, 
also be disregarded.

In response to the financial crisis, the Basel 
Committee introduced a more comprehensive 
measurement methodology for market risk 
(Basel  2.5) in 2009, which increased the capital 
requirement for banks using market risk models 
by a factor of roughly 2.5 at the national and 
EU level.
The Basel Committee has since fundamentally 
revised the concepts and methods in both 
the  standardised approach and the internal 
models-based approach and has refined the 
trading book definition. The FRTB, which sets 
out a revised Basel market risk framework, was 
already adopted and published in January 
2016. The EU implementation process for the 
FRTB began in November 2016 with the publi -
cation of the European Commission’s CRR re -
view proposal. In parallel with the adoption of 
the Basel III reform package on 7  December 
2017, the GHOS decided to postpone the dead -
line for the implementation of the new market 
risk rules from the start of 2019 to 1 January 
2022, bringing it into line with the entry into 
force of the finalised Basel III package.11
Banks therefore have more time to make the 
necessary enhancements to the systems infra -
structure that will be needed to apply the com -
plex framework. A number of issues concern -
ing the modelling requirements are still being 
clarified by the Basel Committee. These include 
a review of the calibrations of the capital re -
quirements under the standardised and internal 
models-based approaches.
The boundary between the trading book and 
the banking book has been revised with the 
aim of making instruments attributable to the 
trading book more consistent across banks. 
The key criterion for assigning instruments to 
the trading book is still the trading intent. 
Whereas in the current regulatory framework, 
credit institutions have themselves determined 
the criteria for the intention to trade in relation 
to their trading instruments, under the FRTB 
there are a number of instruments that must be 
assigned to the trading book. Exceptions to this rule, as well as shifting positions between the 
trading book and the banking book, require 
supervisory approval.
The internal models- based approach will con -
tinue to use internal, mathematical- statistical 
models to measure market risk, accompanied 
by a series of processes concerning, for ex -
ample, data quality. In contrast to previous 
practice, the supervisory approval of an internal 
models-  based approach will no longer be 
granted for entire risk categories (such as gen -
eral interest rate risk, specific interest rate risk, 
commodity risk). Instead, it will be granted on 
a more granular basis per trading desk, for 
which equity risk, interest rate risk, commodity 
risk, exchange rate risk and credit spread risk 
are determined in each case.
A key change in the new approach is that the 
previously used risk measure value- at- risk (VaR), 
as well as stressed VaR introduced under Basel 
2.5, will be replaced by the risk measure ex -
pected shortfall (ES). The risk measure ES is de -
termined for a pre- defined stress period for the 
approved trading desks.
A weakness of previous market risk models was 
that they assumed that all instruments were 
equally liquid and had a uniform liquidity hori -
zon of ten days. The new framework provides 
for horizons of between ten and 120 days, de -
pending on risk factor categories.
Adequate modelling of market risk requires suf -
ficiently broad data of good quality. Where 
data is inadequate, the capital requirements 
will be determined separately and conserva -
tively within the internal models- based ap -
proach.
In comparison with the internal models- based 
approach, the standardised approach is a 
methodologically simpler approach for measur -
ing market risk that is fully prescribed by super -New definition

visors.12 The new standardised approach meas -
ures linear risks using price sensitivities and 
takes risk-  reducing diversification effects into 
account. For options, non-  linear risks are also 
considered. Unlike the previous standardised 
approach, the new standardised approach also 
covers default risk. The new standardised ap -
proach is also to be used in combination with 
the internal models- based approach and serves 
as a fallback solution in case the latter cannot 
or may not be used for given trading desks. For 
small institutions, the existing (Basel II) stand -
ardised approach will be maintained as a sim -
plified approach.
Credit valuation adjustment 
risk
The credit value adjustment (CVA) framework is 
aimed at OTC derivatives. These harbour not 
only market risk, but also credit risk. If, for ex -
ample, the credit quality of the derivative coun -
terparty worsens, this negatively affects the 
value of the derivative. In order to measure this 
relationship between market risk and credit 
risk, one looks at the difference in value be -
tween two portfolios: a credit- risk- free port -
folio and an identical portfolio that takes into 
account potentially changing creditworthiness. 
This difference in value is called the CVA. Credit 
institutions are required to measure the risk of 
a change in CVA values (CVA risk). As described 
above, a change in CVA values can be caused 
by a change in the credit quality of the coun -
terparty (credit risk), by a change in the abso -
lute price of the derivative (market risk), or by a 
combination of the two.
During the financial crisis, banks incurred sig -
nificant CVA losses, and it was therefore de -
cided to introduce a capital requirement for 
CVA in the Basel III framework. Therefore, bar -
ring some exceptions, capital must be held 
against CVA risk for all OTC derivatives. This 
framework has now been revised. One of the 
aims was to establish methodological consist -
ency with the FRTB. In future, procedures based on internal models will no longer be permitted 
for calculating the CVA capital requirement.
The standardised approach for CVA is consist -
ent with the standardised approach used in the 
aforementioned revised market risk framework 
(FRTB). It is intended for banks with a more so -
phisticated derivatives portfolio. In particular, 
this approach must be approved by the compe -
tent supervisory authorities. While the current 
CVA framework already takes into account 
hedges of derivatives’ credit risk, the new CVA 
framework also recognises hedges of deriva -
tives’ market risk.
The basic approach is intended as a method of 
calculating the CVA capital requirement for in -
stitutions that are not authorised to use the 
standardised approach. It is relatively easy to 
implement and uses data that have already 
been determined for the calculation of coun -
terparty credit risk and which, therefore, are 
already  available to credit institutions. With re -
gard to CVA hedges, credit risk hedges are only 
taken into account under certain conditions, 
whereas market risk hedges are (on the other 
hand) not recognised at all.
The simplified method is intended for institu -
tions whose aggregate notional amount of 
non- centrally cleared derivatives is less than 
€100 billion. These institutions can set their 
CVA capital equal to 100% of the bank’s cap -
ital requirement for counterparty credit risk. 
The capital requirements for counterparty 
credit risk are thereby doubled. A bank’s rele -
vant supervisory authority can, however, re -
move this option if CVA risk materially contrib -
utes to the bank’s overall risk.Standardised

Output floor: minimum 
 capital requirement
When institutions calculate their risks with in -
ternal models rather than supervisory standard -
ised methods, they can usually reduce their 
regulatory capital requirement. This is intended 
to create incentives for banks to improve their 
internal risk management. The calculation of 
RWAs based on internal models usually leads to 
lower capital requirements than under the 
standardised approach, especially for low- risk 
exposures. As banks hold different portfolios, 
the RWAs determined for the same exposure 
class differ from one bank to another (desired 
variability). At the same time, banks have con -
siderable room for discretion when using their 
internal models. If institutions make use of this 
to unduly reduce their capital requirements, 
this constitutes unwarranted variability of 
RWAs. Furthermore, internal models can also 
impede the comparability of capital require -
ments between institutions and jurisdictions if 
the calculated RWAs for the same or similar 
risks turn out to vary excessively.
Supervisors limit unwarranted variability by 
means of approval inspections and ongoing 
monitoring.13 Furthermore, some members of 
the Basel Committee advocated restricting the 
potential capital benefit gained from the use of 
internal models by imposing an output floor in 
order to limit the variability of RWAs and thus 
ensure a minimum capital level in the banking 
system. However, the output floor has the 
shortcoming of limiting both desired and un -
warranted RWA variability.
The output floor set by the Basel Committee 
following intense negotiations defines, on the 
basis of the standardised approaches of the 
 Basel III framework, a lower bound for the 
RWAs that must be backed by regulatory cap -
ital. It only concerns institutions that use in -
ternal models for the calculation of credit and/ 
or market risk. Under the output floor, the 
RWAs of an institution must amount to at least 
72.5% of the RWAs that would be calculated if the entire portfolio of the institution had been 
assessed solely using standardised approaches. 
The capital benefit that a bank using internal 
models can derive relative to the standardised 
approaches is therefore limited to 27.5%. The 
output floor is calculated at the level of the 
bank as a whole. When calculating the output 
floor, all risk categories are therefore included, 
irrespective of whether an internal model is 
authorised  or not. This is why the regulatory 
framework refers to it as an “aggregate” out -
put floor.
In the calibration of the output floor, it was im -
portant that regulation should not unduly ham -
per incentives for the use of internal models 
and thus for risk- oriented governance in bank -
ing business. Here, it should be borne in mind 
that the leverage ratio, similarly to the output 
floor, also limits the leeway for modelling. The 
leverage ratio is a non- risk- based instrument 
that captures all exposures without any prior 
risk weighting. The impact of an output floor 
cannot be viewed in isolation, but must be 
considered in conjunction with the leverage 
ratio. It is conceivable, for example, that the 
output floor increases RWAs but does not lead Motivation for 
an output floor

to any additional capital requirements because 
the leverage ratio imposes higher capital re -
quirements which already cover the require -
ments set by the output floor.
The output floor is not a completely new con -
cept. Already under the Basel II framework, 
which for the first time enabled the use of in -
ternal models to calculate risk, a minimum for 
regulatory capital was defined on the basis of 
the capital requirement under Basel I or the 
standardised approach under Basel II (excluding 
market risk). This arrangement has now been 
revised on the basis of the new standardised 
approaches.
Leverage ratio
The leverage ratio was incorporated into the 
regulatory framework in the first part of  Basel III 
in 2010. The leverage ratio is a non- risk based 
measure which is intended to limit the build- up 
of bank leverage. Especially in crisis situations, 
excessive leverage at banks can lead to desta -
bilising deleveraging processes. This, in turn, 
can initially harm individual institutions, but ul -
timately also the financial system as a whole 
and the real economy.
So far, the leverage ratio has not been a bind -
ing minimum requirement. Institutions only 
needed to report it to supervisors and to pub -
licly disclose it. According to the Basel frame -
work, the leverage ratio will be introduced as 
binding from 2018 onwards. All banks will then 
be expected to have a leverage ratio of at least 
3%. The leverage ratio will complement the 
risk- based capital requirements and ensure a 
minimum level of capital at banks, regardless of 
risk levels. In the Basel III framework, the lever -
age ratio is therefore termed a non- risk- based 
“backstop” measure that is intended to re -
inforce risk- based capital requirements, which 
remain the primary instrument of the solvency 
rules governing banks.The leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of a 
bank’s Tier 1 capital to its total leverage expos -
ure (exposure measure). This measure encom -
passes all on- and off- balance sheet exposures.
In the context of finalising Basel III, a possible 
exception for central bank reserves was in -
cluded in the leverage ratio framework. From 
2022 onwards, the competent authorities can 
decide in the case of exceptional macroeco -
nomic circumstances to exempt central bank 
reserves from the leverage ratio exposure 
measure on a temporary basis. This is intended 
to ensure the proper functioning of central 
banks’ monetary policy in these exceptional cir -
cumstances. However, the competent supervis -
ory authority must then, in turn, raise the gen -
eral leverage ratio requirement in order to 
maintain banks’ resilience to crises at the same 
level as before the exemption.
As part of finalising Basel III, an additional lever -
age ratio buffer for G-  SIBs was introduced. In 
addition to maintaining a minimum leverage 
ratio, as of 2022 they must, pursuant to the 
new rules agreed in December 2017, also main -
tain a leverage ratio buffer whose size depends 
on the degree of the systemic importance of 
these institutions. The methodology applied in 
the risk- based capital requirements is used for 
determining systemic importance.14 The lever -
age ratio buffer for G-  SIBs is then set at 50% of 
their risk- based capital buffer. For example, a 
bank that is required to hold a 2% risk-  based 
G- SIB capital buffer would also need to hold a 
leverage ratio buffer of 1% in addition to the 
3% minimum leverage ratio requirement (ie a 
total of 4%). G-  SIBs must meet the leverage 
ratio buffer with Tier 1 capital. As in the case of 
the risk- based capital requirements, capital dis -
tribution constraints will be activated in the 
leverage  ratio framework if a G-  SIB does not 
fully meet its additional leverage ratio buffer re -
quirement.Revision of the

Implementation deadlines
A partly staggered phase- in period over several 
years is planned for the implementation of 
 Basel III. The rules on the CRSA, the IRB ap -
proach, operational risk and the leverage ratio 
buffer for G-  SIBs are to be applied in full from 
1 January 2022. This also applies to the market 
risk rules already agreed at the beginning of 
2016, whose implementation was postponed 
by three years until 1 January 2022. The output 
floor is to be introduced gradually over a period 
of five years and will apply at the full level of 
72.5% as of 1 January 2027. During this phase- 
in period, the increase in RWAs resulting from 
the floor can, at national discretion, be capped 
at 25% of a bank’s RWAs before the applica -
tion of the floor. Furthermore, institutions must 
disclose the amount of their RWAs for credit 
and market risk on the basis of the standard -
ised approaches. This is intended to allow mar -
ket participants to compare capital require -
ments determined using internal models with 
those determined using standardised ap -
proaches.
In addition, the Basel Committee will, after the 
implementation of the floor, carry out further 
quantitative and qualitative assessments of the 
effectiveness of the reform package in terms of reducing RWA variability. Furthermore, the vari -
ability of the RWAs estimated by the banks will 
be monitored in the context of a peer review 
and benchmarking process, as will the counter -
measures taken by the supervisory authorities 
to tackle unwarranted variability in the RWA 
calculation results.
The Basel III package of reforms is to be re -
garded as positive on the whole. While internal 
models are constrained by the new rules, 
 Basel III remains a risk- sensitive approach over -
all. The long phase- in period up to and includ -
ing 2026 gives institutions sufficient time to 
adapt to the new rules. Implementing the 
stricter rules will pose a challenge for German 
institutions, but their sound capital base and 
the extended phase- in period should make it a 
manageable task.15 It is important that all 
member countries in the Basel Committee im -
plement the agreed standards consistently. The 
GHOS members have explicitly endorsed this 
expectation.16 Basel III should therefore be im -
plemented in full in European law, and as 
quickly as possible.
