Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Economic data for industry were disappointing 
for the second consecutive month. This does 
not indicate an interruption of the upswing 
process, but its underlying pace is slower than 
would be suggested by looking in isolation at 
the quarterly growth rate of gross domestic 
product (GDP) for the fourth quarter of 2014. 
This is borne out not only by the fact that 
 sentiment in trade and industry is still muted 
despite a distinct recovery, but also by orders 
received by industry faltering in the first two 
months of the year. Economic growth may 
nonetheless be described as quite strong, prob -
ably still being driven mainly by private con -
sumption. This is implied at least by the strong 
increase in retail sales. The exceptionally posi -
tive consumer climate, which is based on the 
encouraging labour market situation and sub -
stantial increases in real wages, holds out the 
promise of this development persisting for 
some time to come.
Industry
Industrial output rose by ½% in February com -
pared with the January level, which had under -
gone significant downward revision and been 
depressed by a “bridge day” effect. Both months 
taken together were, on average, slightly up on 
the previous quarter by ¼%. Output of inter -
mediate goods increased by 1%, while capital 
goods production remained virtually unchanged. 
By contrast, output of consumer goods de -
clined by 1%.
Orders received by German industry in February 
remained a seasonally adjusted 1% below their 
already depressed level of January. On average, 
both months were 1¾% down on the final 
quarter of 2014. One key reason for this is that a comparatively small number of large orders, 
especially for export, have been received since 
the beginning of 2015. If large orders are 
 excluded, there was likewise a decline (-¾%), 
however. Export orders declined by 2¼% over -
all. The drop in demand from the euro area 
(-4%) was larger than than that from non- euro- 
area countries (-1¼%) and domestically (-¾), 
chiefly because of the relatively low volume of 
orders for the aircraft and aerospace industry. 
Overall, orders for intermediate goods and for 
capital goods fell by 1¾% and 2% respectively. 
By contrast, consumer goods recorded a 
growth in orders of 1%.
After seasonal adjustment, industrial sales in 
February were up slightly by ½% on the month. 
However, January and February showed an in -
crease of 1¼% on average compared with the 
final quarter of 2014. Export business saw an 
increase of almost 2%, with growth in the euro 
area (+1¾%) being almost as steep as that in 
non- euro- area countries (+2%). This contrasted 
with only a marginal increase in sales in Ger -
many (+½%). Exports of goods picked up again 
in February (+1½%) and, taking the average of 
the first two months of the year, maintained 
the high level of the previous quarter in spite of 
the weak figure for January. Imports in Febru -
ary likewise showed a marked increase on the 
month (+1¾%), a considerable role being 
played by a rise in import prices compared with 
January. In nominal terms, January and Febru -
ary together were only slightly up (+½%) on 
the final quarter of 2014; there was a substan -
tial increase in real terms, however, owing to 
the marked decline in prices since the autumn.
Construction
Construction output in February was down by 
a seasonally adjusted 3% on its level in January, 
which had undergone sharp downward revi -
sion. Even so, output on an average of January Upswing process

and February was 2¼% up on the final quarter 
of 2014. The exceptionally mild winter weather 
at the beginning of the year played a key role 
in this respect. There was an increase of 1¼% 
in the main construction industry, and finishing 
trades were up by 3¼%. New orders in the 
main construction sector in January showed a 
considerable rise on the final quarter of 2014 
(+10½%), above all owing to the weather. 
There was an exceptionally strong increase in 
demand from the public sector, although com -
mercial and housing construction orders picked 
up, too.
Labour market
Employment continued to rise in February. The 
seasonally adjusted number of persons in work 
in Germany was up by 28,000 on the month. 
The year- on- year increase was 384,000, or 
0.9%. According to the provisional figures of 
the Federal Employment Agency, which are 
perhaps overstated owing to changes in the 
 reporting method, the number of employees 
subject to social security contributions saw a 
very steep increase in January. The annual 
 increase was 585,000, or 2.0%. By contrast, 
exclusively low- paid part- time employment 
 declined significantly. As a result of the new 
general minimum wage, mini- jobs may have 
been converted to some extent into employ -
ment subject to social security contributions. 
Leading indicators for the labour market pub -
lished by Ifo and the Federal Employment 
Agency would suggest that the upturn in em -
ployment is continuing.
Unemployment declined again in March. In 
seasonally adjusted terms, the number of per -
sons officially registered as unemployed fell by 
15,000 on the month and the unemployment 
rate fell to 6.4%. This represents a fall of 
123,000 on the year. Seasonally adjusted 
underemployment (excluding short- time work) 
was also down on the month. Although the 
labour market barometer of the Institute for 
Employment Research (IAB) declined in March, Continued

it is signalling a further slight reduction in un -
employment for the next few months.
Prices
Following a significant decrease in the first two 
weeks of March, crude oil prices were moving 
upwards again in the second half of the month. 
Prices were tending to increase further in the 
first half of April. As this report went to press, 
the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil stood at 
US$62½. The premium on crude oil futures 
was US$2¾ for deliveries six months ahead 
and US$4½ 12 months ahead.
Import prices in February showed a distinct 
 increase on the month in seasonally adjusted 
terms. This was essentially a result of the higher 
cost of energy due to the hike in crude oil 
prices. Moreover, prices of other goods went 
up owing to the depreciation of the euro. By 
contrast, domestic producer prices remained 
unchanged, as energy price inflation was offset 
by falling prices for other goods. The year- on- 
year decline contracted significantly to 3.0% in 
the case of import prices and only marginally to 
2.1% for industrial producer prices. Excluding 
energy, annual inflation in the case of import 
prices rose to 1.9%; for consumer goods it was 
as much as 2.8%.
Seasonally adjusted consumer prices showed a 
moderate increase of 0.2% in March compared 
with the previous month. There was a marked 
rise in the cost of energy and other industrial 
goods. On the other hand, food prices re -
mained virtually unchanged. Prices for services 
moderated after showing a marked acceler -
ation in the previous month. This mainly re -
flected an unusual seasonal pattern in the case 
of package holidays. Annual inflation as meas -
ured by the national consumer price index (CPI) 
rose to +0.3% and likewise turned positive at 
+0.1% as defined in the Harmonised Index of 
Consumer Prices (HICP). Excluding energy, the 
annual CPI figure was still 1.0% and HICP infla -
tion edged up from 0.9% to 1.0% as well.Public finances1
Local government finances
In 2014, local government recorded a deficit of 
€½ billion (including off- budget entities, whose 
reporting group was expanded to include spe -
cial- purpose associations). Compared with the 
preceding year’s surplus of €1½ billion, this 
equates to a deterioration of €2 billion.2 Over -
all, revenue rose sharply by 4½% (€9 billion). 
Growth in tax revenue amounted to 3½% 
(€2½ billion), with shares in income tax (+6½%) 
making the key contribution to this total. By 
contrast, after deducting the revenue shares 
accruing to other government levels, local busi -
ness tax receipts were only moderately up on 
the year (+1½%). All in all, general grants from 
state government, which are linked to federal 
states’ tax revenue, increased significantly by 
7% (€2 billion). Revenue from fees was also up 
markedly by 4% (€1 billion).
At +5½% (+€11½ billion), the rise in expend -
iture was even higher. The increase of just over 
5% (€3 billion) in personnel expenditure could, 
in large part, be traced back to the pay agree -
ment concluded in spring 2014 but also to the 
expansion of personnel, particularly in the area 
of day care for small children, which appears to 
be ongoing. Other operating expenditure rose 
by as much as 6% (€3 billion). In addition, 
spending on social benefits increased sharply 
by 6% (€2½ billion). The driving factors here 
included, in particular, higher spending on so -
cial assistance and assistance for young people 
as well as on asylum seekers. By contrast, the 
accommodation costs financed by local gov -Crude oil prices

1 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
general government budget trends during the preceding 
quarter. For detailed statistical data on budgetary develop -
ments and public debt, see the statistical section of this 
report.
2 This deterioration and the changes in revenue and ex -
penditure described in the rest of this commentary had lit -
tle to do with the change in the reporting group. The Fed -
eral Statistical Office largely reconstructed the  reporting 
group for the purposes of the year- on- year comparison.Deutsche Bundesbank

ernment for persons receiving the basic allow -
ance for job seekers due to unemployment 
rose at a very moderate pace in the light of a 
further fall in cases. Fixed asset formation 
climbed significantly by 9½% (€2 billion) in 
2014. This upswing was observed in almost all 
federal states. However, it is likely that local 
governments with budgets that are under par -
ticular strain have continued to act in a some -
what more  restrained manner given strict 
budgetary rules.
Besides already making €1 billion in relief avail -
able by raising turnover tax revenue and elevat -
ing central government’s contribution to ac -
commodation costs for recipients of unemploy -
ment benefit II (welfare- related benefit), the 
Federal Government’s plans for 2015 include 
providing an additional €½ billion from turn -
over tax receipts to finance increased expenses 
in connection with asylum seekers and grant -
ing investment subsidies to financially weak 
local governments by setting up a special fund to which €3½ billion is to be allocated. How -
ever, outflows from the latter could be fairly 
limited this year due to the lead time involved. 
Even if targeted aid for financially ailing local 
governments’ infrastructure measures could be 
deemed necessary, the special fund planned by 
the Federal Government does not appear to be 
the best way to provide this aid as, in the ab -
sence of general exceptional circumstances, 
pursuant to Article 104 b of the German consti -
tution, the funds may only be used in the rela -
tively limited areas subject to the legislative 
 authority of central government. All in all, local 
government budgets could be broadly balanced 
in 2015 as, in addition to the aforementioned 
relief, further burdens from the 2014 pay agree -
ment are on the horizon and spending is set to 
continue to rise perceptibly, not least in the 
case of social benefits. In conjunction with fur -
ther measures set to provide €1½ billion in 
 relief that have now been announced by cen -
tral government for 2017 and that, as has been 
intended for some time, are to be further in -
creased by a significant amount (now by an -
other €2½ billion in net terms) in 2018, it 
should then be possible for local governments 
to record surpluses or, at the very least, further 
marked rises in investment spending.
The Federal Statistical Office published figures 
for debt attributable to local government core 
budgets and off- budget entities (including spe -
cial- purpose associations as of 2014) totalling 
€143½ billion at the end of 2014.3 While this 
barely moved the needle in quarter- on- quarter 
terms, year- on- year growth amounted to €6 
billion. However, the bulk of this increase was 
probably caused by the reporting group being 
expanded to include special- purpose associ -
ations belonging to the general government 
sector. The volume of cash advances – which, 
according to legal provisions, are only intended 
for bridging short- term liquidity shortfalls  –
hardly changed on balance over the course of 
2014 and stood at a very high level of €49½ bil -Annual result

lion at the end of the year. On the one hand, 
this reflects the various relief programmes im -
plemented in individual states. But some parts 
of this debt have apparently also simply been 
converted into credit market debt with a long- 
term interest rate lock- in period. Hence, the 
figures for cash advances effectively paint too 
rosy a picture of the situation. On the other 
hand, however, the volume of these cash 
 advances remained on a sharp upward trajec -
tory for many local governments. In terms of 
those federal states with particularly high local 
government cash advances per capita,  Hesse 
recorded a slight year- on- year decline after its 
local governments were able to more than 
halve their high overall deficit in 2014. By con -
trast, deficits escalated significantly in other 
federal states where local government budgets 
have been especially strained for some years. 
This was only partially reflected in develop -
ments in cash advances, however. While their 
rise remained relatively moderate in Rhineland- 
Palatinate, further marked increases were 
 recorded in North Rhine-  Westphalia and Saar -
land. Many local governments, chiefly in the 
aforementioned states but also in others, still 
need to critically review their budgets and 
promptly take the  necessary steps to ensure 
balanced budgets.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €131.9 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in February 2015 was down on 
the January figure (€141.7 billion). After de -
ducting redemptions, which were also lower 
than in the previous month, and taking ac -
count of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, the outstanding volume of 
domestic bonds increased by €8.2 billion. For -
eign debt securities worth €10.9 billion net 
were placed in the German market, which 
meant that the outstanding volume of debt 
 securities in Germany rose by €19.0 billion 
overall.In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
increased their capital market debt by €5.6 bil -
lion net, compared with €2.3 billion in the pre -
vious month.
Credit institutions issued debt securities worth 
€4.9 billion net in February. On balance, these 
were exclusively debt securities issued by spe -
cialised credit institutions, the outstanding 
 volume of which rose by €12.1 billion. By con -
trast, there were net redemptions of other 
bank debt securities (€5.5 billion), public Pfand -
briefe (€0.9 billion) and mortgage Pfandbriefe 
(€0.7 billion).
In the month under review, the public sector 
reduced its holdings of bond market liabilities 
by €2.4 billion. This was attributable primarily 
to central government (including the resolution 
agency which is classified as part of it), which 
redeemed securities worth €8.1 billion net. It 
mainly reduced the outstanding volume of five- 
year Federal notes (Bobls) (€13.3 billion), while Higher out -

it chiefly issued ten- year Federal bonds (Bunds) 
(€5.1 billion) as well as two- year Federal Treas -
ury notes (Schätze) (€4.4 billion). State and 
local government issued debt securities worth 
€5.8 billion net.
Domestic non- banks were virtually the only 
buyers of debt securities in February, stepping 
up their purchases by €30.2 billion; this involved 
predominantly foreign paper on balance. By 
contrast, non- resident investors sold German 
bonds worth €7.1 billion. Domestic credit insti -
tutions reduced their bond holdings by €4.8 bil -
lion, with the focus mainly on foreign paper.
Equity market
In the reporting month, new shares worth €0.1 
billion were issued in the German equity mar -
ket. In addition, the outstanding volume of 
 foreign shares in the German equity market 
rose by €2.3 billion. Non- resident investors 
dominated the buyers’ side of the market in 
February, purchasing €6.4 billion worth of 
shares. Domestic non- banks acquired equities 
for €1.0 billion. By contrast, German credit insti -
tutions reported net sales totalling €5.0 billion.
Mutual funds
In February, domestic mutual funds once again 
recorded very high inflows (€19.2 billion fol -
lowing €21.9 billion in January 2015). This 
benefited mainly specialised funds reserved for 
institutional investors (€15.1 billion). Among 
the asset classes, mixed securities- based funds 
in particular recorded substantial inflows 
(€8.8 billion), as did bond- based funds (€3.8 
billion) and share- based funds (€3.3 billion). 
Foreign mutual funds sold fund shares worth 
€5.4 billion in the German market. Domestic 
non- banks were virtually the only buyers of 
mutual fund shares on balance (€21.3 billion). 
Foreign investors and German credit institu -
tions acquired mutual fund shares to the tune 
of €2.5 billion and €0.8 billion, respectively.Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus of €16.6 billion in February 2015. This was 
€0.8 billion up on the January level. A marked 
increase in the goods account surplus was the 
main contributing factor, although this was 
largely offset by the reduction in the invisible 
current transactions balance comprising ser -
vices as well as primary and secondary income.
In February, the surplus in the goods account 
rose by €4.0 billion to €19.5 billion, with 
growth in exports of goods proving signifi -
cantly stronger than the rise in imports of 
goods.
In February, Germany recorded a deficit of €2.8 
billion in invisible current transactions, com -
pared with a surplus of €0.3 billion one month 
earlier. The chief reason for this turnaround 
was the €3.3 billion rise in the secondary in -
come deficit to €7.6 billion, which mainly arose 
from higher payments to the EU budget. By 
contrast, the balances of both the services and 
the primary income accounts remained virtually 
unchanged. Net receipts on primary income 
rose by €0.2 billion to €7.2 billion. This was 
triggered, in particular, by the fact that, follow -
ing a steep rise in January, there was a sharper 
decline in dividend payments to foreign invest -
ors than in domestic revenue from portfolio

German securities to the tune of €1.7 billion

In February, direct investment generated net

enterprises increased their investment abroad 
by €14.7 billion, while foreign investment in 
Germany came to an additional €6.0 billion on 
balance. Domestic investors increased their 
 activity abroad by €9.9 billion, of which €4.1 
billion constituted reinvested earnings. At €4.8 
billion, intra- group credit transactions also con -
tributed to the growth in German direct invest -
ment abroad. Non- resident investors bolstered 
their equity capital in Germany by €2.0 billion, 
providing €3.9 billion worth of additional loans 
to affiliated enterprises located there.
Other statistically recorded investment, com -
prising loans and trade credits (where these do 
not constitute direct investment) as well as 
bank deposits and other investments, saw net 
capital exports of €2.0 billion in February. This 
largely reflected outflows of funds recorded in 
the banking system, split more or less evenly 
between credit institutions (€6.8 billion net) 
and the Bundesbank (€6.1 billion). The net 
 external assets of enterprises and households 
remained more or less at the same level (-€0.1 
billion), while general government experienced 
net inflows of funds from abroad in the amount 
of €10.7 billion. Although the Bundesbank’s 
claims on TARGET2 balances fell somewhat 
(-€1.9 billion), this was more than offset by the 
parallel decline in the Bank’s external liabilities 
(-€8.0 billion).

The evolution of labour market- related 
 government expenditure in Germany
The extremely favourable and persistently robust development of the German labour market since 
the middle of the last decade has significantly eased the strain on public finances, with even the 
severe economic downturn of 2009 ultimately leaving no lasting mark. As a result, labour market- 
related government expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product has contracted from 
4% to 2½% since 2005. The Federal Employment Agency’s spending on unemployment benefit I 
and active labour market policy measures has fallen significantly, consequently making it possible 
to cut the contribution rate from 6.5% to 3.0%. Labour market- related expenditure by central 
government (the basic allowance for job seekers, in particular) initially rose markedly following 
the entry into force of the Hartz IV reform in 2005 but has been in steady decline since 2009. On 
the whole, the financial strain on local government budgets has also eased considerably.
The Federal Employment Agency may currently be recording surpluses, but a further reduction in 
the contribution rate would, at most, only appear financially manageable if the present extremely 
favourable labour market situation and the exceedingly low number of unemployment benefit I 
recipients were to prove sustainable. Irrespective of this, it would also be possible to cut the con -
tribution rate if central government were to assume financial responsibility for non- insurance-  
related benefits, which are financed through contributions at the current juncture. It is occasion -
ally proposed at the European level to fundamentally reform unemployment insurance by intro -
ducing a European unemployment insurance scheme to partially replace national schemes. How -
ever, in order for these proposals to hold water, the economic and socio- political framework of 
the European Union must be harmonised to a more in- depth and fundamental extent, which is 
not currently on the agenda.
At present, there are no signs of further noticeable relief at the central, state and local govern -
ment level with respect to labour market- related spending. The fiscal impact of the statutory 
minimum wage, which was introduced in 2015, hinges on how it affects employment. All other 
things being equal, the wage increases triggered by the minimum wage will lower the need for 
transfer payments by general government and also boost its revenue. On the other hand, how -
ever, if jobs were lost, which would be a particular concern in the event of sharp increases in the 
minimum wage in future, it would also place a strain on public finances.Deutsche Bundesbank

The impact of labour  
market developments on 
public finances1
Developments on the labour market exert a 
considerable influence on government revenue 
and expenditure. For example, tax and social 
contribution receipts fluctuate with employ -
ment, wages and salaries. Expenditure is 
 affected by changes in unemployment, in par -
ticular, with the main expenditure items includ -
ing labour market- related benefits such as un -
employment benefit I (insurance- related bene -
fit), unemployment benefit II (welfare- related 
benefit) and spending in connection with ac -
tive labour market policy measures.
Looking at the overall picture, labour market-  
related government expenditure amounted to 
€88½ billion in 2004 (for information on the 
classification of expenditure, see the box on 
page  15).2 It was chiefly the merger of un -
employment assistance and social assistance to 
create the basic allowance for job seekers that 
initially drove this expenditure to €91½ billion 
in 2005, which was largely attributable to a 
higher uptake by persons able to work who 
were generally already entitled to social assis -
tance. However, this was followed by a marked 
underlying trend decline, which was only inter -
rupted by a brief spike in 2009 as a conse -
quence of the financial and economic crisis. At 
last report, labour market- related expenditure 
totalled around €73 billion, meaning that it has 
contracted sharply as a percentage of gross 
 domestic product (GDP) from 4% to 2½% over 
the past ten years.
The Institute for Employment Research (IAB) 
takes a different approach to calculating the 
fiscal costs of unemployment.3 First, it factors 
in the tax and social contribution revenue esti -
mated to be lost as a result of unemployment. 
Second, compared with the aforementioned 
calculations, expenditure is defined more nar -
rowly, and spending on non-  registered (long-  
term) unemployed persons is not taken into 
account.4 Using this method, a drop in fiscal costs was recorded immediately after the 
Hartz IV reform as far back as 2005. Expend -
iture-  related and revenue- related costs calcu -
lated in this manner virtually halved as a per -
centage of GDP from almost 4% in 2005 to 2% 
in 2013. Here too, the temporary resurgence 
observed in 2009 and 2010 only briefly over -
shadowed the general downward trend.
This article will focus on the evolution of labour 
market- related government expenditure and 
the range of variables in play since 2005, the 
year in which the Hartz  IV reform entered 
into force. In addition to spending by the Fed -
eral Employment Agency, which is generally 
 financed through contributions, the spotlight 
will also shine, in particular, on the tax- financed 
basic allowance for job seekers and other asso -
ciated benefits, as well as the labour market 
policy measures implemented at the central, 
state and local government level. It will go on 
to also explore the revenue side of the un -
employment insurance scheme organised by 
the Federal  Employment Agency, before pre -
senting the  financial cross- connections be -
tween the Federal Employment Agency and 
central, state and local government budgets 
with respect to  labour market- related benefits.Labour market

ment’s contribution to local government expenditure on 
accommodation, are factored out of the overall review.

4 The IAB only examines how public finances are affected 
by factors directly associated with registered unemploy -
ment. Consequently, in contrast to the definition used 
here, expenditure such as spending on participants in train -
ing schemes and on recipients of unemployment benefit II 
who are employed (“income boosters”) or not registered as 
unemployed and cohabiting social allowance recipients is 
disregarded. According to IAB calculations, around 57% of 
costs (€32 billion) was attributable to  expenditure and 43% 
(€24 billion) to revenue in 2013.Deutsche Bundesbank

The classifi  cation of labour market-related expenditure
Labour market- related expenditure is pri-
marily understood here as the total expend-
iture by the Federal Employment Agency as 
well as expenditure by the central, state and local governments (especially the for-
mer and the latter) on the basic allowance 
for job seekers and other associated active 
labour market policy benefi  ts or measures.1 
In this respect, the scope of benefi  ts associ-
ated with the basic allowance not only 
comprises monetary transfers to recipients 
of unemployment benefi  t II who are able to 
work, but also the social allowance for  dependants living in the same household who are unable to work (particularly chil-dren). Unemployment benefi  t II recipients 
also include persons who are not registered 
as unemployed, but who, for reasons of childcare, nursing care, illness or training, are usually temporarily unavailable to the  labour market, or those who take up em-
ployment but receive means- tested top- up 
benefi  ts.
The basic allowance comprises the standard 
fi  nancial need as well as contributions to 
health and long- term care insurance schemes,
2 the assumption of rent costs of 
an appropriate level including heating costs
3 and other additional needs. Until 
2010, it also included a staggered add-itional payment after the switch from 
 unemployment benefi  t I. In connection with 
the basic allowance, expenses related to 
the active labour market policy of (re)inte-
grating the long- term unemployed and ad-
ministrative costs associated with support 
are also incurred.
Finally, labour market- related expenditure 
also comprises other needs- based expend-
iture by central, state and local govern-
ments which is closely related to unemploy-ment benefi  t II. This includes the additional 
children’s allowance, also introduced in 2005, which aims to prevent low- income 
families from claiming unemployment bene-
fi  t II solely to meet the needs of their chil-
dren. It also includes the education and in-
tegration allowances introduced in 2011, 
which fi  nance primarily non- fi  nancial bene-fi  ts in the area of school and leisure for chil-
dren and young people who normally 
 receive the basic allowance.4
When interpreting the fi  gures, it should be 
noted that the classifi  cation made here does not solely consider government ex-penditure directly infl  uenced by develop-ments on the labour market, since basic  allowances for persons able to work but 
temporarily unavailable to the labour mar-
ket are also included, for example. Benefi  ts for family members who are unable to work 
(social allowance recipients) are also taken 
into account, given that their needs are  related to the income situation of un-
employment benefi  t II recipients living in the same household.
1 In 2004, ie before the introduction of the basic 
 allowance (Hartz IV reform), this comprised, in addition 
to unemployment assistance, the estimated benefi  ts as 
well as the reintegration and administrative costs borne by central, state and local governments for 
 recipients of a housing allowance and social assistance 
who were able to work. Following the reform, these 
expenses were integrated into the basic allowance. In 
2005, outstanding expiring unemployment assistance 
payments were incurred.2 Central government also initially made contributions 
to the statutory pension insurance scheme for un-employment benefi  t II recipients. These contributions 
were effectively halved in 2007, and completely abol-ished in 2011.
3 Pursuant to section 22 of the Second Book of the 
Social Security Code (SGB II).
4 These benefi  ts are also available to children in low- 
income families who are in receipt of a housing allow-ance or additional children’s allowance.Deutsche Bundesbank

The financial development 
of the Federal Employment 
Agency
Responsibility for the statutory unemployment 
insurance scheme in Germany lies with the Fed -
eral Employment Agency (see the box below 
for the debate surrounding a European un -
employment insurance scheme). In particular, 
temporary wage substitutes in the event of un -
employment and active labour market policy 
measures are, as a general rule, financed 
equally by employees and employers in the 
form of contribution payments. The Federal 
Employment Agency’s finances have been sub -
ject to major fluctuations in the past. After over 
a decade dominated by deficits, which were 
very high in some instances, and a broadly bal -
anced budget in 2005, sizeable surpluses were 
initially recorded in 2006 and 2007. However, 
the crisis then sent the deficits higher still in 
2009 and 2010, and the reserves that had been 
built up previously were fully depleted. The Federal Employment Agency has since recorded 
slight surpluses, which have been edging up -
wards in recent times. However, to look solely 
at the bottom line would be to ignore a funda -
mental improvement in the Federal Employ -
ment Agency’s finances over the past ten years 
on the back of both positive labour market 
 developments and a generally muted spending 
policy. Against this favourable backdrop, the 
contribution rate has swiftly and incrementally 
contracted by more than half from 6.5% to 
3.0% (see the annex on legislative changes on 
pages 28 to 33). Overall, this shrank the Federal 
Employment Agency’s revenue by almost 5% 
and its expenditure by almost 5½% on an an -Federal Employ-
ment Agency’s financial  situation  significantly  improved since 2005
Comments on a European unemployment insurance scheme
Discussions on institutional reforms in the EU 
 occasionally elicit a proposal to shift some of the 
tasks of national unemployment insurance 
schemes to a European unemployment insur-ance scheme.
1 The objective is to share the 
 fi  nancial burden – which varies from country to country owing to differing developments in un-employment – across the EU or the euro area. A 
levelling of structural differences would be ac-companied by longer- term transfers between the countries. However, it appears that this 
would only be worthy of consideration if social 
and economic policy were also fundamentally centralised at the European level, as national 
 decisions would otherwise have a strong fi  nan-
cial impact on other member states. But as there 
is currently no majority to go down that path, the proposals focus more on the potential to  improve economic stabilisation by means of a 
cross- border balancing system. This holds the 
promise of better cushioning the impact of 
asymmetric shocks on unemployment in individ-ual countries.
However, if a country has sound public fi  nances, 
it would currently not be problematic for it to cover cyclical fi  nancing requirements at the na-
tional level by depleting reserves or borrowing 
and then correspondingly replenishing the  reserves or repaying the loans in better times. 
The European budgetary rules are also based on 
cyclically adjusted budget balances and there-
fore do not stand in the way of cyclically induced 
fl  uctuations in the budgets of national un-
employment insurance schemes (automatic sta-
bilisers). Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that although, in principle, the proposals aimed 
at improving economic stabilisation do not 
 envisage any permanent structural transfers be-
tween countries, doubts have been raised from 
a practical viewpoint  – not least regarding whether, for example, enough can be done to 
counteract the incentives for individual countries 
to interpret uniform insurance conditions more 
freely. All in all, as things currently stand, the 
proposals for a European unemployment insur-
ance scheme appear to hold no water.

table on page 18).5
Expenditure
The Federal Employment Agency’s expenditure 
is dominated by unemployment benefit I, which 
accounted for approximately half of its budget 
in 2014. Roughly one- fifth was spent on active 
labour market policy measures (preparatory 
 vocational training and advanced vocational 
training, in particular), while around one-  
quarter was set aside for administrative costs 
(about one- sixth in net terms if central govern -
ment’s refunds for transferred administrative 
functions are deducted).
The Federal Employment Agency’s spending on 
both unemployment benefit I and active labour 
market policy measures has fallen by an aver -
age of around 6% per annum  since 2005. The 
drop in unemployment benefit I had more or 
less levelled off by 2008 (see adjacent chart). 
Expenditure picked up again in the crisis year of 
2009 before returning to its previous low level. 
Spending on unemployment benefit I has thus 
halved to ½% of GDP at last count, primarily 
on account of the dwindling number of recipi -
ents of unemployment benefit I, which shrank 
from 1.7 million in 2005 to below 1 million in 
2008. Since then, it has only ever edged above 
the million mark in 2009 and 2010, when pay -Bulk of spending

Reserves5 This does not take into account the pension fund for civil 
servants at the Federal Employment Agency, which was set 
up in 2008. Contributions calculated in actuarial terms are 
transferred to this fund for current civil servants out of the 
Federal Employment Agency’s budget. It also received one- 
off allocations totalling €2.5 billion in the year it was estab -
lished. At the same time, the fund has assumed current 
expenditure for pensions and retired civil servants’ health -
care subsidies. Although contributions currently outstrip 
payments, this is set to reverse. The Federal Employment 
Agency is no longer awarding civil servant status to its em -
ployees, and the pension reserve should be fully  depleted 
in the latter half of the century. The calculation hinges on 
the anticipated return on fund capital, which is managed 
by the Bundesbank. Owing to the persistent low- interest-  
rate environment, the “allocation rate” (actuarial contribu -
tion rate as a percentage of pensionable remuneration) 
was raised from 60% to 80% with effect from 1 January 
2015. The capital stock totalled just over €4½ billion at the 
end of 2014.Deutsche Bundesbank

ments of short- time working benefits, in par -
ticular, increased very significantly (see the 
chart on page 19). Cuts in the maximum period 
of entitlement (initially from 32 to 18 months 
from 2006 and finally back up to 24 months 
from 2008) also drove down the number of 
 recipients.6 Spending per benefit recipient has, 
on average, only risen by just over 1% per an -
num amid quite substantial fluctuations.7 What 
this ultimately shows is that cyclical unemploy -
ment has, over time, tended to increasingly 
focus on lower income groups. Spending on 
short- time working benefits, which are nor -
mally insignificant in quantitative terms and can 
be regarded as a special form of unemploy -
ment benefit I or, to some extent, as its replace -
ment in times of crisis, spiked in 2009 and 
2010 and was amplified further still by govern -
ment intervention measures – chief among 
them extending maximum periods of entitle -
ment and refunding social contributions, the 
onus of which is normally on employers.In the area of active labour market policy, 
 expenditure fell somewhat more steadily over 
the overall observation period. While spending 
likewise increased in this area in the crisis year 
of 2009, it resumed its downward path in the 
ensuing period before bottoming out, it would 
appear, in 2013. All in all, spending on active 
labour market policy measures has moved 
largely in tandem with unemployment benefit I 
and, thus, with unemployment as a whole.8… and on

6 As a general rule, unemployment benefit I is paid out for 
a maximum of 12 months. On reaching 50, 55 and 58 
years of age, this rises to 15, 18 and 24 months  respectively 
(section 147 of the Third Book of the Social Security Code 
(SGB III) ).
7 Unemployment benefit I is generally set at 60% of the 
recipient’s previous net earned income. If the recipient is 
the parent or guardian of at least one child, this rises to 
67% (section 149 of the Third Book of the Social Security 
Code (SGB III)).
8 The reintegration payment, which the Federal Employ -
ment Agency paid to central government to refund half of 
the reintegration benefits and administrative costs for 
 recipients of unemployment benefit II, was completely 
phased out in 2013. At their peak (in 2010), payments to 
central government reached almost €5½ billion.Deutsche Bundesbank

By contrast, administrative costs have risen by 
an average of just under 2% per annum  (cur-
rently totalling just over €7½ billion), with their 
share of expenditure recently hitting 24%. It 
should be noted that the Federal Employment 
Agency also performs administrative functions 
for central government, especially in connec -
tion with support for unemployment benefit II 
recipients. Factoring out refunds paid by cen -
tral government for these services, administra -
tive costs account for 16½% of the corres -
pondingly reduced (net) overall expenditure.9 
The sharp decline in unemployment has 
thus  sent administrative expenditure per un -
employed person significantly higher. On the 
one hand, this implies more intensive support. 
On the other hand, however, this is likely to be 
an area for potential savings that the Federal 
Employment Agency has identified and is 
aiming to tap.10 Another factor contributing to 
the rise in the Federal Employment Agency’s 
administrative expenditure was the decision to 
build up a capital stock to cover future pension 
obligations. In consolidated terms (including 
the pension reserve), spending would have 
risen by 1½% on an annual average.
Above and beyond its core functions, the Fed -
eral Employment Agency also plays a role in 
subsidising phased retirement. Under the state- 
subsidised phased retirement scheme intro -
duced in 1996, the Federal Employment Agency 
reimburses for a maximum of six years the 
 remuneration top-  ups and increased pension 
contributions paid by employers if the vacan -
cies created as a result are filled by either un -Administrative

9 Adjusted for these refunds, administrative costs actually 
climbed by an annual average of 5% between 2005 and 
2014 – but this is attributable, in large part, to the espe -
cially high refund amounts transferred in 2005.
10 For example, the Federal Employment Agency is plan -
ning to cut around 17,000 jobs by 2019 (based on a head -
count of around 107,000 employees at the end of 2014).

These subsidies were discontinued at the end 
of 2009, with expenditure totalling an average 
of just over €1 billion per annum . Phased re -
tirement contracts concluded in or after 2010 
are no longer subsidised by the Federal Em -
ployment Agency, meaning that scarcely any 
spending will be incurred after the end of 2015.
Revenue
The Federal Employment Agency’s revenue 
largely comprises contributions from employ -
ees subject to social security contributions 
(share in 2014: 85%). On top of these, there 
are revenue shares earmarked for insolvency 
benefit and the winter construction subsidy 
(5% altogether) and, in particular, central gov -
ernment’s aforementioned refunds of adminis -
trative costs incurred primarily for supporting 
unemployment benefit II recipients (8½%).12
Revenue patterns were shaped, first and fore -
most, by the gradual reduction in the contribu -
tion rate, which was made possible by the posi -
tive labour market situation characterised by 
rising employment subject to social security 
contributions and shrinking unemployment 
 figures. While remuneration subject to compul -
sory insurance rose by an annual average of 
just over 3% between 2005 and 2014, contri -
bution receipts fell by almost 5½% on an an -
nual average. Besides contribution receipts, sig -
nificant central government grants financed 
through turnover tax, in particular, have occa -
sionally played a role since 2007. Insolvency 
benefit contributions have fluctuated highly er -
ratically. Further to the launch of the second 
economic stimulus package in the crisis year of 
2009, the special contribution rate13 was raised 
significantly from 0.1% to 0.41% in 2010 to 
compensate for a considerable shortfall of 
around €1 billion. Furthermore,  expenditure 
was expected to remain high in 2010 but 
turned out to be substantially lower than an -
ticipated. The contribution rate was subse -
quently set at zero for 2011 in order to run down the surpluses that had accumulated. By 
contrast, central government’s refunds of 
 administrative costs for recipients of unemploy -
ment benefit II climbed very steadily and to -
talled a volume of almost €3 billion in 2014.
Financial relations between 
the Federal Employment 
Agency and the central 
 government budget
In the years up to and including 2006, central 
government was required to offset any deficits 
incurred by the Federal Employment Agency 
with a grant. This last occurred in 2005 (€½ 
billion), after which the Federal Employment 
Agency ran up a considerable surplus of €11 
billion in 2006 – the first surplus since German 
reunification.14 A rule- based central govern -
ment grant was subsequently introduced in 
2007. Following the rise in the standard rate of 
turnover tax by 3 percentage points, it was 
planned for the revenue generated from 1 per -
centage point to be transferred to the Federal Revenue side 
dominated by contributions
Revenue 
 patterns mainly shaped by 
changes in con-
tribution rateCentral govern-
ment grant 
 revised several 
times and ultim-ately abolished
11 Subsidies from the Federal Employment Agency encom -
pass a top- up amounting to 20% of employees’ gross part- 
time remuneration and a top- up to 90% of full- time pen -
sion contributions. In addition, top- up amounts are tax-  
exempt (albeit subject to incremental tax progression).
12 Some benefit recipients fall under the authority of 
 municipalities with separate responsibility for the un -
employed (Optionskommunen) . Under the experimental 
clause in section 6a of the Second Book of the Social 
 Security Code (SGB II) , sole and all- encompassing responsi -
bility for the basic allowance for job seekers was trans -
ferred to these municipalities (initially 69 but later  reduced 
to just 67) on 1 January 2005. Since 1 January 2012, a fur -
ther 41 municipalities have been permitted to establish this 
form of job centre (see the information on the Act on the 
Further Development of the Organisation of the Basic 
 Allowance for Job Seekers (Gesetz zur Weiterentwicklung 
der Organisation der Grundsicherung für Arbeitsuchende)  
in the annex, pp 28-33). These receive separate refunds 
from central government.
13 The contribution rate was set according to each year’s 
financial requirements in the years up to and including 
2012 before a fixed contribution rate of 0.15% of insured 
employees’ remuneration was introduced in 2013. Sur -
pluses and deficits arising from the insolvency benefit and 
the associated contribution are being offset over time via a 
separate reserve.
14 Bringing forward the deadline for the transfer of social 
contributions resulted in social insurance funds receiving 
 almost 13 instead of 12 monthly contributions in 2006. 
This meant that the Federal Employment Agency recorded 
one- off windfall receipts estimated at just over €3 billion.Deutsche Bundesbank

Employment Agency on a permanent basis. At 
its peak in 2009, this grant constituted no less 
than almost a quarter of the Federal Employ -
ment Agency’s total revenue (around €8 bil -
lion). The central government grant was initially 
reduced in 2012 before being abolished al -
together in 2013.
In parallel with the introduction of this rule-  
based central government grant, central gov -
ernment ceased to offset deficits from 2007 
onwards. Deficits run up by the Federal Em -
ployment Agency that cannot be covered by 
reserves now have to be financed using central 
government loans that, while non- interest-  
bearing, are repayable. However, no use has 
hitherto been made of this bridging mechan -
ism. Reserves totalling almost €18 billion had 
initially been built up by the end of 2007, which 
were rapidly depleted once again in 2009 and 
2010, leaving a financial shortfall of just over 
€5 billion in 2010. However, in contravention 
of the new offsetting rule, this was covered by 
a non-  repayable, one-  off central government 
grant.15 Reserves were built up again recently 
(end of 2014: almost €4½ billion).
Conversely, the Federal Employment Agency 
also made payments to central government. 
For instance, the implementation of the Hartz IV 
reform was initially accompanied by the intro -
duction of a compensatory amount based on 
the number of benefit recipients switching 
from unemployment benefit I to unemploy -
ment benefit II. This totalled €4½ billion in the 
year of its introduction (2005) before falling to 
€2 billion by 2007. The compensatory amount 
was replaced in 2008 by the reintegration pay -
ment, which the Federal Employment Agency 
used to pay half of the costs relating to the 
basic allowance (reintegration and administra -
tion) incurred by central government. The re -
integration payment totalled around €5 billion 
per annum  up to 2010, after which it shrank 
significantly to less than €4 billion in 2012. It 
was abolished together with the central gov -
ernment grant in 2013. In retrospect, the last -
ing impression one gains of the Federal Em -ployment Agency – and of other social security 
funds, too, for that  matter – is that financial 
relations with central government have repeat -
edly been the subject of ad hoc,  unsystematic 
interference. At the current juncture, central 
government no longer makes any significant 
 financial contribution  towards unemployment 
insurance.

Basic allowances for  
job seekers
While the Federal Employment Agency essen -
tially represents a contributions- based insur -
ance against the financial repercussions of un -
employment by providing insured persons with 
temporary wage substitutes, means- tested 
benefits ensuring subsistence are paid out of 
the central, state and local government 
budgets. In 2005, the Hartz IV reform com -
bined the benefits of income- based unemploy -
ment assistance and social assistance for per -
sons able to work to create the basic allowance 
for job seekers. As was previously the case for 
social assistance, the beneficiaries here are not 
only unemployed persons or persons able to 
work who are temporarily unavailable to the 
 labour market, but also persons in work whose 
income is below the basic allowance. Persons 
who are generally able to work but are in need 
of financial assistance receive unemployment Deficit offset 
 replaced by lending where necessary
Reintegration 
payment like-wise eliminatedTax- financed basic allowance for persons able 
to work and 
their  dependants
15 With respect to the debt brake, the lending facility 
 envisaged since 2007 has not increased the relevant central 
government deficit as these loans are factored out as finan -
cial transactions. As loan repayment only falls due when 
the Federal Employment Agency has sufficient own funds, 
this regulation tends to accord some leeway for debt finan -
cing and, therefore, provide a way of circumventing the 
constitutional rule on new borrowing. Due to a one- off 
grant nevertheless being provided in 2010, the starting def -
icit to be gradually reduced by central government in sub -
sequent years was higher. The structure chosen therefore 
granted additional scope for credit financing in later years.

benefit II; cohabiting dependants who are un -
able to work receive a social allowance.16 A fur -
ther needs- based,  labour market- related bene -
fit not covered by the basic allowance is added 
in the form of an additional children’s allow -
ance (see also the box on page 15).
The basic allowance for job seekers has been 
the subject of numerous statutory adjustments. 
The (maximum) standard monthly rate for un -
employment benefit II (for single households) 
has climbed since its introduction in 2005 from 
€345 in western Germany (€331 in eastern 
Germany until 2006) to a uniform €399 in 
2015.17 This rise by an average of 1½% per 
 annum  was, in particular, attributable to the 
 legislative changes made in 2011 following a 
ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court. The 
standard financial needs, which were subse -
quently raised slightly and nuanced rather more 
clearly, are now re- evaluated in a more system -
atic manner every five years or so and adjusted 
annually in line with the prices of basic goods and services (70%) and net wages and salaries 
(30%). Over time, the options to top up earn -
ings were notably expanded as well; at the 
same time, however, the sanctions, too, were 
tightened to strengthen the incentives to take 
up employment. In addition, the conditions for 
drawing the additional children’s allowance 
were eased in 2008, sending the number of 
recipients sharply higher as well.18 Lastly, 2011 
saw the creation of an education and integra -
tion package for children and adolescents as 
part of the reform of standard  financial needs 
under unemployment benefit II.
Central, state and local governments also fund 
active labour market policy measures, albeit to 
a somewhat lesser extent than the Federal 
 Employment Agency. Central government, for 
example, pays for reintegration benefits for 
 recipients of unemployment benefit II and for 
other adjustment assistance or job creation 
schemes. Until 2012, central government also 
shouldered some of the Federal Employment 
Agency’s expenditure by way of the rule- based 
grant. Originally it was the state governments 
of eastern Germany, in particular, which made 
greater use of their own budgets, co- financed 
in part by the European Social Fund, to support 
recipients of  social assistance who were able to 
work and to ease the burden on local govern -
ments. When the Hartz IV reform was imple -
mented, the state governments practically dis -
continued their  active labour market policy 
measures, confining their activities to region -
ally- specific supplementary measures.Benefits and

With regard to financial responsibility, central 
government not only refunds the administra -
tive costs of the Federal Employment Agency 
and the municipalities with separate responsi -
bility for the unemployed and covers its own 
active labour market policy measures, as de -
scribed above; it also bears the full cost of 
 financing unemployment benefit II (including 
the social allowance) and the additional chil -
dren’s allowance. As a rule, local government 
covers accommodation and heating costs. 
However, central government also contributes 
markedly to these costs by assuming a variable 
annual share, which differs in part from one 
federal state to the next; in principle, it also 
funds all the education and integration benefits 
(which are also paid out by local government). 
The resulting percentage share of participation 
was lifted again this year to provide general 
 relief for local government budgets and now 
stands at an average of around 36% across 
Germany (compared with 29% in the starting 
year of 2005; see also the annex on legislative changes on pages 28 to 33). On top of this, 
local governments receive transfers (which are 
not mentioned here) from the state govern -
ments that are generally oriented to the 
amount which the state governments saved as 
a result of the Hartz IV reform being introduced 
and the housing allowance being scrapped for 
persons able to work.
Expenditure patterns
Labour market- related expenditure by central 
government captured here (not including 
spending to offset the Federal Employment 
Agency’s deficit) amounted to €23 billion in 
2004 and grew when the Hartz IV reform was 
introduced in 2005, initially jumping to €33 bil -
lion net (1½% of GDP; adjusted for payments 
by the Federal Employment Agency, but includ -
ing contribution to local government accom -
modation costs). (Net) expenditure climbed to

since 2011 to €33 billion (just over 1% of GDP) at 
the current end (see also the table on page 23). 
Thus, current expenditure as a percentage of 
GDP is barely higher than in 2004, ie before the 
Hartz IV reform entered into force. However, 
compared with the first few years after the 
 reform, there has been a distinct decline.
This development is, inter alia,  attributable to 
the largest expenditure item, ie unemployment 
benefit II (including social allowance), which, 
having peaked in 2006, declined by an annual 
average of 3½% to stand at around just over 
€19½ billion in recent years. Unlike unemploy -
ment benefit  I, unemployment benefit  II is 
hardly affected by cyclical influences. Generally 
speaking, poverty under unemployment bene -
fit II is of a structural nature, and fundamental 
aspects, such as qualifications or family circum -
stances, play more of a role in determining the 
need for assistance. Such factors may also be 
relevant for employed persons, entitling them 
to draw supplementary benefits.Expenditure on unemployment benefit  II was 
generally increased through the aforemen -
tioned statutory adjustments to the basic al -
lowance benefits. However, this was offset by 
statutory changes such as the discontinuation 
of pension contributions for recipients of the 
basic allowance, but above all by the distinct 
trend decline in the number of unemployment 
benefit II recipients (persons able to work but in 
need of financial assistance). Since rising imme -
diately in the wake of the Hartz IV reform and 
peaking at 5½ million recipients in 2006,19 the 
number of recipients dwindled steadily – even 
during the financial and economic crisis – and 
from 2012 stabilised at under 4½ million recipi -
ents. Together with social allowance recipients, 
where the  decline was somewhat less pro -
nounced, the overall number of recipients 
drawing these basic allowance benefits has 
fallen from 7½ million in 2006 to 6 million of 
late. In this context, the average monthly 
amount of benefits received by each household 
in need has decreased from €560 since 2005 
to just under €500 of late, which may, inter 
alia, be attributable to pension contributions 
being scrapped and the reduced share of 
households with unemployed persons. Un -
employment benefit II reflects the decline in un -
employment in that unemployed persons as a 
proportion of the number of persons able to 
work drawing benefits is down sharply from 
55% in 2005 to around 43% at the current 
end. The number of benefit recipients who 
were not un employed but required benefits to 
top up their income from employment (which 
is usually low- income and part- time) remained 
relatively static at just under 1½ million. Their 
share of the overall number of persons able to Unemployment

19 According to Federal Employment Agency estimates at 
the time, there were around 4.4 million persons able to 
work (including dependants able to work) drawing  social 
and/or unemployment assistance at the end of 2004. 
Added to this was an unknown number of dependants 
 unable to work. As early as January 2005, the number of 
recipients of unemployment benefit II who were able to 
work amounted to 4.5 million and recipients unable to 
work (social allowance) amounted to 1.6 million (see, for 
example, Federal Employment Agency, Der Übergang von 
der Arbeitslosen- und Sozialhilfe zur Grundsicherung für 
Arbeitsuchende, Sonderbericht, August  2005).Deutsche Bundesbank

work and drawing benefits has increased over -
all of late and stood at around one- third in 
2014. By contrast, the number as well as the 
percentage share of persons receiving benefits 
who were not registered as unemployed and 
who were able to work but temporarily un -
available to the labour market fell meanwhile.20
Central government contributions to local gov -
ernment accommodation costs fluctuated in 
line with statutory adjustments and amounted 
to just over €4 billion of late, whereas refunds 
of administrative costs to the Federal Employ -
ment Agency and municipalities with separate 
responsibility for the unemployed grew by 
around 5% per annum  to reach just over €4½ 
billion. Yet active labour market policy develop -
ments played an important role, too. For 
 example, reintegration payments for unemploy -
ment benefit  II recipients climbed to €6 billion 
in 2010, only to fall back to their 2005 level of 
€3½ billion of late.
Local governments21 benefited financially from 
the Hartz IV reform and their overall labour 
market-  related expenditure dropped overall 
from an estimated €10 billion in 2004 to €9 
billion net in 2005 (since then, almost exclu -
sively accommodation costs, adjusted for cen -
tral government contributions). Spending has 
since climbed by an annual average of 2% to 
around €10½ billion in 2014, although the 
benefit  recipient ratios sometimes differ sub -
stantially between states and between individ -
ual local governments. However, local govern -
ment expenditure as a percentage of GDP vir -
tually never  exceeded ½%. Average monthly 
refunds to households in need increased per -
ceptibly from €275 to roughly €360. This devel -
opment is likely to have reflected higher rental 
and energy prices, particularly in urban areas, 
where a disproportionate number of benefit 
 recipients reside. The net cost for local govern -
ment budgets is likely to be somewhat lower 
still if the savings from the Hartz IV reform for -
warded by state governments are taken into 
account. At the state government level, direct 
labour market- related  expenditure has been negligible since 2005 due to the elimination of 
housing allowances and reintegration benefits 
for persons in need of financial assistance who 
are able to work.
All in all and from today’s perspective, the 
Hartz IV reform saw a considerable expansion 
in government spending on social benefits, 
mainly because the number of recipients in -
creased sharply – but probably also because 
persons previously entitled to social assistance 
began drawing these benefits more intensively. 
Central government initially bore the brunt of 
the reform, while the burden on local govern -
ments was eased. However, in recent years, 
central government has experienced gradual 
yet noticeable relief, whereas local government 
expenditure has trended moderately upwards, 
somewhat below nominal GDP growth.
Conclusions and outlook
The very favourable development in the labour 
market has perceptibly eased the strain on pub -
lic finances over the past ten years. Since peak -
ing in 2005, the number of unemployed per -
sons has declined significantly from almost five 
million to under three million. This develop -
ment has been reflected in labour market-  
related public expenditure and made it pos -
sible, first, for the Federal Employment Agen -
cy’s contribution rate to be slashed by more 
than half; second, it contributed to consolida -
tion at the central, state and local government 
level. The improvements left more of a mark on 
the more cyclical items of the Federal Employ -
ment Agency’s expenditure. However, spend -
ing on the basic allowance for job seekers, too, 
contracted substantially. When unemployment 
and social assistance were combined in 2005, 
this drove the number of recipients sharply Other benefits

higher initially, but this figure has been on a 
steep and steady downward trajectory since 
2006. Overall, the number of unemployment 
benefit II recipients  diminished by 1½% per an -
num until 2014. The number of long- term un -
employed persons22 appears to have levelled 
off at around one  million since 2011.
There are many reasons for the significant 
 decline in unemployment in Germany. The 
 reforms seen in the past decade were probably 
a major catalyst – combined with flexibility 
measures at the firm level, relatively moderate 
collective  labour agreements and improved 
corporate competitiveness, they are likely to 
have put the German labour market on the 
path to success. Particularly noteworthy in this 
respect are the Hartz IV reforms, which, through 
more efficient job mediation and stricter 
means- testing, have ultimately helped drive 
down unemployment.23
In particular the Federal Employment Agency, 
which is the main institution paying short- term 
unemployment benefits, reaped the rewards of 
the very favourable developments in the labour 
market. Besides reducing its previously high 
funding deficits, the Federal Employment 
Agency also succeeded in slashing the contri -
bution rate, which had a positive knock- on 
 effect on employment and growth conditions 
in Germany. As things stand today, the current 
contribution rate seems to be just sufficient to 
 finance around one million recipients of un -
employment benefit I, assuming the Federal 
Employment Agency’s remaining spending per 
unemployed person is roughly proportional to 
its expenditure on unemployment benefit I. Last 
year, the number of recipients stood at 
890,000, and the outlook appears to suggest 
that their figure will at least stabilise at this low 
level. That means the Federal Employment 
Agency would also be able to go without a 
loan from the central government budget in 
the medium term, thus enabling it to further 
boost its general reserves.As far as the setting of the contribution rate is 
concerned, it must be borne in mind that the 
prevailing labour market situation is certainly 
on the upbeat side and that it would be quite 
appropriate for the Federal Employment 
Agency to further boost its reserves. A further 
cut in the contribution rate should only be con -
sidered possible if the present situation in the 
labour market does, in fact, turn out to be the 
new structural normal and the low number of 
unemployment benefit I recipients proves to be 
sustainable, such that the Federal Employment 
Agency does not drift into deficit territory over 
the course of the economic cycle. This would 
additionally presuppose that strict budgetary 
discipline is maintained, especially regarding 
active labour market policy measures, which 
actually seems  rather plausible given that it is 
probably viewed with some scepticism overall 
concerning its impact on the prospect of un -
employed persons finding new employment, 
causes “free-  rider” effects and can even be 
counterproductive (eg in the case of job cre -
ation schemes), especially considering the 
 financial burdens involved.24 In principle, con -

employment benefit I) offers further potential 
for lowering the contribution rate; however, 
this does not appear to be on the agenda at 
present.
Irrespective of this, adequately funding non-  
insurance- related benefits by the Federal 
 Employment Agency also opens up potential 
for lowering the contribution rate. As a rule, 
non- insurance- related benefits allocated by 
central government should be financed using 
general tax revenue so that they are not shoul -
dered by contribution payers alone. However, 
in the past, the allocation of central govern -
ment grants to the Federal Employment Agency 
was relatively arbitrary and occasionally gave 
the impression – as with other social  security 
schemes – that fiscal policymakers shift funding 
at a whim to suit the cash balance at any given 
time. As a case in point, the central govern -
ment contribution was done away with and 
not replaced in 2013.
Although it is probably virtually impossible to 
make an undisputed and universally applicable 
distinction between insurance- compliant and 
non- insurance- related benefits, it would be 
useful if the legislator were to draw up a de -
tailed list and justify insurance benefits. The 
identified expenditure could then be financed 
in the form of a rule- based central government 
grant so as to move towards relieving contribu -
tion payers of the burden of financing tasks 
which belong to society as a whole and, as a 
more general initiative, to boost the transpar -
ency of the social security system. The Federal 
Employment Agency itself estimates that non-  
insurance- related benefits account for around 
10% of its expenditure of late, citing above all 
rehabilitation benefits and preparatory voca -
tional measures for adolescents.25 Together, 
these benefits involve spending of just over €3 
billion, matching the revenue from around 0.3 
contribution percentage point. Moreover, 
benefit rates that differ depending on whether 
or not the recipient is a parent are somewhat 
incompatible with the essence of unemploy -
ment insurance. Longer- term claims of un -employment benefit I by older recipients, too, 
could be regarded more as a separate govern -
ment transfer than a regular element of an in -
surance scheme against the risk of unemploy -
ment.
The Hartz  IV reform and the subsequently 
agreed amendments to the funding arrange -
ments across the different levels of government 
placed a significant additional burden on cen -
tral government and provided a degree of relief 
for local governments. However, from 2011, 
central government’s labour market-  related 
burdens as a percentage of GDP declined again 
markedly, while the situation was virtually 
 unchanged at the local government level. In 
the medium term – given the current labour 
market outlook and owing to the general 
 indexation of benefits – both central govern -
ment and local governments can expect no 
more than moderate growth rates, so burdens 
will probably change only slightly. At the 
present time, there is no sign of any further 
perceptible relief in terms of expenditure on 
unemployment benefit II, and accommodation 
costs are likely to follow the essentially upward 
overall trend in rental prices and energy costs. 
Additional statutory adjustments to the scope 
of benefits or other aspects are not envisaged 
at this stage.
Looking ahead, further extending the provision 
of childcare could potentially further increase 
labour market participation by numerous re -
cipients of unemployment benefit II, especially 
single parents, and, thus, ease the strain on 
 labour market- related expenditure. The me -
dium-  term impact of the introduction of the 
minimum wage on public finances cannot yet 
be gauged precisely. If the minimum wage 
does not have a persistently and substantially 
negative impact on employment levels, the 
burden on central government is more likely to 
be eased as the need to top up low incomes Tax financing of 
non- insurance- related benefits could further lower contribu-tion rate

Annex
Major legislative changes 
 concerning labour market 
 policy since 2005 with an 
 impact on finances
Fifth Act Amending the Third Book of the 
Social Security Code and Other Legislation 
(Fünftes Gesetz zur Änderung des SGB III 
und anderer Gesetze)  (2005)
Extension, until 31  December 2007, of temporary 
active employment promotion measures and of the 
option for persons over the age of 58 to claim un -
employment benefit I without being available to the 
labour market.
Phasing out of one- person business start- up grants 
to unemployed persons (Existenzgründungszuschuss)  
by 30 June 2006.
Act Revising the Exemption Limit Regula -
tions for Persons in Need with the Capacity 
to Work (Gesetz zur Neufassung der  
Freibetragsregelungen für erwerbsfähige 
Hilfebedürftige)  (2005)
Improvement of options to top up earnings and 
more generous allowance of income in the calcula -
tion of unemployment benefit II.
Act Amending the Fourth and Sixth Books 
of the Social Security Code (Gesetz zur  
Änderung des SGB IV und SGB VI) (2005)
Bringing forward of the deadlines for the payment 
of social security contributions from the middle of 
the following month to the end of the month in 
which the work is carried out. In the year in which 
this comes into force (2006), the social security 
funds record a one- off higher inflow of liquidity.First Act Amending the Second Book of the 
Social Security Code (Erstes Gesetz zur  
Änderung des SGB II) (2005)
In 2006, too, central government contributes 29.1% 
to accommodation and heating costs within the 
framework of the basic allowance for job seekers.
Act Amending the Second Book of the 
 Social Security Code and Other Legislation 
(Gesetz zur Änderung des SGB II und  
anderer Gesetze)  (2006)
Convergence of the standard rate of unemployment 
benefit II for eastern Germany with the level in west -
ern Germany (€345 per month).
Extension of income- support households to include 
unmarried children under the age of 25 living in the 
household.
As of 2007, virtual halving of pension insurance con -
tributions paid by central government on behalf of 
recipients of unemployment benefit II.
Act Promoting Year- round Employment 
(Gesetz zur Förderung der ganzjährigen 
Beschäftigung)  (2006)
As of the 2006-07 period of bad weather, the newly 
implemented seasonal short- time working benefits 
replace the promotion of winter construction previ -
ously in place. Seasonal short- time working benefits 
are granted as of the first working hour lost and 
 financed from contributions to the Federal Employ -
ment Agency. Previously, the first 30 hours were 
covered by the individual working time account and, 
beyond that, the winter compensation payments 
were financed by means of the winter construction 
levy paid by employers in the construction sector. 
Only after this was the Federal Employment Agency 
responsible for providing funds.with unemployment benefit  II would decline 
due to the higher wage level and additional tax 
and contribution income can be expected to be 
generated. However, if jobs were lost, which would be a particular concern in the event of 
sharp increases in the minimum wage in the 
future, this would also place a strain on public 
finances.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
April 2015

The refunding of employers’ contributions to the 
 social security funds and the compensation for add -
itional costs incurred when working in winter 
(Mehraufwands-  Wintergeld)  or the allowance for 
hours taken as flexitime (Zuschuss-  Wintergeld)  are 
 financed by means of a levy to which employees in 
the construction sector are also to make a contribu -
tion for the first time.
Act Accompanying the 2006 Budget 
(Haushalts begleitgesetz 2006)  (2006)
Lowering of the contribution rate to the Federal Em -
ployment Agency from 6.5% to 4.2% as of 1 Janu -
ary 2007. The rate was initially envisaged to be cut 
to 4.5%. However, as a result of the Act to Lower 
the Contribution for the Promotion of Employment 
and to Determine Contribution Rates in the Statu -
tory Pension Insurance Scheme and Contributions 
and Contribution Grants for Agricultural Pensions for 
2007 (Gesetz über die Senkung des Beitrags zur 
Arbeits förderung, die Festsetzung der Beitragssätze 
in der gesetzlichen Rentenversicherung und der Bei -
träge und Beitragszuschüsse in der Alterssicherung 
der Landwirte für das Jahr 2007),  the lower contri -
bution rate is adopted in the Act Accompanying the 
Budget.
As of 2007, central government pays a rule- based 
grant to the Federal Employment Agency, which is to 
amount to the revenue generated from one percent -
age point of the rise in the standard rate of VAT on 
1 January 2007 (from 16% to 19%) and, as of 2010, 
is to be extrapolated at the rate of change in the VAT 
assessment basis.
As of 2007, any central government liquidity assis -
tance remaining at the end of the year is no longer 
converted to non- repayable grants but takes the 
form of interest- free central government loans to 
the Federal Employment Agency that are to be 
 repaid in years when the economy is in better shape.
Lowering of health insurance contributions paid by 
central government on behalf of recipients of un -
employment benefit II.Act on the Further Development of the 
Basic Allowance for Job Seekers (Gesetz 
zur Fortentwicklung der Grundsicherung 
für Arbeitsuchende)  (2006)
Expansion of small employment opportunities for 
job seekers, closer examination of benefit abuse, 
more targeted sanctions.
Bridging payments and one- person business start- up 
grants to unemployed persons are combined into 
new start- up grants for unemployed persons wish -
ing to become self- employed.
Act Amending the Second Book of the 
 Social Security Code and the Act on 
 Financial Equalisation (Gesetz zur Änderung 
des SGB II und des FAG)  (2006)
To provide local government with appropriate relief, 
central government’s contribution to accommoda -
tion and heating costs for 2007 is adjusted and dif -
ferentiated according to federal state (Baden-  
Württemberg 35.2%, Rhineland- Palatinate 41.2%, 
other states 31.2%26). As of 2008, the central gov -
ernment grant is to be changed by law using an 
 adjustment formula based on the development of 
the number of income- support households. A fun -
damental review of central government’s contribu -
tion is scheduled for 2010.
Second Act Amending the Second Book of 
the Social Security Code (Zweites Gesetz 
zur Änderung des SGB II) (2007)
Implementation of new labour market policy meas -
ures for the long- term unemployed who are particu -
larly difficult to place (in particular, employment 
grants for employers).
26 At that time, Baden-  Württemberg and Rhineland-  
Palatinate had a disproportionately low number of recipi -
ents of SGB II benefits meaning that, overall, local govern -
ment would have received less relief if a standard contribu -
tion rate had been introduced for the whole of Germany.Deutsche Bundesbank

Sixth Act Amending the Third Book of the 
Social Security Code and Other Legislation

Agency makes a reintegration payment to central 
government to cover half of its expenditure on 
 labour market reintegration benefits and half of its 
administration costs for the basic allowance for job 
seekers. The compensatory amount levied previously 
(for recipients of unemployment benefit I switching 
to unemployment benefit II) is abolished.
Transfers from the Federal Employment Agency are 
to be paid into a pension fund administered by the 
Bundesbank, enabling a capital stock to be accrued 
from which pensions to the Agency’s remaining civil 
servants are to be paid.
Third Act Amending the Second Book of 
the Social Security Code (Drittes Gesetz zur 
Änderung des SGB II) (2007)
Adjustment of central government’s contribution to 
accommodation and heating costs for 2008 (Baden- 
Württemberg 32.6%, Rhineland- Palatinate 38.6%,

the Social Security Code and Other Legisla -
tion (Siebtes Gesetz zur Änderung des 
SGB III und anderer Gesetze)  (2008)
For new cases from 1  January 2008 onward, the 
general maximum period of entitlement to un -

months, respectively, from the age of 50, 55 or 58.
Recipients of unemployment benefit II who have 
reached the age of 58 and have not received an

geldgesetzes)  (2008)
Changes to the additional children’s allowance, in 
particular lowering of the minimum income limit and

Arbeitsuchende)  (2010)
Following the Federal Constitutional Court’s ruling of 
December 2007, job centres in the form of joint 
 institutions, comprising both local employment 
agencies and municipal authorities, are set up to 
carry out tasks related to the basic allowance for job 
seekers. At the same time, further job centres in the 
form of Optionskommunen  – where the municipal

February 2010, the standard requirements for the 
basic allowance for job seekers (as well as the assis -
tance for living expenses (social assistance) and the 
basic allowance for the elderly and for persons with 
reduced earning capacity pursuant to SGB XII) are 
 recalculated as at 1 January 2011. The six new levels 
of standard requirements range between €213 (for 
children under the age of six) and €364 (for single 
adults) per month. They are calculated on the basis 
of the sample survey of income and expenditure 
(which is carried out every five years) and extrapo -
lated each year using a mixed index comprising the 
price developments of goods and services relevant 
for the standard requirements (70%) and the devel -
opment of net wages and salaries per employee 
(30%).
In addition, new benefits for education and partici -
pation for schoolchildren are introduced on 1 Janu -
ary 2011 as part of the basic allowance for job seek -
ers and social assistance. To finance these benefits 
provided by local government, central government’s 
contribution to accommodation costs is raised and 
adjusted each year in line with the development of 
expenditure on education and participation.Act Increasing the Financial Capacity of 
Local Government (Gesetz zur Stärkung der 
Finanzkraft der Kommunen)  (2011)
Discretionary cut to the rule- based central govern -

on the Labour Market (Gesetz zur  
Verbesserung der Eingliederungschancen 
am Arbeits markt)  (2011)
The labour market policy measures in SGB  III and 
SGB II are revised and more closely integrated. The

Structural developments  
in the German banking sector
The financial and sovereign debt crisis which has afflicted the euro area for more than seven 
years now has clearly left a mark on the financial market, having prompted monetary policy-
makers to roll out highly accommodative measures and legislators to make adjustments to the 
regulatory framework. These changes have fundamentally transformed the landscape, particu -
larly for the banking sector.
This article starts out by looking back at developments prior to the financial crisis before turning 
to the post-2007 era to shed light on the interplay between regulation, monetary policy and 
 market behaviour as well as their impact on banks’ business models. In so doing, it will focus on 
banks’ asset and liability structures, looking particularly into the forms of funding used by German 
banks.
The wave of financial market deregulation unleashed from the 1990s onwards, combined with 
the European integration process, had a transformative impact on banks’ business models, espe -
cially so among larger institutions in Germany. One of the effects of deregulation was to allow 
banks in Germany to make greater use of market- based funding and broaden their investment 
banking operations. This was a catalyst for a spell of stellar growth spearheaded by larger 
 German institutions. Smaller banks, on the other hand, tended to be overshadowed by this global 
phenomenon and stuck to their traditional lines of banking business.
The financial crisis put an end to larger institutions’ wave of expansion, which had been focused 
on capital market business and investment banking and fuelled by institutional funding from 
banks, insurers, investment funds and money market funds etc. Added to this, the most recent 
regulatory initiatives define concrete requirements for the structure of banks’ funding and aim to 
ensure that banks have sufficient loss- absorbing capacity, besides introducing, for the first time, 
a facility for resolving larger credit institutions. This newly created regulatory regime, if rigorously 
applied, could take pressure off fiscal and monetary policy going forward.
The slump in credit institutions’ earnings brought about by the crisis, the transformation of the 
financial market landscape and reforms to banking regulation have forced Germany’s banking 
sector as a whole to downsize proprietary trading, refocus on core business operations and sub -
stitute capital market funding with deposits. This marked the first tentative steps towards revers -
ing the very developments that had been observed in the run- up to the crisis.
In recent years, larger German banks in particular have barely managed to generate sufficient 
income to build up capital through retained earnings. But the ability to do so is a key prerequisite 
for a sustainable business model. Only banks which satisfy this requirement in the long run are 
fully capable of serving their function as providers of finance to the economy.Deutsche Bundesbank

Structure of the 
 German banking system
Universal banks – institutions offering a broad 
repertoire of products and services around a 
core of traditional deposit- financed lending 
business – are a hallmark of Germany’s banking 
landscape. They exist alongside specialised 
banks, which are often affiliated with a univer -
sal bank and normally run a narrow business 
model focusing on selected transactions ( inter 
alia building and loan associations and mort -
gage banks).
Categorisation of business 
models
In principle, bank business models can be char -
acterised in three dimensions, the main one 
being the asset and liability structure, ie a 
bank’s funding sources and lending activities 
(see the chart on page 37). The funding mix is 
one of the main factors used to categorise 
banks in that dimension.1 Given that a bank’s 
business activities have a major bearing on its 
earnings structure, which is the second dimen -
sion, it is also possible to differentiate between 
business models in terms of their profitability 
and risk profile. The third dimension is the insti -
tution’s legal form, which can largely dictate an 
individual bank’s size, the number of similarly 
structured institutions and branches as well as 
the density of the branch network.2 In this 
 dimension, German banks can be broken down 
into the country’s three- pillar structure, com -
prising private commercial banks, public sector 
institutions and institutes in the cooperative 
sector. For statistical reporting purposes, the 
banking system is divided into what are known 
as categories of banks, to which institutions are 
assigned depending on the nature of their 
asset and liability structure3 and their legal 
form. The most important categories of banks 
in Germany are big banks, Landesbanken, 
 regional institutions of credit cooperatives, 
 regional banks and other commercial banks, 
credit cooperatives and savings banks.Business models of categories 
of banks: characteristics and 
development
The big banks stand out in the category of pri -
vate commercial banks.4 For the most part, 
their business operations and funding activities 
are strongly biased towards international oper -
ations and the capital markets, and they aim to 
make profits. Their activities include acting as 
the principal banking partners of Germany’s 
major industrial enterprises. Many institutions 
in the category of regional banks and other 
commercial banks, on the other hand, tend to 
be smaller in size, with business models resem -
bling those of savings banks and credit 
 cooperatives.5 Operating more within a par -
ticular region, these institutions mainly focus 
on supplying credit to non- financial corpor -Germany’s

 Experts.
3 The data used in this article to analyse asset and liability 
structures are extracted from the Bundesbank’s monthly 
balance sheet statistics for German banks (monetary finan -
cial institutions, or MFIs). These statistics cover all banks in 
Germany that are licenced to conduct both deposit- taking 
and lending business. They are primarily the following: 
(a) reports by banks operating in Germany with no legally 
dependent branches abroad; (b) partial reports by German 
banks operating a foreign branch network with data on 
their domestic branches; and (c) partial reports by foreign 
branches operated in Germany by non- resident banks. Not 
included are reports by foreign branches or by legally inde -
pendent bank subsidiaries of German banks. The disclosure 
requirements governing the collection of reporting data are 
based on the rules set forth in Regulation ECB/ 2013/ 33 
concerning the balance sheet of the monetary financial in -
stitutions sector. In Germany these requirements can be 
essentially traced back to the financial reporting standards 
under the German Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch , 
or HGB) and the Accounting Regulation for Credit Institu -
tions ( Verordnung über die Rechnungslegung der Kredit -
institute und Finanzdienstleistungsinstitute , or RechKredV).
4 An itemised list of the institutions covered by the monthly 
balance sheet statistics can be found in Deutsche Bundes -
bank, Special Statistical Publication 1, Verzeichnisse.
5 The category of regional banks and other commercial 
banks comprises an extremely heterogeneous set of institu -
tions, as well as including central counterparties and 
Germany- based subsidiaries of international banks.Deutsche Bundesbank

ations and households, using deposits as their 
primary source of funding. This makes them 
direct competitors of savings banks and credit 
cooperatives. Competition is likely to be less 
important, on the other hand, among savings 
banks (on account of the regional principle) 
and among credit cooperatives (owing to their 
close links with a particular region). Landesban -
ken, being the central institutions of savings 
banks, perform transactions which the savings 
banks themselves cannot, because they are ei -
ther too small or operate only in a given region. 
They are therefore major players in the whole -
sale banking and capital market businesses, 
where they go head to head with large private 
commercial banks, first and foremost the big 
banks. Regional institutions of credit coopera -
tives, meanwhile, play a far more active role 
than the Landesbanken in redistributing liquid -
ity among the affiliated primary institutions, 
meaning they operate chiefly in the interbank 
and capital market.
The business models of the smaller regional in -
stitutions have not changed fundamentally 
over the last 50 years. Their customer-  centric 
approach, plus, in the case of the savings 
banks, a commitment to serving the public 
good, make dense regional coverage a neces -
sity, hence the consistently high number of in -
stitutions and branches that can be found to this day in this category. More than three-  
quarters of credit institutions in Germany are 
savings banks or credit cooperatives, but their 
combined total assets make up less than a 
quarter of aggregate total assets in the German 
banking system. The process of consolidation 
which had been evident for some time gained 
traction in the 1990s, notably in the coopera -
tive bank sector with its very large branch net -
work, as credit institutions set out to streamline 
costs. Momentum waned after the turn of the 
millennium, however. Networked institutions,6 
which did not want to risk watering down their 
customer- centric approach by further downsiz -
ing their regional footprint, sought to spin off 
and merge certain business units as specialised 
entities as noiselessly as possible. But the fact 
remains that the aggregate number of institu -
tions across all categories of banks shrank by 
more than half between 1990 and 2015. 
 Advancing digitalisation has further eroded the 
importance of branches as a sales channel, 
while the pressure to reduce the cost base 
through economies of scale has fostered the 
spread of direct banking. Added to this, many 
institutions are increasingly looking to break 
into the online payments business as well.Bulk of smaller

Larger banks differ from their smaller counter -
parts in that their business models have under -
gone transformative change over the past 20 
years. Financial innovations, increased financial 
market integration and the deregulation of the 
financial markets, combined with banks’ ex -
pansionary ambitions, enabled larger banks to 
expand their business franchise on an unpre -
cedented scale. Market- based transactions 
opened the door to fresh sources of earnings 
and new forms of financing. The upturn in cap -
ital market financing was chiefly driven by four 
sets of financial market promotion legislation in 
Germany, the third of which, dating from 1998, 
had the greatest impact on the volume of bank debt issuance (see the box on pages 40 and 41). 
Although the new regulations were ostensibly 
addressed to asset management companies, 
which between 1998 and 2007 counted as 
credit institutions and thus fell within the scope 
of the German Banking Act ( Kreditwesenge -
setz, or KWG),7 there were no plans to apply 
the capital adequacy and liquidity rules (sixth 
KWG amendment) to these institutions.8 Fur-
thermore, the Third Financial Market Promo -
tion Act paved the way for the inception of 
money market funds, and the resulting growth 
in the investor base was another factor which 
fuelled banks’ capital market financing. The 
Fourth  Financial Market Promotion Act from 
2002 was followed by the Financial Market 
Promotion Plan, which centred around the 
2004 Investment Modernisation Act (Invest -
mentmodernisierungsgesetz) . The main thrust 
of this legislation was to authorise hedge funds 
in Germany and to ease the capital adequacy 
rules for asset management companies and in -
vestment stock corporations. In the banking 
sector, it was primarily larger institutions which 
used special purpose entities as a vehicle for 
the large- scale issue of securitised assets, in -
cluding asset- backed securities and mortgage- 
backed securities, (see the chart on page 39). 
But the evolution of the legal landscape since 
the 1990s did more than just affect larger Ger -
man banks’ funding structures – it also radically 
transformed their entire business operations. 
One such change to the legal groundrules was 
the decision in 2001 to abolish state guaran -
tees (Gewährträgerhaftung)  and guarantors’ 
responsibility for ensuring their institutions’ 
solvency (Anstaltslast)  in the Landesbanken Deregulation the

status as credit institutions. Furthermore, the entry into

asset management company (Kapitalanlagegesellschaft)  
with capital management company (Kapitalverwaltungs -

and savings bank sector, which entered into 
force in July 2005 following a transitional 
period lasting several years. In hindsight, some 
larger German banks were evidently so deeply 
invested in securitised assets that they were 
jeopardising their solvency. So besides achiev -
ing the desired effect of boosting the attract -
iveness of the German financial market, de -
regulation also acted as a catalyst for a not 
 altogether sustainable expansion in market-  
based transactions.
Both the emergence of market- based transac -
tions alongside traditional banking business 
and the process of consolidation within the 
three pillars caused individual banks to swell in 
size and fuelled concentration within the bank -
ing sector. The larger a bank’s original size, the 
more strongly it expanded its business fran -
chise and enlarged its balance sheet. There are 
two reasons for this. One is that larger banks 
find it easier to boost their leverage, given that 
they are more likely to tap the capital markets. 
Another is that they have greater scope for 
 diversifying their activities than do their smaller 
competitors, because they can harness econ -
omies of scale and scope for different business 
lines run side by side. This is precisely the devel -
opment that was seen at the national level, 
particularly among big banks and Landesban -
ken but also at a number of larger institutions 
in the other categories of banks. It is not a phe -
nomenon that is confined to Germany but a 
global trend in the growth of larger banks.9
German banks’ funding 
sources
A bank’s business model largely dictates the 
composition of the liabilities and assets on its 
balance sheet. Whereas traditional lending 
business commonly goes hand in hand with 
traditional deposits- based funding, a market-  
facing investment policy typically means mak -
ing greater use of the money and capital mar -
ket and of institutional investors as a source of 
funding. Diversification is the first rule of invest -ing, and it is no less pertinent for funding. 
Being reliant on a single source of funding (or 
even an individual type of funding or a single 
creditor) is more risky for a bank’s liquidity 
 ceteris paribus  than having a diversified port -
folio of different funding sources.
Banks mainly obtain funding from three 
sources: liabilities to non- banks, liabilities to the 
MFI sector10 and securitised debt. The develop -
ment of innovative financial market instruments Big banks grew 
particularly strongly

since the 1990s has seen derivatives emerging 
as another major form of liability (eg liquidity 
swaps).11 Liabilities to non- banks are the pri -
mary source of funds for Germany’s banking 
system as a whole, funding almost 45% of 
 aggregate total assets on a long- run average 
(since December 1968). Deposits by house -
holds and non- financial corporations account 
for the bulk of these liabilities (taking the form 
of overnight deposits, savings deposits and 
time deposits). Furthermore, insurers, which 
are mostly a source of long- term funding ( inter 
alia registered bank bonds), are a major cred -
itor group in the non- bank segment.12 A fur -
ther 25% of total assets on average are funded 
in the form of deposits by other MFIs (two-  
thirds domestically and one- third from abroad), 
with short- term interbank liabilities being used 
chiefly to settle liquidity in the money market. 
Yet over half of interbank liabilities are more 
long- term in nature, with an original life of two 
years or more. Besides intra- group or intra-  
network funding, these are primarily  deposits by development banks. The third source of 
funding, bond issuance, makes up a further 
20% of banks’ funding on a long- run average. 
Banks use bank bonds to raise both short- term 
and long- term funds.
Banks’ own equity capital is another economic -
ally significant source of funding. Since a bank’s 
business model typically implies a high level of 
debt, its equity ratio – capital as a percentage 
of total assets – is significantly lower than that 
of non- financial corporations. The German 
banking system’s reported equity ratio amounts German banks

brokers who were appointed by the stock exchange

segment in fl  oor trading; they were responsible for 
 determining offi   cial exchange prices in that segment. 
With the advent of the Fourth Financial Market Promo-

by European standards, is well below mid-

high leverage ratios.
How the financing  
structure of the German 
banking  sector evolved 
in the  financial crisis
The financial crisis brought to a halt a trend, 
which had been unfolding since the 1990s, of 
financial market liberalisation characterised by 
rapidly growing interbank and capital markets. 
The new, and in many cases short- term, finan -
cing instruments showed their dark side, with 
banks suddenly facing high liquidity risk. The 
spread of the subprime crisis to the money 
market in summer 2007 and the Lehman Broth -
ers failure in September 2008 made it at once 
more difficult and more expensive for banks, 
including German banks, to obtain finance on the interbank and capital markets. Although 
the German interbank market did not come 
 entirely undone, the financial crisis radically 
changed the international funding environ -
ment, resulting, inter alia , in a change in per -
ceptions of risk with regard to liquidity and 
counterparty default; one of the main conse -
quences was that interbank transactions, which 
in many cases were unsecured before the crisis, 
were largely replaced by secured transactions.15

issues in the capital market since investors were 
demanding much greater risk premiums than in 
the past while, in addition, uncertainty was 
causing a quantitative deterioration in sales 
 opportunities. At the same time, central bank

the same time that the interest rate on main 
refinancing operations (MROs) fell drastically.16 
The non- standard monetary policy measures 
taken in response to the spread of the sover -
eign debt crisis and particularly the provision by 
the Eurosystem of long- term refinancing at very 
low rates at the end of 2011 and beginning of 
2012 made capital market funding an increas -
ingly costly proposition. This was one of the 
key reasons why new issues of bank debt and 
Pfandbriefe systematically failed to keep pace 
with redemption volumes. German banks’ 
 securitised debt subsequently contracted by 
nearly one- third (from their level in July 2007). 
Looking at the other bank debt securities, this 
decline was focused primarily on the medium 
maturity segment (having an initial maturity of 
over one and up to four years).17
Even though the financial crisis has been going 
on for over seven years, only the Landesbanken 
and mortgage banks –  categories of banks 
which have been hit hard by restructuring and 
resolution – have seen their aggregated total 
assets contract significantly. This is also  reflected 
in trends in the aggregated total assets of the 
German banking system as a whole.18 Where 
German banks not belonging to either of these 
two categories sought capital market finan -
cing, the massive decline in securitised debt 
must have been made up for by other sources 
of funding since balance sheets were not 
shrunk. The targeted substitution of capital 
market financing by the banks themselves is, 
strictly speaking, possible only by expanding 
central bank refinancing or by a capital in -
crease, as deposit- based finance cannot be 
managed directly by the banks but only indir -ectly by structuring the terms and conditions. 
To the banks, deposits therefore tend to be 
more of a “passive source of funds”.
However, non- bank- based financing has been 
undergoing a renaissance across all categories 
of banks. This is the only source of funding to 
grow in absolute terms since the outbreak of 
the financial crisis. A role has surely been played 
by the advantages of deposit-  based financing 
over interbank liabilities and capital market 
 finance: to the institutions, deposits are inex -
pensive, unsecured and – despite being callable 
at short notice – very stable, especially in Ger -
many. The regulatory assessment (in connec -
tion, for instance, with liquidity regulation) 
goes in the same direction, thus helping to 
make this source of funds an increasingly 
 enticing option. However, portfolio shifts (eg 
from bonds and equities to bank deposits) and 
the formation of new financial assets by Ger -
man households are the primary reason why 
deposit- based financing grew across the board 
and not just among individual banks by poach -
ing customer deposits from other institutions.19
Amidst the wide variety of business models in 
Germany’s banking system, three identifiable 
characteristics run like a thread through the 
current financing structure of German banks. 
One is that liabilities to non- banks have be -
come considerably more important since the 
financial crisis, though not nearly to the same 
extent as in the 1960s, when deposits were the 
primary source of funding not only for savings 
banks and credit cooperatives but also for com -… did not cause

mercial banks (big banks, regional banks and 
other commercial banks). The second charac -
teristic is that, with the exception of customer 
deposits and intra- group or intra- association 
loans, there is hardly any unsecured funding 
left in banks’ balance sheets. The third is that 
contractually agreed maturities were being 
shortened on the liabilities side during the 
 financial crisis. The above- mentioned develop -
ments will be illustrated in greater detail for 
specific categories of banks below.
Big banks
Prior to the financial crisis, the interbank mar -
ket and liabilities to non- banks, usually in the 
form of households’ and non- financial corpor -
ations’ deposits, each accounted for a little 
over one- third of big banks’ funding. Securi -
tised debt, by contrast, was far less material 
(12% of total assets). The financial crisis brought 
to a halt the expansion of big banks’ interbank 
and capital market funding observed primarily 
in the 1990s. Since the onset of the crisis, the 
bottom has fallen out of the prices of securi -
tised debt; since 2010, this debt has been con -
tinuously run off, which means that today bal -
ance sheets have only around two- thirds of 
their pre- crisis levels of securitised debt. In con -
trast to the decline in securitised funding, the 
interbank market – especially the foreign inter -
bank market – has not relinquished any of its 
importance to big banks for their funding; the 
volume of their interbank debt is only margin -
ally below pre- crisis levels. A little over one-  
third of debt consists of derivative financial in -
struments. However, it is impossible to reliably 
say whether this share has changed since the 
crisis, as the reporting of derivative financial in -
struments in the trading portfolio for the banks’ 
monthly balance sheet statistics has been man -
datory only since December 2010.20 The pri -
mary purpose of derivatives is probably to gen -
erate profits and hedge against interest rate 
risk. Owing to their short- term nature, they are 
also an extremely flexible method of funding 
which enables liquidity risk to be managed to the exact day; its usage is accordingly highly 
volatile.21 After steadily accumulating these in -
struments during the intensification of the sov -
ereign debt crisis up until May 2012, big banks 
shed massive amounts from their balance 
sheets. This was likely due primarily to the cur -
rent interest rate environment, in which the 
profit outlook for this type of business is min -
imal, and to new regulations as part of the pro -
cess of implementing Basel III in Europe.22
Moreover, big banks are observably soliciting 
deposits. Their portfolio of deposits has in -
creased slightly since the pre- financial crisis 
period; following derivative financial instru -
ments in the trading portfolio, deposits now 
represent the second most important type of 
debt. On balance, although big banks’ funding 
is diversified to a similar extent as in the stage 
of financial market liberalisation and globalisa -
tion, the relative weights have shifted mark -
edly. Capital market financing, in particular, is 
significantly less important than prior to the 
 financial crisis and in the stage of financial mar -
ket liberalisation in the 1990s. The high ratio of 
overnight debt (deposits and interbank debt) to 
total debt is also new (40% as against 26% in 
July 2007). There was, in particular, a shift from 
short maturities to overnight debt, which is 
why the percentage of the total of both types 
of liabilities, at 64%, is high but, by historical 
standards, not exceptionally so.23
Networked institutions
The business model pursued by the savings 
banks and cooperative banks is entirely differ -
ent from that of big banks, which is heavily fo -
cused on the global market and investment 
banking activities. Both categories of banks be -Crisis called time

long to networks and, within these networks, 
generally function as the regionally focused 
credit institution which conducts mostly retail 
banking business. Its funding is therefore heav -
ily dependent on deposits of households and 
enterprises (which make up around 70% of 
total assets). Just under 15% are acquired via 
the interbank market (mainly through the 
 respective central institutions). The capital 
 market, however, is hardly accessed directly by 
either category of banks. Both network sys -
tems have set out a clear- cut division of roles in 
this regard, with issuance being the prerogative 
of the central institutions (Landesbanken and 
cooperative central banks); these then provide 
the necessary financial resources to primary 
 institutions as loans. The savings banks’ aggre -
gated total assets have grown 10% since 2007, 
whereas the credit cooperatives have expanded 
theirs by one- quarter over the same period.24 
Both banking categories achieved this growth 
through a strong expansion in their portfolios 
of deposits, which moreover replaced capital 
market funding, which had been scaled back 
to virtually zero. In addition, the savings banks 
reduced their interbank debt by 25% during 
the financial crisis (both to the Landesbanken 
and to the rest of the banking system), slashing 
mainly long maturities (-30%) which nonethe -
less still represent the greater part of their inter -
bank debt. By contrast, the credit cooperatives 
increased their long- term interbank debt – the 
majority of which is to the central institutions – 
to the same extent as they did customer de -
posits (each by one- third).
The central significance of deposits as a source 
of funds for savings banks and credit coopera -
tives involves maturities on the liabilities side 
being shortened more extremely than is the 
case for other banking groups. Interest rates, 
which have fallen and have been low for quite 
some time across all investment horizons, have 
been encouraging customers to invest mainly 
in short- term, very liquid vehicles, provided 
they do not wish to invest in riskier vehicles. At 
present, some 90% of customer deposits at 
savings banks and credit cooperatives have an original maturity of up to one year. Shorter 
 maturities for customer deposits and a growing 
share of deposits as a percentage of overall 
funding have caused the percentage share of 
all liabilities with an original maturity of up to 
one year to rise from just over 60% in July 
2007 to now over 70% of overall liabilities of 
savings banks and credit cooperatives. This has 
also been observed, albeit to a somewhat 
limited extent, among regional banks, the 
 majority of which – much like the savings banks 
and credit cooperatives – are oriented towards 
classic deposit and lending business. Since their 
funding structure is quite similar to that of the 
savings banks and, in addition, the compos -
ition of this category of banks may fluctuate 
sharply over time, they will be ignored below.
Regional institutions of credit 
cooperatives
In their financial network, the two regional 
 institutions of credit cooperatives occupy a 
central position in redistributing liquidity among 
affiliated credit institutions. This is not only be -
cause of the, on the whole, small size of the 
1,047 credit cooperatives but also the strictly 
subsidiary organisational structure of the finan -
cial network, amongst other factors. Nearly 
half of funding is from the interbank market, 
though only just over one- third of these funds 
are taken up in the network – mostly short-  
term. The financial crisis has not changed this 
situation in any way. One- fifth is obtained via 
long- term capital market issuance, which, 
bucking the general trend, rose by one- third 
during the financial crisis. The credit coopera -
tives are the largest group of creditors, along -
side domestic households. Unsecuritised debt 
to non- banks, by contrast, is immaterial. The High share of 
very short- term financing among  networked  institutionsLiquidity redistri-bution function within the  collective still a

24 This comparison is based on the figures reported in the 
monthly balance sheet statistics; however, the savings 
banks’ business volume is slightly understated since S- Kre -

lending business, not deposit business. On the other hand, 
TeamBank AG, which performs a similar role for credit 
 cooperatives, is included in the statistics because it fulfils 
the definition of an MFI.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

main investors here are insurers and investment 
funds. Regional institutions hold next to no 
household deposits, since this is the role of the 
credit cooperatives.
Landesbanken
Although the Landesbanken, as the central 
 institutions of the savings banks, have played a 
similar role to that of the regional institutions 
of credit cooperatives, the business model of 
several institutions in this category has, in the 
past few years, clearly become more similar to 
that of the big banks. The abolition of the state 
guarantees and guarantors’ responsibility for 
ensuring their institutions’ solvency, along with 
the conditionality imposed by the European 
Commission in the financial crisis, have led to a 
fundamental change in the funding structure 
of the Landesbanken. In the wake of the finan -
cial crisis, funding via foreign banks and the 
capital market was slashed. The aggregate 
total assets of the Landesbanken contracted by 
nearly one- third, and the number of institu -
tions fell from 12 to nine.25 All three main fund -
ing sources account for a more or less equal 
share of the current funding structure of the 
Landesbanken, which is attributable to their 
role in the savings bank network, amongst 
other factors. Notwithstanding the similarities 
between the Landesbanken and big banks with 
regard to business model, the Landesbanken 
are thus still making significantly greater use of 
securitised debt for funding than big banks. 
 Although the Landesbanken, relative to the 
 regional institutions of credit cooperatives, are 
less active than in the past in fulfilling their role 
in redistributing liquidity throughout the net -
work, since many major savings banks are no 
longer dependent on such redistribution, they 
are discharging this function for the large num -
ber of smaller institutions, in particular.Discussion of developments 
in the financial crisis
Diversifying the funding 
 structure
A look at the funding structure of the individual 
banking categories shows that the banks can 
be divided into two “camps”: institutions which 
obtain funding largely from private non- banks 
(for savings banks and credit cooperatives, 
nearly three- quarters of total assets, and for 
 regional banks, two- thirds of total assets), and 
institutions with more highly diversified fund -
ing. The latter group encompasses mainly the 
larger banks, though the weighting of the indi -
vidual sources of funds can vary significantly 
depending on the bank’s business model. Such 
business models range from regional institu -
tions (regional institutions of credit coopera -
tives and Landesbanken) to major universal 
banks with extensive trading activity.
Concentration on a single source of funding 
carries with it a fundamental hazard of expos -
ure to a liquidity squeeze in crisis situations, 
whereas diversified funding structures, in prin -
ciple, contribute to securing liquidity. However, 
owing to institution- specific factors, this rule is 
not readily applicable to all sources of funding.

25 This comprises both DekaBank Deutsche Girozentrale 
and Landesbank Berlin AG, which from around the end of 
2014 or the beginning of 2015 began to focus almost 
 exclusively on business with its Berliner Sparkasse brand 
owing to a reorientation of its business activities. None of 
the three institutions that fell by the wayside exited the 
market entirely. Whereas Landesbank Sachsen and Landes -
bank Rheinland- Pfalz were taken over by Landesbank 
Baden-  Württemberg in 2008, Westdeutsche Landesbank 
was restructured. It was broken down into the state-  
owned Erste Abwicklungsanstalt (EAA) and Portigon AG, 
with only the former being liquidated. The erstwhile West -
LB’s network business was absorbed by Landesbank

deposits26 and thus render this source of fund -
ing comparatively stable even in crisis situ -
ations, and even if deposits are concentrated 
on a single group of customers and region. By 
contrast, short- term institutional deposits, 
which do not enjoy statutory protection, are 
generally withdrawn right away in the event of 
imminent distress or initial signs thereof.27 Con-
centration on this type of funding therefore 
poses a greater liquidity risk than on customer 
deposits. Diversification across multiple credit -
ors and regions will hardly mitigate the liquidity 
risk associated with short- term institutional 
 deposits. Even in the case of capital market-  
based financing, such as via securitisations, 
 impending disruptions can quickly lead to the 
respective market segment drying up, which 
would be tantamount to the elimination of this 
source of funding. However, a comparative 
 assessment of financing structures based solely 
on the composition of the liabilities side is 
hardly possible since the structure of the assets 
side likewise presents opportunities for acquir -
ing liquidity.
Incentives for secured funding
The disadvantages of funding via short- term 
 institutional deposits (“wholesale funding”) be -
came subject to intense public scrutiny during 
the financial crisis, as this was the first time that 
the attendant risks materialised on a large 
scale. Nevertheless, this form of funding con -
tinues to play an important role for banks, 
functioning as a buffer for short- term liquidity 
requirements. As the respective marginal cost 
of a bank’s debt refinancing is determined by 
wholesale funding in conjunction with the 
costs of capital market funding, wholesale 
funding is also used internally for the purposes 
of loan pricing. Generally speaking, wholesale 
funding is what larger banks focus on for the 
purposes of financing and, in particular, liquid -
ity management in order to ensure efficient 
 operations. However, the financial crisis has not 
only highlighted the danger of basing a fund -
ing strategy primarily on short- term institu -tional deposits  – it has also made investors 
more aware of counterparty credit risk, prompt -
ing them to hedge such risks and increase their 
demand for collateralised products. For ex -
ample, since the start of the financial crisis, 
short- term interbank loans have no longer 
been granted on an unsecured basis, but chiefly 
on a secured basis as repo transactions. Un -
covered debt securities are also increasingly 
being displaced by covered bonds. This trend 
towards secured funding, which began even 
before the crisis ensued, has been reinforced 
by the crisis and further boosted by recent 
regulation.
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR),28 which is 
being gradually phased in as of 2015, is very 
much influenced by the principle that short-  
term secured funding, particularly from institu -
tional investors, is less frequently withdrawn 
than short- term unsecured funding and can 
also be more readily substituted by the bor -
rower. That being said, the collateral is subject 
to certain liquidity requirements to ensure the 
underlying funding can be categorised as more 
stable.29 Institutions with a large portion of 
short- term funding are therefore likely to make 
increased use of secured funding as a way of 
fulfilling the LCR. However, such institutions Trend towards 
secured  funding …… is being boosted both by liquidity  regulation …
26 Covered deposits are deposits protected by a European 
Economic Area (EEA) member state up to the amount of 
€100,000 per depositor. See Article 6 of Directive 2014/ 49/
EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (2014).
27 See R Huang and L Ratnovski (2011), The dark side of 
wholesale funding, Journal of Financial Intermediation, 
Vol 20, pp 248-263.
28 The LCR is the ratio of the stock of highly liquid assets 
to the projected net cash outflows within 30 days in a 
 severe liquidity stress scenario. The LCR is being phased in 
gradually from 1 October 2015 (minimum required LCR: 
60%) until 2018 (minimum required LCR: 100%). See Com -
mission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/ 61 of 10 October 
2014 to supplement Regulation (EU) No 575/ 2013 of the 
European Parliament and the Council with regard to liquid -
ity coverage requirement for Credit Institutions.
29 For this purpose, the LCR defines the degree of liquidity 
that can be applied to the various assets. Secured funding 
transactions with the central bank are given special treat -
ment in this regard. For example, if a bank that is subject to 
LCR requirements borrows from a central bank, such fund -
ing is regarded as the most stable type of funding, irre -
spective of the liquidity of the collateral provided. It is 
therefore assumed that this type of funding can always be 
renewed upon maturity at the same conditions. See also 
the box on pp 53-54.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

(above all, larger private banks) usually have 
large stocks of highly liquid assets, such as sov -
ereign bonds with a 0% risk weighting. This 
provides them with an additional means of ful -
filling the LCR, as these assets can be used to 
compensate for high outflows of short- term 
unsecured funding.30 The adjustments made by 
German banks to date for the LCR are pre -
sented in the box above. The box on pages 50 
and 51 explains the extent to which  liquidity 
regulation could affect the structure of a bank’s 
holdings of assets and liabilities.
The incentive for secured funding has already 
been strengthened by regulatory changes and 
will potentially be further bolstered by another 
legal innovation that has applied in Germany 
since the start of 2015: the bail- in instrument.31 
This is because, as it is now possible to enforce 
creditor liability in the event of a bank being 
resolved, holders of unsecured claims must 
now anticipate a haircut even if no insolvency 
proceedings are carried out.32 Creditors of  secured liabilities, on the other hand, are 
 excluded from the bail- in procedure and in the 
event of liquidation may, in a best- case scen -
ario, be able to escape losses by selling the pro -
vided collateral. However, a high share of 
 secured funding in a bank’s balance sheet 
means that a large portion of assets are used as 
collateral and are therefore encumbered. For 
creditors of unsecured liabilities, this tends to

rulesAdjustment of German banks to the liquidity coverage ratio
Obligatory compliance with the liquidity cover-
age ratio (LCR) as of 1 October 2015 is not likely 
to require the majority of German banks to make any further adjustments. According to the report 
on the Basel III monitoring exercise for German 
institutions as of 30 June 2014,1 all banks in the 
sample2 already had an LCR above the 60% min-
imum requirement (capital shortfalls totalling €1.2 billion) at the end of June 2014, with the exception of one of the larger institutions (Group  1) and two smaller banks in Group 2. 
More than three- quarters of the banks in Group 2 
already even have an LCR above 100%, while 
the remaining institutions will still need to raise a 
total of 0.7% more liquid assets by 2018. Four 
banks in Group 1 still have to boost their liquid 
assets by 6.7% compared to the current level 
until they fully meet the LCR.
Convergence towards the minimum requirement 
was primarily achieved by accumulating liquid 
securities holdings (above all government 
bonds), which account for approximately half of the eligible holdings of high- quality liquid assets for the German banking sector as a whole. Par-ticularly in the euro- area aggregate, liquid secur-
ities (such as government bonds) are the most important components of high- quality liquid 
assets. For the larger banks (Group 1), the cash and central bank reserves component is, how-
ever, of equal importance.3 According to studies 
by the European Banking Authority (EBA),4 con-
vergence of European banks towards the LCR 
requirements has, to date, not had a dampening 
effect on lending to small and medium- sized non- fi  nancial corporations. However, given the current generous provision of liquidity by the Euro system, a regime for liquidity regulation might not impose any binding restrictions on 
the majority of banks at the current juncture.

30 In fact, in an initial assessment of the possible effects of 
the liquidity measures on European banks, the European 
Banking Authority (EBA) finds that well diversified large 
cross- border banks have thus far used large volumes of 
particularly liquid assets (securities) to compensate for their 
high level of potential short-  term cash outflows. See EBA 
(2013), Report on impact assessment for liquidity measures 
under Article 509(1) of the CRR.

recovery and resolution of banks, see Deutsche Bundes -

The bail- in instrument must be in force across Europe only 
as of 2016, but has already been implemented in Germany 
as of 2015.
32 The bail- in procedure is also subject to the provision

creditor is left worse off than they would have been in the 
event of insolvency.Deutsche Bundesbank

reduce the liable capital that can be drawn on 
in the event of liquidation. The introduction of 
the bail- in instrument could therefore bolster 
the trend towards secured funding by increas -
ing investor demand. However, the effects of 
this depend in large part on whether the bail- in 
appears credible to market participants. In 
order to ensure that, in spite of such effects, 
there is sufficient liable capital in the event of a 
bail- in, institutions must fulfil minimum require -
ments in terms of their holdings of equity cap -
ital and bail-  in- able liabilities. The issuance of 
unsecured bonds is therefore likely to become 
more expensive for banks in light of the higher 
loss given default that they entail.33 Covered 
 retail funding, as a source of unsecured fund -
ing excluded from the bail- in regime, could 
therefore become considerably more attractive 
still.34 Moreover, deposits from natural persons 
and small and medium- sized enterprises that 
exceed the covered volume enjoy priority over 
the majority of other bail- in- able liabilities held 
by other categories of creditors.35
Significance of funding 
through deposits
If increased funding through customer deposits 
leads to fiercer competition for these deposits, 
individual banks could find that such deposits 
become less stable if the average holding 
period (average time in which a deposit  remains 
at the bank irrespective of the agreed maturity) 
decreases as a result of adjustments in cus -
tomer behaviour. This effect is likely to be 
limited, however, as German households are 
generally fairly inactive in terms of reallocating 
assets. In comparison to other types of fund -
ing, regulators therefore continue to regard the 
deposits of private customers as a very stable 
source of funding alongside equity capital. In 
the LCR, this is reflected, above all, in the de -
fined outflow rates for certain types of funding 
in a liquidity stress situation. For example, the 
outflow rate for short- term unsecured funding 
(residual term of up to 30 days) through 
 financial corporations is assumed to be 100%, while the estimated outflow rate for deposits 
of private clients and small and medium- sized 
enterprises is likely to be a mere 10% in most 
cases.36 Higher outflow rates are assumed in 
some cases, for instance for very large deposits. 
In terms of fulfilling the LCR requirements, this 
approach is likely to chiefly benefit savings 
banks and credit cooperatives. These institu -
tions compensate for their relatively low hold -
ings of easy- to- sell liquid assets through high 
levels of deposit holdings (which are often not 
subject to interest rate fixation periods or only 
subject to such periods over the short term).
The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which is 
still under discussion, provides similar incen -
tives for short- term funding. Compliance with 
the NSFR is meant to make banks’ funding 
more stable in order, amongst other things, to 
prevent liquidity bottlenecks that can arise as a 
result of the low liquidity of (long- term encum -
bered) assets.37 The introduction to the Basel 
Committee’s draft rules explicitly mentions the 
counterparty, alongside residual maturity, as an 
indicator of a funding type’s stability.38 Accord -

Internalising the costs of externalities by introducing 
new  liquidity standards
In their function as service providers to the 
real economy, banks provide long- term 
loans to enterprises, which they fi  nance 
with short- term liabilities. Thus, a key pur-
pose of the banking system is to transform maturities. For performing this service, bank owners receive a premium, which, in effect, 
is their remuneration for creating liquidity. 
Given that interest rates normally climb the 
longer capital is tied up, there is an incen-
tive for banks, from an earnings perspec-
tive, to keep the terms of their liabilities as 
short as possible and to maximise the ma-
turities of their claims. However, if maturing debt is not rolled over, banks run the risk of 
no longer being able to meet their short- term obligations if their claims cannot be 
readily converted into cash at short notice 
(without incurring major losses) because 
they are tied up for the long term. As much 
as a bank can assume it will be bailed out 
by government in such a situation –  and can therefore pass on some of the risks 
 associated with this behaviour to society – 
it will incorporate (“internalise”) only part of the potential systemic costs of its behaviour 
into its operational calculations.1 Hence, 
from a macroeconomic perspective, that bank engages in an excessive degree of 
 maturity transformation.
This is where the liquidity standards come in. Their objective is to more comprehen-sively internalise the potential systemic costs associated with maturity transform-
ation, defi  ning minimum requirements for a 
liquidity buffer which banks must hold for 
periods of stress as well as for the maturity 
structures of their assets and liabilities. In Europe, these minimum requirements will 
be regulated in future on the basis of har-
monised and standardised liquidity stand-ards such as the liquidity coverage ratio
2 (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio3 
(NSFR).
Liquidity is determined by the structure of 
both the assets side and the liabilities side 
of the balance sheet. The longer the matur-ity structure on the assets side and the less 
readily disposable its components are, and 
the more the liabilities side is biased  towards 
short- term funding instruments that can 
easily be withdrawn by investors, the lower 
the bank’s liquidity will be. The  further a bank’s existing assets- side and  liabilities- side structures stray from the regulatory  liquidity standards, the higher the costs it 
will need to internalise in the future.
The LCR requires banks to have a stock of 
unencumbered high- quality liquid assets (HQLA) that can be converted easily into 
cash to cover total expected net cash out-
fl  ows in a 30-calendar- day liquidity stress scenario. The objective, then, is to ensure 
that every bank can survive a stress scenario 
marked by increased cash outfl  ows and  reduced cash infl  ows lasting roughly one 
month – if need be, by selling liquid assets 
from the liquidity reserve it is to maintain 
specifi  cally for this purpose. The impact of 
the conditions for, and the volume of liquid-ity provided by the central bank on a bank’s

scope for building up this regulatory liquid-
ity reserve should also be borne in mind 
(see the box on pages 53 and 54).
Under the LCR standard, run- off and infl  ow 
rates are infl  uenced primarily by the type of 
counterparty and degree of collateralisa-tion, with the assets and liabilities sides largely being treated symmetrically, espe-
cially in the case of short- term transactions 
with other fi  nancial agents. Short- term interbank loans collateralised by assets of 
similar liquidity, for instance, do not act to 
constrain intermediation chains within the banking sector given that rates of infl  ows 
from maturing loans and run- off rates from 
maturing funding are identical (both are 
high) in the 30-day window. These rates are 
lower for small and medium- sized enter-
prises because of the assumption that some 
of the infl  ows from maturing loans will be 
immediately lent out again. It is also con-
sidered very unlikely that their deposits will 
be withdrawn. Therefore, the banks that face the prospect of having to internalise more costs are primarily those with mis-matches, in terms of their counterparties 
and the degree of collateralisation for short- 
term capital market transactions, between the assets side and the liabilities side of 
their balance sheets.4
Compliance with the NSFR, meanwhile, is 
particularly costly for institutions with huge mismatches between residual maturities on 
their assets side and liabilities side. Short- term liabilities are only recognised as re-quired stable funding (RSF) for long- term 
assets (with residual maturities of one year 
or more) subject to capital deductions 
which vary according to their residual ma-
turities and counterparties. A lower level of 
RSF is needed for assets maturing within 
one year. Hence, increased maturity trans-
formation is one of the main reasons for a mismatch between RSF and available stable funding (ASF).
The comparison of liquidity characteristics on the assets and liabilities sides from the 
perspective of these standards means that 
an institution can generally adjust to meet 
the minimum liquidity provisions by con-tracting its balance sheet (scaling down 
long- term assets and short- term liabilities), 
by expanding its balance sheet (building up  long- term liabilities and short- term assets), or by substituting balance sheet items (swapping long- term assets/short- term liabilities for items with the opposite maturity structures). If the bank’s owners are not prepared to (fully) assume what 
might be a lower margin required for com-
pliance with the liquidity standards –  for  example, by  tolerating a lower dividend – 
the bank will try to pass on the costs that 
need to be  internalised to creditors and borrowers. Whether and how far a bank will venture down these paths is likely to depend inter alia on whether it faces the 
prospect of  losing market shares to com-petitors with lower costs to internalise, or on how much scope it has to save costs 
elsewhere in order to avoid putting an add-itional strain on its customers.
4 The central bank has a particular counterparty status. 
It is assumed, for example, that central bank loans 
can always be renewed at the same conditions upon 
 maturity. See the box on pp 53-54.Deutsche Bundesbank

 financial and sovereign debt crisis has shown 
that large depositors and institutional lenders 
have reacted more quickly to changes in insti -
tution- specific and market- wide risks.
Increased maturity 
 transformation
However, the advantages of funding through 
deposits (low volatility, no need for collateral 
and low costs) are coupled with poor control 
over the maturity structure, which is becoming 
particularly apparent in the current interest rate 
environment. As already stated, a clear short -
ening of maturities on the liabilities side has 
been observed, particularly for categories of 
banks that rely heavily on deposits as a source 
of funding. However, as the maturities for loans 
on the assets side have not shortened to the 
same degree over the last seven years, savings 
banks and credit cooperatives are subject more 
than most to an increased maturity transform -
ation risk in their balance sheets. Beyond the 
liquidity risk effect, an increased interest rate 
risk also arises from the differences in the inter -
est rate fixation periods, which have also 
widened, between the liabilities side and the 
assets side.39 While the big banks are also sub -
ject to a relatively high maturity transformation 
risk, this risk has not risen sharply during the 
crisis. This is because although big banks have 
increased their recourse to funding through de -
posits, this represents a comparatively minor 
source of funding for them and they have not 
expanded their use of short- term institutional 
funding. By contrast, the regional institutions 
of credit cooperatives as well as the two cat -
egories of banks heavily affected by restructur -
ings –  Landesbanken and mortgage banks  – 
have scaled back their short- term funding, 
though to differing extents. All other things 
being equal, this points to a lower liquidity risk 
from maturity transformation.
The experience of the financial crisis has shown 
that there is a strong correlation between the 
probability of an institution becoming dis -tressed and it having a high level of maturity 
transformation and/or having a large propor -
tion of short- term institutional funding in rela -
tion to overall funding. It is these risks that the 
various regulatory changes implemented in 
 recent years, or currently at the planning stage, 
aim to influence. The objective is to constrain 
maturity transformation more strongly than in 
the past, while at the same time providing 
 incentives for sustainable funding. However, an 
explanation is provided on pages 53 and 54 as 
to why the call for banks to maintain liquidity 
buffers in no way impinges on the central 
bank’s role in the provision of liquidity. With 
 regard to the fulfilment of the NSFR, liabilities 
with a residual maturity of more than one year 
are considered 100% stable. In a similar fash -
ion to the  arrangement under the LCR, the sta -
bility of short- term funding under the NSFR will 
probably be recognised in staggered percent -
ages depending on the residual maturity and 
the  respective counterparty. The available 
stable funding must be at least as high as the 
required stable funding calculated on the basis 
of the residual maturities of assets and the 
characteristics of borrowers. Assets with longer 
residual maturities need to be backed by higher 
levels of stable funding than those with shorter 
 residual maturities. However, if an institution 
encumbers a short- term asset that is otherwise 
classed as liquid –  for example by using a 
 security as collateral for a longer- term refinan -
cing operation – this reduces the liquidity of 
the assets side, which must be balanced 
 accordingly through stable (long- term) fund -
ing.
Furthermore, the transposition of Basel III into 
European law in 2013 took account of the fact 
that a comfortable capital base and adequate 
capital buffer can significantly improve a bank’s 
stability. The stricter requirements for banks’ 
capital adequacy are a step in the right direc -Heightened

Liquidity regulation and provision of liquidity 
by the central bank
The key objective of achieving liquidity 
regulation that is harmonised at the Euro-pean level and internationally coordinated 
is to internalise the costs of macroeconomic 
external effects resulting from excessive maturity transformation by the banking 
 system. The purpose of the liquidity cover-
age ratio (LCR) is to ensure that certain 
 liquidity buffers are available at the single- 
entity level in the event of a stress phase. As 
a consequence, excessive maturity trans-formation, as witnessed in the run- up to the fi  nancial crisis for some institutions, 
 entails additional costs, thus making a non- sustainable assumption of risk less attractive 
to banks. At the same time, the LCR is to reduce this risk by “making credit institu-tions less dependent on […] central bank 
liquidity provision” according to the recitals of the Regulation
1 (see fi  rst recital).2 During 
the fi  nancial crisis, it became necessary for 
central banks to provide liquidity at favour-able conditions and in generous amounts in order to help protect banks against a short-
age of funds. The cost of external effects 
resulting from excessive maturity transform-ation, which was essentially taken on by the central bank through its extensive provision 
of liquidity, was not internalised by the 
banks to the specifi  ed extent.
The LCR- based buffer could, however, prove ineffective for several reasons. First, 
institutions may choose not to make use of 
their liquidity reserves during tense market 
phases. For reputational reasons, they would prefer to avoid falling below the  liquidity coverage ratio despite being 
allowed to do so by the supervisory author-
ities. They could achieve this by, for ex-
ample, selling long- term assets to increase 
their holdings of highly liquid assets – even 
if this can only be done at unfavourable conditions on account of being in a stress 
phase. Second, the protective LCR shield 
 installed by the central bank may be fl  awed 
if some of the extra costs to be carried by 
the banks as a result of the regulation are 
essentially taken on by the central bank in 
advance. Although the liquidity regulation 
can determine which assets are deemed to 
be liquid for the purpose of fulfi  lling pru-
dential ratios, the liquidity characteristic of 
an asset does not necessarily have to con-
form with this regulatory assessment at all 
times. This is mainly due to the fact that the central bank’s ability to set the volume and 
conditions for creating central bank re-
serves largely determines which assets can 
ultimately be converted into central bank 
reserves and, therefore, also into cash at a 
given point in time.
It is not least due to this role of a central bank that the regulation stipulates that – unlike most other short- term liabilities – recourse to central bank loans must not 
 entail any additional costs under the LCR, ie 
no highly liquid assets have to be held to cover such lending.
3 Hence, it is assumed 
for LCR purposes that central bank loans scheduled to be repaid within the next 30  days may constantly be renewed, re-gardless of the regulatory quality of the

for Credit Institutions. Gradual implementation from 
1 October 2015.
2 Recital (3) is even more specifi  c: “During such a 
[30-day stress] period, a credit institution should be 
able to convert quickly its liquid assets into cash with-
out recourse to central bank liquidity or public funds, 
which may result in its liquidity coverage ratio falling 
temporarily below the 100% level.”

results in lower earnings. For detailed information, see the box on pp 50-51.Deutsche Bundesbank

 collateral held. This rule originates from the 
fact that central bank loans are, in principle, 
the most important standard refi  nancing 
operation in the Eurosystem. Furthermore, 
claims on the central bank are largely con-
sidered highly liquid assets as they represent a fi  nal means of payment, ie liquidity in the strict sense of the term. The LCR cannot be abstracted from the role of the central bank given that the refi  nancing of banks through 
the central bank is absolutely imperative due to cash outfl  ows alone and cannot, 
therefore, be equated with refi  nancing via 
other sources. Since the central bank can determine the volume of central bank re-
serves and the conditions for creating these, it can, in principle, greatly extend the defi  n-
ition of liquidity formulated in the LCR as 
and when it wishes.
However, this opens a window for regula-
tory arbitrage on the part of institutions, 
 especially in times when there is an abun-
dance of monetary policy refi  nancing oper-ations. Banks are then able to submit assets 
which are not or only to an extent recog-
nised as being liquid for LCR purposes due 
to a lower level of liquidity in the market 
(ie level 2 A/B assets) to the central bank for 
refi  nancing and also deposit the funds re-
ceived with the central bank. Subsequently, 
these assets are deemed highly liquid 
(level 1 assets) and are in principle fully rec-
ognised under the LCR.4 Given the special 
role of the central bank in regulatory terms, 
the LCR can easily be exceeded, even in li-
quidity stress phases, through recourse to 
central bank loans. By means of its condi-
tions – eg regarding the scope of the collat-
eral framework, the level of haircuts and 
the refi  nancing costs  – the central bank  determines how easily banks can obtain central bank reserves and, by extension, 
assets deemed liquid by the regulators.5However, in an environment where central 
bank loans are becoming more attractive 
compared with other sources of funding for 
a longer period of time, this bears the risk 
of the LCR not being able to work prevent-
ively and, therefore, losing its power as a protective shield against using the central bank as lender of last resort. This would mean that a share of the costs resulting 
from excessive liquidity and maturity trans-
formations that need to be internalised would be shouldered by the central bank and, thus, ultimately, by the taxpayer. The 
LCR may fail to have a preventive effect as it 
does not necessarily refl  ect institutions’ 
 resilience to liquidity shortages in the mar-
ket and is, instead, largely shaped by the 
behaviour of the central bank. It will be all the more important for institutions to  defi  ne the necessity and scope of further individual 
liquidity reserves beyond the minimum re-
quirements prescribed by the LCR. Together with the central bank, regulators are called 
upon to monitor this process in a far- 
sighted manner with a view to reducing the 
probability of future liquidity risks and pro-
moting the broadest possible internalisation of costs arising from increased  liquidity and maturity transformations by the proprietors of banks.
4 The treatment of minimum reserves in this context is 
based on agreements between the supervisory author-ity and the central bank (see Article 10 (1b) point (iii) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/ 61.
5 When pursuing an expansionary monetary policy 
strategy, of which the main monetary policy instru-ment is bond purchases, recourse to central bank 
 operations improves an institution’s LCR only if bonds 
are purchased that, unlike central bank reserves, are 
not regarded as highly liquid for LCR purposes.Deutsche Bundesbank

tion. Nevertheless, banks’ resilience is not 
something that can be created through regula -
tory provisions alone. Indeed, it depends, 
amongst other things, on the extent to which 
banks can generate equity capital internally on 
a sustainable basis; ie the extent to which they 
have a tenable business model.
Earnings structure of  German 
banks
Impact of the financial crisis
The business models of German banks have 
been put to the test by the financial crisis. 
Credit institutions that focus primarily on 
deposit-  financed lending have thus far gone 
 almost entirely unscathed. These include the 
majority of savings banks and credit coopera -
tives, as well as numerous regional banks, 
which have therefore scarcely needed to 
change their business activities at all in recent 
years.40 However, due to their strong depend -
ence on interest income from the traditional 
lending business, the current low- interest- rate 
environment presents a great challenge for 
these banks. By expanding the volume of their 
lending and deposit business and increasing 
maturity transformation, the institutions in 
question are attempting to sidestep the down -
ward pressure on profitability caused by the 
current interest rate environment. Therefore, 
the profitability of savings banks and credit 
 cooperatives, which has hardly changed on 
 aggregate, has been maintained largely at the 
expense of higher interest rate risks. Stable 
profitability is of major importance for these 
categories of banks, as they are almost exclu -
sively dependent on profit retention for build -
ing up equity capital. If the extreme low-  
interest- rate environment persists, this could 
require adjustments to be made at the relevant 
institutions. This could also include sharehold -
ers having to shoulder a greater burden.
By contrast, as described in the previous sec -
tions, business models that do not focus pri -marily on the traditional lending and deposit 
business have been hit hard by the crisis. From 
the 1990s to 2007, a clear expansion of finan -
cial market exposure and interbank transac -
tions was observable among larger German 
banks on both the assets and the liabilities side, 
particularly among the big banks and Landes -
banken. The expansion into the field of invest -
ment banking went hand in hand with a 
greater diversification of income sources, with 
income from trading and commission becom -
ing significantly more important, alongside 
interest income, in relation to total assets. 
However, this expansion was also  accompanied 
by higher income volatility. By contrast, the 
 expansion in interbank market  activity entailed 
a less volatile business area, yet one with rela -
tively low margins (see the chart on page 56).
Although, on aggregate, the business volumes 
of both areas grew strongly, the individual 
banks did not expand uniformly in each field. 
Some of the big banks placed their strategic 
focus on investment banking, while the re -
maining large institutions among the various 
categories of banks were either relatively strong 
in the retail business or expanded vigorously on 
the interbank market by virtue of their role as a 
regional institution of a networked banking 
group. The large share of relatively low- margin 
interbank business in relation to their total 
business volume is the reason why the regional 
institutions of credit cooperatives and the Lan -
desbanken have historically had rather low 
 returns and profits compared to other larger 
 institutions (see the chart on page  56).41 By 
contrast, up until the financial crisis, the big 
banks had a superior profitability ratio to most 
other larger German banks, particularly com -
pared to Landesbanken that pursued a similar 
business model. The greater size of their trad -Networked insti-
tutions stabilise income through increased  maturity trans-formationInvestment banking  increases profit volatility, …

40 As there are certainly heterogeneous developments 
among the savings banks too, this statement cannot be 
automatically applied to every institution. However, it 
 applies to the majority of the institutions and thus to this 
category of banks in aggregate.

while return on total assets is used as the measure of prof -
itability.Deutsche Bundesbank

ing portfolio in relation to their overall business 
volume is likely to have contributed to this. 
However, the higher profits and more diversi -
fied income structure go hand in hand with the 
trading business’s higher earnings volatility, 
which in turn implies increased vulnerability to 
crises. Thus, during the financial crisis, poor 
profitability was largely attributable to losses in 
the trading business.
Consequences of low earnings
When viewed in isolation, persistently low 
earnings do not initially represent increased 
solvency risk. However, they restrict a bank’s 
capacity to generate capital internally that can 
be used to offset losses. Credit institutions with 
weak earnings are significantly more depend -
ent than comparable better- performing banks 
on their shareholders’ willingness to implement 
capital increases to cover any losses. The prob -
lem of high risk propensity combined with only 
limited potential to generate capital –  on 
 account of weak earnings, for instance – was 
revealed during the financial crisis, particularly 
at a number of institutions in the big banks and 
Landesbanken sectors, which would have had 
to be liquidated if not for government support 
measures.42 In principle, such support meas -
ures run counter to a market economy system, 
especially if they lend credence to the impres -
sion that government assistance will be granted 
more or less automatically in a crisis situation. 
The rules resolved upon under the German Act 
Implementing the Bank Recovery and Reso -
lution Directive (BRRD) (BRRD- Umsetzungs-
gesetz) , and notably the bail- in instrument dis -
cussed above, aim inter alia  to facilitate the 
resolution of institutions in which going-  
concern risk gives rise to systemic risk and to 
avoid the socialisation of costs during a crisis, if 
possible. 43
Landesbanken
As a result of experiences in the financial crisis, 
but also due to more restrictive banking regula -tion (Basel III), the four largest Landesbanken 
analysed in this article have improved their loss- 
absorbing capacity (see the chart on page 58). 
For example, as against 2006 they have delev -
eraged and reduced the risk contained in their 
balance sheets, and as a result of this in par -
ticular, they have increased their regulatory 
tier 1 capital ratio. In the aggregate, the above- 
average balance sheet reductions made by the 
Landesbanken since the onset of the financial 
crisis compared with the other German cat -
egories of banks are likely to also be closely 
linked to the poor profit situation.44 Since the 
shareholders of the Landesbanken, primarily 
the public savings banks (associations), were 
slow to provide additional capital, but at the 
same time internal capital generation was diffi -
cult owing to a lack of profits, the only remain -
ing means by which the Landesbanken them -
selves could meet the capital requirements was 
(regulatory) balance sheet reduction.
Regional institutions of credit cooperatives
Another development was evident among the 
regional institutions of credit cooperatives, 
however, which allowed their business model 
to focus more strongly than the Landesbanken 
on their liquidity redistributing function within 
the collective. Although the biggest regional 
 institutions of credit cooperatives also had to 
shoulder considerable losses during the finan -
cial crisis, the additional capital requirements Low earnings

that arose as a result of this were covered by

the Landesbanken, therefore, no balance sheet 
reduction was seen at the regional institutions 
of credit cooperatives in the past few years, 
since the injection of capital meant that toxic 
assets could be quickly cleaned up.
Big banks
The big banks – some of which are significantly 
more active in investment banking than the 
Landesbanken and regional institutions of 
credit cooperatives – also had to realise consid -
erable losses in the financial crisis. On aggre -gate, this prevented this category of bank from 
building up its capital by retaining profits be -
tween 2007 and 2013, which is probably why 
the big banks pursued the aim of covering their 
capital needs on the market. However, govern -
ment recapitalisation could not be avoided in 
one case.45 In contrast to the development at 
the Landesbanken, the average risk content of 
the assets held by the two parent undertakings 
domiciled in Germany did not decline during 
the financial crisis (see the chart above). How -

led to a clear increase in their tier 1 capital ratio 
and a reduction in their leverage.
Dealing with weak earnings
Not only the negative repercussions of the 
 financial and sovereign debt crisis on financial 
market activity, especially with regard to riskier 
bank products (eg subordinated bonds and 
structured products), but also the push towards 
separating certain lines of business from the 
core bank (eg proprietary trading) are likely to 
make considerable changes necessary to the 
business models of the big banks in particu -
lar.46 In addition, the persistently weak earnings 
in the big banks sector since 2007 will probably 
bring about more far- reaching structural 
changes, enabling them to remain attractive to 
investors on the one hand and not be too 
heavily dependent on external capital sources 
by generating capital internally on the other. 
There is already a trend towards renewed activ -
ity in their traditional lending business, for 
 instance. In this context, the target group of 
the big banks, just like the rest of the larger 
German banks regardless of the category of 
bank in which they are included, is likely to be 
major non- financial corporations. The fiercer 
competition for a customer segment for which 
financing via bank loans is significantly less 
 important than for smaller enterprises is likely 
to restrict earnings potential in this business 
segment, however. An upturn in the capital 
market would be advantageous from an earn -
ings perspective for the big banks in particular, 
as their business models are actually geared to -
wards capital market activities. In this setting, 
the European Commission’s plans to create a 
capital markets union –  and notably to har -
monise the legal requirements for securitising 
claims on small and medium- sized enterprises – 
are likely to open up positive prospects for 
these banks.
In principle, there are two conceivable options 
for tackling operationally weak earnings and thus implicit capital restrictions: concentrating 
on specific business areas that are higher-  
earning but simultaneously tie up less capital 
while total assets remain more or less un -
changed, or significantly shrinking the bank 
balance sheet.47 Traditional lending business, 
for example, potentially offers good earnings 
opportunities, but unlike financial market trans -
actions it tends to be more capital- intensive 
from a regulatory perspective.48 Furthermore, 
the still relatively high- margin traditional bank -
ing business is already occupied in Germany by 
a number of categories of banks, especially in 
the areas of small and medium- sized enter -
prises and households. Banks’ expansion op -
portunities in business with major non- financial 
corporations are also limited owing to their 
funding structure (high significance of internal 
market funding and capital market funding, 
amongst other factors). Taken by itself, compe -
tition in this field, which is probably growing 
nonetheless, is likely to involve a narrowing of 
the interest margin for most of the categories 
of German banks.
An institution’s prospective survival vitally de -
pends on it having a sustainable business 
model, which means, in other words, that it 
can access sufficient income sources in the 
 future, too. In this regard, it is not the task of 
supervisors to stipulate specific business 
models, but rather to promote competition in 
the banking system that boosts efficiency and 
to ensure that credit institutions with structur -
ally weak earnings which are experiencing real … but probably 
cannot avoid developing strat -
egies to stabilise their earningsScarcity of  capital at banks 
entails economic problems
Need for 
 efficient compe-tition in the  German banking system
46 The universal banking principle in Germany is not being 
called into question by the current regulatory initiatives. For 
an overview of structural changes at big banks in an inter -
national comparison, see PwC, Structural reform study: 
Supplementary report 2, November 2014.
47 While temporarily weak earnings can also be tackled by 
reducing fixed costs, structurally weak earnings are only 
likely to be remedied in the long term by sustainably 
 increasing operating income.
48 The main portion of the interest margin – by far the 
most important operating income across all categories of 
banks – is generated through traditional deposit and lend -
ing business in the German banking system. The average 
has been roughly 90% since 2003. Source: Deutsche Bun -

solvency problems exit the market significantly 
faster than was previously the case, regardless 
of their size.
Conclusion
This article made the conceptual distinction 
 between specific categories of business models 
along three dimensions, specifically the legal 
form of banks, their asset and liability structure 
–  the latter focusing on their funding struc -
ture  – and their earnings position. Although 
there has been considerable consolidation in 
the German banking system in recent decades, 
this occurred mostly within the individual 
 pillars. This means that the ownership structure 
has barely changed in the aggregate. By con -
trast, the funding mix has been subject to sig -
nificant change since the financial crisis, 
 although essential characteristics of the individ -
ual categories of banks have been retained. 
Larger banks, for instance, increasingly  returned 
to traditional banking business, with a business 
model geared towards the money market and 
capital market. This is likely to be a result of 
 restrained capital market activity primarily in 
the area of bank products (eg bank debt instru -
ments, derivative instruments, securitisations) 
and weak earnings, but also of the new regula -
tory requirements stemming from the experi -
ence gained during the crisis. As long as the 
first two factors, in particular, continue to exist, 
it can be assumed that larger banks will prob -ably step up their involvement in traditional 
lending and deposit business in the future, too.
Weak earnings imply difficulties in generating 
capital internally. If banks that are de facto  
 insolvent are then not permitted to exit the 
market, this can trigger negative repercussions 
for the economy and monetary policy. One of 
the objectives of the new banking regulation is 
to facilitate the resolution of banks without 
government assistance. The aim is to reduce 
both the probability and necessity of govern -
ment intervention by introducing more strin -
gent requirements for banks’ loss- absorbing 
capacity. Furthermore, when regulators and 
supervisors assess the viability of a bank, they 
will place greater emphasis than before on its 
ability to generate capital internally. Only banks 
with a sustainable business model can thor -
oughly fulfil their financing function in the 
economy over the long term. All of the reforms 
to banking regulation that are currently being 
initiated serve the purpose of making the finan -
cial system more stable, and should therefore 
be supported as a step in the right direction, 
not just from a monetary policy perspective. 
The significantly stricter regulatory require -
ments in a sub- sector of the financial system, 
specifically the banking sector, increase the in -
centives for regulatory  arbitrage, however. The 
reform of banking regulation therefore has to 
be promptly supplemented with corresponding 
measures in the other sectors.Deutsche Bundesbank

Euro coins held for transaction purposes  
in Germany
According to estimates using the seasonal method, the volume of euro coins held for transaction 
purposes in Germany in 2011 stood at €2.3 billion; this corresponds to around 36% of the total 
volume of German (ie issued by the Deutsche Bundesbank) euro coins in circulation. €1 and 
€2 coins accounted for 76% of the total volume of coins by value held for transaction purposes. 
In recent years, the volumes of coins held for transaction purposes of almost all denominations 
have remained the same. Only the volume of €2 coins held for transaction purposes has increased 
significantly, which has made a notable contribution to growth in the circulation of this denom -
ination. Unlike the other motives behind the demand for coins, it is comparatively easy to model 
the transaction motive empirically (via cash consumption). Structural models are therefore the 
most suitable method of determining the demand for €2 coins. At less than 30%, the transaction 
balance shares of small denomination coins (1 and 2 cent coins) are comparatively low. This is 
because larger volumes of them are lost or people hoard them in order to lighten their wallet or 
purse. On balance, German euro coins in circulation abroad are probably only to be found in 
countries outside the euro area where they are being hoarded on a permanent basis. Owing to 
insufficient data, the volumes of coins held for domestic transaction purposes by sector cannot 
be fully captured. Households and credit institutions accounted for the largest share.Deutsche Bundesbank

Background information
Since the introduction of euro banknotes and 
coins, there has been a marked upward trend 
in the demand for euro coins issued in Ger -
many.1 At the start of 2002, there were only 
€3.8 billion worth of coins in circulation (11.1 
billion coins); however, by the end of 2014, this 
figure had risen steadily to €7.4 billion (32.5 bil -
lion coins). In statistical terms, this recently 
worked out at 403 coins with a value of €92 
euro for each person living in Germany. Growth 
in 1 and 2 cent coins has been particularly 
 pronounced. In Germany, 208 coins of these 
denominations are held per capita .
Coins in circulation are used for the following 
purposes: first, the (domestic) transaction bal -
ance for purchases; second, (domestic) hoard -
ing; and third, foreign demand. Coins may be 
hoarded permanently or temporarily. Based on 
the broad definition applied here, this not only 
comprises classic hoarding as a store of value 
and the regular setting aside of coins to be 
used as small change, eg for vending machines 
(temporary hoarding), it also includes leakages 
in the form of coins that are part of a collec -
tion, as well as coins that are lost or damaged 
(permanent hoarding). The breakdown of Ger -
man coins in circulation into the various cat -
egories of use has not yet been examined in 
more detail. However, it is clear from the fig -
ures provided that the rise in the number of 
these coins cannot be explained simply by the 
increase in the transaction balance, especially 
since the decrease in the proportion of house -
holds’ expenditure in cash does not exactly 
suggest sharp growth in the volume of coins 
held for domestic transaction purposes. In this 
article, we seek to estimate the level and pat -
terns over time of these transaction balances.2 
The remainder of the total volume of coins in 
circulation is accounted for by the domestic 
hoarding balances and the foreign demand for 
German euro coins.
The volume of euro coins held for transaction 
purposes in Germany is of interest for the fol -lowing reasons. First, it is relevant to seignior -
age. Responsibility for minting euro coins lies 
with the national governments of the euro-  
area countries. In Germany, while the Federal 
Ministry of Finance is responsible for minting 
coins, it is the Bundesbank’s task to bring them 
into circulation. In order to do so, it purchases 
them from the Federal Ministry of Finance at 
their face value. The difference between the 
face value and the minting costs is known as 
seigniorage. Unlike the issuance of banknotes, 
the seigniorage generated from the issuance of 
coins is collected directly by the Federal Minis -
try of Finance. The total value of all the coins to 
be brought into circulation every year has to be 
approved by the Governing Council of the ECB.
If the overall demand for coins is broken down 
into the categories “transaction balance”, 
“hoarding” and “foreign demand”, the sources 
of seigniorage from the coins in circulation can 
be determined. While coins held for transaction 
purposes circulate comparatively quickly, coins 
that are hoarded and coins that are held abroad 
circulate slowly. The latter two categories thus 
result in a higher volume of coins in circulation. 
It is therefore beneficial to the government 
budget if a large proportion of coins are 
hoarded and in circulation abroad.
The volume of German 1 and 2 cent coins 
(known as small denomination coins) in circula -
tion has risen sharply over the past few years 
and a large number of small denomination 
deutsche Mark coins have not yet been re -
turned to the Bundesbank.3 This raises the Reasons for

1 The (statistical) circulation of euro coins issued in Ger -
many corresponds to the accumulated net issuance of euro 
coins by the Bundesbank. In this article, these coins will 
also be referred to as “German” euro coins in circulation 
and the circulation of “German” euro coins. According to 
this definition, these coins do not necessarily have to have 
a “German” national reverse side, since the Bundesbank 
also (re)circulates coins with foreign national reverse sides.

question as to how often small denomination 
coins are actually used in cash transactions, ie 
held for transaction purposes. Because of their 
low face value, they are not very useful as a 
store of value for the purpose of savings. More -
over, if the main reason for using small denom -
ination coins in transactions is to provide exact 
change, then phasing out these coins could 
help make payment transactions slightly more 
efficient. This is why, up to now, the euro- area 
countries Belgium, Finland and the Netherlands 
have introduced a rounding rule, according to 
which the payment amount is rounded up or 
down to the nearest five cents at the point of 
sale. The findings of a survey on payment be -
haviour conducted by the Bundesbank indicate 
that Germans are not especially interested in 
the introduction of a rounding rule at the 
 moment.4 However, no clear trend can be 
 derived from the responses. Another factor to 
consider here is the cost of producing small de -
nomination coins, which is less than their face 
value.
Ultimately, determining the transaction balance 
also plays a role in forecasting coin circulation. 
The Bundesbank forecasts the change in circu -
lation for each denomination every January 
and September as part of its cash requirement 
planning for the Federal Ministry of Finance.5 It 
does so using time series models. In principle, 
forecasts using structural models which map 
the individual motives of the demand for cash, 
such as transactions and hoarding, can be used 
as an alternative. However, it is difficult to find 
suitable variables for this. It is more or less pos -
sible to capture the transaction motive using a 
proxy variable for consumption paid for using 
coins (“cash consumption”). It is much more 
difficult to find an opportunity cost variable for 
the hoarding motive. Therefore, the greater the 
extent to which developments in the circula -
tion of coins are driven by the transaction bal -
ance, the more suitable structural models are 
for creating forecasts.Seasonal method
The aim of the seasonal method is to filter out 
information about the volume of coins held for 
transaction purposes in Germany from the sea -
sonal structure of coins in circulation.6 This is 
based on the assumption that holdings of coins 
for transaction purposes have a more pro -
nounced seasonal structure than the total vol -
ume of coins in circulation. The latter ultimately 
also includes hoarding balances and foreign 
demand. Neither is likely to have much to do 
with seasonal developments in Germany. The 
calculation formula for the share of the domes -
tic transaction balance in the volume of coins 
in circulation is derived and described in the 
box entitled “Seasonal method” on pages 64 
and 65.
Shares of German euro coins 
in circulation held for domestic 
transaction purposes
The share of coins held for domestic transac -
tion purposes in the total volume of coins in 
circulation is determined both for total circula -
tion by value (total for all denominations) of 
German euro coins (ie those issued by the Bun -
desbank) as well as for the circulation of these 
coins by denomination. Based on the calcula -
tion formula, the transaction balance shares 
can only be determined up to and including 
2011, even though the database covers 2002 
to 2012. The years 2002 and 2003 were not 
taken into consideration on account of the dis -
tortions to coin circulation following the intro -
duction of euro banknotes and coins. The share

Seasonal method
The seasonal model is based on the as-
sumption that the time series of the cumu-
lative value- based net issuance of euro 
coins by the Bundesbank (volume of “Ger-
man” euro coins in circulation in terms 
of  value) consists of three parts: a trend  component T
t, a seasonal term St and an 
irregular component. These are to be linked 
together on a multiplicative basis (multi-plicative seasonal model). Assigning the  irregular component to the trend for the sake of simplicity and taking into account the fact that some of the coins are in 
 domestic hoards or abroad, it follows that
(1) TtSt=Td
tSd
t+Ta
tSa
t,
where t represents the time index, d  de-
notes the domestic transaction balance and 
a stands for domestic hoards and euro 
coins circulating outside the country (for-
eign demand). If /beta.stt now captures the share 
of the total trend to be found in the domes-
tic transaction balance and, consequently, 
(1 – /beta.stt ) is the corresponding share of do-
mestic hoards and of foreign demand, it 
follows that
(2) St=tSd
t+ (1t)Sa
t.
On the assumption that there is not any 
season in the domestic hoards and in for-
eign demand, ie Sa = 1 for all t , Equation 
(2) can be further simplifi  ed to
(3) St=tSd
t+ (1t).
Given the values for the seasonal terms S 
and Sd, an equation is produced for the 
 unknown value /beta.stt, the domestic transac-
tion balance share of German euro coins
(4) t=St1
Sd
t1.St corresponds to the seasonal fi  gure of the 
value- based German euro coins in circula-
tion and can be determined by applying the 
usual methods of seasonal adjustment (eg 
X12-ARIMA, Tramo/Seats). Sd, on the other 
hand, the season of the domestic transac-
tion balance, is unknown. This has to be ap-
proximated. Equation (4) does not always 
deliver meaningful results, however. If, for 
example, there is no seasonal adjustment in 
any given period, ie St = Std = 1, /beta.stt tends 
to infi  nity and/or every value of /beta.stt is com-
patible with Equation (4). It is then not pos-
sible to identify /beta.stt unambiguously. Prob-
lems may also arise if the seasonality of the 
total value- based coins in circulation is not 
more weakly pronounced in every period than that of the domestic transaction bal-
ance.1 This method thus produces plausible 
results for some, but not for all periods.
Therefore, further modifi  cations are needed 
to allow for such cases and to be able to 
apply this method. It is often the case that 
meaningful estimation results are obtained 
only for certain frequencies within a year.2 
With regard to the total value- based Ger-
man euro coins in circulation, the seasonal 
high lies in December, for example, but the seasonal low is in January. This is therefore 
an instance of a one- month frequency. In order to factor this into the equation, we 
replace the time index t with m,j, where m 
denotes the mth month and j stands for the 
jth year. If Equation (3) for January is sub-tracted from the corresponding equation 
1 If the seasonality of the domestic transaction bal-
ance is more pronounced than that in the domestic 
hoards and in foreign demand, the following applies 
to values greater than 1: St < Std, for values smaller 
than 1: St > Std.

the domestic transaction balance /beta.stj is given 
as
(5) j=Sdec,jSjan,j +1

jan,j +1.
The next thing to do is to approximate the 
unknown seasonal amplitude of the do-
mestic transaction balance in the denomin-
ator of Equation (5). To do this, the sea-
sonal amplitude of a transaction variable tr, 
∆S(tr), is used, ie the difference between 
the seasonal high and the seasonal low of 
this transaction variable. The selected trans-
action variable should capture the domestic 
transaction demand for coins as accurately 
as possible. Here, real cash consumption is used as the transaction variable. This corres-ponds to those components of real private consumption that are usually (also) paid for 
with coins.3 Furthermore, the seasonal 
amplitude of the transaction variable and/or real cash consumption still has to be multi-plied by the transaction and/or income elas-
ticity in order to convert the “transaction 
variable” unit into the “value of coins in cir-
culation” unit. A value of 0.5 is set for the 
transaction elasticity. This derives from cash 
management theory for notes and coins that are used for the payment of regular 
transactions.4 Equation (5) thus becomes
(6) j=Sdec,j−Sjan,j +1
Sd
dec,j−Sd
jan,j +1
⇡Sdec,j−Sjan,j +1
0,5·S(tr).
Finally, owing to the availability of data on 
cash consumption, there also has to be a 
changeover from monthly data to quarterly data (q). The seasonal amplitude of the total 
value- based quarterly volume of German 
euro coins in circulation (in the numerator) corresponds to the difference between the seasonal factor of coins in circulation in the 
second quarter of the year j  and the sea-
sonal factor of coins in circulation in the fi  rst quarter of the following year j + 1.5 The 
seasonal amplitude of cash consumption (in the denominator) is equal to the difference 
between the seasonal factor of cash con-
sumption in the fourth quarter and its sea-
sonal factor in the fi  rst quarter of the fol-
lowing year. The calculation formula for the domestic transaction balance’s share of the total volume of German euro coins in circu-
lation is thus
(7) 
j⇡Sq2,j−Sq1,j+1
0,5·q4,j;q1,j+1S(tr),
where ∆S(tr) stands for the difference 
 between the seasonal high and the sea-
sonal low of real cash consumption.

5 In line with Equation (6), it might be expected that 
the seasonal high of the total volume of German coins in circulation lies in the fourth quarter. However, it falls in the second quarter for the following reasons. With regard to monthly seasonal factors, those in December are indeed the greatest, but are immediately followed by seasonal factors in June and May, which can be ex-plained by public holidays and the start of the holiday period. Furthermore, seasonal factors in November are low- level.Deutsche Bundesbank

culation accounted for by the transaction bal -
ance was just under 36% in 2011, its lowest 
level during the period under review. The high -
est level was reached in 2006 and 2007 at just 
under 41%. The declining trend since 2008 
could be attributable to the drop in the share 
of cash payments made in retail outlets. In add -ition, the share of coins in circulation accounted 
for by the transaction balance automatically 
shrinks over time due to the accrual of coins 
that are lost or form part of a permanent col -
lection. However, this argument applies mainly 
to older coins in circulation.7
Applying the seasonal method, the percentage 
shares accounted for by the domestic transac -
tion balance can also be estimated for the indi -
vidual coin denominations. The domestic trans -
action balance shares by denomination refer 
here to the circulation of the denomination in 
question and not to total circulation by value 
(circulation of all denominations). The domestic 
transaction balances shares of small denomin -
ation coins (1, 2 and 5 cent coins) are between 
about 20% and 30%, well below the share of 
the total volume of German euro coins in circu -
lation by value accounted for by the domestic 
transaction balance. The transaction balance 
shares of small denomination coins are particu -
larly low. A likely explanation is that people put 
more of them to one side in order to lighten 
their wallet or purse. Just under 30% of re -
spondents in the Bundesbank’s study on pay -
ment behaviour agreed with the following state -
ment: “I prefer not to use small coins as a form 
of payment and tend to put them to one side”.8 
What is more, for the most part, it is not pos -
sible to use small change at vending machines. 
Furthermore, a relatively large proportion of 
small denomination coins are likely to be lost.9 
They thus account for correspondingly low 
shares of the transaction balance. These shares 
rise as the denomination size increases. As with 
total circulation, the small denominations have 
accounted for decreasing shares of the domes -
tic transaction balance in recent years.Transaction

The domestic transaction balance shares of 
medium denomination coins (10, 20 and 50 
cent coins) are higher than those of the total 
volume of coins in circulation.10 The German 
transaction balance shares for 20 and 50 cent 
coins are particularly high. They were 46% and 
51%, respectively, in 2011. These two denomin -
ations can be classed as typical transaction 
 denominations. Unlike small denomination 
coins, people rarely put them to one side in 
order to lighten their wallet or purse. Given 
their low face value, they are also not as suit -
able as a store of value as the two large de -
nomination euro coins. Just like small denomin -
ation coins, the domestic transaction balance 
share for medium denomination coins has 
fallen in recent years, and rises as the denomin -
ation size increases.
The domestic transaction balance shares of 
large denomination coins (€1 and €2 coins) are 
fairly different.11 At 45%, the €1 coin’s share of 
the transaction balance is significantly higher 
than its corresponding share of the total circu -
lation by value. However, it is lower than the 
shares for 20 and 50 cent coins, which are typ -
ical transaction denominations. This could be 
due to the fact that €1 coins are more suitable 
as a store of value because of their compara -
tively high face value and are therefore hoarded 
to a greater extent. This assumption is sup -
ported by the share of the circulation of the 
€2 coin accounted for by the domestic transac -
tion balance, which, over the entire period 
under review, is lower than the share of the 
transaction balance in the total volume of coins 
in circulation by value. In 2011, it was 35%. Be -Transaction

10 As is the case for the small denominations, the seasonal 
high for the medium denominations occurs in the third 
quarter and not in the second quarter as for the total vol -
ume of coins in circulation. The calculation formula (see 
box on pp 64-65) has been adapted accordingly.
11 As with the small and medium denominations, the sea -
sonal high in the circulation of the €1 coin also takes place 
in the third quarter. This may be connected to the holiday 
period. By contrast, the seasonal high in the circulation of 
the €2 coin falls in the second quarter. Given the large 
weighting of €2 coins in the total volume of all German 
euro coins in circulation by value (about 50% at the end of 
2011), the seasonal high for total circulation by value is also 
found in the second quarter.Deutsche Bundesbank

cause of its high face value, the €2 coin is par -
ticularly good for hoarding as a store of value 
because relatively few of these coins need to 
be put to one side in order to save larger sums 
or amounts suitable for transactions. However, 
it is also in demand as a collectible item in the 
form of commemorative €2 coins, which also 
include the Federal States series.
Volumes of German euro coins 
held for domestic transaction 
purposes
The domestic transaction balances (in €) are 
calculated by multiplying the shares of the 
transaction balance by the denomination-  
specific or total circulation of German euro 
coins by value. The share of the total circulation 
of German euro coins accounted for by the 
 domestic transaction balance rose from just 
over €1.7 billion in 2004 to just over €2.3 bil -
lion in 2011.12 During the same period, the total 
value of German coins in circulation rose from 
almost €4.5 billion to just over €6.5 billion. 
Consequently, around 30% of this rise is 
 accounted for by the German transaction bal -
ance. However, while the total volume of coins 
in circulation has shown marked linear growth 
during the period under review, the time series 
for the German transaction balance has flat -
tened out noticeably since 2008 and barely 
makes any contribution towards growth of 
total circulation. As described above, the share 
of the  domestic transaction balance in total cir -
culation of German euro coins by value has 
therefore fallen since 2008.Total volume of 
coins held for transaction pur-poses amounts to €2.3 billionTotal circulation and domestic transaction balance of German euro coins

12 This estimate is confirmed by another estimate based 
on information relating to the introduction of euro bank -
notes and coins. See M Altmann and N Bartzsch (2014), op 
cit, section 4. According to this, the domestic transaction 
balance of euro coins was just over €2.3 billion (transaction 
balance share of just under 41%) in 2008 and €2.5 billion 
(transaction balance share of just over 38%) in 2011. These 
estimates are very similar to the results presented here for 
the domestic transaction balance, which are €2.3 billion 
(transaction balance share of 40%) in 2008 and €2.3 bil -
lion (transaction balance share of just under 36%) in 2011.Deutsche Bundesbank

The domestic transaction balances and circula -
tion volumes of small denomination coins in -
crease with the denomination size. Reflecting 
the low value of the circulation of small de -
nomination coins by value, the transaction bal -
ances are quite low at under €60 million. While 
the shares of the transaction balances by de -
nomination have been declining since 2008, 
the transaction balances themselves have re -
mained more or less the same over this period. 
Because of sharp growth in the circulation of 
small  denomination coins, the transaction bal -
ances have not fallen despite the decline in the 
transaction balance shares. The significant in -
crease in the circulation of small denomination 
coins is not attributable to the domestic trans -
action motive because the corresponding 
transaction balances have remained more or 
less constant for a number of years. By con -
trast, hoarding saw (net) inflows.
The domestic transaction balances and circula -
tion volumes of medium denomination coins 
also increase with denomination size. The for -
mer have remained more or less the same since 
2008 at between €100 million and €350 mil -
lion. They are thus considerably higher than for 
small denomination coins. As for small denom -
ination coins, despite the declining transaction 
balance shares, holdings remained stable 
thanks to the rise in circulation. In the case of 
medium denomination coins, too, growth in 
circulation is not attributable to the domestic 
transaction motive, but rather to hoarding at 
home and abroad.
For the large denominations, the most recent 
domestic transaction balances of just over 
€600 million for the €1 coin and just over €1.1 
billion for the €2 coin are well above those of 
the small and medium denominations, as might 
be expected. As with the latter, the declining 
transaction balance shares in the large denom -
inations are offset by growth in circulation (by 
denomination). While the domestic transaction 
balance for €1 coins as well as for small and 
medium denomination coins has remained 
constant since 2008, the domestic transaction Volumes of

balance for €2 coins has shown marked growth 
since 2004. The share of this denomination in 
the total circulation of German euro coins by 
value had risen from just over 44% at the end 
of 2004 to just under 50% by the end of 2011. 
The circulation of German euro coins by value 
is clearly determined by the two large denom -
inations. During the period under review, they 
consistently accounted for a share of about 
70% of the total volume of coins in circulation 
by value. During the same period, the transac -
tion balance share of the two large denomin -
ations in all German euro coins rose from 65% 
to 76%. As with the small and medium denom -
inations, the transaction balance for €1 coins in 
Germany also makes no contribution towards 
growth in the circulation of that denomination. 
This is different in the case of the €2 coin. Here, 
the rise in the domestic transaction balance 
from 2004 to 2011 amounts to almost 38% of 
the corresponding rise in the circulation of this 
denomination.
Volumes of euro coins held for 
domestic transaction purposes 
by sector
In the text which follows, we seek to estimate 
the volumes of euro coins held for domestic 
transaction purposes, broken down by sector. 
In addition to the volume of coins held in the 
wallets or purses of households (consumers), 
this also includes the change kept at points of 
sale in retail outlets and the stock of coins in 
amusement and vending machines, as well as 
the volume of coins held by credit institutions. 
While households use coins for actively effect -
ing transactions, retailers need coins to provide 
customers with change. The cash contained in 
vending machines derives from turnover and 
part of this income re-  enters circulation as 
change dispensed to customers. On balance, 
turnover income exceeds the amount disbursed 
again as change; consequently, the stocks of 
coins in the machines have to be emptied on a 
regular basis. Credit institutions maintain hold -
ings of coins for the purpose of facilitating withdrawals by retailers and households. In 
addition, coins are paid in at banks by vending 
machine operators and households. For their 
part, credit institutions dispose of whatever 
surplus coins they have by submitting these to 
the Bundesbank, from which they also obtain 
new stocks of coins.
The Deutsche Bundesbank conducted a survey 
of payment behaviour in Germany in 2008, 
2011 and 2014.13 Among other things, these 
surveys ascertained how much cash people 
had in their wallet or purse during the record -
ing period. In 2008, the respondents were 
found to carry an average of €118 on their per -
son, €6.70 of which was accounted for by 
coins. This contrasts with 2011 when the figure 
in question declined slightly to an average of 
€103. Of this amount, €5.90 was in the form of 
coins. The cash people carry around on them is 
generally used for making payments. There -
fore, this amount can be wholly allocated to 
the transaction balance. If the average volume 
of coins carried on an individual’s person is 
then extrapolated for Germany’s entire adult 
population, this results in a volume of around 
€440 million worth of euro coins held for trans -
action purposes on the part of households in 
2008, and a total of approximately €410 mil -
lion for 2011.
The volume of coins kept by other users (ie sec -
tors) for effecting transactions can only be 
gauged on the basis of assumptions of greater 
or lesser reliability due to the lack of relevant 
statistics. The average volume of cash held by 
credit institutions in Germany is known but 
there are no data on how this breaks down in 
terms of banknotes and coins. However, this 
information can be roughly calculated by study -Volume of 
coins held by  consumers for transaction  purposes totals €410 million
Volume of coins 
held by credit institutions ranges from €120 million to €370 million

ing credit institutions’ inpayments and outpay -
ments to and from the Bundesbank. To this 
end, the share of coins in the total volume of 
inpayments made by credit institutions to the 
Bundesbank in the course of a year is allotted 
to the average volume of cash held. Alterna -
tively, the above calculation can also be made 
using the outpayment data. On balance, this 
estimation method provides a rough approxi -
mate value of the volumes of coins held by 
credit institutions for transaction purposes. Esti -
mates for 2011 put these at between €120 mil -
lion and €370 million.
Another share of the volume of coins held for 
transaction purposes is kept at points of sale in 
retail outlets. These outlets require coins to give 
shoppers change. According to an interview 
with an expert in the field, retailers are gener -
ally replenished with coins twice a week. 
 Assuming that the volume of coins diminishes 
at a steady rate, the amount of cash held as 
change is calculated as the supply of coins 
needed to cover three days of sales activity, div -
ided by two. Using turnover figures and the 
shares of cash payments in these sales, the 
 volume of cash needed as change can be ex -
trapolated for all retailers operating in Ger -
many. This presupposes a need for coins in in -
dividual business sectors that is proportionately 
equal to the share of cash payments and to 
turnover figures. Based on this model, retailers 
in Germany hold around €130 million worth of 
coins in their cash registers on average.
In addition to retail outlets that need to provide 
coins as change, there are also points of sale 
where coins are the main method of payment, 
primarily vending machines (eg for travel and 
parking tickets, cigarettes and gaming activ -
ities). The stocks of coins accumulated in vend -
ing machines as a result of the above sales are 
wholly allocable to the transaction balance. In 
order to determine the volume of coins held in 
vending machines, it is necessary to make an 
additional calculation. An approximate value 
for the daily turnover in cash at vending ma -
chines in Germany can be calculated on the basis of turnover figures provided by the Ger -
man Industry Association for coin- operated 
Amusement and Vending Machines (VDAI) and 
the share of cash payments conducted at vend -
ing machines according to the Bundesbank 
study on payment behaviour.14 Making an as -
sumption about the frequency at which vend -
ing machines are emptied, this works out at an 
average stock of coins of between €30 million 
and €100 million. Unfortunately, the data from 
the vending machine industry do not include all 
vending machine sales transactions. They omit 
transactions at machines selling parking or 
travel tickets. Consequently, the values shown 
here are likely to represent lower limits. In add -
ition, no distinction can be made between 
banknote and coin payments on the basis of 
the cash payment share. The turnover in coins 
is presumably lower than the cash turnover 
shown here. Moreover, vending machines 
 redistribute coins as change, thus further de -
pleting the stock of coins kept in vending 
 machines. No information is available about 
the precise influence of the various determin -
ing factors.
To summarise, the volume of coins held for 
 domestic transaction purposes in 2011 was 
 estimated at between €690 million and €1.0 Volume of 
change held by retailers stands at €130 million

Foreign demand for German euro coins
The purposes of coin usage are generally broken 
down into the following three categories: trans-
action balance, hoarding and foreign demand. The foreign share of DM coins in circulation is unlikely to have played a major role.
1 Little is 
known to date about the hoarding of and for-
eign demand for euro coins issued in Germany 
(“German” euro coins).
In a fi  rst step, the number of coins in circulation 
in each country as a share of the total euro coins 
in circulation can be compared with the ECB 
capital shares of the member states.2 A country’s 
ECB capital share is calculated on the basis of its 
population and its economic output and, thus, upon important factors for determining the transaction balance of cash in that country. 
While the volume of coins in circulation in some 
countries deviates from the calculated value based on the ECB capital share, the deviations 
are by far not as pronounced as in the case of 
euro banknotes, for which there is a signifi  cant 
migration, also within the euro area.3 In contrast 
to banknotes in circulation, tourism does not 
therefore appear to lead to any signifi  cant cross- border net fl  ows of coins within the euro area.
4
German euro coins make their way into coun-tries outside the euro area via three channels: 
fi  rst, via the euro coins taken by German tourists and business travellers to certain holiday destin-ations (such as Turkey) for transaction purposes; second, through countries outside the euro area 
which have introduced the euro unilaterally as 
legal tender and, third, via tourists and business 
travellers from outside the euro area who take euro coins back home following a trip to the euro area. In the case of the fi  rst channel, we 
assume, as with coin migration within the euro 
area, that households and business travellers 
take just as many coins with them to countries 
outside the euro area as they take from these 
countries back to Germany. Consequently, there 
is no (net) export of German euro coins. The second channel concerns Kosovo and Monte-negro. Euro coins are in circulation in these 
countries for transaction and hoarding purposes. 
However, the balances concerned can be disre-
garded as these countries are so small. The third 
channel is the most important of the three. It concerns tourists from countries outside the 
euro area who take euro coins back home with 
them. Unlike euro banknotes, these coins can-not generally be exchanged and therefore end 
up being hoarded. A large share of these coins 
never return to the euro area and can therefore 
be regarded as being permanently hoarded.5 
This form of seepage loss is probably more sig-
nifi  cant because Germany attracts visitors from 
all over the world.
Consequently, the active volume of German euro 
coins circulating abroad (excluding permanent 
hoarding) probably plays only a minor role. The 
difference between the overall value of German 
euro coins in circulation and the cash balance 
held in German euro coins for domestic transac-
tions is therefore likely to consist principally of 
domestic and permanent hoards outside the 
euro area. The division into these two types of 
hoards and the composition of the domestic hoards (temporary and permanent hoards, col-
lector holdings and lost coins) goes beyond the scope of this study and merits future  research.

data are available.5 See J W D Bos (1994), The demand for coins in the

billion. At around €410 million, the single larg -
est value was recorded for the volume of coins 
carried in households’ wallets or purses. This 
was followed by credit institutions, retail out -
lets and vending machine operators.
As a result, the total volume of coins held for 
domestic transaction purposes by sector lies 
well below the volume of coins held for trans -
action purposes in Germany in 2011 calculated 
using the seasonal method, which came to 
about €2.3 billion. Owing to insufficient data, 
the volumes of coins held for domestic transac -
tion purposes by sector cannot be fully cap -
tured. It is doubly difficult to estimate the for -
eign demand for German euro coins (measured 
in terms of net exports). A majority of these 
coins are likely to be found circulating in coun -
tries outside the euro area. For further details, 
refer to the box entitled “Foreign demand for 
German euro coins” on page 72.
Summary and conclusions
According to estimates based on the seasonal 
method, the volume of euro coins held in Ger -
many rose from just over €1.7 billion in 2004 to 
around €2.3 billion in 2011. During the same 
period, the total circulation of euro coins issued 
by the Bundesbank (“German” euro coins in 
circulation) rose from just under €4.5 billion to 
just over €6.5 billion. Consequently, 30% of 
this rise is attributable to the volume of coins 
held for domestic transaction purposes. How -
ever, while the total volume of German euro 
coins in circulation has grown at a steady and 
marked pace during the period under review, 
the time series for domestic transaction bal -
ances has flattened out noticeably since 2008 
and barely makes any contribution towards the 
growth in the volume of German euro coins in 
circulation. The share of the total volume of 
German euro coins in circulation by value ac -
counted for by the volume of coins held for 
domestic transaction purposes has therefore 
dropped since 2008 and stood at just under 
36% in 2011. One reason for this downward trend in recent years could be the dwindling 
share of cash payments in the retail sector. In 
addition, the share of coins in circulation 
 accounted for by the transaction balance auto -
matically shrinks over time due to the accrual 
of coins that are lost or part of a collection.
The volumes of coins held in small denomin -
ations (1 to 5 cent coins) for domestic transac -
tion purposes was quite low at less than €60 
million in each case in 2011, which corres -
ponded with the low circulation of these 
 denominations by value. The largest volumes of 
coins held for domestic transaction purposes 
were accounted for by the €1 coin (€600 mil -
lion of late) and the €2 coin (at just over €1.1 
billion). According to the estimates cited here, 
the €2 coin is the only denomination in which 
the volume of coins held for transaction pur -
poses is still expanding significantly in Germany, 
unlike the other denominations which have 
been stagnating since 2008.15 The circulation 
of German euro coins by value is clearly domin -
ated by the two large denominations.
The domestic transaction balance shares of 
small denomination coins in the volume of 
small denomination German euro coins in cir -
culation ranged between 20% and 30% in 
2011; well below the figure for total circulation 
by value (36%). This can partially be explained 
by the fact that small denomination coins are 
hoarded to a greater extent to lighten the 
weight of wallets and purses, or are lost. More -
over, except for a few cases, they cannot be 
used for making payments at vending ma -
chines. The domestic transaction balance shares 
of 20 and 50 cent coins turn out to be above 
average (46% and 51% respectively in 2011). 
These two coins can be classed as typical trans -
action denominations. Unlike small denomin -
ation coins, people rarely hoard them to make Transaction 
 balance makes next to no  contribution  towards elevat -
ing the volume of coins in  circulationVolumes of coins held for transaction pur-poses increase in line with  denomination size

15 To derive an economic explanation for this result as well 
as to verify its accuracy, it would be necessary to identify 
the extent to which consumption is paid for using coins 
(cash consumption), broken down by denomination. How -
ever, no such figures are at hand and it would be extremely 
difficult to make an estimate.Deutsche Bundesbank

their wallet or purse lighter. Given their low 
face value, they are also not as good as a store 
of value as large denomination coins.
In addition, surveys and statistics were used to 
arrive at an estimate of the volumes of coins 
held for domestic transaction purposes by sec -
tor. Due to a lack of data, it was not possible to 
fully capture Germany’s transaction balance 
using the stated approach. Hence, in 2011 the 
total volume of coins held for domestic trans -
action purposes by sector was estimated as 
lying between €690 million and €1.0 billion. At 
around €410 million, the single largest value 
was recorded for the volume of coins carried in 
the wallets or purses of households. This was 
followed by credit institutions, retail outlets 
and vending machine operators. German euro 
coins (in net terms) are only likely to be kept in 
significant quantities outside the euro area, 
where they are hoarded on a permanent basis.
The estimates specified here allow the follow -
ing conclusions to be drawn.
Firstly, as a rule, small denomination coins 
(ie 1 and 2 cent coins) seem to be used to issue 
customers with the exact amount of change when settling a transaction. Owing to their 
modest transaction balance shares, relatively 
little use is made of such coins to pay for goods 
and services. In all likelihood, the bulk of them 
are either permanently lost or hoarded to 
lighten the weight of wallets and purses.
Secondly, the results are of interest for estimat -
ing demand functions for German euro coins 
as well as the expected circulation of German 
euro coins. The demand for coins essentially 
depends on a transaction variable (for the 
transaction motive) and an opportunity cost 
variable (for the hoarding motive to use them 
as a store of value).16 Real cash consumption 
can be used as one such transaction variable in 
structural models. It is more difficult to find a 
suitable proxy variable for opportunity costs. 
Structural models are therefore the most suit -
able method of determining the demand for 
German €2 coins. This is the only denomin -
ation in which the transaction balance makes a 
significant contribution towards boosting circu -
lation. Hoarding balances play a greater role 
in  other denominations. Time series models 
 appear to be more suitable for this purpose.Households hold 
highest volume of coins for transaction  purposesIn the main, 
small denomin-
ation coins are

8Less German MFIs’ holdings of paper issued by euro-area MFIs. 9Including money stocks M1, M2 or M3. 11The difference between the volume of euro
