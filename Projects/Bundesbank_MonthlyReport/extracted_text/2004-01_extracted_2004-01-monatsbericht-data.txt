5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a wholeThe cyclical upturn in the German economy
continued at a moderate pace in the fourthquarter of 2003. According to the Bundes-bank’s calculations, real gross domestic prod-uct (GDP) in the October to December periodmay have gone up by
1/C254% after seasonal and
working-day adjustment. This means that itnearly matched the figure for the correspond-ing period of 2002. In calendar-month terms,there was a slight increase. Mainly on ac-count of weak growth in the first half of theyear, overall output in 2003 – according tothe initial provisional estimate of the FederalStatistical Office – was still 0.1% down on2002, when a slight increase of 0.2% hadbeen achieved.
IndustryThe orders situation in industry continued to
improve in November. Orders received by en-terprises again showed a slight rise on the al-ready comparatively high level of the previousmonth. On an average of October and No-vember, new orders were almost 4% up onthe third quarter in seasonally adjusted terms.The figure was 2
1/C254% up on the year, com-
pared with what was still a year-on-year fallof
1/C254% in the third quarter.
Growth in new orders by domestic customers
was particularly strong, with all major sectorsof industry showing a marked increase. Interms of foreign demand, there was a con-tinuation of the positive tendency that had al-Real GDP

6ready been identifiable in summer. October
and November were 51/C252% up on the level of
the second quarter, which marked the lowpoint last year. The sharpest growth in foreignorders was recorded by producers of con-sumer goods along with the intermediategoods sector.
Output expanded sharply again in November,
having already shown a distinct increase inOctober. Both months taken together werearound 3% up on the average of the thirdquarter. There was a year-on-year increase of1
3/C254%, compared with a figure of -1/C252% in the
previous quarter. The improvement is likely tobe somewhat overstated from a cyclical view-point, however. It is possible that there wassome catching up on production in Octoberon account of the fact that the summer holi-days had been concentrated, more than in re-cent years, on August and September. In No-vember, production may have been broughtforward owing to the prospect of an in-creased amount of holiday being taken in thesecond half of December because of the waythe Christmas and New Year public holidaysfell.
ConstructionThe situation in the construction sector re-
mained subdued in early autumn. Construc-tion sector output did show a slight seasonal-ly adjusted recovery in November. However,in October and November as a whole – takingaccount of the upward adjustment still to bemade as part of the overall survey – it wasscarcely up on its level in the third quarter. Itwas also down again on the year, evenEconomic conditions in Germany*

7though the decline, at around 3%, was no
longer as large as before.
Seasonally adjusted demand for construction
was somewhat higher in October than in thepreceding months. (At present, data are avail-able only up to and including October.)A larger number of orders was placed, espe-cially in residential construction. These weremostly for single-family housing construction,where the debate on cuts in assistance is like-ly to have led to many planned constructionprojects being rapidly embarked on. Bothindustrial and public construction orders inOctober remained largely at the third-quarterlevel in seasonally adjusted terms.
Labour marketThe labour market continued to be marked
by a decline in employment. According to thefigures of the Federal Statistical Office, therewas a further fall in the seasonally adjustednumber of persons in work in October(monthly data are available up to thatmonth). At 38.26 million, the figure wasaround 30,000 down on the average level ofthe third quarter. The year-on-year declineamounts to just over 260,000, or 0.7%. At allevents, the pace of the decline has becomeslower. At 1.5%, it was twice as fast in thefirst few months of 2003.
Even so, the fall in the number of persons of-
ficially registered as unemployed to 4.34 mil-lion at the end of December was again mainlydue to the fact that the Federal EmploymentAgency had, for some time, been applyingthe regulations for registration more strin-gently. Many people also ended their un-
employment by becoming self-employed, sayas a “one-person business”, which is pro-moted by labour market policy, or by chan-ging to a personnel service agency (PSA). Theseasonally adjusted unemployment rate, asdefined by the Federal Employment Agency,went down to 10.4% in December. Accord-ing to the standardised method, the relevantfigure was unchanged at 9.2%.
PricesSeasonally adjusted consumer prices re-
mained constant in December. In year-on-year terms, the rate of price increase slowedto 1.1% after accelerating to 1.3% for a timein November. The average rise in 2003 as awhole, likewise 1.1%, was 0.3 percentagepoint lower than in 2002. The recent slow-down in the year-on-year rate was due, firstly,to package holidays and telecommunicationsservices. Secondly, consumer prices for re-fined petroleum products became cheaper inDecember last year.

Indebtedness of central, state and local

In November, the indebtedness of central,
state and local government rose by 34.7 bil-
lion, of which only 30.4 billion was attribut-
able to central government. Had it not beenfor the 34.5 billion of one-off receipts from

8rowing requirements would certainly have
been much greater. As it was, a 32.6 billion
increase in money market indebtedness wasaccompanied by a 32.2 billion reduction in
capital market liabilities. On balance, it wasprimarily Federal bonds (Bunds) that were re-paid in the amount of 33.9 billion, whereas
the outstanding volume of Treasury discountpaper (Bubills) and five-year Federal notes(Bobls) climbed by 30.9 billion and 30.7 bil-
lion, respectively.
State government was the main net borrower
in November, raising 33.9 billion. In terms of
actual cash inflow, this meant that its net bor-rowing totalled 332.4 billion over the first
eleven months of last year, thus significantlyexceeding the full-year budgetary target (ad-mittedly defined somewhat differently) of ap-proximately 325 billion. 33.8 billion of the fi-
nancing requirement in November was raisedthrough Treasury notes. Alongside a 31.3 bil-
lion “state jumbo” in which six Federal statestook part, the State of Hesse issued a foreigncurrency bond for 200 million Swiss francs. Afurther 30.5 billion was raised through loans
against borrowers’ notes. By contrast, theoutstanding volume of short-term cash ad-vances was cut by 30.6 billion. The indebted-
ness of local government probably again in-creased only moderately.
Central government borrowingIn December, a month of major tax payments,
central government generated a considerablecash surplus of 38.3 billion. Most of this,
however, was initially invested in the moneymarket. On balance, 31.2 billion of debts
were repaid, 30.4 billion of which constituted
money market indebtedness. Net repaymentson the capital market totalled 30.7 billion,
whereas gross borrowing amounted to 314
billion. The bulk of this ( 36.7 billion) was pro-
cured via two-year Federal Treasury notes.The tender allotment of a new issue raised36.2 billion (of which 30.2 billion was ear-
marked for the German Unity Fund); at2.76%, the yield was
1/C2510percentage point up
on the October issue. Owing to even higherredemptions, however, the outstanding vol-ume fell by 33 billion. Central government re-
ceived 35.5 billion through six-month Bubills,
with the outstanding volume rising by 31 bil-
lion once redemptions had been deducted.As a result of market-smoothing operations,the current amount of Bunds in circulationrose by 30.7 billion. On balance, the out-Net borrowing in the market

9standing volume of loans against borrowers’
notes increased by the same amount.
At the end of 2003, central government in-
debtedness (excluding the ERP Special Fundand the German Unity Fund) reached 3768
billion, which was almost 343 billion higher
than in the previous year.
1The bulk of this in-
crease (just under 342 billion) was obtained
on the capital market, where almost 3227 bil-
lion gross was raised. As regards the debtstructure, the share of Bunds (with an originalmaturity of 10 and 30 years) declined onceagain by almost 1
1/C252percentage points to just
under 57% of central government’s overalldebt. The share of five-year Bobls climbedfurther by just over 1 percentage point to al-most 19%. The respective shares of two-yearFederal Treasury notes and six-month Bubillsrose less markedly to just over 11% and justover 4%. By contrast, the overall level of Fed-eral savings notes and bank loans wentdown, with the result that their contributionto central government’s total indebtednessalso fell by almost 1 and
1/C252percentage point,
respectively (to less than 2% and 5%, re-spectively). The average residual maturity roseby four months on the previous year to nearly6
1/C252years which is relatively high in historical
terms.
During 2004, central government will have to
make 3183 billion of repayments. This is
slightly less than last year, primarily owing tothe smaller need to refinance Treuhandagency bonds. However, a sharp rise in therepayment volume of Federal Treasury notesand Bubills partly offsets this development.As well as the refinancing of existing liabil-
ities, the Federal budget for 2004 envisagesnet new borrowing of just over 329 billion,
which implies a gross borrowing total of3212 billion as defined in the budget ac-
counts. This does not include issuance stilloutstanding at the beginning of 2004 relatingto the 2003 supplementary budget. A shift inthe structure of gross borrowing during thecurrent year is becoming apparent. For ex-ample, a significant increase in issues ofshorter-term Federal Treasury notes isplanned alongside a decrease in issues ofBunds and Bobls. A major factor in this is thepattern of repayment volumes. In the BudgetNet borrowing in the market by central

Securities markets
Bond marketThe volume of issues in the German bond
market decreased in November. Domesticborrowers issued debt securities to a nominalvalue of 396.4 billion, compared with 3114.6
billion in October. After deducting redemp-tions and changes in issuers’ holdings of theirown bonds, net sales were 310.6 billion. On
balance, most of these were debt securitieswith maturities of up to (and including) fouryears. In October, the volume of fixed interestsecurities outstanding increased by 327.0 bil-
lion. Following an annual peak of 39.2 billion
in October, only 31.8 billion worth of foreign
bonds and notes were sold in the Germanmarket in November.
Funds raised in the bond market accrued al-
most entirely to credit institutions, which is-sued 39.8 billion (net) worth of bonds (Octo-
ber: 310.4 billion). Other bank bonds ac-
counted for most of this amount ( 37.3 bil-
lion). Sales of mortgage Pfandbriefe andbonds issued by specialised credit institutionsraised 31.9 billion and 31.7 billion net, re-
spectively. By contrast, public Pfandbriefewere redeemed for 31.1 billion. The volume
of corporate bonds outstanding remainedunchanged in November.
The public sector raised only 30.8 billion in
the bond market in November (October:312.3 billion). The state governments ( L/C228n-
der) raised 34.0 billion net in the bond mar-
ket; the Federal Government sold merely32.0 billion worth of debt securities. Five-year
Federal notes (Bobls) were sold for 30.5 bil-
lion net. Net sales of two-year Federal Treas-ury notes and 10-year Federal bonds raised30.3 billion and 30.2 billion respectively.
2By
comparison, a 35.1 billion bond of the former
Treuhand Agency was redeemed.
In net terms foreign investors sold domestic
debt securities to the value of 33.6 billion in
November. On balance, domestic investorspurchased 314.1 billion net worth of German
debt securities. The main buyers were bothdomestic credit institutions and non-banks,which added 38.2 billion and 35.9 billion re-
spectively to their holdings of German bondsand notes. Domestic non-banks added 31.5
billion and credit institutions 30.2 billion to
their foreign bond portfolios.
Equity marketThe recovery of prices in the German equity
market, which has been under way sinceMarch, was also reflected in an increase inthe volume of issues. In November domesticenterprises placed new shares to a marketvalue of 35.2 billion – the highest amount
since 1999. These mainly comprised the cap-ital increases of an insurance corporation,and, to a lesser extent, of a big bank. By con-

11trast, 31.3 billion net of domestically held
positions in foreign equities were sold.
In November, German equities were pur-
chased primarily by domestic credit institu-tions and foreign investors, which increasedtheir holdings by 36.7 billion and 35.0 billion
respectively. By contrast, domestic non-banksagain reduced their holdings of domesticshares by 36.5 billion. Credit institutions and
non-banks sold foreign equities amounting to30.1 billion and 31.1 billion respectively.
Mutual fund sharesDomestic mutual funds recorded somewhat
larger net inflows in November ( 30.5 billion)
than in the previous month ( 30.3 billion).
Only the specialised funds which sell to insti-tutional investors were able to attract net in-flows of 30.8 billion. By contrast, shares in
domestic mutual funds open to the generalpublic were redeemed to a value of 30.3 bil-
lion. Net inflows of 30.1 billion accrued to
share-based funds and 30.2 billion to mixed
funds. These contrasted with net outflows of30.3 billion and 30.4 billion from the sale of
bond-based funds and money market fundsrespectively. On balance, the level of funds inopen-end real estate funds remained un-changed.
In November German mutual fund shares
were purchased only by domestic non-banks(31.4 billion). By contrast, domestic credit in-
stitutions raised 30.1 billion net from sales of
mutual fund shares. Foreign investors re-duced their holdings by 30.8 billion.Balance of payments
In November 2003, the German current ac-
count ran a surplus of 36.2 billion, which was
31.3 billion less than in the previous month.
The decrease in the trade surplus and increasein the deficit on invisible current transactionswith non-residents contributed to this fall.
According to provisional Federal Statistical
Office figures, the foreign trade surplus fell by30.5 billion to 310.4 billion in November. The
seasonally adjusted November surplus alsowent down slightly to 39
1/C252billion since im-
ports of goods rose somewhat more sharplythan exports of goods. Thus seasonally ad-justed imports rose by 5

12had fallen 61/C252% below the September level
while there had been a minor increase in im-ports (+
1/C252%).
In the case of invisible current transactions, a
deficit of 33.3 billion was recorded in Novem-
ber compared with 32.6 billion in the previ-
ous month. The main reason for the increasewas the rise in net expenditure in currenttransfers, which went up by 31.0 billion to
32.8 billion compared with October. In add-
ition, the surplus on factor income wentdown by 30.2 billion to 31.4 billion in Novem-
ber. The deficit on services, however, fell to31.8 billion from 32.3 billion in the previous
month.
In weak turnover, statistically recorded port-
folio investment resulted in net capital ex-ports of 31.2 billion in November whereas
there had been net capital imports of 321.9
billion in October. German investors acquiredforeign securities worth 31.2 billion net in the
month under review. These were predomin-antly money market paper ( 31.6 billion) as
well as a small amount of bonds and notes(30.2 billion). By contrast, they sold net
amounts of shares ( 30.4 billion) and invest-
ment fund certificates ( 30.2 billion). The buy-
ing and selling by foreign investors on theGerman securities markets balanced out inNovember. Non-residents switched frombonds and notes (- 34.4 billion) and invest-
ment fund certificates (- 30.8 billion) to shares
(34.4 billion) and money market paper ( 30.8
billion).

15The euro and prices
two years onIn the realm of economic policy, hardly
any event has caused such a public stirin Germany and the entire EuropeanUnion as the introduction of eurobanknotes and coins on 1 January2002. Consumers in virtually everycountry of the euro area felt that theywere experiencing a sharp surge in in-flation, and there were growing num-bers of press reports on excessive pricerises.
The official statistics did, in fact, show
that prices had gone up in connectionwith the introduction of euro cash butnot nearly to the extent perceived bythe general public. Many of the priceincreases were not connected with theintroduction of the euro banknotesand coins but were due instead toother factors, such as very cold winterweather as well as higher taxes on en-ergy, tobacco products and insurance.Nevertheless, there were very notice-able price movements, mainly in thecase of some services. Moreover, thepattern of prices had changed, and thediversity of prices had become wider.
In the two years following the change-
over to the euro, it is noticeable thatprice structures have, by and large, re-turned to normal in many sectors.Moreover, some of the excessive pricesthat arose at the start of 2002 havesince gone down again.

16A look back
The Federal Statistical Office and the Deutsche
Bundesbank conducted a series of specialstudies to accompany the conversion of con-sumer prices from D-Mark to euro.
1These an-
alyses were based not only on the compre-hensive official price statistics which are pub-lished regularly but also on individual datawhich the Federal Statistical Office compiledspecifically for this purpose.
2
Major findings of the studies by the FederalStatistical Office and the Bundesbank werethat the introduction of euro banknotes andcoins and the associated conversion of priceshad a considerable impact on the patternsand dynamics of (individual) prices. First, re-pricing in euro led directly to a reduction inthe percentage of “attractive” prices. Where-as many prices during the D-Mark era hadended in the figure 9, ie just below whatwas perhaps felt to be a price threshold, thiswas initially much less the case from January2002 onwards. “Rounded” prices with thefinal digit 0 or 5, which make it easier to giveout change, were also observed less frequent-ly. In part, this had to do with the fact that,even after the cash changeover, quite a largenumber of traders were also showing theprices of their goods in D-Mark and initiallyretaining the former pricing patterns. It wasonly gradually that the practice of showingprices solely in euro prevailed.
Second, the introduction of euro cash was
accompanied by an exceptional number ofprice changes. It is likely that many vendorssaw the displaying of prices in euro for thefirst time as a favourable opportunity for re-
pricing. Deferring or bringing forward achange in price to January 2002 was especial-ly opportune in cases where setting newprices incurred relatively high costs. It may bethat a period of considerable confusion anduncertainty also appeared to be a suitable oc-casion for putting up prices even though cus-tomers were inevitably going to be particularlyalert to the situation. In actual fact, mostprices were converted exactly in January2002.
3In the retail food sector, some suppliers
advertised the fact that they were actuallyrounding down the exactly converted pricesand, by doing so, they were able to expandtheir market shares significantly.
4By contrast,
there were more frequent, and sometimessharp, price increases in the services sector.

17The introduction of the euro had very little ef-
fect on the overall price level of the basket ofgoods representing household spending inGermany. According to the consumer priceindex supplied by the Federal Statistical Office(base year 2000), the overall price level in Janu-ary 2002 went up by 0.3% in seasonally ad-justed terms. This was only slightly more thanin the months immediately before and afterJanuary 2002. However, the year-on-year ratewent up from 1.4% in December 2001 to2.1% in January 2002.
5The acceleration in the
rate of inflation is by no means ascribable tothe euro changeover alone, however. In actualfact, taxes on energy, tobacco products and in-surance were increased as of 1 January 2002.Moreover, a reduced supply of fresh fruit andvegetables owing to very unfavourable wea-ther pushed up prices. Even after eliminatingthe usual price increases at this time ofyear, seasonal food products still went upby around 10% on the month. At most, a0.3 percentage point contribution to the an-nual inflation rate for January 2002 can beascribed to the introduction of euro cash it-self.

price index based on the 1995 basket of goods. The
measured rate of inflation is affected mainly by methodo-
logical revisions as well as by the updated weights.
6The price statistics nevertheless show that there were
some sharp increases in retail trade prices during 2001 in
the run-up to the changeover. This may be seen as an in-
dication that fairly sharp price increases in 2001 had
been used to “prepare for” price reductions in January
2002. (See, for example, Institute for Applied Consumer
Research, Preisbeobachtungen vor, w/C228hrend und nach
der Einf/C252hrung des Euro, December 2002). In this con-
nection, however, it should be pointed out, that – espe-
cially in the food sector – prices had generally been
pushed down to a very low level as a result of fierce com-
petition for market share. This had been triggered by the
market entry of a major new competitor in the retail
sector in the second half of 1998 and continued until the
Federal Cartel Office, in the late summer of 2000,
prohibited the unfair practice of selling below cost price.Little change

18Consumer price developments since the
euro changeover
In the not quite two years since the introduc-
tion of euro cash, the rise in consumer priceshas remained within fairly narrow bounds.On an average of the two years, inflation wasno higher than 1
1/C254%. This is distinctly less
than in the first half of the 1990s and alsosomewhat less than the average in the periodfrom 1995 to 2001. Moreover, due accountshould be taken of the greater burden of in-direct taxes, without which the price increasewould have been even smaller.
This positive outcome is due in part not only
to a slight decline in food prices, following asharp rise in 2001 and early 2002, but also tocomparatively moderate increases in energyprices. Over the entire period since the begin-ning of 2002, upward pressure on prices dueto the crude oil market has been more thanoffset by alleviating factors related to the ex-change rate. Energy taxes were increased atthe beginning of 2002 and again in 2003,however. Price reductions in the case of foodwere associated with the waning of the BSEand foot-and-mouth disease crises and thelessening of the impact of the very cold win-ter weather at the turn of 2001-02. Even so,food was still discernibly more expensive thanat the end of 2000.
The noticeable price increase for industrial
goods in the consumer price index is duemainly to the higher tax on tobacco. If to-bacco products are excluded, the underlyingtendency, if anything, is for prices to decline.Information processing machinery as well asYear-on-year change, quarterly

19shoes and clothing have become less expen-
sive. In the field of services, the pace of infla-tion has become noticeably slower since thefinal quarter of 2002. At the end of theperiod under review, the year-on-year rate ofincrease was less than 1
1/C252%. The increase in
rents slowed to scarcely more than 1% annu-ally. The low rate of consumer inflation re-flects the subdued rise in wage costs helpedby generally moderate pay settlements aswell as a pronounced negative wage drift.Persistently weak domestic demand also re-stricted the scope for raising prices.
Price patterns and price diversity
Consumer prices had to be stated in euro by
the time the cash changeover took place inJanuary 2002, if not earlier. Many productshad, in fact, already been priced in both theold and new currencies before then, but thefamiliar D-Mark prices had predominated inthe retail trade and in the case of service pro-viders up to the end of 2001. The specialstudy of the consumer price statistics revealedthat this had been determined by (psycho-logically important) “threshold prices”. In thecase of services, “rounded” prices predomin-ated. The changeover from D-Mark to eurowas accompanied by a widening betweenthe incremental price points. The exchangerate of DM1.95583 to 31 meant that only
just over half of the prices possible earlierwere available.
7In order to retain the former
“real” gradations, consideration had to begiven to prices that had end digits which dif-fered from the familiar ones. It thereforecame as no surprise that price patternsaltered with the changeover from D-Mark to
euro. Whereas previously, on an average ofthe 25 products studied, more than half ofthe prices ended in a 9 and a further 30%ended in a 5 or a 0, the relevant figures ineuro were less than 20% and 25%, respect-ively, in January 2002. At the same time, thedistributions of prices fanned out, with an in-crease in the number of different prices foreach product. This development was encour-aged by the tendency of many vendors to dis-play prices in both currencies and to retainthe traditional D-Mark prices. In such cases,the price in euro was an exact conversion ofPercentage shares

7In some countries, the euro changeover brought an in-
crease in the range of incremental price points. In Bel-
gium, for example, the number of possible prices more
than doubled, and the retail trade also made use of the
additional possibilities. See National Bank of Belgium,

20the old D-Mark price but was often “odd”
and unfamiliar. The increased variation inprices is likely to have restricted price trans-parency during the changeover period.
During the past two years, the price pattern
has largely returned to normal. The numberof “threshold” prices, for example, has in-creased again. However, with a share of justunder 40% (up to September 2003) theyhave not quite regained their former signifi-cance. In the special study, however, “round-ed” prices occurred somewhat more oftenthan before. In the retail trade especially,prices ending in a 5 were more prominentthan before the changeover, thus counteringthe non-availability of half the prices possibleearlier. The share of “rounded” prices hasrisen to 35% in total. In the case of bothgoods and services, however, “odd” pricesalso occurred somewhat more frequentlythan two years earlier.
For most products, the concentration of indi-
vidual prices on a small number of key pricepoints now matches the situation prior to theintroduction of euro cash. In the case ofsugar, for example, the price of DM1.79 hada share of more than 60% at the end of2001. In January 2002, the price of 30.89
and the exactly converted price of 30.92 each
accounted for just over 30%. In the monthsthat followed, 30.89 became the predomin-
ant price even though there were still severalother prices, including “unattractive” ones,which were, admittedly, of no major signifi-cance. In the case of coffee filter paper, therewere two predominant prices: DM0.99 andDM2.99. In January 2002, most prices werePercentage shares 1Distribution of sugar prices*

21initially converted exactly. Subsequently, two
new key price points emerged: 30.49 and
31.49. At 31.35, a new “rounded” price
became significant – one that had not beencustomary in this context prior to the intro-duction of the euro.
This is a typical example of price patterns
gradually returning to normal following aperiod of variation accompanying the change-over to the euro. Although, at the time ofgoing to press, the number of different priceswas still somewhat larger than before thechangeover, the majority of such additionalprices are of no major significance. In actualfact, during 2002 and 2003 new key pricepoints emerged, sometimes ending in a 5 ra-ther than a 9. Furthermore, it is becoming ap-parent that the conversion of prices was notalways to the disadvantage of the consumer.In the case of sugar, the new predominantprice is just under 3% below the old key pricepoint. For coffee filter paper, the prices are3% and 2
1/C252% lower, respectively.
The situation is different with regard to cin-
ema tickets. In the D-Mark era, virtually allcinema prices were priced in full D-Markamounts (or, at most, amounts ending in50 pfennigs), whereas almost the entirerange of 10 cent gradations are now used inthe relevant price range. Nevertheless, evennow, the most important prices end in50 cents or are for full euro amounts. Therehas been a significant price rise. Many cinematickets became noticeably more expensive inJanuary 2002, and this trend has continued,albeit at a slower pace.

these are now 36,36.50 and 37.
Subsequent adjustment of excessive price
changes?
It is well known that there were fairly large
price increases for some goods and services inconnection with the euro changeover.
8Given
that price developments have generally beensubdued recently and that pricing has re-turned to normal, there arises the question asto whether the exceptional price increases atthe time of the changeover have now beencancelled out or whether the introduction ofthe euro has encouraged a permanent jumpin the general price level. Any adjustmentsare not necessarily apparent in the form ofprice reductions. Subsequent price increasesmay, in fact, be smaller than usual or bemade less frequently. The crucial factor iswhether the “new” price path convergesover a somewhat longer period with the“traditional” price path before the effects ofthe euro.
The particular difficulty of this kind of study is
that the price trend without the euro change-over cannot be observed directly but can onlybe inferred from empirical regularities in thepast. For that reason, price equations for indi-vidual goods and services constructed onmajor cost components, such as producerprices, wages, rents and other input prices,were estimated on the basis of the periodPercentage shares 1Distribution of prices

23from the beginning of 1991 to the end of
2000. Restricting the time-frame to theperiod up to 2000 is intended to eliminateany influences from the run-up to the intro-duction of euro cash. Projections excludingeuro factors were derived from the estimatedrelationships using the actual input price de-velopments and were compared with the ac-tual path of consumer prices. As a rule, thereis quite a close and stable relationship be-tween consumer prices and major cost fac-tors, which means that an extrapolation overa period of three years would appear permis-sible.
As the introduction of euro banknotes and
coins was accompanied by noticeable pricemovements, especially for individual services,the analysis below will focus on these. InJanuary 2002, the cost of hairdressing wentup by an average of 1.9%. Prices of cinematickets increased by 2.3%. Dry cleaning a suitcost 2.5% more. The index for restaurants,caf/C216s and takeaways went up 2.1%. Thesewere all exceptional monthly price move-ments, each of which led to a sharp rise inthe year-on-year rate.
9
Comparing estimated and actual price devel-opments shows, first, that, in the case ofthese services, there are almost no indicationsof previously deferred price increases subse-quently being put into effect. Instead, the ac-tual prices at the end of 2001 were largelyconsistent with the development to be ex-pected on the basis of the long-term relation-ships. Second, price movements after thesurge in prices at the beginning of 2002were, in most cases, smaller than usual. Forexample, dry-cleaning a man’s suit did not
become much more expensive throughout2002, and the average price remained stablein 2003. There was a distinct flattening-outof price developments in the case of hair-2000 = 100, log scale

9At this juncture, it should again be pointed out that by
no means all vendors put up prices in January 2002. Ac-
cording to calculations based on the special study, just
under 45% of prices for the products mentioned were in-
creased, 10% were lowered and, at all events, just less
than half remained unchanged (apart from very minor
price changes).Underlying

24dressing, too. Consequently, the “price ex-
cess” in the case of these two services had,on average, been eliminated by the late sum-mer of 2003. Although a slow convergencewith the estimated long-term price path maybe noted in the case of restaurants and cin-emas, a certain “price exaggeration” stillexists at present according to the method de-scribed. Owing to the many problems in-volved in estimating counterfactual price de-velopments excluding the effects of the euro,these findings should, of course, be interpret-ed with caution. Nevertheless, they do indi-cate that the “price exaggeration” accom-panying the introduction of euro banknotesand coins was often subsequently eliminatedin line with developments in costs. This sug-gests that, to a considerable extent, the pricesurge in January 2002 was due to anticipa-tory effects. The elimination of price exagger-ations contributed to what was, by and large,a subdued rise in the prices of services in2003.
Price perception and price reality
Official pronouncements on the limited im-
pact that the introduction of euro cash hadon prices have met with public incomprehen-sion in many cases. Many consumers feltprice rises were much sharper than was indi-cated by the official statistics. This has alsobeen reflected in the responses to the ques-tion about price developments in the past12 months, as collected in the monthly con-sumer surveys of the European Commission.Interpreting the balance of opinions as towhether there have been more or less sharpprice rises or price reductions is no easy mat-
ter. Nevertheless, the fact that the balanceshowed a marked increase, particularly at thestart of 2002, and subsequently persisted at avery high level suggests that the public per-ception of prices and the prices revealed inthe statistics no longer matched for a time.
10
In earlier years, there had been quite a closecorrelation between “price perception” and“price expectations for the immediate fu-ture”, as derived from the balances, and pricedevelopments as actually measured. Thechange in price expectations shows that con-sumers did not anticipate a much faster rateof inflation after January 2002. Even so, des-pite quite a sharp downward adjustment dur-ing 2003, the price perception indicator has
10Consumers are asked whether, in their view, prices
have risen a lot, moderately or slightly in the past
12 months, whether they have stayed about the same or
whether they have, in fact, fallen. The qualitative
responses are then used to calculate weighted balances,
which are shown as percentages. If all consumers state
that prices have risen sharply, the resulting value is +100.
If all consumers state that prices have fallen, the resulting
value is -100. (See European Commission, The joint har-
monised EU programme of business and consumer sur-
veys, User Guide , October 2003). In the Flash Eurobarom-
eter the European Commission asks more directly
whether prices have changed more in favour or to the
detriment of consumers in the wake of the euro change-
over or whether rises and falls balanced out. In October
and November 2003, more than 90% of the members of
the German public surveyed were, with hindsight, of the
opinion that prices tended to have been converted to
their disadvantage (EOS Gallup Europe, The euro, two
years later, Flash Eurobarometer 153 , December 2003,
p 17f). The figure 12 months earlier had been 88% (EOS
Gallup Europe, The euro, one year later, Flash Euroba-
rometer 139 , December 2002, p 32f). The idea that the
changeover was unfavourable to consumers has thus be-
come entrenched. Strictly speaking, however, the out-
come of this survey merely implies that the majority of
consumers in Germany believe that prices have been ad-
justed upward more frequently. This is consistent with
the findings of the special study of the individual price
data from the official statistics (see Deutsche Bundes-
bank, Consumer prices and the changeover from
Deutsche Mark to euro, op cit , p 20) although it is not
inconsistent with the statement that the direct price
effects of the euro changeover overall were indeed
upward, albeit not very strong.Consumers’

25so far remained at an historically very high
level.
In statistical terms, however, there are no in-
dications whatsoever that the consumer pricestatistics do not provide a representative over-all picture. Indeed, it should be pointed outthat the prices for a representative basket of750 goods and services are precisely recordedevery month by almost 600 employees of thestatistical offices in 190 reporting areas or40,000 reporting units. In total, around350,000 individual prices are included in thecalculation of the German consumer priceindex. This suggests that the official statisticshave provided a sufficiently realistic record ofconsumer price developments both beforeand after the introduction of the euro.
11
This is also revealed clearly by the fact thatthe official consumer price index does indeedshow the higher prices for some services ofwhich many consumers complained. For themajority of households, however, their im-portance in terms of consumption is not verygreat and they therefore tend to have a lowweight in the overall basket of goods. Asmentioned above, prices for hairdressing roseby an average of 1.9% throughout Germanyin January 2002, but their weight in terms ofexpenditure does not amount to even 1%.Moreover, the special analysis of the individ-ual price data shows that prices were raisedonly by roughly half of the hairdressing salonsobserved by the official statistics. Thoseraising prices did so by around 6% on aver-age.
12There were also hairdressers who
lowered their prices. The accumulation ofrelatively sharp price increases in the case ofsome services, as perceived by the general
public, is therefore clearly identifiable in theindividual data from which the official con-sumer price index is calculated.

11Studies on the effects on prices of the euro cash
changeover are often based on very much smaller sam-
ples and can therefore make only a very limited claim to
being representative. The Institute for Applied Consumer
Research (IFAV), which has analysed price developments
relating to the cash changeover on behalf of the Feder-
ation of German Consumer Organisations, started in
mid-2001 with a sample of 1,151 prices for goods and
349 prices for services, for example. By the time the sur-
veys ended in December 2002, the sample had shrunk to
697 prices for goods and 282 prices for services (Institute
for Applied Consumer Research, Preisbeobachtungen

26the case of many retail goods, countervailing
effects were in play. Detailed surveys on priceperception confirm that consumers ascribeupward pressure on prices to certain servicesas well as food and, in some cases, did indeedgive nuanced replies to the question aboutthe causes.
13
It would therefore be interesting to knowhow this change in households’ perception ofprices – as depicted in, say, the EuropeanCommission’s consumer surveys – may havecome about. One likely reason is that, giventhe actual conversion factor of 1.95583, thecommonly used “rule of thumb” method ofconverting euro prices into D-Mark by using aratio of 1:2 overstates the D-Mark value by2.3%, thus working to the disadvantage ofthe euro. Furthermore, the individual con-sumer is likely to notice “spectacular” priceincreases more than correct conversions,moderate price increases or price reductions,all of which are included in the consumerprice index. In addition, according to the Bun-desbank’s opinion polls on the acceptance ofthe euro, some sections of the general publiccontinued to have reservations about thenew currency after the euro banknotes andcoins had been introduced.
14Finally, difficul-
ties in using the new banknotes and coinsmay have contributed to a feeling of uneasi-ness. According to surveys commissioned bythe European Commission, members of theGerman public, just two years after the cashchangeover, had become better accustomedto using the euro and, according to theirown statements, no longer convert back toD-Mark as often as they used to when doingtheir day-to-day shopping.
15This has not cor-rected the assessment of price effects result-
ing from the changeover, however.
Economic and social psychologists have
shown experimentally that price changesfrom D-Mark to euro are often overesti-mated. Even in the case of a precise conver-sion by the vendor, the consumer often per-ceives an increase in price. The effect isstronger in the case of persons who expecteda price surge generally from the euro change-over.
16This is explained by the fact that calcu-
lation errors are noticed less frequently if theresults of the calculation match personal ex-pectations. In the literature on psychology,this phenomenon is known as “selective errorcorrection”. That could be one major reasonfor the widespread unease about the priceeffects of the euro changeover.
Other experimental studies for the period
prior to the introduction of euro banknotesand coins concluded that, as our price per-ception had been geared to nominal valuesfor many years, the value and/or appropriate

27price of a product or service in euro was
often rated (and accepted) at a higher levelthan in D-Mark.
17Since the conversion ratio
of nearly 1:2 means that the new euro priceslook much lower than the old prices inD-Mark, the perceived inflationary impact ofthe euro can scarcely be explained in thoseterms, however.
18
Implications for the real economy
Given sharp price increases in the case of indi-
vidual products, the lack of transparency (fora time) with regard to prices as well as thetemporarily changed perception of prices,there arises the question of the shorter-termimplications of the euro-cash changeover forthe real economy. In connection with thechangeover to the euro, the European Com-mission asked whether households tended tobuy more because they did not realise howmuch they were spending or whether theytended to buy less because they were afraidto spend too much. The vast majority ofthose surveyed in Germany regarded thesecond category as applying to them.
19It can
be concluded from this that consumers inGermany have become more cautious in theirspending behaviour.
For some time now, household consumption
spending has not been showing an under-lying trend increase. At around 3300 billion in
the third quarter of 2003, spending was nohigher than two years previously. Neverthe-less, given the fact that up to mid-2003 theeconomy as a whole stagnated – and actuallythreatened to go into recession – it would bewrong to attribute weak consumer spending
predominantly, let alone exclusively, to theintroduction of the euro. After all, there hasbeen hardly any increase in households’ dis-posable income for quite some time now,and the labour market situation has deterior-ated substantially. Since the introduction ofeuro cash, the private saving ratio has in-creased by
1/C252percentage point in seasonally
adjusted terms to almost 11% of late. The up-turn in saving had already begun a year earl-ier, however, having reached a low point inthe second half of 2000 at a ratio of 9
1/C252%.
This restraint in consumption has had a par-
ticularly severe effect on two sectors, inwhich there were noticeable price move-ments accompanying the euro changeover.Turnover in the catering trade (restaurants,caf/C216s, ice parlours and snack bars) fell dra-matically in the course of 2002 and has notrecovered since. In the first half of 2002, turn-over was already 3% down on the year. Inthe second half of 2002, the decline in-creased to nearly 9% and, at -8%, wasscarcely any better in the first half of 2003. Inthe case of cinemas, for which information isavailable from the German Federal FilmBoard,

1/C252%. Even though there
are a wide variety of reasons for the fallin turnover in the case of restaurants andcinemas, the “overshooting” of prices inconnection with the euro changeover hasundoubtedly been a factor.
Outlook
In summary, it may be stated that the change-
over to prices in euro has now come a longway. There is still a somewhat wider diversityof prices than before the changeover, and
signs of excessive prices may be found in thecase of some products. Nevertheless, keyprice points have emerged for many goodsand services as they did in the D-Mark era.The retail trade and service providers havebeen flexible in adapting to the new situ-ation. This means that the halving of thenumber of available prices is unlikely to havegenerated additional price rigidities. Accord-ing to the surveys of the European Commis-sion, using the new currency is causing con-sumers fewer and fewer problems, eventhough consumers still often convert back toD-Mark when making major purchases.Given the continuing low rates of inflation inthe euro area, the new currency is likely to begenerally held in increasingly high esteem.

oversight –
a contribution
to the stability
of the financial system
and the efficiency
of payment operationsOverseeing payment systems is one of
the Bundesbank’s fundamental tasksand makes an important contributionto maintaining and strengthening thestability of the financial system.Whereas the term “oversight” is acomparatively recent concept, taskswhich come under this heading havebeen carried out by the Bundesbankfor many years. Two key goals of over-sight are to ensure that payment sys-tems are safe and efficient. This articleconsiders the importance of oversightand explain its objectives in detail. Italso describes the principles underlyingthe Bundesbank’s oversight policy.In carrying out its oversight function,the Bundesbank traditionally takesa market-oriented, cooperative ap-proach. This approach has proved ef-fective in the past and will also con-tinue to be used in the future withinthe framework of the Eurosystem’scommon oversight policy. The Bundes-bank’s activities range from monitor-ing compliance with internationaloversight standards, observing devel-opments in the payment field andmaintaining contacts with market par-ticipants to cooperating with othercentral banks and banking supervisors.The article concludes by mapping outthe main lines of the Bundesbank’sfuture oversight activities.
A payment system is used to transfer financial
assets between banks, enterprises, house-holds and government. On the one hand, it is

DEUTSCHE

30the two-way flow of payments accompany-
ing the exchange of goods and services in thereal economy and, on the other, it serves totransfer claims and pay off liabilities as well asfacilitating the monetary settlement of trans-fers of and shifts in financial assets such as se-curities and foreign currency. Central bankshave a particular interest in payment systemsfor several reasons: they provide accountsand central bank money for the settlement ofpayments, many central banks offer theirown market infrastructure for settling pay-ments, and monetary policy requires a well-functioning payment system.
Legal basis for payment system oversight
The Bundesbank’s responsibility for payment
system oversight is laid down by section 3 ofthe Bundesbank Act. The Act states that,inter alia , the Bundesbank “shall arrange for
the execution of domestic and cross-borderpayments and shall contribute to the stabilityof payment and clearing systems”. In actualfact the “oversight” function in the sense ofthe Bundesbank Act is interpreted as coveringthe entire field of payment operations andnot just payment systems or instruments. TheBundesbank’s oversight activities embrace allaspects of payments, including regulatoryissues.
For the European System of Central Banks
(ESCB), of which the Bundesbank is an inte-gral part, the Treaty establishing the EuropeanCommunity (EC Treaty) and the Statute of theEuropean System of Central Banks and of theEuropean Central Bank (ECB) (Statute) applyin addition. Pursuant to Article 105 (2) of the
EC Treaty and Article 3 of the Statute, theESCB is to promote the smooth operation ofpayment systems. Article 22 of the Statutestates that “the ECB and national centralbanks may provide facilities, and the ECB maymake regulations, to ensure efficient andsound clearing and payment systems withinthe Community and with other countries”.
Payment systems and the stability
of the financial sector
Payment systems constitute an important
part of the financial sector infrastructure. Thecreation of a single money market and an ef-ficient allocation of liquidity within a cur-rency area require efficient, safe and high-availability systems. In the ESCB, the TARGET
1
network, including the German componentRTGS
plus, is the system which meets this im-
portant requirement for implementing singlemonetary policy and for settling paymentssafely.
The default of one or more participants in a
payment system or a malfunctioning of thesystem itself may have a negative impact onother participants and, in an extreme case,may endanger the stability of the entire finan-cial system (domino effect). Payment systemscan consequently be conduits of crises in thefinancial sector and bring such problems tolight. Net systems – systems entailing the mu-tual netting of claims without immediate fi-

31nality of the individual payments and without
the associated intra-day provision of centralbank liquidity – are particularly prone to fi-nancial risks. They also pose problems forbanks’ liquidity management, since incomingpayments in the course of the day are notsimultaneously associated with transfers ofcentral bank liquidity. If these risks are notcountered, the default of a participant thatcannot meet its settlement obligations andthe unwinding of its payments may result inconsiderable liquidity and credit problems forother participants. In gross settlement sys-tems, by contrast, payments are only exe-cuted after it has been verified that sufficientcover is available and the originator’s accounthas been debited, so that the payment recipi-ent has immediate and final access to thecredited amount and is subject to neithercredit risks nor liquidity risks if settlement hasbeen effected in central bank money. In add-ition to the systemic, credit and liquidity risk,payment operations are also subject to oper-ational and legal risk. Disruptions to paymentsystems may also seriously damage the imageof the currency concerned and have devastat-ing consequences for the real economy.
Securities clearing and settlement systems
likewise influence the smooth settlement ofpayments in many ways. The monetary settle-ment of individual payments and balances,which in these systems arise from, for ex-ample, purchasing securities on the stockmarket, is executed via the Bundesbank andtherefore has a direct impact on banks’ cen-tral bank liquidity. Smoothly functioning se-curities settlement systems are also necessaryto enable banks to transfer securities as col-lateral to the Bundesbank quickly and effi-
ciently. This collateral serves to increase cen-tral bank liquidity in two respects. Firstly, itcan be used as collateral for intra-day creditwhich has been guaranteed by the Bundes-bank in the interests of efficient paymentsettlements. Secondly, the collateral can bedeployed in the framework of monetary pol-icy operations with the Eurosystem.
The threats to the financial sector, real econ-
omy and the currency posed by risks arisingfrom payment operations and securitiessettlement must be limited by implementingsuitable measures. With this particular goal inmind, the central banks have drawn up vari-ous oversight standards. In addition, meas-ures were taken at an early stage to reducerisk, such as the introduction of gross settle-ment systems or the widespread use of cen-tral bank money as the monetary settlementmedium in securities trading, for example inovernight processing by Clearstream Frank-furt. This increased use of central bankmoney not only accords with the aim of redu-cing risk but also makes banks’ use of liquid-ity more efficient. Whenever a paymenttransaction or positions are settled in centralbank money, the latter is available to the re-cipient for all further transactions.

32that they comply with these standards and
principles. As an integral part of the ESCBand a member of the Committee on Paymentand Settlement Systems (CPSS) of the G10central banks, the Bundesbank is actively in-volved in developing international standardsand principles. These rules may be referred toas “soft law” because they do not have thestatus of law and are neither universally ap-plicable nor legally binding.
The “Core Principles for Systemically Import-
ant Payment Systems”, which were approvedby the governors of the G10 central banks inJanuary 2001, are of particular importance.They date back to a report published in 1990by the Committee on Interbank NettingSchemes of the Central Banks of the Groupof Ten Countries (known as the “LamfalussyStandards”), which were originally drawn upfor cross-border and multi-currency nettingand settlement systems but which are usedmuch more generally in practice. The ten“Core Principles” relate to legal certainty, themanagement of financial risks, security andoperational reliability, and criteria for partici-pation. Additional principles that were notamong the “Lamfalussy Standards” are theminimum requirements for efficiency, forassets used for settlement and for the gov-ernance arrangements. In addition, the publi-cation also contains statements on the re-sponsibilities of the central bank in applyingthe “Core Principles”. With regard to theoversight of payment systems in the euroarea, the Governing Council of the ECB de-cided to adopt the “Core Principles” of theCPSS as minimum requirements for paymentsystem oversight in the Eurosystem.Risks in payment systems
Credit risk
The risk that a party within the system will
be unable fully to meet its financial obliga-tions within the system either when due orat any time in the future.
Liquidity risk
The risk that a party within the system will
have insufficient funds to meet financialobligations within the system as and whenexpected, although it may be able to do soat some time in the future.
Legal risk
The risk that a poor legal framework or
legal uncertainties will cause or exacerbatecredit or liquidity risks.
Operational risk
The risk that operational factors such as
technical malfunctions or operational mis-takes will cause or exacerbate credit orliquidity risks.
Systemic risk
The risk that the inability of one of the par-
ticipants to meet its obligations, or a dis-ruption in the system itself, could result inthe inability of other system participants orof financial institutions in other parts ofthe financial system to meet their obliga-tions as they become due. Such a failurecould cause widespread liquidity or creditproblems and, as a result, could threatenthe stability of the system or of financialmarkets.

33In June 2003 the Eurosystem additionally
adopted a set of “Oversight standards foreuro retail payment systems” which arebased on the “Core Principles” of the CPSS.They contain indicators for classifying retailpayment systems with a correspondingly dif-ferentiated catalogue of requirements. Theydistinguish between retail systems of systemicimportance, those which are of prominentimportance, and all other systems. Whereasthe first type of system has to fulfil all ten“Core Principles”, important systems needto observe only six of the “Core Principles”(I, II, VII-X). Other systems, where necessary,have to meet other requirements (such asfor electronic money (e-money)) or particularnational regulations.
In the “Report on electronic money” pub-
lished in 1998, the Eurosystem defined itsminimum requirements for the issuance anddesign of e-money. The minimum require-ments relate primarily to oversight and secur-ity aspects as well as to the redeemability ofe-money in central bank money. The reporton e-money is supplemented by the securityobjectives defined for the Eurosystem in con-nection with e-money (“Electronic MoneySystem Security Objectives” report, 2003).
The standards for securities clearing and
settlement systems were drawn up at theEuropean and international levels with the in-volvement of the Bundesbank. The standardsadopted by the Eurosystem for using thesesystems for monetary policy transactionswithin the Eurosystem
2are designed for se-
curities settlement systems – also known ascentral securities depositories (CSDs). Thesesecurities settlement systems are used by
monetary policy partners of the Eurosystemto transfer securities to the Bundesbank ascollateral. The standards lay down the condi-tions – from a fairly narrow user perspective –under which CSDs may act as intermediariesin monetary policy transactions. However,they also have positive effects on securitiessettlement outside of the monetary policycontext.
By contrast, the Recommendations for Secur-
ities Settlement Systems (November 2001)drawn up by a joint working group of theCPSS and the International Organization ofSecurities Commissions (IOSCO) were formu-lated under the broader angle of generaloversight and financial market stability. Theycontain minimum requirements for securitiessettlement systems in industrial and develop-ing countries. This group is currently workingon elaborating minimum standards for cen-tral counterparties (CCPs), which act as inter-mediaries between two counterparties in thecash and forward markets so as to ensuretrade anonymity and reduce the risks for mar-ket participants. At the European level, aworking group of the European System ofCentral Banks and the Committee of Euro-pean Securities Regulators (ESCB-CESR JointWorking Group) deals with the ongoing de-velopment and subsequent implementationof international recommendations. The groupalso takes due account of the requirementsof the single market and European integra-tion.

34Core Principles for systemically important payment systems
I The system should have a well founded
legal basis under all relevant jurisdic-tions.
II The system’s rules and procedures should
enable participants to have a clearunderstanding of the system’s impact oneach of the financial risks they incurthrough participation in it.
III The system should have clearly defined
procedures for the management ofcredit risks and liquidity risks, which spe-cify the respective responsibilities of thesystem operator and the participants andwhich provide appropriate incentives tomanage and contain those risks.
IV
1The system should provide prompt final
settlement on the day of value, prefer-ably during the day and at a minimum atthe end of the day.
V
1A system in which multilateral netting
takes place should, at a minimum, becapable of ensuring the timely comple-tion of daily settlements in the event ofan inability to settle by the participantwith the largest single settlement obliga-tion.
VI Assets used for settlement should prefer-
ably be a claim on the central bank;where other assets are used, they shouldcarry little or no credit risk and little orno liquidity risk.
VII The system should ensure a high degree
of security and operational reliabilityand should have contingency arrange-ments for timely completion of daily pro-
cessing.
VIII The system should provide a means of
making payments which is practical forits users and efficient for the economy.
IX The system should have objective and
publicly disclosed criteria for participa-tion, which permit fair and open access.
X The system’s governance arrangements
should be effective, accountable andtransparent.
Responsibilities of the central bank
in applying the Core Principles
A The central bank should define clearly its
payment system objectives and shoulddisclose publicly its role and major pol-icies with respect to systemically import-ant payment systems.
B The central bank should ensure that the
systems it operates comply with the CorePrinciples.
C The central bank should oversee compli-
ance with the Core Principles by systemsit does not operate and it should havethe ability to carry out this oversight.
D The central bank, in promoting payment
system safety and efficiency through theCore Principles, should cooperate withother central banks and with any otherrelevant domestic or foreign authorities.

35The “Code of Good Practices on Transpar-
ency in Monetary and Financial Policies: Dec-laration of Principles” published by the Inter-national Monetary Fund (IMF) defines require-ments for, inter alia , public authorities which
exercise an oversight function. The Code em-phasises that oversight activities are to begoverned by the principle of transparencywith regard to their role and underlying prin-ciples.
Payment systems and efficiency
An efficient payment system requires cost-
effective procedures which accord with users’preferences. Payment costs can be reducedthrough various means. These include re-placing paper-based instruments (for ex-ample, paper-based credit transfer orders,cheques) by electronic instruments and pro-cedures. The higher the degree of straight-through processing (STP) of payment ordersand information from the payer to the benefi-ciary, the greater the efficiency. Gaps in themedia and interfaces between different pro-cedures lead to higher transmission costs butalso to longer processing times and an in-creased risk of errors. In this connection, theBundesbank has recently been discussing twoissues with the banking industry. Firstly, onthe subject of a German Automated ClearingHouse (ACH), it was considered whether thecurrent outsourcing of services to transactionbanks should perhaps instead be channelledinto a national ACH. Secondly, the Bundes-bank is actively endeavouring to replace thecurrent paper-based forms for large-valuecheques by a national electronic imaging pro-
cedure.
Besides costs, user preferences also play a
role in the efficiency of payment systems.These relate to such things as the safety andcomfort of procedures and instruments, theprocessing time of payments and banks’ li-quidity management, for which – as men-tioned above – the use of central bankmoney is of particular importance. Therefore,the Bundesbank focuses its attention onbanks as users. While the Bundesbank’s man-date is not oriented to consumer protection,an increase in efficiency never exclusivelybenefits the banks but is also in the interestsof the banks’ customers. Other authoritiesconcern themselves with consumer issues.For example, the European Parliament andCouncil have issued a regulation on cross-border payments in euro according to whichcharges for cross-border payments in euro areto match those for domestic euro payments.
Account needs to be taken in the context of
payment systems of particular aspects con-cerning the efficient allocation of resourcesthat arise from the network structure of pay-ment systems. The utility of a payment sys-tem or payment instrument for the partici-pant increases with its extensiveness and ac-ceptance. Owing to this positive network ex-ternality, it is advantageous to choose coord-inated procedures for payment systems sincecompatible, interoperable elements broadenthe potential user base and thus boost itsusage.

36Deutsche BundesbankCPSS-IOSCO recommendations for securities settlement systems
1 Legal framework
Securities settlement systems should have a well
founded, clear and transparent legal basis in the rele-vant jurisdictions.
2 Trade confirmation
Confirmation of trades between direct market partici-
pants should occur as soon as possible after trade exe-cution, but no later than trade date (T+0). Where con-firmation of trades by indirect market participants(such as institutional investors) is required, it shouldoccur as soon as possible after trade execution, prefer-ably on T+0, but no later than T+1.
3.Settlement cycles
Rolling settlement should be adopted in all securities
markets. Final settlement should occur no later thanT+3. The benefits and costs of a settlement cycle short-er than T+3 should be evaluated.
4 Central counterparties (CCPs)
The benefits and costs of a CCP should be evaluated.
Where such a mechanism is introduced, the CCPshould rigorously control the risks it assumes.
5 Securities lending
Securities lending and borrowing (or repurchase
agreements and other economically equivalent trans-actions) should be encouraged as a method for exped-iting the settlement of securities transactions. Barriersthat inhibit the practice of lending securities for thispurpose should be removed.6 Central securities depositories (CSDs)
Securities should be immobilised or dematerialised
and transferred by book entry in CSDs to the greatestextent possible.
7 Delivery versus payment (DVP)
CSDs should eliminate principal risk by linking secur-
ities transfers to funds transfers in a way that achievesdelivery versus payment.
8 Timing of settlement finality
Final settlement should occur no later than the end of
the settlement day. Intraday or real-time finalityshould be provided where necessary to reduce risks.
9 CSD risk controls to address participants’ failures to
settle
CSDs that extend intraday credit to participants, in-
cluding CSDs that operate net settlement systems,should institute risk controls that, at a minimum, en-sure timely settlement in the event that the partici-pant with the largest payment obligation is unable tosettle. The most reliable set of controls is a combin-ation of collateral requirements and limits.
10 Cash settlement assets
Assets used to settle the ultimate payment obligations

3711 Operational reliability
Sources of operational risk arising in the clearing and
settlement process should be identified and minim-ised through the development of appropriate sys-tems, controls and procedures. Systems should be reli-able and secure, and have adequate, scalable capacity.Contingency plans and backup facilities should be es-tablished to allow for timely recovery of operationsand completion of the settlement process.
12 Protection of customers’ securities
Entities holding securities in custody should employ
accounting practices and safekeeping procedures thatfully protect customers’ securities. It is essential thatcustomers’ securities be protected against the claimsof a custodian’s creditors.
13 Governance
Governance arrangements for CSDs and CCPs should
be designed to fulfil public interest requirements andto promote the objectives of owners and users.
14 Access
CSDs and CCPs should have objective and publicly dis-
closed criteria for participation that permit fair andopen access.15 Efficiency
While maintaining safe and secure operations, secur-
ities settlement systems should be cost-effective inmeeting the requirements of users.
16 Communication procedures and standards
Securities settlement systems should use or accommo-
date the relevant international communication pro-cedures and standards in order to facilitate efficientsettlement of cross-border transactions.
17 Transparency
CSDs and CCPs should provide market participants
with sufficient information for them to identify andevaluate accurately the risks and costs associated withusing the CSD or CCP services.
18 Regulation and oversight
Securities settlement systems should be subject to
transparent and effective regulation and oversight.Central banks and securities regulators should cooper-ate with each other and with other relevant author-ities.
19 Risks in cross-border links
CSDs that establish links to settle cross-border trades
should design and operate such links to reduce effect-ively the risks associated with cross-border settle-ments.

38An important instrument for achieving this
aim is the development of common technicaland organisational standards and the actualimplementation of existing payment systemstandards. Without such standards it wouldbe necessary to insert conversion links intothe payment processing chain, which wouldnormally result in a lower level of efficiencyfor both the customer and the banking indus-try. Technical standards can arise from marketprocesses, develop from cooperative venturesbetween private and sometimes public play-ers or be laid down by institutional standardsetters. In their role as a catalyst, centralbanks can promote coordination or canthemselves set standards and, for example,further develop the systems they operate ac-cordingly. However, only standard setterswhich have practical market experience and/or work closely with market participants arelikely to be in a position to develop and imple-ment the best possible standards.
The Bundesbank has traditionally been in-
volved in Germany with the development oftechnical standards for payment systems andparticipates, for example, in the correspond-ing bodies of the Central Credit Committee(CCC). The “Automation” task force of theBusiness Management Committee draws upagreements for standardising interbank pay-ments in Germany. The agreements are basedon the consent of all the parties involved andare legally binding for all banks which are af-filiated to the various national federations ofthe banking industry that were signatories tothe agreement. After they have been signed,the agreements are reported to the FederalCartel Office because they reverse the prin-ciple of no collusion among competitors. If
no objections are made within three monthsafter being reported, the agreements becomefinal and absolute in law.
To a certain extent, the same conditions pre-
vail in payment systems as in natural monop-olies: across-the-board returns to scale andhigh sunk costs (such as the initial investmentin constructing a payment system or develop-ing technical standards). High sunk costs andthe need for a critical mass of participants inthe payment network constitute entry bar-riers in the markets concerned and stop po-tential competitors from entering the market.The Bundesbank has countered this problemthrough its competitively neutral provision ofpayment services to all banks, thereby enab-ling every institution to directly participate inpayment operations and at the same time en-suring a nationwide coverage permitting allinstitutions to access the payment systems.Moreover, the creation and application ofcommon technical standards and procedureshas not led to monopolistic structures in Ger-many but instead has fostered keen competi-tion among banks with regard to operatinghours, prices, running times and additionalservices, which has had positive conse-quences for consumers.
Path dependency, ie the impact of past deci-
sions on future decisions, plays a major role inthe efficiency of payment systems. There is adanger that structures which have becomeinefficient as a result of changes in the oper-ational setting will remain in place simply be-cause changing the system and the standardswould be too expensive.

39weighed up against the benefits of changing
the standard, which are rather limited until acritical mass of users of the new standard hasbeen reached. Introducing innovations is add-itionally hampered by increased uncertaintysurrounding the assessment of new proced-ures and by a lack of knowledge about alter-native options. Hence a new procedure withgreater long-term efficiency may fail to re-place an older procedure that is less efficientin the long term. This problem can be over-come through a coordinated approach, suchas a joint changeover to a new standard. Forexample, one of the objectives that the Bun-desbank has persistently pursued is to con-tinue reducing the use of traditional chequeswhich, compared with alternative paymentmethods such as paperless credit transfers ordirect debits, have considerable efficiencydeficits.
The single currency and growing economic
integration have highlighted the aforemen-tioned coordination problems at the Euro-pean level. Even payment system structureswhich have achieved high levels of efficiencyat a national level exhibit inefficiencies in theinternational environment because of a lackof compatibility. This applies particularly tothe European retail payment system which isstill fragmented, whereas the large-value pay-ment system is already more harmonised.
3
The Bundesbank therefore supports and,through collaboration with the German bank-ing industry, is involved in efforts to establishconsistent European standards. These arelikely to yield efficiency gains in the long termvis-/C224-vis the proven national standards.Relationship between safety
and efficiency
In large-value payment systems the safety as-
pect is more to the fore, whereas in retail pay-ment systems the focus is on the efficiencyaspect. To a large extent these two objectivesof payment system oversight are compatiblewith one another because users have prefer-ences for a specific safety level of the pay-ment systems or instruments. Only systemswhich satisfy the users’ preferences and arewidely accepted can also be efficient in thelong run in that, given the aforementionednetwork structure, a critical mass of usersmust be reached so as to achieve the corres-ponding returns to scale and operate profit-able systems. Owing to a lack of transpar-ency, however, systems with high risks mightalso be retained. Central banks can sharpenrisk awareness in this context and encouragea changeover to procedures with greatersafety and efficiency. The Bundesbankachieved this by developing Euro AccessFrankfurt (EAF) from a net system to a hybridsystem and then later changing to the grosssettlement system RTGS
plus. A high liquidity
efficiency was attained in addition by usingliquidity-saving elements and giving banksthe opportunity to manage payment flows.
However, the two aims of safety and effi-
ciency are not fully compatible, also in thelight of externalities in risk mitigation. For ex-ample, problems experienced by an individual

40system participant result in costs for other sys-
tem participants. Moreover, disruptions inpayment operations lead to problems in otherareas, such as the currency and the real econ-omy. These external costs are not, however,factored into the cost/benefit considerationsof individual participants. All in all, there is adanger that participants in payment systemsmay be less interested in safe systems than ismacroeconomically desirable.
Oversight function exercised
by the Bundesbank
The Bundesbank acts under the regulations
of the Eurosystem, which oversees the pay-ment and settlement systems in the euroarea. This task also embraces the centralbanks’ own systems. The “Statement on therole of the Eurosystem in the field of paymentsystems oversight” published in 2000 ex-plained in detail the goals of oversight andoutlined the organisational distribution of du-ties within the Eurosystem. According to thisstatement the Governing Council of the ECBdefines the fundamental political stance ofthe Eurosystem’s oversight policy. The imple-mentation of this stance is based on the prin-ciple of decentralisation and is usually the re-sponsibility of the national central bank (NCB)of the country in which the system concernedis legally registered. In the case of cross-border systems, this NCB has the leadingoversight role and cooperates with the otherNCBs concerned. Systems which do not havea clear national anchoring are normally over-seen by the NCB of the country in which thesystem is legally registered. The GoverningCouncil of the ECB can, however, transfer the
leading oversight function for such latter sys-tems to the ECB; this was the case for theEURO1 system of the Euro Banking Associ-ation (EBA), which is registered in France butlargely operates according to German law.
The German payment system infrastructure is
characterised by the coexistence of paymentsystems and other settlement procedures.There are currently two payment systems asdefined in the EU Directive on Settlement Fi-nality in Payment and Securities SettlementSystems (Settlement Finality Directive). Bothsystems are operated by the Bundesbank.Large-value payments are handled by RTGS
plus
and retail payments by the Retail PaymentSystem (RPS). In connection with the Bundes-bank’s own systems, responsibilities for over-sight and for operation are segregated. Thisinternal organisational structure meets theminimum requirements of the GoverningCouncil of the ECB and of the IMF.
RTGS
plusis of systemic importance for the fi-
nancial system and is checked for compliancewith the “Core Principles” in the context ofpayment system oversight. Given its marketshare in Germany of just over 15%, RPS isclassified as an “other system”. As a result,the European oversight standards do notapply to it. RPS is nevertheless subject tooversight – as are the bilateral clearing ar-rangements between commercial banks’ cen-tral offices and their principal payment officesor the respective internal payment networksof the cooperative and savings banks, whichmake up the remaining 85% of interbanksettlements in the retail payment sector.

41Bundesbank oversees not only the payment
systems but also the payment instruments; inthis connection electronic cards and internetusage have acquired considerable import-ance. Among other things, the Bundesbank islooking at the design of the smart card ( Geld-
Karte ) scheme, the e-money system operated
by the German banking industry. The securityaspects of this smart card are being analysedin cooperation with the Federal Office forSecurity in Information Technology (BSI).
The Bundesbank also makes its infrastructure
available in the area of securities settlements.The Electronic Securities Settlement (ESS)system is an electronic interface betweenClearstream Banking Frankfurt AG and theBundesbank for transmitting data for themonetary settlement of securities transac-tions. This procedure is also subject to over-sight.
Payment system oversight can be carried out
by central banks with a varying intensity ofintervention. This ranges from a market-oriented approach with very little or no inter-vention, a cooperative oversight approach incollaboration with market players to a highlyregulatory approach. The Bundesbank trad-itionally uses the first two approaches. In theeuro area the ECB has the right to issue regu-lations (Article 22 of the Statute). It has, how-ever, not yet exercised this right. The success-ful cooperation between the Bundesbankand the payment system players – particularlythrough the CCC – has contributed greatly tothe high degree of safety and efficiency inGerman payment systems and rendered regu-lation largely unnecessary. The fact that it isitself a payment system operator means that
the Bundesbank is able not only to ensurecompetitively neutral access to the market forall banks but also to directly influence thesafety and efficiency of payment systems. Theuse of moral suasion vis-/C224-vis market playersis another effective instrument for imple-menting general and technical oversightstandards. Another option available to theBundesbank is informing the general publicabout any irregularities and risks. Through itsparticipation in various committees of theGerman CSD, Clearstream Banking FrankfurtAG, which deal with policy and organisation-al issues, the Bundesbank also helps to ensurethat, concerning the financial settlement ofsecurities transactions, the interests of thesystems’ users and public needs are dulytaken into account.
Comprehensive and up-to-date information is
a key requirement for oversight activities. TheBundesbank therefore attentively follows andanalyses developments in the German pay-ment landscape. The scope of analysis em-braces not only publicly accessible media orspecifically requested material but also com-plaints and court rulings in the field of pay-ment systems. Ongoing insights and the ex-pertise which the Bundesbank has gainedfrom developing and operating its own large-value and retail payment systems are likewiseof particular importance. The Bundesbankholds meetings directly with market playersand associations of the banking industry atvarious levels. It also participates in relevantevents organised by the banking industry andstages its own conferences, seminars andworking meetings. Moreover, the Bundes-

The Bundesbank makes use of the insights
which it gains from its oversight function inits payment policy activities at the national,European and G10 level as well as in its ownpublications and other public statements onpayment operations, which range thematical-ly from structural to technical issues.

The “execution of cashless pay-ment and clearing operations (giro business)”and “the issuance and administration of elec-tronic money (e-money business)” qualify asbanking business, while “the issuance and
administration of credit cards and travellers’cheques (credit card business)” is a financialservice. A licence from the Federal FinancialSupervisory Authority (BaFin) is required tocarry out these business activities. Pursuant tosection 6 (2) of the Banking Act, one ofBaFin’s tasks is to “counteract undesirable de-velopments in the banking and financial ser-vices sector which may endanger the safetyof the assets entrusted to institutions, impairthe proper conduct of banking business orprovision of financial services or involve ser-ious disadvantages for the national econ-omy”.
Pursuant to section 7 of the Banking Act, the
Bundesbank is responsible for the ongoingmonitoring of institutions. This specifically in-cludes evaluating the documents submittedby institutions as well as performing andevaluating audits of banking operations.However, the Bundesbank has sole responsi-bility for payment system oversight. Problemsand risks of prudential relevance which cometo light during the monitoring and oversightactivities are reported to the banking super-visors at the Bundesbank and at BaFin. Onthe one hand, this cooperation is necessary toensure that concrete penalties can be im-posed wherever negative developments areexposed in the payment processing of one ormore banks. On the other hand, the Bundes-bank also cooperates with BaFin in areaswhich equally affect both agencies. One ex-ample of this is the oversight of new paymentprocedures such as e-money systems.

43To institutionalise cooperation and the ex-

The memo-randum, which is not legally binding, is basedon the consideration that banking supervisionand payment system oversight are pursuing acommon goal – namley, safeguarding the sta-bility of the financial system. The respectiveremits of these two agencies changed tosome extent at the start of monetary union inthat payment system oversight became oneof the basic tasks of the Eurosystem, ie thecentral banks, whereas banking supervisionremains the responsibility of national agenciesand not every central bank is responsible for
or involved in banking supervision in its owncountry.
Besides overseeing payment systems in Ger-
many, the Bundesbank is also involved in theoversight of supranational payment systems.The ECB is the leading overseer for the EBA’ssystems. The Bundesbank is involved in thisoversight through its participation in the re-spective working groups of the ESCB. Thesame applies to the oversight of the Continu-ous Linked Settlement (CLS) system, whichcame into operation in September 2002 forthe purpose of settling foreign exchangetransactions and which, thanks to its design,largely eliminates FX settlement risk.

44in the cooperative oversight with regard to
settlements in euro. The Bundesbank is in-volved in the oversight of CLS both as a mem-ber of the Eurosystem, via the ESCB workinggroups, and as the NCB of the German directparticipants. Furthermore, the Bundesbanktakes part in a working group of the CPSS ofthe G10 which supports the Federal ReserveSystem within the framework of the coopera-tive oversight of the entire CLS system. Al-though it is not a payment system, SWIFT
5is
also monitored as part of payment systemoversight. Within the cooperative oversightframework, the G10 central banks – whichinclude the Bundesbank – support the activ-ities of the National Bank of Belgium, whichis the leading overseer of SWIFT.
Outlook
On the whole, the Bundesbank has carried
out its oversight function, which it has trad-itionally seen as forming part of its mandatespelled out in section 3 of the BundesbankAct, successfully and in doing so has made asubstantial contribution to the high level ofsafety and efficiency of the German paymentlandscape. In this context the cooperativeapproach to oversight has proved to be botheffective and appropriate. In this connectionthe Bundesbank will further intensify its on-going dialogue with the banking industry
– also by means of bilateral discussions withindividual banks – and communicate its ob-jectives in an appropriate and transparentform to both the banking industry and thegeneral public.
The Bundesbank sees important focal points
of its future oversight activities in identifyingthe adjustment requirements of the Germanstructures with regard to establishing a singleEuropean payment area and in further de-veloping provisions to cope with emergenciesand contingencies in the financial sector(business continuity planning). The Bundes-bank will also monitor changes in the valuechain of the payment systems, arising, for ex-ample, from the involvement of transactioninstitutions and banks, and the resultant im-plications for central banks, or the innovativedesign of electronic payment procedures –without which, for example, the develop-ment of e-commerce would be retarded. Fi-nally, the Bundesbank will continue to evalu-ate the experience of other central banks inconnection with payment system oversightwith a review to further refining its own over-sight activities.

45The new MFI interest
rate statistics –
methodology for
collecting the German
dataFollowing several years of preparing a
strategy for harmonising nationalinterest rate statistics in the countriesparticipating in European monetaryunion, the new MFI interest rate statis-tics, collected monthly in a uniformmanner, were introduced in January2003. These statistics provide data onnew business in, and outstandingamounts of, all euro-denominated de-posits and loans of euro-area monetaryfinancial institutions (MFIs). These datasupply essential information for theanalysis of monetary developmentsand the monetary transmission mech-anism as well as for monitoring finan-cial stability. The harmonised interestrate statistics supersede the Bundes-bank’s survey of lending and depositrates, which had been of interest tomany segments of the private sector.The vast difference between the meth-odology of the German contributionto the new MFI interest rate statisticsand the Bundesbank’s previous statis-tics makes it very difficult to comparethe two sets of statistics. This article de-scribes the methodology for collectingthe German data for the MFI interestrate statistics. It also explains how thenew method differs conceptually fromthe old system and presents key con-clusions regarding the interpretationof the two sets of statistics.

46Purpose of MFI interest rate statistics
The “Implementation Package”1of July
1996, in which the European Monetary Insti-tute had compiled all the measures needed toharmonise the methods used by national cen-tral banks to collect statistics, already laid thefoundation stone for the MFI interest ratestatistics, which are to be collected in a uni-form manner in all countries participating inEuropean monetary union. Because the workon harmonising the consolidated balancesheet of the euro-area banking sector was apriority task, at first only a short-term ap-proach for interest rate statistics was imple-mented. To that end, for significant categor-ies of products, non-harmonised interestrates on credit institutions’ business with pri-vate non-banks, which central banks were al-ready able to provide, were aggregated toproduce euro-area interest rates. Owing todifferences in data collection methodologyacross countries, however, these data wereonly of limited usefulness.
The Bundesbank provided data from its sur-
vey of lending and deposit rates so that theseeuro-area interest rates could be calculated.From June 1967 onwards, these statisticscontained the interest rates on standardisednew deposit and credit business as agreedmost frequently within a two-week reportingperiod by selected credit institutions in Ger-many with domestic non-bank customers.
2In
July 2003 the Bundesbank’s interest rate stat-istics were superseded by the German contri-bution to the MFI interest rate statistics.Owing to the relative heterogeneity of bank-ing products and terms across the euro-areacountries, the methodology underpinning the
harmonised statistics is more complex thanthat on which the national statistics had beenpreviously based.
Since January 2003 the MFI interest rate stat-
istics have been collected monthly by all euro-area central banks on the basis of a EuropeanCentral Bank Regulation.
3The interest rates
applied by MFIs in Germany and the corres-ponding volumes of new business in the re-porting month as well as of all contracts foreuro-denominated lending and deposit busi-ness with euro-area households and non-financial corporations outstanding at the endof the month form the basis of the Germancontribution to these statistics.
The data from the MFI interest rate statistics
will be used primarily for analysing monetarydevelopments and the monetary transmissionmechanism as well as for monitoring financialstability in the euro area. While deposit ratesmay indicate, for instance, how componentsof the money stock are remunerated, lendingrates may be used to assess the financingconditions of the economy as a whole. In
1See European Monetary Institute, The statistical re-
quirements for Monetary Union, July 1996, p 4.
2The Bundesbank introduced its survey of lending and
deposit rates in 1967, just two months after government
interest rate controls were lifted, as a means of observing
the structure and movement of interest rates in Germany.
In the first few years data were reported quarterly; from
1975 reports were returned monthly.

The new collection methodology
The scheme for collecting and reporting MFI
interest rate statistics comprises averageinterest rates and business volumes, whichneed to be computed according to a prede-fined methodology and classified accordingto predefined sectors and categories of loansand deposits as well as categories of matur-ities and amounts.
5
The survey of lending and deposit rates previ-ously used by the Bundesbank captured newagreements concluded with the majority ofcustomers within the two middle weeks of amonth, including extensions of and changesto earlier agreements, without any weighting.By contrast, the new MFI interest rate statis-tics record not only interest rates on newbusiness but also corresponding informationon outstanding amounts of banks’ claims onand liabilities to customers as at the last dayof each month. When the books are closedon the last day of the reference month, insti-tutions calculate the interest rates and vol-umes of all outstanding lending and depositbusiness and derive a volume-weighted aver-age interest rate for each reporting category.Claims relating to existing bad loans and forwhich loan loss provisions have been formedare excluded, as are loans for debt restructur-ing at rates below market conditions.Banks use two different procedures for col-
lecting data on new business. In the case ofdeposits with an agreed maturity, repos andall loans excluding overdrafts, new businessencompasses all new agreements betweencustomers and banks during the reportingmonth. These include all financial arrange-ments in which terms were agreed for thefirst time in the reporting month as well as allexisting contracts renegotiated with the ac-tive involvement of the customers. By con-trast, automatic prolongations, changes invariable interest rates caused by contractuallypredefined interest rate adjustments, or apreviously agreed changeover from a fixedrate to a variable rate and vice versa are notregarded as new business. The interest ratesare calculated as volume-weighted averagesof all new agreements concluded during thereporting month. The second method is ap-plied to overnight deposits, deposits redeem-able at notice and bank overdrafts. For thesecategories of instruments, data on new busi-ness are collected – for practical reasons – atthe end of the month in question, analogous-ly to outstanding amounts. What this meansis that, for these categories of deposits andloans, banks use the business volumes out-standing at the last day of the reporting

statistics to calculate average interest rates.6
Whereas the Bundesbank’s survey of lendingand deposit rates had featured nominal ratesin standardised business, the MFI interestrate statistics collect effective interest rateswhich are to be calculated according tothe methods stipulated in Regulation (EC)No 63/2002 of the European Central Bankand which contain not only “market condi-tions” but also favourable interest ratesgranted by credit institutions to employeesand large customers, for instance. For alltypes of loans and deposits, the effectiveinterest rates are calculated either as “annual-ised agreed rates” or as “narrowly definedeffective rates” as recommended by theInternational Securities Market Association(ISMA); apart from the interest payments, noother related costs (such as the cost of en-quiries, administration, preparation of docu-ments, guarantees and credit insurance) arefactored into the calculation.
7The only differ-
ence between the two methods of calculat-ing effective interest rates is in the underlyingCalculating effective interest ratesin the MFI interest rate statisticsaccording to ISMA: “annualised agreedrate”, “narrowly defined effectiverate” and “annual percentage rateof charge”
The “annualised agreed rate” (AAR) is the interest rate
that is individually agreed between the bank and thecustomer and converted to an annual interest rate. It isa simplified version of the “narrowly defined effectiverate” (NDER). If interest capitalisation occurs at regularintervals within the year, the agreed interest rate is an-nualised using the formula below.

The NDER is the annualised interest rate which equalises
the present value of all commitments other thancharges (deposits or loans, payments or repayments,interest payments), future or existing, agreed by thereporting agents and the household or non-financialcorporation.
The “annual percentage rate of charge” (APRC) pursu-
ant to Directive 87/102/EEC contains, in addition, anyother related costs (eg for enquiries, administration,preparation of documents, guarantees and credit insur-ance).
An iterative procedure is generally necessary to calcu-
late the NDER and the APRC. For certain loans, they canbe calculated as shown below.

Deutsche Bundesbank6Accounts with overnight deposits, deposits redeemable
at notice and bank overdrafts are generally host to nu-
merous inpayments and outpayments each month, each
of which changes the overall balance. The additional col-
lection over the course of the month of new agreements
which are no longer outstanding at the end of the month
would have placed an unreasonable reporting burden on
the reporting agents; in addition, the business volumes in
question would have been expanded disproportionately.

ment which is due at the start of the contract and in-
cluded in the calculation of interest rates. However, a
bank customer’s taxes and subsidies granted by third par-
ties are ignored. This means that government building
loan premiums are not included in the calculation of the

addition, for the overarching categories of“consumer loans” and “housing loans” tohouseholds, the “annual percentage rate ofcharge” as defined in Directive 87/102/EEC,which comprises the total costs to the cus-tomer, is also to be reported.
The MFI interest rate statistics make a clear
distinction between “households” and “non-financial corporations” in terms of interestrates and volumes so that the different inter-est rate structures in MFIs’ lending and de-posit business with these two customer cat-egories can be observed.
9Non-financial cor-
porations correspond to the ESA 95 definitionand comprise all enterprises (including part-nerships) other than banks, insurance com-panies and other financial institutions. Thedefinition of “households” comprises indi-viduals (including sole proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households (egchurches, political parties, trades unions orcharities).
The objective of harmonising the national
interest rate statistics was to establish a uni-form system for different banking products inthe euro area and to calculate interest ratedata for comparable groups of products. Inthis vein, the instruments which once servedas reference variables in the Bundesbank’ssurvey of lending and deposit rates were re-defined in the German contribution to theMFI interest rate statistics. The new groups ofinstruments are generally consistent with theclassification principles set out in Regulation(EC) No 2423/2001 of the European CentralBank concerning the consolidated balancesheet of the monetary financial institutions
sector. Deposit liabilities are broken downinto overnight deposits, deposits with agreedmaturity, deposits redeemable at notice andrepos. As regards asset items, loans to house-holds are mostly classified by purpose, ie theyare broken down into loans for consumptionpurposes, housing loans and loans for otherpurposes. Consumer loans comprise all loansgranted for the purchase of goods and ser-vices for personal use. Housing loans comprisesecured and unsecured loans for investmentin housing, including building and home im-provements. All other loans to households aregrouped together in a residual category called“other loans”, which includes loans for debtconsolidation, education or business pur-poses. In addition, bank overdrafts are shownas a separate category under new business.They are defined as debit balances on currentaccounts. They are generally assumed not tohave a defined maturity and may be drawnon without the customer giving prior notice.In a departure from the Bundesbank’s earlierpractice, bank overdrafts include personalcredit lines and current account credit thathave been specifically agreed as well as thosethat are simply tolerated, and the terms ofwhich may also include penalties.
For a variety of analytical purposes the MFI
interest rate statistics needed to include an
8These two approaches will lead to identical effective
interest rates if interest is capitalised regularly and the fre-
quency of interest capitalisation matches the frequency
of redemptions (or, in the case of a loan, the frequency of
repayments).
9The only time a sectoral breakdown is not made is in
the case of repos and deposits redeemable at notice; for
the latter, deposits of non-financial corporations are allo-
cated to the household sector.Breakdown

50additional detailed breakdown of financial
products by maturity categories, ie in termsof the typical features regarding original ma-turity, notice period or initial rate fixation. Inorder to be able to examine the interest bur-den on the non-financial sector, for instance,the outstanding amounts on which interestrates are to be reported are to be brokendown by various categories of original matur-ities in line with the aforementioned Regula-tion (EC) No 2423/2001. Data on new busi-ness should primarily reveal how quickly andto what extent changes in key ECB rates arereflected in banks’ lending rates. This meansthat new deposit contracts are classifiedeither according to original maturity or periodof notice, depending on the type of deposit.For new loans, the initial interest rate fixationis the decisive criterion since the period ofinterest rate fixation is a more important fac-tor than the overall maturity of the loan in de-termining the newly agreed interest rate. Inthe new interest rate statistics, variable rateloans are no longer listed separately, as wasdone by the Bundesbank in the past, but aresubsumed under the category “up to oneyear initial rate fixation”.
The Bundesbank’s previous interest rate stat-
istics broke down the interest rates on currentaccount credit, instalment credits and loansto enterprises, as well as time deposits andsavings deposits, into amount categories. Thisenabled the observation of differences ininterest rate levels for “smaller” and “larger”contracts as well as of the impact of eachcustomer group’s “market power”. Hadthis breakdown of amount categories beenadopted for all product categories in the newMFI interest rate statistics, the added benefit
to the users would have been outweighedby the undue reporting burden placed on thereporting agents. Therefore, the tried andtested approach of differentiating by amountwas restricted to new loans by MFIs to non-financial enterprises. In this case, interestrates and business volumes are to be listedseparately in the amount categories of “up to31 million” and “over 31 million”.
Selection of reporting agents in Germany
The statistical reporting population for the
German contribution to the MFI interest ratestatistics is composed of a sample of around200 institutions spread across 15 strata. AllMFIs in Germany are subdivided on the basisof a combination of categories of banks andregional criteria, with the largest institutionsfrom each stratum being chosen.
Around 350 credit institutions of various sizes
from nearly all categories of banks and allparts of Germany, with the focus on the re-gional banking centres, were contributing re-ports to the Bundesbank’s survey of lendingand deposit rates by the time they were dis-continued. When the previous system wasterminated, 15% of the potential reportingpopulation accounted for 53% of the lendingand deposit business relevant to the interestrate statistics, whereas in the new MFI inter-est rate statistics, 8

51– specifically, the regional institutions of credit
cooperatives, banks with special functionsand building and loan associations – were in-cluded in the new statistical reporting popula-tion. Moreover, the selection of the samplefor the German contribution to the MFI inter-est rate statistics placed greater emphasis onmajor institutions. In the past, some majorcredit institutions had submitted separate re-ports for selected branches, whereas in thenew MFI interest rate statistics every reportingagent in Germany submits total values for allbranches, analogously to the monthly bal-ance sheet statistics. This change of methodwas intended to streamline the collection ofdata for the interest rate statistics and bal-ance sheet statistics as much as possible, thusenabling the results obtained to be linkedclosely. It was for that same reason that Ger-man reporting agents were not permitted to
submit group reports to the MFI interest ratestatistics.
The principles underlying the procedure for
selecting reporting agents for the MFI interestrate statistics from the potential reportingpopulation are set forth in Regulation (EC)No 63/2002 (in Germany, these comprise allMFIs domiciled in Germany excluding theBundesbank and money market funds). Thatdocument lists those steps which nationalcentral banks are to take to define the param-eters of the selection procedure and then tochoose the reporting agents.
A fundamental decision had first to be taken
as to whether to apply a census or a samplingapproach. In a census, all institutions areNumber of reporting agents (around 350 1)

52treated equally; however, it places an ex-
tremely great cost burden on the nationalbanking sector as a whole. Since the idea ofthese interest rate statistics is to calculate“average prices” for various banking prod-ucts, it is not necessary to survey all partici-pants in the banking market. A sample canalso enable average prices to be calculatedwith a sufficient degree of precision. The newbusiness volumes necessary for weighting thenational contributions to the euro-area resultscan also be grossed up with sufficient accur-acy for all MFIs using the information sup-plied by the actual reporting population. TheBundesbank therefore decided to use a sam-pling approach to calculate the German con-tribution to the MFI interest rate statistics. Asfewer than 10% of German banks needed tobe included in the survey, this method en-abled the total costs associated with the stat-
istical reporting requirements to be kepttightly in check. To minimise the samplingerror, a representative selection of reportingagents needed to be made. The informationnecessary for this purpose was obtained byevaluating the Bundesbank’s previous surveyof lending and deposit rates and the monthlybalance sheet statistics.
In order to improve the representativity of the
sample, the potential reporting populationwas broken down into strata that were ashomogeneous as possible in terms of the MFIinterest rate statistics. The variance decom-position method, also known as Huygens’theorem, was used to derive the most con-venient stratification. It splits up the total vari-ance of a sample into variance within theNumber of reporting agents (around 200)

53stratum (intra-stratum variance) and variance
between strata (extra-stratum variance). Theobjective of stratification was for intra-stratum variance to be lower than extra-stratum variance. Besides homogeneity, itwas also important to obtain strata which aremost conducive to the subsequent analysis ofthe data. Stratification only by category ofbanks or only by regional aspects provedincapable of producing satisfactory results.Only a combination of banking group andregion ultimately proved to be the right ap-proach. It does not, however, allow results tobe broken down by specific categories ofbanks or selected regions in Germany.
Two decisive criteria had to be observed
when defining the size of the sample: thenumber of reporting agents needed to bekept to a minimum while at the same time
guaranteeing that the measured results main-tained a given standard of accuracy. The aver-age interest rates calculated from the data inthe sample were permitted to deviate fromthe true (unknown) average only by a max-imum random error. Using the variance ofinterest reports estimated from the Bundes-bank’s survey of lending and deposit rates, itwas possible to derive, given this criterion, anecessary sample size of around 200 banks.
Regulation (EC) No 63/2002 lays down three
basic methods of determining how many in-stitutions to draw from each stratum. Thenumber of reporting agents may be the samefor each stratum, dependent on the varianceof the sampling variables or proportional tothe size of each stratum. The Bundesbank

54chose the third option. The size of the sample
from each stratum was chosen in proportionto the stratum’s share in an aggregated vol-ume of loans and deposits derived from themonthly balance sheet statistics. The actualreporting population was selected not at ran-dom but because they were the largest insti-tutions in each stratum. This avoided placinga relatively heavy cost burden on smaller insti-tutions, which requiring them to submit re-ports would have done.
Changes in the characteristics of the report-
ing agents, institutions joining and leavingthe potential reporting population and newdevelopments in the financial sector cancause the representativity of the sample to di-minish over time. Regular reviews are there-fore necessary to ensure that the selection ofreporting agents is always an accurate reflec-
tion of the potential reporting population.The sample is refreshed at least every twoyears whenever its representativity is no long-er sufficiently assured. More reporting agentsmay be added to the population, and report-ing agents may be regrouped to other strata.However, pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 63/2002, no reporting agent is removed fromthe sample. This restriction is intended tominimise the breaks resulting from changes inthe reporting population, thereby ensuringthe stability of the time series derived fromthe MFI interest rate statistics.
Data aggregation procedures
There are three levels of aggregating data to
produce euro-area statistics. Interim resultsare produced at the two lower levels andserve as the basis for aggregation at the nexthigher level. The first level of aggregation ismade up of data on the lending and depositbusiness of all branches as submitted by allreporting agents to the Bundesbank. At thenext higher level of aggregation, the Bundes-bank calculates aggregates for Germany andforwards them to the European Central Bank.At this level of aggregation, the reportedinterest rates are weighted with the corres-ponding volumes of new business or out-standing amounts from balance sheet statis-tics reports submitted by the reporting institu-tions and then merged to form average val-ues. Volumes of new business are grossed upto form total results for Germany. At the thirdlevel, the European Central Bank mergeseach country’s interim results to form euro-

55area aggregates, using national volumes of
new business or outstanding amounts asweighting factors. To guarantee the quality ofthe aggregates, the individual componentsare subjected to a comprehensive range ofplausibility checks by both the Bundesbankand the European Central Bank for each indi-vidual category of instrument.
The Bundesbank’s former survey of lending
and deposit rates used a relatively simple ag-gregation method, calculating average inter-est rates as unweighted arithmetic averagesof the reported interest rates within thespread. The spread was calculated by elimin-ating the highest 5% and the lowest 5% ofthe reported interest rates. The rates reportedby the individual reporting agents were nei-ther simple average rates nor rates weightedfor volumes of contracts; instead, the mostfrequently agreed interest rate for each cat-egory of deposits and loans was to be report-ed.
For the volume-weighted average interest
rates and the corresponding volumes of newbusiness collected for the new MFI interestrate statistics, specific aggregation methodsare used to calculate the statistical resultswhich form the German contribution. In thecase of interest rates, the reported volume-weighted average interest rates are used tocalculate an overall average per categoryas an estimation for Germany. A weight isformed here using the volume of loans or de-posits which is reported by each institution orwhich can be calculated from the outstand-ing amounts. For volumes of new business, itis necessary to use the information providedby sample members to gross up the figures
to form the (unknown) total business forGermany. The Horvitz-Thompson estimator isused for grossing-up.
In this approach, the expansion factor to be
applied to a reporting agent depends on itsrelative weight in its stratum and in the po-tential reporting population. To calculate this,indicators for the entire potential reportingpopulation are needed. The outstandingamounts from the balance sheet statistics as-sociated with the relevant new businessproved to be the best indicators for Germany.On this basis, specific expansion factors arecalculated each month for every category ofnew business and every reporting agent. Thestratification of the reporting population istaken into account. In calculating the expan-

Comparison of the Bundesbank’s
previous survey of lendingand deposit rates with the German MFIinterest rate statistics
The information contained in the new MFI
interest rate statistics is very difficult to com-pare with the data from the Bundesbank’sprevious survey of lending and deposit ratesbecause of the vast differences in the collec-tion methodology. Between January and June2003 data were collected for both the Bun-desbank’s interest rate statistics as well as forthe new MFI interest rate statistics. The differ-ences in interest rates on comparable lendingand deposit instruments during this periodallow certain conclusions to be drawn regard-ing the impact of the methodological differ-ences in the collection and compilation. Thereis an important caveat to observe when in-terpreting the results: the observations arebased on a fairly short parallel collectionperiod lasting only six months. This articlenow goes on to compare the interest rate re-sults calculated using the two sets of statisticsfor new business in some important prod-ucts.

57Variable interest rates on mortgage loans se-
cured by residential real estate, which used tobe collected separately, are now included inthe category of housing loans to householdswith an initial rate fixation of up to one year.During the overlapping collection period, theresults in the new interest rate statistics weresomewhat lower than the variable rates. Thisreflects the influence of mortgage banks,building and loan associations, and large-volume loans at favourable conditions. In theharmonised statistics, what were once col-lected as rates on mortgage loans with aninterest rate fixation of two years and fiveyears are now included in the interest rateson housing loans with an initial rate fixationof over one year and up to five years. Whatused to be mortgage loans with an interestrate fixation of ten years are now included inthe category of housing loans with an initialrate fixation of over five years and up to tenyears. In the case of fixed rate mortgageloans, it was impossible to detect a stable cor-relation between the Bundesbank’s statisticsand the reference series from the MFI interestrate statistics, a possible reason being thatthe more broadly defined categories of instru-ments in the new system include loans withdifferent maturities, which are reflected inthe interest rates. Another reason may bethat rates on unsecured housing loans, whichare generally higher, are included in the newstatistics, too.
In the past, users of these statistics were also
interested in the prevailing interest ratecharged on instalment credits. This is the re-muneration of instalment credits having acredit volume of 35,000 and more but not% per annum

58more than 315,000 and a maturity of be-
tween 36 and 60 months as calculated in theBundesbank’s survey of lending and depositrates. In the MFI interest rate statistics, theseloans are recorded as consumer loans tohouseholds with an initial rate fixation of overone year and up to five years. During the firsthalf of 2003, the German MFI interest ratestatistics for these specific consumer loanswere much lower – up to 4 percentage pointslower, in fact – than the prevailing interest
rates from the previous statistics. One reasonis that the reported interest rates on con-sumer loans in the new statistics do not con-tain service charges. Another is that specialfactors, such as the business of automotivebanks, are reflected in the new series. More-over, the category under review now alsoencompasses larger loan volumes, which aregenerally associated with more favourableconditions.
The three categories of current account credit
contained in the Bundesbank’s former inter-est rate statistics – less than 3100,000,
3100,000 and more but less than 3500,000
and 3500,000 and more but less than
32.5 million – are now indivisibly contained
in a single category: bank overdrafts to non-financial corporations. Under the assumptionthat current account loans under 3100,000
are mostly taken up by individuals and self-employed persons, the interest rates on bankoverdrafts to households in the MFI interestrate statistics could potentially be used tomake comparisons with this category of theformer Bundesbank statistics. During the par-allel collection period, however, the correl-ation between these two series was less pro-nounced than that between “small” currentaccount credit and bank overdrafts to non-financial corporations. On the whole, whencomparing the two types of loans, it must benoted that favourable terms for contractswith large customers and special productssuch as merchant settlement accounts andproperty development financing, often atrates well below normal conditions, are nowcontained in the interest rate statistics.

59means that the average interest rates will
tend to be lower than those shown in theprevious set of statistics, in which the mostfrequently agreed interest rate on each typeof standardised business was surveyed.
The rates for the former categories of new
agreements on time deposits with an agreedmaturity of one month and three months arenow recorded in the new statistics as new de-posit business of households or non-financialcorporations with an agreed maturity of upto one year. The new reporting categoriesare defined relatively broadly, encompassingother short-term instruments, some of whichbear higher interest rates. In the first half of2003 the trends of three-month time depositsand deposits with an agreed maturity of upto one year appeared to be relatively parallel;in fact, the level of the data in the new MFIinterest rate statistics was slightly higher thanthat shown by the Bundesbank’s previousstatistical regime.
In the case of savings deposits, too, the inter-
est rate series of the two sets of statisticsdiverge to varying degrees. The rate of sav-ings deposits with an agreed notice of threemonths (called “savings deposits with a statu-tory period of notice” until June 1993) andminimum rates of return as defined in theBundesbank’s previous statistics were in com-mon use in Germany as a reference value. Inthe MFI interest rate statistics, these rates areno longer collected separately but in a “prod-uct basket” containing all deposits of house-holds and non-financial corporations redeem-able at notice of up to three months. The in-clusion of a wider range of different types ofsavings deposits – including instruments bear-
ing higher rates of interest such as growthsavings accounts, index-linked savings orvolume-dependent graduated interest rateagreements – has pushed the average interestrate in the German contribution to the MFIinterest rate statistics 1
1/C252percentage points
higher than that on the standard savings de-posit component in the Bundesbank’s formerstatistics on lending and deposit rates. In add-ition, the category collected as outstandingamounts at the end of the month containsnot only pure new business but also “old con-tracts” from past periods when interest rateswere higher.
Outlook
The new MFI interest rate statistics represent
a continuation of the Bundesbank’s decades-old practice of making statistics on banks’lending and deposit rates in their retail busi-ness available to the public. The methodologyfor collecting statistics has changed funda-mentally, causing unavoidable statistical breaksin the time series. However, the advantage ofthe new statistical collection system is thatthe results are based on a harmonised meth-odology and thus enable national contribu-tions to the statistics to be compared in termsof instrument categories in banks’ lendingand deposit business as well as their import-ance in the national financial markets viatheir respective volume weights. These statis-tics are therefore highly useful for analysingmacroeconomic developments and structuralchanges.Time deposits
