Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The impact of Russia’s attack on Ukraine is 
likely to place a noticeable strain on economic 
activity in Germany from March. Before the in -
vasion, the economic situation in the first quar -
ter of 2022 was better than expected despite 
the Omicron wave. Retail sales and turnover in 
the hotel and restaurant sector recovered 
slightly in January from the steep decline in De -
cember. According to data provided by the 
company health insurance institutions, sickness 
rates were not strikingly high compared with 
December, either. Furthermore, materials short -
ages continued to ease. Given the bulging 
order books, industrial output therefore con -
tinued to grow in January. The same holds true 
for construction, which also benefited from the 
mild weather. Supply bottlenecks may have im -
proved further in February, although survey re -
sults are sending out mixed signals in this re -
spect. In any case, sentiment in the German 
economy brightened on a broad basis in Janu -
ary and February according to the ifo Institute. 
In addition, the pandemic containment meas -
ures are gradually being eased.
However, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means 
that supply chain problems are likely to inten -
sify again as early as March. Moreover, energy 
commodity prices surged in the wake of the 
war and the economic sanctions imposed. This 
will probably put a damper on household con -
sumption and the output of energy- intensive 
industries. Together with the looming disrup -
tions to foreign trade and the heightened un -
certainty, the consequences of the war are 
likely to slow the economic recovery originally 
expected by a significant degree. Only a small 
period of the first quarter is affected by this, 
however. Economic activity could more or less 
stagnate. From today’s perspective, however, 
the strong recovery expected for the second quarter is likely to turn out considerably weaker. 
The magnitude of the repercussions of the con -
flict are very uncertain, however, and depend -
ent on how the situation evolves.
Industry
Industrial output continued to rise in January 
2022. This was partly attributable to a slight 
easing of supply bottlenecks and the still high 
demand for industrial products. According to 
ifo Institute surveys, the percentage of enter -
prises to see output hampered by delivery 
bottlenecks declined significantly. Survey results 
provided by IHS Markit also indicate fewer de -
livery problems in January. In seasonally ad -
justed terms,1 industrial output was up dis -
tinctly (+1¼%) on the previous month and 
there was even a substantial increase in com -
parison with the average of the fourth quarter 
(+3%). Broken down by main groupings, the 
production of capital goods rose strongly in 
most sectors. The output of consumer goods 
was also up steeply. By contrast, the manufac -
ture of intermediate goods showed less dy -
namic growth.
New industrial orders rose markedly in January 
and were up by 1¾% on the previous month in 
seasonally adjusted terms. In quarter- on- 
quarter terms, they were in fact substantially 
higher (+5%). A look at the regional break -
down shows that the rise was attributable to 
the inflow of orders from non- euro area coun -
tries. By contrast, demand from euro area 
countries was down somewhat and domestic 
demand fell distinctly. Broken down by sector, 
the manufacturers of capital goods reported a 
steep increase in orders. In particular, orders 
were up strongly in other transport equipment Economic

and among producers of motor vehicles and 
motor vehicle parts. Producers of intermediate 
goods experienced a stagnation in their inflow 
of orders but considerably more orders were 
received in the manufacture of basic metals 
and production of fabricated metal products. 
Producers of consumer goods saw a slight drop 
in incoming orders although manufacturers of 
pharmaceutical products posted a steep rise in 
orders. Overall, industrial orders in January 
were up considerably on the pre- crisis level of 
the fourth quarter of 2019 (+14¼%). Com -
pared with industrial output, which was still 
1½% below its pre- crisis level, demand for in -
dustrial products remained exceptionally high.
Nominal industrial sales rose steeply in January 
in line with industrial output. They were up by 
3¼% on the month in seasonally adjusted 
terms and by 6% in quarter- on- quarter terms. 
Broken down by regional sales markets, the 
strong rise compared with the previous quarter 
was broadly based. Broken down by sector, 
there was a particularly steep increase in sales 
of capital goods but sales of intermediate and 
consumer goods expanded strongly, too. By 
contrast, nominal exports of goods declined 
substantially in January in spite of higher export 
sales (-3%). Exports of goods were down by 
1½% compared with the previous quarter. In 
price- adjusted terms, goods exports were even 
significantly below the average of the previous 
quarter (-4%). This was largely due to goods 
exports to the euro area. Nominal goods im -
ports were down steeply on the previous 
month (-4%), with just a slight decline on the 
average of the previous quarter (-½%). The 
sharp rise in import prices for energy, in par -
ticular, virtually balanced out the strong con -
traction in price- adjusted goods imports 
(-5¼%).

pared with the fourth quarter of 2021. Output 
in the finishing trades was up particularly sub -
stantially on the quarter, with the figure for the 
previous month additionally having undergone 
a strong upward revision. Output in the main 
construction sector likewise increased steeply, 
with a slightly stronger rise posted in building 
construction than in civil engineering. Con -
struction activity was bolstered in January by 
the comparatively mild weather for this time of 
year. Furthermore, demand for construction 
work remained high. New orders were up sig -
nificantly in the fourth quarter of 2021 – the 
latest period for which figures are available – 
compared with the previous quarter. In add -
ition, the reach of existing orders once again 
climbed to a record high in February according 
to ifo Institute surveys. Equipment utilisation 
also reached a new peak in February. The per -
centage of enterprises in the main construction 
sector reporting a disruption to production due 
to a lack of staff declined for the third consecu -
tive month. The shortage of materials also con -
tinued to dissipate after peaking in June 2021.
Labour market
The positive labour market development was 
not noticeably hampered by the Omicron wave 
at the beginning of the year. After seasonal ad -
justment, employment in fact expanded excep -
tionally substantially in January 2022. With an 
increase of 80,000 persons on the previous 
month, the rise was somewhat stronger than in 
the months of the second half of 2021. The 
comparatively mild winter weather may also 
have contributed to the positive developments 
in employment, however. The increase in jobs 
subject to social security contributions was par -
ticularly robust (according to initial estimates as 
at December 2021). According to the initial 
estimate by the Federal Employment Agency, 
the number of persons in cyclically induced 
short- time work declined again slightly in De -
cember, although the number of registrations 
for short- time work had suggested a different 
development. The loss of working hours per short- time worker rose significantly, however. 
Up until February, the number of registrations 
for cyclically motivated short- time work re -
mained slightly elevated. Other leading indica -
tors for employment developments neverthe -
less showed very optimistic sentiment. How -
ever, the relevant surveys conducted by the ifo 
Institute and the Institute for Employment Re -
search (IAB) could not yet take into account the 
most recent developments since Russia’s inva -
sion of Ukraine.
After seasonal adjustment, registered unemploy -
ment continued its marked decline in February, 
falling by 33,000 persons. The unemployment 
rate dropped by 0.1 percentage point to 5.0% 
and thus returned to its very low pre- crisis level. 
Unemployment fell in both the statutory insur -
ance scheme, which is influenced by cyclical 
factors, and, of late, more sharply among those 
receiving the basic welfare allowance. The 
IAB’s unemployment barometer climbed well 
into positive territory in February. Unemploy -
ment is therefore expected to continue to de -
crease over the next few months, although the 
fallout from the war in Ukraine has not yet 
been factored in here either.
Prices
The rise in international crude oil prices, evi -
dent for some time now, accelerated sharply 
from the end of February, triggered by the Rus -
sian invasion of Ukraine. The price for a barrel 
of Brent crude oil stood at US$134 for a time 
and was thus over 37% higher than before 
24  February 2022. Prices have come down 
slightly since, presumably due to OPEC poten -
tially stepping up production and the resur -
gence in infection rates in China, and stood at 
US$111 as this report went to press. European 
prices for natural gas at the trading hub in the 
Netherlands also fell. They dropped to €105 
from their recent high of more than €240 per 
megawatt hour. However, they were thus still 
roughly 22% higher than before the war. The

has a high share of production also rose sharply 
as a result of the war.
The usual delays in data collection mean that 
the latest figures for prices at the upstream 
stages of the economy are those for January 
2022. However, even at the beginning of the 
year, the already distinct upward pressure on 
prices intensified further. Import prices went up 
very steeply, with the energy component 
account ing for roughly half of this rise. Prices 
also rose markedly at the producer level, with 
the non- energy component making the largest 
contribution. Import prices increased by just 
under 27% in year- on- year terms and by 25% 
at the producer level.
After seasonal adjustment, consumer prices as 
measured by the Harmonised Index of Con -
sumer Prices (HICP) rose again substantially in 
February by 0.6% compared with the previous 
month. The Russian invasion of Ukraine was 
not yet a factor in the marked increase as prices 
are usually collected in the first three weeks of 
the respective month. The inflation rate stood 
at 5.5% on the year and was thus up by 
0.4 percentage point compared with January. 
Higher inflation was evident in all the compon -
ents with the exception of services. Due to the 
war in Ukraine, the inflation rate is likely to 
continue to edge slightly upwards in the next 
few months, probably largely on the back of 
energy prices. It is, however, currently particu -
larly difficult to assess how energy markets will 
develop. Prices for food and industrial goods, 
too, are expected to receive additional impetus 
as a result of the slump in wheat exports from 
Ukraine and Russia and new disruptions to sup -
ply chains.
Public finances2
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
The statutory health insurance (SHI) scheme 
(comprising the health insurance institutions and the health fund) finished 2021 with a sig -
nificant deficit. This deficit came in below both 
last year’s level and the amount forecast. 
Accord ing to preliminary figures, it stood at 
€4½ billion (2020: -€6 billion).3 The health fund 
was the driving force behind this improvement. 
By contrast, the health insurance institutions 
saw a rise in their deficit.4
The health fund posted a surplus of €1½ billion 
in 2021. In autumn 2020, the group of SHI esti -
mators forecast a deficit of €1 billion. The def -
icit had totalled €3½ billion in 2020. This year- 
on- year improvement stems primarily from the 
fact that central government has now almost 
fully refunded the health fund’s pandemic-  
related burdens. In addition to these refunds, 
the health fund received the regular central 
government grant of €14½ billion and a special 
grant of €5 billion. Contribution receipts grew 
steeply, by 5%.5 Almost two percentage points 
of this growth were attributable to a rise in the 
average supplementary contribution rate (+ 0.3 
percentage point to 1.3%). The expenditure 
side recorded pandemic- related expenses of 
€17½ billion.6 Expenditure by the health fund

2 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain an in- depth description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter. 
For detailed data on budgetary developments and public 
debt, see the statistical section of this report.
3 Preliminary accounting figures for 2021 compared with 
the final annual outturn for 2020 (see the table on p. 9). By 
contrast, the chart on p. 10 shows preliminary outturns.
4 In 2021, reserves belonging to the health insurance insti -
tutions totalling €8 billion were redistributed among the in -
stitutions via the health fund. The associated payment 
flows between the health insurance institutions and the 
health fund do not influence the financial situation of the 
SHI scheme and its two constituent parts overall. The rev -
enue and expenditure growth figures in this report are 
therefore adjusted for this.
5 They rose considerably more sharply than the group of 
SHI estimators had assumed when projecting expenditure 
in autumn 2020. This enabled the health fund to close the 
year in surplus rather than with the expected deficit.
6 These include funds for tests (almost €6½ billion), vaccin -
ations (cost share accruing to the vaccination centres and 
remuneration for doctors and pharmacists, €3½ billion) 
and protective face masks for risk groups (€1½ billion). 
They also encompass financial assistance for hospitals to 
compensate them for empty beds resulting from the pan -
demic (€5 billion).Deutsche Bundesbank

by 4½%. At the end of the year, the fund’s re -
serves amounted to €7½ billion and were thus 
€3 billion above their statutory lower limit.7
The health insurance institutions posted a def -
icit of almost €6 billion in 2021. This constitutes 
a rise of just over €3 billion on the previous 
year. In autumn 2020, the group of SHI estima -
tors had forecast a deficit of €8 billion. Expend -
iture did rise steeply, by just over 5%; however, 
growth lagged 1½ percentage points behind 
what the group of SHI estimators had ex -
pected. Of the spending on benefits, expend -
iture on remedies and therapeutic appliances 
(+ 11%) and pharmaceuticals (+ 8%), in particu -
lar, was up substantially. This was partly due to 
the fact that VAT was temporarily lower in the 
second half of 2020. Spending on hospital 
treatment, a major expenditure item, rose by 
4½%. Yet, together with the compensation for 
empty beds that was granted for some time, 
the SHI scheme paid 1% less to hospitals than 
a year earlier. Following strong growth in 2020, spending on medical treatments expanded at a 
below- average rate of 1½%. Administrative ex -
penditure even fell by just under ½%, eased by 
slightly lower pension provisions. Health insur -
ance institutions’ revenue (for the most part, 
transfers from the health fund) grew by 4%. 
The health insurance institutions’ financial re -
serves sank considerably as a result of the def -
icit. Overall, however, they still had reserves of 
€11 billion at year-  end. For the health insur -
ance institutions as a whole, the financial re -
serves were thus €6½ billion above the statu -
tory lower limit.

estimators and the resultant €7 billion in add -
itional central government funds, the SHI Health insurance

7 The newly introduced Hospital Future Fund also has ex -
tensive reserves. According to provisional figures, outflows 
from this fund amounted to €250 million in 2021. This 
leaves just under €3 billion in central government funds 
and a little over €1 billion from state government for add -
itional investment in technical equipment for hospitals.Deutsche Bundesbank

scheme as a whole would close 2022 with a 
deficit of around €2 billion. The health fund 
alone would bear the strain of this deficit, as 
parts of its liquidity reserves are used to provide 
the health insurance institutions with additional 
funds. The health insurance institutions receive 
€½ billion to compensate for part of the losses 
caused by the reduction of SHI scheme contri -
butions on occupational pensions since 2020, 
and an additional €1½ billion from the liquidity 
reserves because of a special rule.8 On top of 
this, further liquidity reserve funds are trans -
ferred to the innovation and structural funds.According to the results of the group of SHI 
estimators, if the average supplementary con -
tribution rate does not change, the higher funds 
from central government should put the health 
insurance institutions on course to a balanced 
budget. The group of SHI estimators forecast a 
slight slowing in expenditure growth next year 
(4½%). As far as revenue is concerned, the 
health insurance institutions will receive exten -
sive special transfers in order to stabilise the 
average supplementary contribution rate. Over 
and above the €2 billion from the health fund’s 
liquidity reserves, central government will pro -
vide a special grant of €14 billion. All in all, spe -
cial transfers will be €10 billion up on 2021.
As things currently stand, there is good reason 
to believe that the outturn for the scheme as 
a  whole could be better than expected in 
autumn . For one thing, the 2021 expenditure 
base for the projected expenditure growth is 
around ½ percentage point lower than ex -
pected. Furthermore, the actual average sup -
plementary contribution rate is somewhat 
higher than anticipated. However, risk is height -
ened due to the war in Ukraine.
The SHI scheme will continue to face consider -
able challenges in the years to come. As in pre -
vious years, the structural expenditure trend is 
expected to rise significantly more steeply than 
the revenue base. This has nothing to do with 
the pandemic. Without fundamentally curbing 
expenditure dynamics, ever larger supplemen -
tary contribution rates and/ or ever higher tax 
grants will remain necessary in the future. As 
things currently stand, there will be no repeti -
tion of central government’s €14 billion in spe -
cial grants in 2023. This means that the supple -
mentary contribution rates would need to rise 
by around one percentage point.Group of SHI

Public long- term care 
insurance  scheme
The core budget of the public long- term care 
insurance scheme was €1½ billion in deficit in 
2021.9 This represents a deterioration of €2½ 
billion compared with the previous year.10 
Without the pandemic- related special pay -
ments on both the revenue and expenditure 
side, there would have been a surplus of al -
most €1½ billion and the result would have 
been roughly the same as in 2020. The reserves 
shrank to €7 billion at the end of 2021. How -
ever, they still exceeded the statutory lower 
limit of half of one month’s expenditure by just 
over €4½ billion. Nevertheless, there were re -
ports of liquidity shortfalls in autumn. In the 
end, central government provided a non-  
repayable special grant of €1 billion.
Contribution receipts increased by 3½%. 
Higher employee contributions (+  4%) were 
partly offset by slightly lower contributions pay -
able on unemployment benefits. Contributions 
payable on pensions increased by 2½%. Cen -
tral government funds were down by just 
under €1 billion. However, there was an ex -
tremely sharp rise in other revenue. This was 
due to the statutory and private health insur -
ance schemes contributing just over €1 billion 
to the pandemic- related special payments 
made to the long- term care insurance scheme. 
Total revenue increased by a little over 3½%.
Expenditure (+ 9½%) was up by much more 
than revenue. Of this, 3½ percentage points 
(€2 billion) were attributable to the rise in 
pandemic- related special payments to long-  
term care facilities and for coronavirus tests.11 
With benefit rates unchanged, the long- term 
care insurance scheme’s expenditure on bene -
fits continued to rise steeply, by 6%, with cash 
benefits even going up by 8½%. Spending on 
non- cash benefits, an even larger expenditure 
item, rose by 4½%. Expenditure on residential 
nursing care remained unchanged at last year’s 
level, which had gone down slightly.Deficit due to

9 The developments outlined here and in the remainder of 
the text exclude the provident fund. Since 2015, this fund 
has received transfers from the core area corresponding to 
the receipts of 0.1 percentage point of the contribution 
rate. Assets accumulated in this way are to be depleted 
again in the 2030s to dampen the expected contribution 
rate rise. At the end of 2021, these accumulated reserves 
amounted to just under €10 billion.
10 Preliminary accounting figures for 2021 compared with 
the final annual outturn for 2020.
11 Special payments amounted to €5 billion in total. The 
long-  term care insurance scheme reimbursed non-  
residential and (partially) residential long- term care facilities 
for coronavirus testing costs (just over €1½ billion). Fur -
thermore, these facilities received financial compensation 
for additional expenditure relating to the pandemic. They 
were also compensated for revenue shortfalls caused by 
the non- utilisation of long- term care services on account of 
the pandemic, for instance because no new long- term care 
patients could be accepted. Had there been no pandemic, 
however, spending on benefits for residential long- term 
care patients, above all, would have been higher.Deutsche Bundesbank

The long- term care insurance scheme’s finan -
cial situation is not likely to change much this 
year. The revenue base is expected to grow sig -
nificantly, although the war in Ukraine is a 
source of uncertainty. On the expenditure side, 
pandemic- related special payments have been 
extended until mid- 2022. They are expected to 
be less than half as high as last year. By con -
trast, the new regular central government 
grants of €1 billion and a higher contribution 
rate for childless persons (+ 0.1 percentage 
point) will only compensate for some of the 
additional burdens stemming from the latest 
long- term care reform.12 The financial situation 
is set to deteriorate in the coming years. Demo -
graphic developments and the expanded bene -
fits will push expenditure up markedly. Without 
a change to the contribution rate, the freely 
available reserves would be more or less ex -
hausted after 2023. Successive significant rises 
in the contribution rate are therefore on the 
cards.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €143.3 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in January 2022 was significantly 
up on the previous month’s figure of €84.1 bil -
lion. After taking account of increased redemp -
tions and changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, the outstanding volume of 
domestic bonds rose by €39.1 billion, following 
a drop of €27.6 billion in December 2021. The 
outstanding volume of foreign debt securities 
in the German market grew by €22.0 billion, 
which meant that the outstanding volume of 
domestic and foreign debt securities in Ger -
many increased by €61.1 billion on balance in 
January.
Domestic enterprises expanded their capital 
market debt by €16.6 billion in January, follow -
ing net redemptions of €9.0 billion in Decem -
ber. The bulk of this net issuance was attribut -
able to other financial intermediaries.Domestic credit institutions issued bonds total -
ling €13.3 billion net in January, following net 
redemptions of €16.6 billion in the previous 
month. This net issuance was mainly attributable 
to mortgage Pfandbriefe (€5.9 billion) and debt 
securities (€5.5 billion) issued by specialised 
credit institutions. Public Pfandbriefe and other 
bank debt securities that can be structured flex -
ibly were also issued, albeit to a lesser extent, 
in the amount of €1.0 billion each in net terms.
The public sector issued bonds worth €9.1 bil -
lion net in the reporting month. Central gov -
ernment increased its capital market debt by 
€7.3 billion on balance. It mainly issued two-  
year Federal Treasury notes (Schätze) (€7.1 bil -
lion) and five- year Federal notes (Bobls) (€6.5 
billion), but also 30- year Federal bonds (Bunds) 
on a smaller scale (€4.5 billion). This contrasted 
with net redemptions of ten- year Federal bonds 
(Bunds) totalling €6.6 billion. State and local 
governments issued bonds in the amount of 
€1.8 billion on balance.
Domestic non- banks were the strongest group 
of buyers in January. They added bonds worth 
€39.9 billion net to their portfolios, focusing 
their interest on foreign securities. The Bundes -
bank acquired debt securities worth €15.0 bil -
lion net, largely under the Eurosystem’s asset 
purchase programmes, which consisted almost 
exclusively of domestic securities issued by the 
public sector. Foreign investors purchased do -
mestic debt securities for a net of €9.1 billion. 
By contrast, domestic credit institutions sold 
bonds worth €2.9 billion on balance.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
raised fresh capital resources of €0.4 billion on 
balance by placing new shares in the German 
equity market. Net issuance of foreign equities 
in Germany totalled €5.3 billion in the same 
period. Domestic non- banks dominated on the Virtually no

buyers’ side, acquiring assets in the amount of 
€7.2 billion net. Domestic credit institutions ex -
panded their equity portfolios by €2.1 billion 
net, while non- resident investors sold domestic 
equities for €3.6 billion on balance.
Mutual funds
Domestic mutual funds recorded an inflow of 
€17.0 billion in January. The main beneficiaries 
were specialised funds reserved for institutional 
investors (€11.8 billion). Among the various 
asset classes, the bulk of investment flowed 
into mixed securities funds (€5.1 billion), equity 
funds (€4.2 billion), bond funds (€3.2 billion) 
and open- end real estate funds (€2.8 billion). 
Foreign mutual funds placed shares worth €6.5 
billion in the German market in January. On 
balance, domestic non- banks were virtually the 
only purchasers of mutual fund shares in the 
reporting month (€21.7 billion). Domestic credit 
institutions and foreign investors purchased 
mutual fund shares worth €1.2 billion and €0.6 
billion net, respectively.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €11.0 billion in January 2022, down €13.6 
billion on the previous month’s level. The sur -
plus in the goods account declined consider -
ably, with the surplus in invisible current trans -
actions, which comprise services as well as pri -
mary and secondary income, contracting even 
more strongly.
In January, the surplus in the goods account fell 
by €4.3 billion on the month to €4.5 billion be -
cause receipts recorded a sharper decrease 
than expenditure.
The surplus in invisible current transactions de -
clined by €9.3 billion to €6.5 billion in January 
2022, owing to lower results in all three sub-  
accounts. The surplus of €1.5 billion in the ser -
vices account in December 2021 turned into a deficit of €0.3 billion in the reporting month. 
Receipts recorded a stronger decline than ex -
penditure, especially in the context of charges 
for the use of intellectual property, other busi -
ness services and computer services. Net re -
ceipts in primary income fell by €5.3 billion to 
€12.8 billion, with the revenue side showing a 
particular decline following the payment of the 
EU’s agricultural subsidies to Germany in De -
cember 2021. In addition, the secondary in -
come deficit rose by €2.2 billion to €6.1 billion, 
notably on account of lower general govern -
ment revenue from current taxes on income 
and wealth of non- residents.
In January 2022, events in the international 
financial markets were shaped by rising yields 
linked to persistently high inflation rates and 
expectations that the major central banks 
would take further steps towards normalising 
monetary policy. Germany’s cross- border port -
folio investment generated net capital exports 
of €27.2 billion (December 2021: €34.0 billion). Inflows to

enterprises injected their affiliated enterprises 
in Germany with direct investment funds worth 
€30.7 billion net. They increased their equity 
capital in German enterprises by €2.4 billion 
and granted intra- group loans in the amount of 
€28.4 billion. Conversely, domestic enterprises 
stepped up their foreign direct investment by 
€27.0 billion. They supplied foreign branches 
with additional equity capital of €10.5 billion, 
just over half of which took the form of re -
invested earnings. Furthermore, they issued 
intra- group loans in the amount of €16.5 bil -
lion.
Other statistically recorded investment – which

Monetary policy in a prolonged period 
of low interest rates – a discussion of the 
concept of the reversal rate
Since the financial and sovereign debt crisis, interest rates in the euro area have been at a low, 
sometimes even negative, level. This prolonged phase of low interest rates raises a question for 
monetary policymakers: could the effect of expansionary monetary policy measures on banks’ 
lending reverse itself? The interest rate level at which such a reversal occurs is referred to in the 
literature on the subject as the “reversal rate”. To hit a reversal rate, two conditions have to be 
met. First, the expansionary monetary policy measures must constrain the profitability and thus 
also the capital ratios of banks. Second, squeezed capital ratios must manifest themselves in 
reduced lending. If both conditions are satisfied, banks could respond to expansionary monetary 
policy measures by curtailing their lending.
During the period of low interest rates, expansionary monetary policy measures contributed to 
reducing the interest rate level in the euro area still further. Empirical studies show that a falling 
interest rate level depresses the net interest margin and thereby the profitability of banks above 
all when interest rates are already low. This kind of negative effect exerted on net interest mar -
gins by expansionary monetary policy measures can be offset by opposing effects, however. Fall -
ing interest rates tend to bolster macroeconomic developments, bringing down credit default 
risks and stimulating credit demand. While the negative effect on the net interest margin increases 
over time, this is unlikely to be the case for the positive effects. This is why the longer interest rates 
stay low, the greater the probability that expansionary monetary policy measures will exert a 
negative overall effect on the profitability and thus the capital ratios of banks. The first condition 
for the existence of a reversal rate is therefore more likely to be met the longer the period of low 
interest rates lasts.
The key factors for the second reversal rate condition are the banks’ capital ratios and the regu -
latory capital requirements that they have to fulfil: if banks have capital ratios well in excess of 
the regulatory requirements, it is unlikely that a fall in those capital ratios will lead to a contrac -
tion in lending. This is because banks are most likely to respond to reduced capital ratios by cut -
ting back on lending when they are operating with ratios only just over the requirements. In a 
banking system where the capital ratios of many banks lie barely above what is required by regu -
lators, hitting the reversal rate is thus a possibility.
The reversal rate is unobservable and time- varying. It is therefore not possible to precisely quan -
tify the reversal rate for the present situation. Nevertheless there exist indicators which allow us 
to assess whether the reversal rate has been encountered in the past. In particular, the evolution 
in the headroom between banks’ capital ratios and regulatory requirements is of pivotal import -
ance in this regard. Developments in this gap and additional indicators show no signs so far that 
the reversal rate has been reached before, in Germany or the euro area.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
In view of the financial and sovereign debt cri -
sis and the very low rates of inflation in the 
euro area, the Governing Council of the Euro -
pean Central Bank (ECB) made multiple cuts to 
its policy rates in the years from 2009 to 2019. 
In June 2014, the deposit facility rate in the Euro-
system entered negative territory for the first 
time. Alongside this, the ECB Governing Coun -
cil implemented additional monetary policy 
measures which contributed to a low general 
level of interest rates in the euro area. These in -
clude the various asset purchase programmes, 
such as the expanded asset purchase pro -
gramme (APP) and the pandemic emergency 
purchase programme (PEPP) as well as the 
three series of targeted longer- term refinancing 
operations (TLTROs). The excess liquidity gener -
ated by these measures was a key driver behind 
money market rates following the interest rate 
on the deposit facility deep into negative terri -
tory. The APP also contributed to the lowering of long- term capital market yields and thus had 
a flattening effect on the yield curve.1
With interest rates sinking further and further 
and the period of low interest rates persisting 
for longer and longer, the question arose as to 
whether such a setting could, in fact, see the 
effect of monetary policy on banks’ lending 
abating or even reversing. Based on the idea 
that the effect could end up working in the op -
posite direction, the term reversal rate was 
coined in the literature. It describes the interest 
rate level below which further monetary policy 
easing ceases to stimulate bank lending and in -
stead constrains it. This article centres around 
explaining the concept of the reversal rate.
Monetary policy’s influence on the general 
level of interest rates tends to depend on the

enced by the conventional interest rate policy, 
medium- term maturities by forward guidance 
and long- term maturities by the asset purchase 
programmes.2 But a host of other factors 
alongside monetary policy also have an impact 
on the long- term interest rate of an economy. 
Examples of other determinants include house -
holds’ propensity to consume or save, enter -
prises’ propensity to invest and the propensity 
of economic agents to assume risks or to con -
vert assets into liquidity without complica -
tions.3
The fear that monetary policy could hit the re -
versal rate was kindled by findings in the empir -
ical literature suggesting that a very low, pos -
sibly negative, interest rate level tends to have 
a detrimental impact on banks’ profitability:4 
taken by itself, a period of low interest rates de -
presses banks’ net interest margin5 and thereby 
their net interest income (the difference be -
tween interest income and interest expend -
iture) as bank interest rates decline more 
sharply on the income side than on the ex -
penditure side. This is because banks tend to 
be reluctant to apply negative interest rates to 
customers’ deposits. Where the interest rate 
level is very low and the period of low interest 
rates persists for longer and longer, there 
comes a point as of which deposit rates all but 
cease to be adjusted while lending rates con -
tinue to fall. The theoretical literature, too, 
shows that a key element increasing the prob -
ability of a reversal rate scenario is the fact that 
banks’ funding costs decrease less than the in -
come side.6
If banks are unable to compensate for the de -
cline in their net interest margin through other 
revenue or cost components and/  or higher 
lending, their profits decrease, ceteris paribus. 
This, in turn, makes it harder for banks to build 
up capital through retained earnings.7 The em -
pirical literature shows that the longer the 
period of low interest rates lasts, the more net 
interest margins are squeezed.8 If the period of 
low interest rates persists over a long time, banks thus need to make greater and greater 
adjustments to their business strategy if they 
wish to offset the influence of the decreasing 
net interest margin on their profitability.
A bank’s capital ratio – its capital9 as a percent -
age of (risk- weighted) assets – is one of the 
factors determining its lending behaviour. One 
reason is because a change in the capital ratio 
will have an impact on the bank’s funding 
costs. Empirical studies suggest that a lower 
capital ratio is associated with lower funding 
costs.10 Funding costs, for their part, are a cen -
tral component of the lending rate.11 Another 
reason is that banks have to comply with regu -
latory minimum capital requirements. Falling 
short of these requirements triggers supervisory 
intervention. If a bank is operating with a cap -
ital ratio in close proximity to the regulatory 
minimum, then it may curtail its lending to pre -
vent an undershooting of the requirement. 
There are studies based on bank-  level data 
which show that it is primarily banks with low 
excess capital buffers – i.e. the difference be -
tween the actual capital ratio and the capital 
ratio required for regulatory purposes – that 
scale back lending.12
Banks reducing their lending in a period of low 
interest rates because they are capital-  
constrained does not necessarily mean that the 
reversal rate has been reached, however. The Upshot of

literature : net 
interest margin 
declines when 
the interest rate 
level is very low

academic literature only refers to this if the cur -
tailment of lending can be attributed to the ex -
pansionary monetary policy stance. This means 
two conditions must be satisfied before we can 
say that a reversal rate scenario has occurred 
(see the chart above):
– the expansionary monetary policy stance 
weighs on profitability and thus banks’ cap -
ital endowment and …
– …  the erosion of the capital endowment 
causes banks to reduce their lending.
Looking at the two necessary conditions, this 
article discusses the concept of a reversal rate 
in the light of the existing theoretical and em -
pirical literature and explores the monetary pol -
icy implications.Discussion of the conditions 
required for the existence of 
a reversal rate
Monetary policy and banks’ 
capital endowment
The economic literature shows that monetary 
policy measures influence banks’ capital en -
dowment and thus potentially their lending 
choices by acting on the institutions’ profitabil -
ity.13 This monetary policy transmission channel 
has grown in significance during the prolonged 
period of low interest rates in the large cur -
rency areas. According to results found in the 
empirical literature, the relationship between 
the interest rate level and banks’ net interest 
margin depends on how high the interest level 
is. Especially when the interest rate level is low, 
the empirical literature finds that a further re -
duction in that level leads to a decreasing net 
interest margin.14 This positive relationship be -
tween the interest rate level and the net inter -
est margin also becomes stronger if the interest 
rate level falls still further,15 for it is particularly 
when interest rates are low that income on the 
assets side of the bank’s balance sheet will re -
spond more sharply to the change in the inter -
est rate level than the costs on the liabilities 
side.16 This response of varying intensity is also

oretical model of Brunnermeier and Koby 
(2019) (see the box on pp. 22 ff.).17
Furthermore, the negative impact exerted by a 
low interest rate level on the net interest mar -
gin increases the longer the level stays low.18 
One reason is that, over time, older, higher-  
interest loans gradually mature and are re -
placed by new loans at lower rates of interest. 
The other reason is that interest rates on cus -
tomer deposits do not fall to the same extent 
as lending rates. Experience during the period 
of low interest rates in the euro area shows 
that, in the aggregate, banks hardly ever apply 
negative interest rates to customer deposits: 
the volume- weighted interest rate aggregated 
across all customer deposits has settled at just 
over the zero mark in most euro area countries. 
This also reduces the income that banks gener -
ate on the funding side (liabilities- side margin 
contribution19). When interest rates are at a 
“normal” level, the interest on customer de -
posits averages out at lower than the interest 
rate on the interbank market, meaning that 
banks generate a profit through the liabilities-  
side margin contribution. However, this changes 
in a period of low interest rates: because the 
interest rate on customer deposits falls less 
sharply than interest rates in the interbank mar -
ket, the liabilities- side margin contribution 
shrinks or even turns negative.20 The longer the 
period of low interest rates lasts, the greater 
the contraction in both sources of revenue usu -
ally tapped in classical loan/ deposit business – 
the net interest margin and the liabilities- side 
margin contribution.
A negative effect of a low interest level on the 
net interest margin is a necessary, but not suffi -
cient, condition for monetary policy to have a 
negative impact on banks’ profitability and thus 
on their capital. This is because monetary pol -
icy has a positive impact on banks’ profitability 
through various channels, for example via 
macroeconomic developments. The more fa -
vourable these developments are, the lower 
the average default risk. Lower credit risk, in 
turn, drives down banks’ loan loss provision -ing.21 Lower levels of loan loss provisioning re -
duce banks’ expenditure and therefore have a 
positive effect on their profitability.22 In add -
ition, favourable macroeconomic develop -
ments stimulate loan demand. This can enable 
banks to compensate for the decreasing net 
interest margin – at least in part – through a 
greater lending volume.
The low interest rate period seen in the euro 
area over the past decade tended to be charac -
terised by favourable economic developments. 
Monetary policy accommodation is likely to 
have played a part in this development. In add -
ition, one- off valuation gains on account of 
monetary policy easing improved banks’ profit -
ability. These positive effects of low interest 
rate policy on banks’ profitability must be 
weighed up against the negative effect on the 
net interest margin, as a reversal rate can only 
be achieved if the overall effect of monetary 
policy measures on banks’ profitability, and 
thus their capital, is negative.23
While the pressure on the net interest margin 
increases with the duration of the low interest 
rate phase, this is unlikely to apply to the posi -
tive effect on loan loss provisioning via eco -Net interest

17 Similarly to Brunnermeier und Koby (2019), in the model 
of König und Schliephake (2021) a reduction in the interest 
margin as a result of monetary policy easing causes a rever -
sal rate to arise, too. In contrast to the model of Brunner -
meier and Koby (2019), however, it is not the binding ef -
fect of a regulatory capital requirement which provokes 
such a scenario; rather, in the model of König und 
Schliephake (2021), the pressure on profitability leads 
banks to increase risk- taking and this, taken by itself, leads 
to higher lending rates and a reduction in lending. If risk 
appetite increases to a sufficient degree, a reversal rate can 
be reached in this model context as well.
18 See Altavilla et al. (2018) and Claessens et al. (2018).
19 The liabilities- side margin contribution is the spread be -
tween a customer deposit and wholesale funding with the 
same maturity.
20 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2018).
21 Lower credit risk also reduces banks’ stock of risk-  
weighted assets. If the stock of risk- weighted assets de -
clines, the denominator of the risk- weighted capital ratio 
falls and thus, taken in isolation, drives up the ratio.
22 At the same time, however, the relationship postulated 
in the risk- taking channel could also occur, according to 
which low interest rates raise banks’ risk appetite, which is 
likely to push up their loan loss provisioning (see, inter alia, 
Borio and Zhu (2012)).

Theoretical concept of the reversal rate
The concept of the reversal rate was de-
veloped in a model- theoretical paper by 
Brunnermeier and Koby (2019). In this 
model, the stylised bank holds loans and 
debt securities on the assets side of its bal-
ance sheet. On the liabilities side are cus-
tomer deposits and equity capital. In the 
model, monetary policy is implemented by 
means of a single interest rate. The interest 
rate applied to debt securities always cor-
responds to this monetary policy rate, and 
is therefore a given from the bank’s per-
spective. The bank sets both its lending and 
deposit rates with a view to maximising its 
profi  t. The volume of the bank’s lending de-
creases given a rising lending rate, while de-
posits increase when the deposit rate 
climbs.
The bank’s balance sheet structure must 
satisfy two conditions.
– First, the bank must hold debt securities 
in at least the amount of a predeter-
mined share of its customer deposits. 
This can be interpreted as a provision put 
in place to guarantee liquidity.1
– Second, the bank must hold equity cap-
ital in at least the amount of a predeter-
mined share of the loans that it grants. 
This condition refl  ects a regulatory cap-
ital requirement.
If one of these conditions restricts the 
bank’s business policy, this condition be-
comes binding. This means that, in such an 
event, the bank must pursue a different 
business policy than it would in the absence 
of this binding condition. The amount of 
capital necessary to fulfi  l the second condi-
tion comprises two components: exogen-
ous capital at the start of the period under review and the bank’s net interest income 
at the end of this period. The latter is 
equivalent to the difference between inter-
est income from lending and debt securities 
and interest expenditure on customer de-
posits. Net interest income thus results from 
investment activities decided upon by the 
bank during the period under review. This 
means that the bank’s relevant capital 
endow ment in this period is forward- 
looking, as it already includes income and 
expenditure stemming from investment ac-
tivities in this period.2
If the monetary policy rate declines, so too 
does the interest income the bank receives 
via debt securities. This reduces net interest 
income and therefore the bank’s capital 
endow ment.3 Provided that no binding ef-
fect results from the two aforementioned 
conditions, the bank reacts to a monetary 
policy rate cut by expanding its lending. 
This is because from the bank’s perspective, 
granting loans becomes more attractive 
relative to holding debt securities when the 
monetary policy rate –  and therefore the 
rate of interest on debt securities  – de-
creases. The monetary policy rate ultimately 
represents the interest rate of the bank’s 
only alternative investment instrument and 
thus depicts the opportunity costs of lend-
1 In reality, such provisions are more complex. In the 
European Union, for instance, the liquidity coverage 
requirement (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio 
(NSFR) are in force.
2 See also Repullo (2020).
3 In the model of Brunnermeier and Koby (2019), a 
monetary policy rate cut additionally results in valu-
ation gains, which in turn increase the bank’s capital 
endowment when taken in isolation. Theoretically, 
however, the volume of such gains could be assumed 
to be equal to zero without changing the underlying 
mechanism of the model. For more on this, see Re-
pullo (2020). This channel is therefore excluded from 
the presentation of the model in the remainder of this 
box.Deutsche Bundesbank

ing. The bank can expand its lending by 
lowering the lending rate. The interest rate 
on deposits is also lowered following a de-
cline in the monetary policy rate as a re-
sponse to decreased opportunities to gen-
erate interest income. Despite these adjust-
ment reactions, the bank in the model can-
not prevent its net interest income from 
contracting due to falling interest rates on 
debt securities and lending.
The sharper the decline in the monetary 
policy rate, the lower the bank’s net interest 
income and thus its equity capital, too. At 
the same time, the bank will want to lend 
at higher volumes the sharper the decline in 
the monetary policy rate turns out to be. 
However, this requires the bank to have the 
necessary capital at hand. If the monetary 
policy rate falls below a certain level, the 
bank is no longer able to expand its loan 
volume to the desired extent, as it is con-
strained by its capital endowment. From 
this point onwards, capital requirements 
become binding, and the volume of loans 
that the bank is able to grant is determined 
solely by its capital endowment. The mon-
etary policy rate at which this binding effect 
of capital requirements comes into play is 
the reversal rate. Below this interest rate, a 
further decline in the monetary policy rate 
results in a decreasing loan volume.
In Brunnermeier and Koby’s model, the ex-
istence of a reversal rate is ultimately due to 
the fact that a declining interest rate level 
results in banks’ income sinking faster than 
their expenditure. This asymmetry in the re-
actions of income and expenditure can also 
be seen in the empirical literature on the 
impact of the low interest rate environ-
ment,4 which often justifi  es this observation 
by the fact that banks are hesitant to apply 
negative interest rates to customer de-
posits.5In the model, however, the existence of this 
asymmetry is based on another assumption: 
namely that banks are required to invest in 
debt securities (assets side) but may not use 
them to fi  nance themselves (liabilities side).6 
Debt securities are, in the model, the only 
bank asset for which the interest rate ap-
plied is directly determined from the mon-
etary policy rate. A monetary policy rate cut 
thus implies that interest income generated 
by a bank’s assets will decline. That being 
said, no corresponding decline in funding 
costs will occur, as these are directly deter-
mined only by the interest rate on customer 
deposits.
Repullo (2020) abandons this restrictive as-
sumption with regard to the bank’s funding 
structure. He analyses the consequences of 
the bank being granted the additional op-
tion of also fi  nancing itself via debt secur-
ities within the context of Brunnermeier 
and Koby’s model. Overall, the existence of 
the reversal rate in the model is dependent 
on the bank’s net position in debt secur-
ities,7 as this net position dictates how a de-
cline in the monetary policy rate will affect 
the bank’s profi  ts. If the bank fi  nances itself 
via debt securities to a greater extent than it 
invests in them (net borrower in debt secur-
ities), a monetary policy rate cut in the 
model will decrease the bank’s interest ex-
penditure more signifi  cantly than its interest 
income. Consequently, the monetary policy

sens et al. (2018) and Klein (2020).

Heider et al. (2019).
6 In their paper, Brunnermeier and Koby indicate that 
a lower bound on the deposit rate is not essential for 
the existence of a reversal rate in the context of their 
model. If there is such a bound, however, the reversal 
rate is higher the higher the bound is set.
7 Other investment and funding options such as the 
interbank market can be substituted for debt securities 
here. The deciding factor is that the rate of interest ap-
plied to the investment and funding options examined 
is directly determined by the monetary policy rate and 
is a given from the bank’s perspective.Deutsche Bundesbank

rate cut boosts the profi  tability and there-
fore the capital endowment of a bank such 
as this. This is why there is no reversal rate 
for such a bank in the model. In this con-
nection, then, the key role of the net pos-
ition in debt securities is conditional on a 
number of assumptions in the model.8 In 
reality, these are unlikely to be fully met. 
Generally, it can therefore be assumed that 
alongside the net position in debt securities, 
other factors are key when it comes to de-
termining how a monetary policy rate cut 
will affect a bank’s profi  ts and whether or 
not a reversal rate exists.
Another core assumption made in Brunner-
meier and Koby’s model is that the bank 
cannot increase its capital through the issu-
ance of equity instruments. In the model, 
the bank’s capital endowment, which is key 
to the fulfi  lment of its capital requirements, 
is determined solely on the basis of an ex-
ogenously given initial capital endowment 
and the bank’s net interest income. Repullo 
demonstrates that a lack of opportunities to 
issue equity instruments is decisive for the 
existence of a reversal rate. He considers a 
model in which the bank not only issues 
debt securities but is also able to raise cap-
ital via the market. It may do the latter to 
any extent it desires, as long as it generates 
the return required by the equity investors 
(shareholders). This is assumed to corres-
pond to the monetary policy rate plus a 
constant mark- up.
In Repullo’s model, two variables determine 
the bank funding costs that are instrumen-
tal to lending: namely the return required 
by shareholders and the interest rate on the 
debt securities issued by the bank. If the 
monetary policy rate declines, both the 
interest rate on debt securities and the re-
turn required by shareholders fall, too. In 
response to declining funding costs, the 
bank lowers its lending rates and expands its lending. In Repullo’s model, then, as 
long as the bank generates the return re-
quired by shareholders, a decrease in the 
monetary policy rate always results in an ex-
pansion of lending. A scenario matching 
that of Brunnermeier and Koby’s model, in 
which a decline in the monetary policy rate 
can entail a decrease in banks’ lending, is 
therefore precluded in Repullo’s model.
In the event that the bank cannot generate 
the return required by the shareholders, 
however, it must exit the market in Repul-
lo’s model. The prerequisites for this are the 
monetary policy rate being lowered to a 
negative level, banks being unable to de-
crease their deposit rate to under zero and, 
at the same time, not being able to reject 
depositors. In such a setting, losses from 
deposit- taking may rise to the extent that it 
becomes impossible for the bank to obtain 
suffi   ciently high profi  ts from lending to gen-
erate the returns required by the sharehold-
ers. In Repullo’s model too, therefore, a 
monetary policy rate cut below a certain 
level could, in principle, have a contraction-
ary rather than an expansionary effect on 
lending. However, the consequences of 
such an adverse scenario are very serious in 
this model: no more lending will take place 
at all as the bank has closed down.9
8 Here, the assumption that the volume of loans and 
deposits only depends on the lending rate or the de-
posit rate respectively, in particular, seems to be key. 
On the basis of this assumption, a bank that is a net 
borrower in debt securities can always improve its 
profi  tability in the event of a monetary policy rate cut. 
If it leaves its balance sheet structure unchanged, inter-
est income and interest expenditure from lending and 
deposit business will remain the same. However, inter-
est expenditure for debt securities issued declines 
more sharply than interest income on debt securities 
held. As a result, the bank’s net interest income in-
creases overall. If, by contrast, borrowers and deposit-
ors also react to a monetary policy rate cut when the 
interest rates on lending and deposits remain un-
changed, the bank’s profi  tability could deteriorate 
even if it is a net borrower in debt securities.

nomic developments. In addition, the valuation 
gains incurred with each interest rate cut only 
have a one- off positive effect on profitability. 
Therefore, the likelihood of a negative overall 
effect of monetary policy on banks’ profitabil -
ity, and thus on their capital base, increases 
with the duration of the low interest rate 
phase.
Significance of capital for 
lending 
A bank’s capital ratio can influence its lending 
and the lending rates it charges.24 Two key 
channels can be distinguished here.
– The first channel operates via the bank’s 
total funding costs (hereinafter referred to 
as the “funding costs channel”).
– The second channel focuses on the binding 
force of regulatory capital requirements (hereinafter referred to as the “capital re -
quirement channel”).25
Funding costs channel
The funding costs channel is derived from the 
influence of the capital ratio on the total fund -
ing costs26 of a bank.
– A higher capital ratio reduces the risk of a 
bank failing, meaning that the costs per unit 
of equity and debt decrease. As a result, Likelihood of a 
negative overall 
effect of monet -
ary policy 
increases the 
longer the 
period of low 
interest rates 
lasts
Two channels 
are key to the 
relationship 
between the 
capital ratio 
and lendingA bank’s capital 
ratio influences 
its funding costsThis result is attributable to the fact that the 
bank in Repullo’s model fi  rst has to raise the 
entirety of its equity capital for the period 
under review. Alternatively, it can be as-
sumed, as in the model of Brunnermeier 
and Koby, that the bank has a starting 
amount of capital carried over from the pre-
vious period at the beginning of the period 
under review. In this scenario, the bank 
would receive no new equity capital from 
its investors if it was unable to fulfi  l their re-
quirements with regard to returns on their 
investment. The bank could, however, use 
equity capital from its initial capital endow-
ment for lending purposes, meaning that it 
would not have to exit the market. A rever-
sal rate scenario similar to that seen in the 
model of Brunnermeier and Koby would 
then be conceivable in principle: if the bank 
does not receive any new equity capital, it 
may potentially conduct less lending busi-
ness following an interest rate cut than would otherwise have been the case. For if 
the monetary policy rate were higher, the 
loss incurred from deposit- taking would be 
lower. This could then make it possible for 
the bank to generate the return required by 
the shareholders, to obtain new equity cap-
ital and therefore to grant more loans than 
in the lower monetary policy rate scenario. 
If the loss entailed by deposit- taking activ-
ities was so high that the bank also re-
corded a loss overall, this would, in add-
ition, exhaust the available capital over 
time. The bank would then have to succes-
sively scale back its lending even more over 
the following periods relative to a higher 
monetary policy rate scenario.
24 The capital ratio is the ratio between the level of a 
bank’s capital and the total assets or risk- weighted assets. 
Hereinafter the term “capital ratio” encompasses both pos -
sible definitions. By contrast, we will omit below the fact 
that different types of capital ratio exist, each differing in 
terms of which instruments are counted as capital in the 
numerator.
25 The regulatory capital requirement sets the size of the 
minimum capital ratio. The difference between the capital 
ratio and the regulatory capital requirement is the excess 
capital buffer.
26 Here and in the remainder of this article, the term “total 
funding costs” always refers to the ratio between total 
funding costs in absolute terms and total assets.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
March 2022  
25

taken in isolation, the bank’s total funding 
costs fall.
– A higher capital ratio also leads to a shift in 
the funding mix from debt to equity.27 Given 
that equity is normally associated with 
higher costs for a bank than debt – since 
equity is riskier for investors than debt – this 
results in higher total funding costs for a 
bank when viewed in isolation.28
Which of the two relationships mentioned 
above is dominant –  and thus determines 
whether the overall relationship between the 
capital ratio and the total funding costs is posi -
tive or negative – depends on the size of the 
capital ratio (see the chart above). If the capital 
ratio is low, a bank’s risk of default is likely to rise 
more strongly as a result of a given drop in the 
capital ratio than in the case of a high ratio. 
Consequently, the costs per unit of equity and 
debt probably also increase more sharply in such 
a scenario, meaning that the relationship be -
tween the capital ratio and total funding costs is 
not linear. Arnould et al. (2020) do in fact find 
evidence of such non- linearity in the euro area.
Empirical studies mostly conclude that a lower 
capital ratio reduces total funding costs (this 
corresponds to the upper branch in the chart 
above).29 However, they typically disregard ef -fects that the capital ratio has on the costs per 
unit of debt as well as the non- linearity men -
tioned above. Therefore, their informative value 
for banks with low capital ratios is possibly only 
limited. For other banks, these empirical find -
ings mean that their total funding costs de -
crease if their capital ratio falls.
Since banks typically pass a change in their 
total funding costs through to borrowers, a 
falling lending rate tends to be expected if the 
capital ratio declines.30 On account of the non- 
linearity mentioned above, however, the direc -
tion of this relationship could change if the 
capital ratio is sufficiently low.Relationship

27 This only applies to a capital ratio based on risk-  
weighted assets if the capital ratio based on total assets in -
creases at the same time. This is the case if capital increases 
and/ or total assets decrease.
28 The higher risk involved for equity providers stems from 
the fact that losses initially cause a reduction in capital. 
Debt is only affected once equity is exhausted. Moreover, 
equity funding is also more expensive for banks because, 
unlike debt funding costs, they cannot be deducted from 
taxable profits.
29 For more information on this topic, see, for example, 
Miles et al. (2012). See Birn et al. (2020) for an overview of 
the literature. According to this literature overview, empir -
ical studies typically find that the decline in the costs per 
unit of equity only offsets up to around 50% of the in -
crease in funding costs resulting from a rise in the share of 
equity in the funding mix.
30 For instance, Illes et al. (2015) find that banks in the 
euro area pass a large part of a change in their funding 
costs through to their customers by adjusting their lending 
rates. However, the funding costs observed here do not in -
clude capital costs.Deutsche Bundesbank

Capital requirement channel
The capital requirement channel stems from 
the binding force of a regulatory capital re -
quirement. Such a binding force exists if a bank 
lends less than it would in the absence of this 
requirement. If a bank’s new loans exceed 
those that are repaid or default, its credit vol -
ume grows and thus the denominator of its 
capital ratio. Therefore, ceteris paribus, the 
capital ratio falls if lending increases. If a bank’s 
excess capital buffer is low, it potentially has to 
cut back on its lending to avoid its capital ratio 
falling. In this context, banks do not wait until 
they would otherwise violate regulatory capital 
requirements to constrain their lending. In -
stead, it seems plausible that they strive for a 
target capital ratio above the regulatory capital 
requirement.31 They could therefore already 
constrain their lending at the point where their 
capital ratio would otherwise fall below their 
target capital ratio. A target capital ratio pro -
vides a bank with a certain degree of flexibility: 
first, it creates scope for a potential expansion 
of lending in future. Second, a bank can thus 
hedge against unexpected events, meaning 
that losses do not immediately cause it to 
undershoot regulatory capital requirements.
The capital requirement channel is based on 
the assumption that banks are unable to issue equity instruments to stabilise their excess cap -
ital buffer. This is likely to be the case for many 
unlisted banks.32 Yet, even for listed banks this 
way of raising capital is probably not always 
possible without any constraints (see also the 
box on pp. 22 ff.). It therefore also cannot be 
ruled out that these banks will cut back on 
their lending if their excess capital buffer is too 
low.
Therefore, as a general rule: the lower a bank’s 
excess capital buffer, the higher the likelihood 
that the regulatory capital requirement exerts a 
binding force on its lending.33 A bank is likely 
to curtail its lending if its excess capital buffer 
falls below the target capital ratio.34 The greater 
the extent to which the excess capital buffer 
undershoots the target level, the greater the re -
strictions on lending are likely to be. This results

cess capital buffer and its lending below a cer -Binding force

tain excess capital buffer level. For a given 
regulatory capital requirement, this implies, at 
the same time, that a falling capital ratio is as -
sociated with a decline in lending below a cer -
tain level of the excess capital buffer (see the 
lower branch in the chart on p. 27). By con -
trast, if the excess capital buffer is sufficiently 
high, lending does not respond to a change in 
the capital ratio according to this channel (see 
the upper branch in the chart on p. 27).
Since credit demand typically falls as the lend -
ing rate rises, a bank can cut back its lending 
by raising the lending rate. Consequently, a 
negative relationship between a bank’s excess 
capital buffer and the lending rate can be de -
rived from the above considerations if this buf -
fer drops below a certain level. For a given 
regulatory capital requirement, a negative rela -
tionship consequently also exists between a 
bank’s capital ratio and the lending rate if the 
capital ratio falls below a certain level.
The relationships outlined initially only apply to 
the capital requirement channel presented in 
this section. The overall relationship between a 
bank’s capital ratio and its lending hinges on 
the interaction between the funding costs 
channel and the capital requirement channel. 
The overall impact of both channels will be dis -
cussed in the next section.
Joint examination of both channels
The funding costs and capital requirement 
channels imply opposite signs for the relation -
ship between the capital ratio and lending.
– The funding costs channel tends to give rise 
to a negative relationship between the cap -
ital ratio and lending, which is most likely to 
become apparent if the capital ratio is high.
– By contrast, the capital requirement channel 
gives rise to a positive relationship between 
the excess capital buffer and lending if the 
excess capital buffer is low. For a given regu -
latory capital requirement, this also results in a positive relationship between a bank’s 
capital ratio and its lending.
All in all, the relationship between the capital 
ratio and lending – and thus also the relation -
ship between the capital ratio and the lending 
rate – therefore depends on the size of the ex -
cess capital buffer. If the excess capital buffer is 
sufficiently low, a decline in capital leads to a 
reduction in lending and to a rise in the lending 
rate. This is also suggested by the results of an 
empirical study conducted by the Bundesbank 
(see the box on pp. 29 ff.) For banks in Ger -
many, these results indicate that a decline in 
the capital ratio tends to be associated with an 
increase in the lending rate on loans to non-  
financial corporations if banks’ excess capital 
buffer is low. This relationship is reversed in the 
case of large excess capital buffers. The results 
of the study also suggest that the non- linear 
relation ship has strengthened during the 
coronavirus pandemic, with a decline in the 
capital ratio during the pandemic resulting in a 
stronger rise in the lending rate for banks with 
a low excess capital buffer than prior to the 
pandemic. A decline in the capital ratio caused 
the lending rate for banks with a high excess 
capital buffer to fall more sharply than before 
the onset of the pandemic. A simple aggregate 
analysis does not provide any evidence to sug -
gest that an increase in lending rates due to a 
decline in the capital ratios is currently likely in 
the German banking system. This is because 
banks’ excess capital buffers are too high on 
average for a negative relationship to be ex -
pected. Thus, the empirical study shows no in -
dication that German banks currently meet the 
second necessary condition for reaching a re -
versal rate.

The relationship between banks’ capital and lending rates: 
econometric analysis based on AnaCredit credit data 
statistics 
This box presents an analysis of the relation-
ship between the capital ratios of banks in 
Germany and the lending rates they charge. 
The principal focus here is on whether this 
relationship exhibits non- linearities. The an-
alysis is conducted at the individual loan 
level for the period from July 2019 to Octo-
ber 2021. AnaCredit credit data statistics, 
prudential reporting data and credit institu-
tions’ balance sheet statistics data serve as 
the data basis. The analysis focuses on 
interest rates on new loans to non- fi  nancial 
corporations.1 The estimation sample com-
prises around 430,000 observations, of 
which approximately 150,000 are from 
2019, 180,000 are from 2020 and roughly 
100,000 are from 2021. Data from Ana-
Credit and the balance sheet statistics are 
available at the monthly level, the pruden-
tial data at the quarterly level.
To determine the empirical relationship, the 
interest rate on a loan is regressed on differ-
ent loan and bank- side variables. The analy-
sis takes place at the individual loan level 
and all loans are equally weighted in the 
estimation.2 Fixed effects are included to 
control for borrower- side and macroeco-
nomic infl  uences on the lending rates. For-
mally, the estimation can be described by 
the following equation:
Ri,b,f,m=β1⇤EKb,q−1+β2⇤EK2

8⇤Covid m⇤ki,b,f,m+λf,q
+δm+"i,b,f,m
Ri,b,f,m is the interest rate on the loan i , 
which was newly granted in month m  by bank b to an enterprise from group f (see 
below for a defi  nition of this group). EKb,q–1 
is the capital ratio – lagged by one quar-
ter – of bank b.3 As outlined in the main 
text, it is to be expected that the relation-
ship between the capital ratio and the lend-
ing rate is non- linear. To take this into ac-
count, the squared capital ratio EK2
b,q–1 
from the previous quarter q –1 is incorpor-
ated into the estimation. As a bank’s excess 
capital buffer is likely to be paramount for 
the binding effect of regulatory capital re-
quirements (see the main text), the regula-
tory capital requirement of the respective 
bank Regb,q from the current quarter q  is 
also incorporated into the estimation (the 
original and squared value, respectively).4 In 
this way, the regulatory capital requirement 
is kept constant, which means that a rise 
(fall) in the capital ratio in the estimation 
model increases (reduces) the excess capital 
1 The focus is on this loan category as lending to non- 
fi  nancial corporations, in particular, plays a key role 
from a monetary policy perspective.
2 Loans to enterprises from the sub- sector “Wholesale 
and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and 
motorcycles” make up by far the largest share of new 
loans to non- fi  nancial corporations in terms of the 
number of loans granted. The results of the estima-
tions presented here are therefore very sensitive to the 
(non-)inclusion of these loans in the estimation sam-
ple. The share of these loans in the underlying credit 
volume is, however, signifi  cantly smaller than their 
share in the number of loans granted. To prevent loans 
to this sector from having a decisive infl  uence on the 
estimation results, they were removed from the esti-
mation sample.
3 The capital ratio is calculated as the ratio of a bank’s 
Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital to its risk- 
weighted assets.
4 The term “regulatory capital requirement” here and 
below refers to the ratio of required CET1 capital to 
the bank’s risk- weighted assets. The capital require-
ment used here includes (binding) capital add- ons 
under the Pillar 2 requirement and required buffers, 
but not (non- binding) capital add- ons under the Pillar 
2 guidance. As (binding) capital add- ons and some of 
the buffer requirements are bank- specifi  c, the require-
ment varies across the banks in the sample.Deutsche Bundesbank

buffer by the same amount, ceteris paribus. 
In addition, the inclusion of the interaction 
term EKb,q–1 * Regb,q takes account of the 
fact that the marginal effect of the capital 
ratio on the lending rate might depend on 
the size of the regulatory capital require-
ment. The vector bb,q–1 comprises other 
bank- side variables: the share of non- 
performing loans in total loans, the share of 
excess liquidity5 in total assets as well as the 
size of the respective bank’s total assets.6 
The vector ki,b,f,m consists of the loan- side 
variables, including the volume, collateral, 
purpose7 and maturity of the respective 
loan. The dummy variable Covidm takes the 
value of 1 after the outbreak of the corona-
virus pandemic in March 2020, and the 
value of 0 beforehand. On account of the 
interaction between the vector ki,b,f,m and 
the dummy variable Covidm, the effects of 
the loan- side variables can vary before and 
after the onset of the coronavirus pan-
demic. Fixed effects are included to control for enterprise- side factors: for every quarter, 
a fi  xed effect λf,q is incorporated for each 
group f of enterprises in the same sector 
that are of a similar size and from the same 
region.8 The time- fi  xed effects at the 
monthly level δm collectively capture the in-
fl  uence on lending rates of all variables that 
vary over time but not across banks, fi  rms 
and loans. This replaces the inclusion of a 
series of possibly relevant macroeconomic 
variables such as capital market yields, mon-
etary policy rates or infl  ation rates. The vari-
able εi,b,f,m is an error term. When calculat-
ing the standard errors of the estimators, 
the error terms are clustered at the quar-
terly bank level.
The results of the analysis indicate that the 
effect a bank’s capital ratio has on the lend-
ing rates it charges is indeed non- linear. The 
adjacent chart shows that a decline in the 
capital ratio tends to be accompanied by an 
increase in the lending rate if the level of 
the bank’s excess capital buffer is low. How-
ever, this effect is not signifi  cantly different 
from zero. By contrast, if the level of the ex-
cess capital buffer is suffi   ciently high, then a 
decline in the capital ratio leads to a de-
crease in the lending rate.9
In a further estimation, the estimation 
period was limited to the period after the 
5 In this context, only excess liquidity that exceeds the 
exemption allowance is taken into account.
6 Some of the variables in the vector bb,q–1 are available 
at a monthly frequency; these are lagged by three 
months.
7 Possible forms of the variable “purpose” are, for ex-
ample, construction investment or the fi  nancing of 
working capital.
8 See Degryse et al. (2019). The results presented 
below are largely robust if, alternatively, for each quar-
ter one fi  xed effect per enterprise is incorporated into 
the estimation.
9 Owing to the effect of the interaction between the 
capital ratio and regulatory capital requirement con-
tained in the estimation, the straight line shown in the 
chart shifts if the requirement is fi  xed at a different 
level.Effect of a reduction in the capital ratio

outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.10 
The results suggest that the relationship be-
tween the capital ratio and lending rates 
has intensifi  ed with the pandemic. For both 
small and large excess capital buffers, there 
is a stronger effect in terms of absolute 
value than in the estimation for the entire 
period. The effect is also signifi  cantly differ-
ent from zero for small excess capital buf-
fers.
The results indicate that banks with small 
excess capital buffers may strive to stabilise 
their capital ratios and thus their excess 
capital buffers. They seem to respond to a 
decline in their capital ratios by increasing 
lending rates in order to slow their lending. 
This suggests that the regulatory capital re-
quirement has a binding effect on banks 
with small excess capital buffers: affected 
banks seek to avoid a further decline in 
their excess capital buffers in order to re-
duce the risk of breaching the regulatory 
capital requirement. To that end, they ad-
just their lending policies to developments 
in their capital ratios. By contrast, for banks 
with large excess capital buffers, the bind-
ing effect of the regulatory capital require-
ment is likely to play a less signifi  cant role. 
According to the chart, these banks re-
spond to a decline in their capital ratios by 
reducing lending rates. This is likely to re-
fl  ect the positive relationship between fund-
ing costs and the capital ratio: a lower cap-
ital ratio tends to be accompanied by lower 
total funding costs (see the main text). The 
banks then pass on the lower funding costs 
to their customers in the form of lower 
lending rates.
This interpretation of the results is also con-
sistent with the fact that the relationship 
between capital and lending rates intensi-
fi  ed after the coronavirus pandemic began. 
First, banks’ capital costs probably rose dur-
ing the pandemic.11 Therefore, the positive relationship between capital ratios and 
funding costs is likely to have intensifi  ed. 
Second, the heightened uncertainty trig-
gered by the pandemic probably led banks 
with small excess capital buffers to respond 
more sensitively to a change in their capital 
ratios. If their capital ratios fall, these banks 
therefore seem to increase their lending 
rates more sharply than before the pan-
demic, despite the higher capital costs.
Based on the estimation results, the effect 
of the capital ratio on lending rates can be 
calculated for each bank.12 The weighted 
average effect across all banks can then be 
calculated. The respective level of the out-
standing volume of loans supplied to non- 
fi  nancial corporations acts as a weight. This 
means that those banks that play a bigger 
role in this loan segment are given a greater 
weight in the average. It turns out that the 
weighted average effect of a reduction in 
the capital ratio on lending rates is slightly 
negative. There is therefore no direct indica-
tion that a decline in German banks’ capital 
ratios might currently prompt an increase in 
lending rates on loans to non- fi  nancial cor-
porations on aggregate.
One caveat to be noted is that the analysis 
presented here is based on the assumption 
that a bank’s capital ratio in the preceding 
quarter is exogenous. This implies that the 
bank gears its lending rates to this given 
10 The dummy variable Covidm and the interaction 
terms formed with it are then eliminated from the esti-
mation as the dummy variable, by necessity, takes the 
value 1 for all observations.
11 See Altavilla et al. (2021).
12 As described above, the squared capital ratio is 
used in the estimation. Furthermore, it is interacted 
with the regulatory capital requirement. For this rea-
son, the effect of the capital ratio depends on the level 
of the capital ratio itself and the level of the regulatory 
requirement. As these variables differ from bank to 
bank, this results in an individual effect of the capital 
ratio for each bank. The bank- specifi  c values for these 
variables from the third quarter of 2021 were used in 
the calculation.Deutsche Bundesbank

– Expansionary monetary policy weighs on 
banks’ profitability and thus their capital 
endow ment and …
– …  the erosion of the capital endowment 
causes banks to reduce their lending.
The level of the reversal rate is neither directly 
observable nor fixed; it is time- varying and de -
pends, in particular, on the size of the excess 
capital buffer. The smaller the excess capital 
buffer, the more likely it is that a reduced cap -
ital endowment will have a dampening effect 
on lending. The reversal rate thus materialises 
earlier when banks have a smaller excess cap -
ital buffer than when it is large. In other words, 
as the excess capital buffer falls, the reversal 
rate rises. Consequently, all factors that change 
the excess capital buffer also change the level 
of the reversal rate. These factors include not 
only the duration of the low interest rate period 
but also, for example, changed capital require -
ments and the business cycle.In a cyclical downturn, credit risk typically in -
creases. If this heightened risk translates into 
higher risk weights, this triggers a rise in risk-  
weighted assets.35 Ceteris paribus, this reduces 
banks’ capital ratio and thus also their excess 
capital buffer. Tighter regulatory capital re -
quirements likewise lower the excess capital 
buffer, all other things being equal. In addition, 
the net interest margin decreases the longer 
the low interest rate period lasts.36 Taken in 
isolation, the resulting downward pressure on 
bank profitability is likely to raise the reversal 
rate over time.
However, margin compression can also have an 
expansionary effect on lending as long as the 
reversal rate has not yet materialised. This is in -
dicated by the results of the euro area Bank Reversal rate

BLS results do 
not indicate that 
reversal rate has 
materialised in 
the euro areacapital ratio. In reality, however, the direc-
tion of impact might also be the reverse: a 
bank that wants to expand its lending 
might already increase its ratio beforehand 
by raising new capital in the market, for ex-
ample. If so, lending possibilities today 
would be a determinant of the develop-
ment of the capital ratio in the past. This 
would contradict the assumption that the 
capital ratio of the previous quarter is ex-
ogenous. Consequently, the actual effect of 
the capital ratio on lending rates might be 
systematically higher or lower than the ef-
fect identifi  ed here. It should also be borne 
in mind that the analysis outlined in this box 
does not capture any spillover effects be-
tween banks. Such spillover effects could 
mean that, on aggregate, a change in the 
capital ratios has a different effect than the 
results presented here suggest.
35 Furthermore, credit defaults place a direct strain on cap -
ital and thus, ceteris paribus, reduce the excess capital buf -
fer.

Lending Survey (BLS) (see the adjacent chart). 
The participating banks responded to the 
downward pressure on their profitability from 
the negative deposit facility rate by expanding 
their lending, probably in an attempt to com -
pensate for margin compression. The BLS re -
sults suggest that, despite the downward pres -
sure on their margins, the participating euro 
area banks had sufficient scope in their capital 
endowment to expand their lending. The BLS 
thus gives no indication that a reversal rate has 
already materialised in the euro area.37
The outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic led 
to concerns that pandemic mitigation meas -
ures would trigger a sharp increase in credit de -
faults in the hardest hit sectors. Banks would 
then have needed to increase their loan loss 
provisioning, resulting in downward pressure 
on their profitability and thus their capital en -
dowment. This deterioration in banks’ capital 
endowment would, ceteris paribus, have in -
creased the likelihood of a reversal rate scen -
ario in the euro area as it would have reduced 
the excess capital buffer in the banking system 
given the existing regulatory capital require -
ments. No such scenario materialised, how -
ever, partly because the regulatory capital re -
quirements were temporarily loosened and fis -
cal policy support measures alleviated the im -
pact of the pandemic.38 In addition, supervisors 
asked banks to temporarily refrain from or limit 
dividends.39 In reality, euro area banks’ capital 
ratios have actually risen since the outbreak of 
the pandemic.40 Excess capital buffers have 
also tended to increase in the quarters since 
the pandemic began.41 To date, developments 
in the capital endowment do not indicate, in 
and of themselves, that a reversal rate scenario 
in the euro area has become more likely during 
the pandemic.
Implications for 
monetary policy
The indicators addressed in this article suggest 
that a reversal rate for the aggregated banking system has not yet materialised either in Ger -
many or the euro area. The econometric analy -
sis presented here does not give any indication 
that the German banking system is currently 
likely to experience lending constraints due to a 
decline in capital ratios. For the euro area, the 
BLS results show that, so far, banks have re -
sponded to the downward pressure on their 
margins due to the negative deposit facility rate 
by expanding their lending, not by restricting it. 
Furthermore, the capital endowment of euro 
area banks has improved since the outbreak of 
the coronavirus pandemic, which, ceteris pari -
bus, has made a reversal rate scenario less 
likely.Taken in isol -

The reversal rate probably has not yet material -
ised in the euro area. However, it is impossible 
to tell how far the banking system is from the 
reversal rate at present because its level at the 
current end cannot be determined precisely 
enough. The level of the reversal rate changes 
all the time because the macroeconomic and/  
or regulatory environment also change. As a re -
sult, the analyses and indicators presented in 
this article do not allow the reversal rate to be 
quantified at the current end.
Nonetheless, the article illustrates which met -
rics can be helpful in assessing the potential risk of hitting the reversal rate at the current 
end. One key metric is banks’ excess capital 
buffer: its size is a crucial factor in banks’ lend -
ing and thus also in the probability of a monet -
ary policy measure triggering a reversal rate 
scenario. The concept of the reversal rate is 
therefore useful in monetary policy discussions 
as it shows which mechanisms can potentially 
lessen the impact of monetary policy in a 
period of low interest rates. It thus provides 
valuable insights into the indicators and factors 
that warrant closer attention from monetary 
policymakers in a low interest rate environ -
ment.Reversal rate

tified for the

still useful in

German balance of payments in 2021
In 2021, the German economy’s current account surplus increased by ½ percentage point to 
7½% of nominal gross domestic product (GDP). The surplus more or less returned to its pre-  
pandemic level, following its short- lived decline in the previous year. It was chiefly the primary 
income surplus that grew in size, while the balances of the goods account, services account and 
secondary income remained largely unchanged. This outcome is only partly attributable to the 
reversal of developments observed in the first year of the pandemic. The primary income surplus 
recovered owing to a higher level of income from Germany’s outward foreign direct investment 
amid the upswing in most host countries, and German exporters benefited from a rebound in for -
eign demand. However, strong increases in import prices in connection with pandemic- related 
supply bottlenecks reduced the surplus in the goods account. In addition, Germans’ continued 
low spending on travel together with exceptionally high receipts from patents for vaccines in 
2021 had a positive impact on Germany’s services account, which usually runs a deficit.
From a saving and investment perspective, the rise in the current account surplus was attributable 
mainly to increased saving, which exceeded the cyclical recovery in investment. Saving by non- 
financial corporations went up, which may, to some extent, have been for precautionary and 
deleveraging purposes after the crisis- related strains of the year before. While household saving 
was down, it remained significantly above its pre- crisis level. Given the presence of temporary, 
persistently large crisis- related burdens, the general government deficit remained broadly 
unchanged.
The ongoing coronavirus pandemic affected not only the current account but also international 
capital flows in 2021. In particular, expansionary fiscal and monetary policy responses to the pan -
demic in many countries affected cross- border activities. At the same time, inflation rates and 
expectations rose in many places over the course of the year. As a result, a number of major cen -
tral banks returned to a slightly more restrictive monetary policy. For example, the US Fed began 
tapering its net asset purchases in November and the Bank of England raised its Bank Rate. Other 
central banks such as the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of Canada and the Bank of 
Japan announced that they were considering either scaling back or fully discontinuing their asset 
purchase programmes. All in all, at €314½ billion in 2021, Germany’s net capital exports were 
substantially higher than in the year before (€216½ billion).
Portfolio investment, financial derivatives and direct investment saw net capital exports. By con -
trast, other investment predominantly gave rise to capital inflows, with the Bundesbank’s external 
claims from a higher TARGET2 balance rising less strongly than its external liabilities. Besides 
larger deposits from non- resident counterparties and the above average issuance of euro bank -
notes, a one- off effect stemming from the allocation of special drawing rights by the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) had an impact here. In turn, the allocation of special drawing rights caused 
the Bundesbank’s reserve assets to grow.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current account
Underlying trends 
in the current account
In a year- on- year comparison, Germany’s cur -
rent account surplus rose by €26½ billion in 
2021 to €265½ billion. The balance increased 
by ½  percentage point to 7½% of nominal 
GDP . However, Germany’s current account sur -
plus shrank over the course of the year. The 
country’s current account surplus amounted to 
8¼% of GDP in the first quarter, decreasing as 
the year progressed to a seasonally adjusted 
5½% in the final quarter.The change in the current account balance 
was  brought about by contrasting develop -
ments in certain sub-accounts. The main driver 
of growth in the aggregate was the significant 
rise in the primary income balance, due espe -
cially to the higher level of income from Ger -
many’s outward foreign direct investment amid 
the economic recovery in most host countries, 
the pace of which exceeded that in Germany.1 
The surplus in the goods account went up mar -
ginally. Relative to GDP , however, it went down 
slightly. While the economic recovery of Ger -
many’s trading partners raised the surplus in 
the reporting year by way of volume effects, 
these effects were outweighed by the impact 
of strong import price increases in connection 
with pandemic- related supply bottlenecks. The 
deterioration in German terms of trade over 
the course of the year was amplified by the rise 
in energy prices, in particular. In addition, 
supply- side production constraints in Germany 
gradually grew larger. On balance, the surplus 
in the goods account, and with it the current 
account surplus, shrank over the course of the 
year. Furthermore, travel started to normalise 
somewhat around mid- 2021, which tended to 
reduce the surplus in the services account. On 
average in 2021, the larger receipts in the ser -
vices account from charges for the use of intel -
lectual property to develop vaccines offset 
higher deficits in other sub- items, such as cross- 
border travel. The deficit in the secondary in -
come account remained broadly unchanged.
The global economic recovery shaped the 
global setting in 2021. First, German exporters 
benefited from increased foreign demand. Ac -

(CPB) World Trade Monitor, world trade in -
creased very significantly across regions. Eco -
nomic output in a number of countries, includ -
ing the United States and China, returned to or 
exceeded pre- crisis levels. Other economies, in -
cluding those in the euro area, were still lag -
ging behind in terms of economic activity due 
to divergent pandemic developments and 
measures taken to combat them. Second, the 
global boost in demand led to delivery delays 
and shortages of important intermediate goods 
in light of the pandemic- related production 
and transport problems. This led to steep in -
creases in the prices of inputs and industrial 
raw materials. The prices of fossil fuels also 
rose, in some cases drastically, in view of high 
demand and scarce supply. At just under 
US$71, a barrel of Brent crude oil cost around 
two- thirds more in 2021 than in the year be -
fore. According to the Hamburg Institute of 
International Economics, natural gas and coal 
prices have tripled and doubled, respectively.2 
German exporters also faced slight headwinds 
stirred up by the appreciation of the euro. The 
currency’s nominal effective exchange rate 
against the currencies of the euro area’s 42 
most important trading partners, on average 
across 2021, was roughly 1¼% higher than the 
previous year’s level.
From a regional perspective, the current ac -
count surplus vis- à- vis euro area countries rose 
to 3% of GDP , with increases in the balances of 
the goods account and primary income ex -
ceeding the larger deficit in the services ac -
count. The current account surplus vis- à- vis 
non- euro area countries remained unchanged, 
at 4½% of GDP . Here, increases in the balances 
of primary income and the services account 
offset the decrease in the goods surplus.
Aggregate net lending/ net borrowing rose 
slightly relative to GDP in the reporting year.3 
Both domestic investment and domestic saving 
recovered significantly on aggregate, but did 
not completely rebound from the low levels of 
the previous year. Amongst other things, sup -
ply bottlenecks dampened backlog and catch-  up effects in business investment. Meanwhile, 
private residential investment increased sharply. 
While household saving was down, it remained 
significantly above its pre- crisis level due to cer -
tain opportunities to consume, such as trips 
abroad, being available only to a limited extent 
or not being taken up to the same extent as 
before the outbreak of the coronavirus pan -
demic. Given the presence of temporary, per -
sistently large crisis- related burdens, the gen -
eral government deficit remained broadly un -
changed. However, saving by non- financial cor -
porations increased very significantly, due in 
part to lower distributions. This may, to some 
extent, have been for precautionary and delev -

net lending/  net borrowing by non- financial 
corporations exceeded the decrease for house -
holds, while net lending/ net borrowing by gen -
eral government remained unchanged.
Goods flows 
and balance of trade
At 8% in price- adjusted terms, goods exports 
recorded very strong year- on- year growth in 
2021. Imports of goods grew less strongly, by 
3¼%. The fact that exports of certain capital 
goods such as machinery and motor vehicles were significantly depressed in 2020 due to the 
pandemic was a contributing factor behind the 
relatively high percentage growth rate for ex -
ports. As a result, the volume of total exports in 
the reporting year was still slightly below the 
annual average for 2019, a level to which im -
ports returned. In 2021, the year- on- year in -
crease in exports and particularly imports was 
far higher in terms of value than in price-  
adjusted terms, at 14% and 17% respectively. 
On balance, the foreign trade balance fell by 
€7½ billion to €173 billion.
The recovery of Germany’s foreign trade activ -
ities from their pandemic- related slump in 2020 
slowed down over the course of 2021. The 
main reason for this was sluggish industrial ac -
tivity in Germany and its trading partners for 
large parts of the reporting year; this activity 
was hampered by delivery delays and materials 
shortages in the second half of the year, in par -
ticular. In real terms, total exports in the fourth 
quarter were up by only 1½% on the year, and 
imports were down by 1¾%.
In regional terms, German exporters recorded 
very strong increases in sales to almost every 
partner country in the euro area. Deliveries to 
countries outside the euro area also saw strong 
growth. In this context, the increases in sales to 
central and eastern European countries as well 
as to the United States were especially pro -
nounced. In addition, there was perceptible 
growth in exports to commodity-  exporting 
countries such as Russia, Brazil and South 
Africa , which are also likely to have benefited 
from greater scope for expenditure as a result 
of income from their commodity sales. Sales to 
China likewise recorded a significant increase in 
line with the strong expansion of the Chinese 
economy. By contrast, exports to the United 
Kingdom declined markedly as the transitional 
period ensuring reciprocal market access under 
EU single market rules had come to an end.
With regard to the range of exported goods, 
practically all areas saw very steep growth in 
price- adjusted terms in the year under review. Foreign trade

Exports of intermediate goods more than re -
covered from the decline recorded in the previ -
ous year. Among capital goods, there was a 
considerable increase in exports of motor 
vehicles  and motor vehicle parts as well as of 
machinery and equipment. Exports of other 
transport equipment such as aircraft suffered 
from the global travel outlook, which remains 
subdued by the coronavirus pandemic, and 
declined  further. Very strong growth was re -
corded by exports of electrical equipment, 
chemical products, computers, and electronic 
and optical products. Exports of consumer 
goods also made strong gains. This was bol -
stered by the very sharp hike in demand for 
pharmaceutical products; in this context, the 
global need for coronavirus vaccines made in 
Germany also played a major role.
Imports of intermediate goods saw very steep 
growth. Among capital goods, there was an 
especially sharp rise in deliveries of machinery 
and equipment from foreign manufacturers. 
These benefited from an improvement in the 
pandemic situation leading to a reduction in 
uncertainty, which had also weighed on the in -
vestment plans of German enterprises. Mean -
while, imports of motor vehicles and motor ve -
hicle parts suffered heavily from global supply 
bottlenecks and saw only moderate growth. 
Deliveries of consumer goods rose steeply, with 
imports of pharmaceutical products expanding 
especially strongly, which was linked to the 
need for coronavirus vaccines and tests.
Broken down by region, deliveries from the 
euro area and from other countries saw simi -
larly strong growth in price- adjusted terms, 
with manufacturers in almost every partner 
country recording growth in their sales to Ger -
many. Among Germany’s major trading part -
ners in the euro area, imports from Belgium 
grew exceptionally strongly in terms of value, 
with coronavirus vaccines produced in that 
country also playing a significant role. Among 
third countries, key energy suppliers such as

which was partly due to inflation for energy

Invisible current transactions
In the cross- border trade in services, receipts 
and expenditure rose steeply in 2021, similarly 
to the goods trade, following the slump in the 
previous year. At 17½%, services exports grew 
to the same extent as services imports, which 
rose by 18½%. As a result, this account, which 
had posted large deficits in the past and re -
corded a slight surplus for the first time in many 
decades during the course of the pandemic, 
also posted a small surplus of €½ billion last 
year. However, this was only partially attribut -
able to the recovery, i.e. a return to pre-  
pandemic conditions. One- off developments in 
certain sub- accounts had a major impact on 
the overall services account.Before the outbreak of the coronavirus pan -
demic, German residents’ traditionally high for -
eign travel expenditure was responsible for the 
large deficit in the services account. With gains 
of €6½ billion in the year under review, this 
item saw hardly any recovery following its 
coronavirus-  related collapse of almost three-  
fifths – or nearly €50 billion – in the first year of 
the pandemic. Due to the pandemic situation 
and the associated obstacles to travel, long-  
distance journeys in particular, but also Alpine 
winter tourism, were even weaker in 2021 than 
they had been in the previous year. By contrast, 
expenditure for summer travel to Mediterra -
nean countries rose again. In terms of travel in -
come – which is dominated by travel for trade 
fairs, events and business trips – Germany has 
seen no recovery thus far. The deficit in the

4 On balance, the higher supplementary trade items were 
the key factor in this. Here, there was a very sharp rise in 
the c.i.f. charges for imports, amongst others; these com -
prise the costs of freight and insurance from the border of 
the supplier’s country to the German border. Furthermore, 
net income from merchanting trade rose steeply by €6½ 
billion, as receipts from sales grew to a larger extent than 
expenditure for purchases. In this context, a key role was 
played by transactions in the automotive industry; a consid -
erable share of merchanting transactions are generally at -
tributable to this industry. This was contrasted by a rise of 
€7 billion in net expenditure for trade in non- monetary 
gold. Here, transaction values rose on the expenditure side 
and fell on the receipts side.Deutsche Bundesbank

far, widened again by €7 billion on balance. 
However, at €22 billion, it remained well short 
of the considerable deficits to which Germany 
is accustomed.
Cross- border transport services reflect goods-  
related economic activity in the services sector 
and, for Germany, are normally in deficit. Fol -
lowing the decline in both receipts and ex -
penditure in this area resulting from the re -
duced trade in goods in 2020, both sides of the 
balance sheet were extended significantly be -
yond their pre- crisis levels during the year 
under review. However, this was only partially 
attributable to the renewed considerable rise in 
import and export volumes. Due to disrupted 
supply chains and higher energy prices, there 
was a massive increase in freight rates for inter -
national goods transport. Forwarding agents, 
shipping companies and air transport enter -
prises domiciled in Germany benefited from 
this, making gains of more than 41% over the 
previous year. However, domestic customers’ 
expenditure with non-  resident transport com -
panies also grew, by 39%. As a result of this 
development, the deficit that had been ac -
crued in this sub- account in the previous year 
widened only slightly by €2½ billion. Other 
components of the services account related to 
the goods trade, such as manufacturing, main -
tenance and repair services, experienced only 
marginal changes in their balances compared 
with 2020.
The very steep rise in services receipts in 2021 
was significantly bolstered by a one- off effect 
in charges for the use of intellectual property. 
In this item, expenditure rose by €3 billion, 
while receipts grew by just over €17 billion. Li -
cence fees for vaccines played a major role in 
this context. As a result, the surplus grew mas -
sively in 2021 to €32 billion.
In the year under review, receipts and expend -
iture for other knowledge- based and business 
services saw somewhat below average growth.

tually unchanged, while sales in both directions 
rose considerably. In the first year of the pan -
demic, there had only been a small dip in an 
otherwise very strong trend. There was limited 
recovery in receipts in the area of other busi -
ness services from abroad. By contrast, expend -
iture for research and development, profes -
sional, technical and commercial services, as 
well as management consultancy services grew 
to a greater extent. In net terms, the deficit in 
this category widened by around €4 billion.
In the year under review, domestic enterprises 
generated a slightly smaller surplus from cross- 
border financial services and insurance and pension fund services than they had in 2020. 
The main reason for this was the steep rise in 
expenditure for financial services usually pro -
vided by banks, which exceeded the growth on 
the receipts side. Sales of these services had 
also increased in the previous year due to re -
locations away from the financial centre of 
London as a result of Brexit. By contrast, cross- 
border insurance and pension fund services 
only recorded marginal changes in sales and in 
the balance compared with the previous year.
Following a decline in 2020, the surplus on the 
primary income balance widened again consid -
erably in the year under review. Germany’s re -
ceipts from abroad exceeded payments to 
other countries by €126½ billion and were thus 
higher than they had been immediately prior to 
the pandemic. Combined, cross-  border com -
pensation of employees and other primary in -
come were almost balanced, as in the preced -
ing year. The dominant balance sheet item was 
investment income. In the second year of the 
pandemic, corporate earnings saw a strong re -
covery. Net receipts from cross- border invest -
ment rose by €29 billion compared with the 
first year of the pandemic, amounting to €126 
billion according to preliminary calculations. In 
this context, receipts to resident investors and 
capital donors from foreign investments grew 
massively by more than one- sixth, reaching a 
total of €213 billion. This rise is largely attribut -
able to the upswing in receipts from direct in -
vestment, although this had also been pre -
ceded by a very sharp drop. By contrast, pay -
ments to foreign financiers saw hardly any 
growth, rising by ½%, and thus remained far 
short of the pre- crisis level. This was partly due 
to the fact that the rise in payments from resi -
dents to non- resident capital donors for their 
direct investment was somewhat counterbal -
anced by a corresponding decline in expend -
iture for portfolio investment.
Much like in the year before, the deficit in the 
cross- border secondary income account 
widened slightly last year by €1½ billion to €54 
billion. For Germany, unilateral payments grew Expansion in

considerably on both the receipts and expend -
iture side. Government payment flows were 
the major factor in this. Germany’s contribu -
tions to the EU budget based on gross national 
income rose significantly in 2021. In the oppos -
ite direction, inflows to Germany included 
coronavirus- related special assistance from the 
EU budget, amongst others. Receipts from in -
come and wealth taxes on persons resident 
abroad also increased slightly once again.
Capital movements
Underlying trends in capital 
movements
In 2021, Germany’s current account surplus 
was mirrored by net capital exports of €314½ 
billion.5 Following the sharp economic down -
turn in 2020, enterprises and financial players 
started 2021 with confidence and hopeful for a 
rapid upswing, with vaccination campaigns 
being launched in some advanced economies 
at the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021. 
The ongoing fiscal support and the strongly ex -
pansionary monetary policy also stimulated in -
vestors’ risk appetite.
However, the spread of new virus variants 
showed that the coronavirus pandemic was still 
far from over. Furthermore, in the second half 
of the year, unexpectedly high inflation rates 
and emerging inflation concerns increasingly 
proved to be a strain. Some central banks 
reacted by ushering in or at least signalling a 
tighter monetary policy stance: for example, 
the Fed in the United States tapered its asset 
purchases as of November, and the Bank of 
England increased its base rate (Bank Rate). The 
Eurosystem announced a marked reduction in 
the total envelope of its purchase programmes: 
the net purchases under the pandemic emer -
gency purchase programme (PEPP) will be dis -
continued at the end of March 2022. Further -
more, in the first quarter of 2022, the Govern -
ing Council of the ECB expects to conduct net 
purchases under the PEPP at a lower pace than in the previous quarter. At the same time, it de -
cided to temporarily step up purchases under 
the expanded asset purchase programme (APP) 
to a limited extent. This deteriorating economic 
environment was compounded by mounting 
political risks relating to the Russia- Ukraine 
conflict that had already begun to escalate in 
2021.
Although underlying conditions were challen -
ging at times, German stakeholders benefited 
from Germany’s integration in the global econ -
omy in 2021 as well. Cross- border ties are a key 
component in the economic growth of domes -
tic firms.6 Unhindered access to international

tates cross- border investment, whereas foreign 
capital controls may have a dampening effect 
on financial flows to and from Germany (see 
the box on pp. 47 ff.).
Overall, the cross- border transactions of do -
mestic market participants resulted in net cap -ital exports in portfolio investment, financial 
derivatives and direct investment. Once again, 
the Eurosystem’s purchase programmes had a 
profound impact on portfolio transactions. As 
the Bundesbank largely acquired domestic debt 
securities under its asset purchases, residents 
partly shifted their portfolios towards foreign, 
often higher- yielding assets. Non- residents, 
too, disposed of German paper on balance. 
Other investment recorded net capital imports. 
While German TARGET2 claims reached an all- 
time high at the end of 2021, the liabilities of 
the Bundesbank and the rest of the banking 
system to non- euro area residents rose even 
more strongly than the Bundesbank’s claims on 
the ECB.
Portfolio investment
In 2021, there were net capital exports of €255 
billion in portfolio investment, which was much 
higher than the €43 billion recorded in 2020. 
The main cause of these high outflows was the 
fact that domestic investors boosted their port -
folios of foreign interest- bearing securities and 
foreign equities significantly, by €221½ billion. 
For instance, they showed considerable interest 
in foreign mutual fund shares (€103½ billion), 
and there was also strong demand for foreign 
shares (€56 billion).
One reason for German investors’ elevated for -
eign investment may lie in the search for yield 
associated with an increased appetite for risk: 
the stock markets in the United States, and 
even in other EU countries, for example, out -
performed those in Germany. Accordingly, 
shares issued by firms in the US topped the list 
of purchases by German investors by a wide 
margin, at €26 billion. Furthermore, domestic 
investors added large volumes of equities from 
the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Italy and 
Japan to their portfolios. Among the countries 
issuing mutual fund shares, Luxembourg and 
Ireland – two countries that are home to many 
investment companies – stood out.Germany’s port -

Impact of foreign capital controls on German fi  nancial 
fl  ows*
In recent years, numerous countries have 
made greater use of capital controls in 
order to shield themselves from undesirable 
external disturbances or prevent outfl  ows 
due to internal imbalances. The administra-
tive design of these interventions has varied 
considerably in the specifi  cs, depending on 
the motive. International organisations such 
as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
and the Organisation for Economic Co- 
operation and Development (OECD) have 
engaged in in- depth discussions of the cir-
cumstances under which interventions in 
fi  nancial fl  ows can be justifi  ed.1
There is no consensus on the impact of cap-
ital controls in the academic literature. Klein 
(2012) argues that temporary capital con-
trols have no marked effect on the growth 
of fi  nancial variables, on the real exchange 
rate or on growth in gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP). By contrast, Erten and Ocampo 
(2016) conclude that capital controls can 
help to reduce macroeconomic instabilities, 
therefore lending themselves to use as 
countercyclical policy instruments. In their 
literature review, Erten, Korinek and Oc-
ampo (2021) show that different methods 
for measuring fi  nancial fl  ows are a key rea-
son why empirical studies arrive at differing 
results.
A large number of studies have so far fo-
cused on emerging market economies. This 
analysis looks at whether foreign capital 
controls reduce cross- border fi  nancial trans-
actions between Germany and its partner 
countries. It explicitly does not set out to 
assess whether or not the measures imple-
mented were effective. The study uses dec-
larations from the German balance of pay-
ments statistics for the period from January 
1999 to December 2017. The transactions are available at a monthly frequency, but for 
most parts of the analysis they are aggre-
gated to annual values because the meas-
ures for capital controls only vary over the 
years. The data permit a much more de-
tailed analysis than studies using macro-
data, which have so far dominated the rele-
vant literature.
The balance of payments data are aug-
mented by information on capital controls. 
To this end, this analysis uses the database 
of Fernández et al. (2016). The authors gen-
erate binary variables of the IMF’s Annual 
Report on Exchange Arrangements and Ex-
change Restrictions (AREAER) for a total of 
99 countries to form aggregate indices. In 
doing so, they concentrate on the AREAER’s 
capital account category and thus on direct 
effects on fi  nancial fl  ows. This approach re-
sembles that of Chinn and Ito (2008),2 but 
unlike them, Fernández et al. (2016) defi  ne 
separate measures for infl  ows and out-
fl  ows, broken down into ten different asset 
categories.
The fi  rst question addressed is whether cap-
ital controls in general reduce Germany’s 
cross- border fi  nancial fl  ows. To this end, the 
empirical study uses a panel setting with 
multiple fi  xed effects:
* This analysis is based on a research paper by Gold-
bach and Nitsch (2020).
1 See IMF (2012) and OECD (2015).
2 The measure applied by Chinn and Ito (2008) is used 
very frequently in the empirical literature. However, the 
measure only provides indications for total fi  nancial 
fl  ows and thus is not broken down into infl  ows and 
outfl  ows or into different asset categories. Further-
more, the measure is based on a broader approach: all 
four of the overarching AREAER categories (FX Re-
gime, Export Proceeds, Capital Account and Current 
Account) are used. This index therefore also takes into 
account indirect effects on fi  nancial fl  ows which are 
attributable to export restrictions, for example.Deutsche Bundesbank

fect. The negative impact on cross- border 
fi  nancial fl  ows is thus attributable to strict 
and long- term capital controls.
The microdata can be used to examine fur-
ther mechanisms. For example, the effect of 
capital controls on market entries (“exten-
sive margin”) and on the change in existing 
business relationships (“intensive margin”) 
can be assessed independently of one an-
other. To do so, total German fi  nancial 
fl  ows with a given partner country are de-
composed into multiple elements, such as 
the number of declarants or the average 
volume of an ongoing entry (at the 
declarant- asset- month level).The above table presents the estimation re-
sults. As before, the β coeffi   cient is nega-
tive. Capital controls thus appear to have an 
effect on both the extensive (number) and 
intensive (average value) margin of bilateral 
fi  nancial relationships. However, roughly 
half of the coeffi   cients are statistically insig-
nifi  cant. The strongest effect occurs for in-
fl  ows to Germany. Other control variables 
generally do not affect the results.
In a fi  nal step, the effects of temporary cap-
ital controls within the European Union are 
studied. Starting in spring 2010, market 
participants increasingly began to have 
doubts about the solvency of the Greek 
government. This mounting nervousness 
was also felt by Cyprus, which had close Extensive and intensive marginº

economic and fi  nancial ties to Greece. Con-
cerned about the stability of its domestic 
banking sector, Cyprus implemented capital 
controls in March 2013, which remained in 
place until April 2015. The measures in-
cluded a restriction on transferring money 
abroad. Greece imposed capital controls it-
self in June 2015, which were lifted in 
stages up until September 2019.
The previous approach is modifi  ed as fol-
lows: the study uses monthly data and con-
structs a balanced panel for European 
Union countries. A binary variable takes the 
value of one for Greece and Cyprus if cap-
ital controls are implemented in the re-
spective country at the time. Control vari-
ables are the real effective exchange rate, 
infl  ation, reserve assets, long- term govern-
ment bond yields and the stock market re-
turn.
The above table illustrates the estimation 
results. The previous results are confi  rmed. Capital controls within the European Union 
also reduce Germany’s cross- border fi  nan-
cial fl  ows. Since the capital controls were 
introduced in Greece and Cyprus during 
turbulent times, the control variables serve 
as further important factors. The estimated 
effect even becomes stronger as soon as 
these variables are taken into account in 
the regressions.
The aim of this study was to examine 
whether foreign capital controls reduce 
Germany’s bilateral fi  nancial fl  ows. The re-
sults support this thesis. Long- term meas-
ures, in particular, explain this relationship. 
In addition, capital controls introduced 
abroad reduce market entries by domestic 
players – which is to say, the establishment 
of fi  nancial relationships with foreign par-
ticipants – (or lead to market exits) as well 
as transactions in existing business relation-
ships. It was also demonstrated that capital 
controls within the European Union have 
this effect as well.Effect of capital controls within the European Union on Germany’s cross-border

Foreign bonds were likewise in demand (€68½ 
billion). Compared with the previous year, how -
ever, investors shifted their focus from foreign 
currency bonds to instruments denominated in 
euro – despite the appreciation of other key 
currencies against the euro. These euro-  
denominated instruments made up over two-  
thirds of German net purchases. Among the 
public sector bonds denominated in euro, Ital -
ian government debt securities were particu -
larly sought after, followed by instruments is -
sued by Austria or the European Union. The lat -
ter instruments included the EU’s new issues to 
fund the European unemployment insurance 
programme (Support to mitigate Unemploy -
ment Risks in an Emergency – SURE) and the 
European Recovery and Resilience Facility 
(NextGenerationEU – NGEU).
German investors’ purchases of foreign cur -
rency bonds (€23½ billion) were spread across 
multiple countries, with issuance from the 
United States and the United Kingdom being 
the most significant. By contrast, domestic in -
vestors offloaded money market instruments 
issued  abroad on balance (€6½ billion).
The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU 
left its mark on German portfolio investment in 
2021 as well. The country finally left the Euro -
pean single market at the start of the year. The 
free trade agreement between the United King -
dom and the EU largely excludes financial ser -
vices. In order to retain access to European 
financial markets, banks with an international 
focus have moved parts of their business out of 
the United Kingdom over the last few years to 
existing or newly established subsidiaries in 
Germany and other EU countries. This primarily 
relates to investment banking. This led, in par -
ticular, to a strong rise in the purchases and 
sales of foreign securities by financial institu -
tions located here. Thus, transaction volumes 
virtually doubled from 2020 to 2021. That said, 
this increase in gross flows was not reflected in 
the aforementioned net portfolio investment 
figures for Germany, as the German branches 
of international commercial banks frequently function merely as a hub for international trans -
actions and German institutions, too, have pri -
marily repatriated their trading activities.
In 2021, foreign investors sold securities issued 
in Germany to the tune of €33½ billion on bal -
ance. In 2020, they had still been adding large 
volumes of domestic paper to their portfolios 
(€149 billion). The acquisition of structured 
debt securities from German issuers had played 
a major role at the time.7 This effect was much 
less significant in the year under review.
On the whole, foreign investors scaled back 
their holdings of German long- term debt secur -
ities in particular (€52 billion), with their sales 
of public sector bonds alone amounting to 
€75½ billion net. The Bundesbank’s purchases 
under the APP and the PEPP had an impact in 
this regard. By contrast, non- resident investors 
added private bonds issued in Germany to their 
portfolios on balance (€23 billion), stocking up 
on corporate bonds and divesting themselves 
of bank bonds. They also parted with German 
shares (€3½ billion) and mutual fund shares 
(€3 billion).
This development is consistent with the picture 
that German equity indices have underper -
formed against the indices of other advanced 
economies and that the euro has depreciated 
against key currencies. However, non- residents 
parked more liquidity in domestic money mar -
ket instruments (€25 billion), of which around 
two- fifths were the structured securities men -
tioned earlier. The fact that the Federal govern -
ment issued a large volume of short- dated 
bonds also became noticeable in the first quar -
ter.

2021, a clear decline from the year before 
(€96½ billion). The main reason behind this de -
crease was fewer compensatory intra- group 
transactions in the form of over- the- counter 
options for the aforementioned transactions in 
structured debt securities. Nevertheless, they 
still account for just under half of the total bal -
ance of derivatives. On balance, a small volume 
of funds was invested in options and forward 
contracts. Cross- border forward and futures 
contracts relating to electricity and gas re -
corded net capital imports, whereas they had 
still registered net capital exports in 2020.
Direct investment
Despite the persistently challenging environ -
ment caused by the coronavirus pandemic, 
global direct investment flows rebounded in 
2021 after having declined considerably in 
2020. The United Nations Conference on Trade 
and Development estimates that global direct 
investment flows rose by 77% on the year in 
2021 and were thus higher than before the 
outbreak of the pandemic.8 The observed re -
covery varied considerably not only across re -
gions but also across different sectors and 
types of cross- border direct investment. For ex -
ample, greenfield investment activity remained 
much lower on average across all industrial sec -
tors than prior to the pandemic. By contrast, 
there were higher flows of cross- border fund -
ing for infrastructure in many economic sectors 
through project financing. Mergers and acqui -
sitions also picked up significantly, especially in 
the services sector. All in all, direct investment 
flows to advanced economies rose much more 
strongly than those to developing countries. A 
higher number of cross- border mergers and ac -
quisitions were also carried out in advanced 
economies than in other countries.
German enterprises were no exception in this 
regard. Compared with the preceding year, Intra- group 
transactions still

capital exports

they stepped up their cross- border exposures 
considerably in 2021 through direct invest -
ment. Conversely, non- resident enterprises like -
wise boosted their direct investment in Ger -
many, albeit to a lesser extent than in 2020. 
Overall, the second year of the pandemic pre -
sented German enterprises with an inter -
national focus with major challenges, how -
ever.9 In addition to the adverse effects of the 
coronavirus pandemic, geopolitical tensions 
also caused difficulties for enterprises operating 
abroad. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the 
United Kingdom finally exited the European 
single market on 1 January 2021, resulting in a 
new playing field for cross- border investment. 
Business activities had already been relocated 
– to Germany in some cases – in the run- up to 
the UK’s withdrawal.
Looking at direct investment by German invest -
ors, 2021 saw, on balance, net capital exports 
of €102 billion – a record high when con -
sidered over the long term. This was in contrast 
to 2020, which had seen modest net capital 
imports.
German enterprises invested €163½ billion 
abroad in 2021, around €44 billion more than 
in 2020. Once again, they strongly expanded 
their equity investments in foreign affiliates in 
particular (€113 billion). Similarly sized portions 
of these funds were for equity capital in the 
narrower sense and reinvested earnings. Com -
paratively high cross- border transaction values 
were recorded for enterprises specialised in 
providing professional and technical services.10 
Last year, too, cross- border corporate take -
overs by enterprises domiciled in Germany 
played a significant role in terms of volume.11
Enterprises domiciled in Germany issued €50½ 
billion in intra- group credit to foreign affiliated 
enterprises in 2021, significantly more than in 
2020 (€29½ billion), predominantly in the form 
of loans. These loans were issued to subsidiar -
ies and affiliates abroad. Subsidiaries domiciled 
in Germany also made large amounts of funds 
available to their foreign parent enterprises.German enterprises engage in direct invest -
ment in many countries all over the globe. In

10 The data refer only to decipherable net transfers used to 
augment equity capital.
11 According to Refinitiv (Thomson ONE) data, in 2021 
roughly €50½ billion was used to finance takeovers of 
companies domiciled abroad and previously under foreign 
ownership where the German stake after the transaction is 
at least 10%. This was somewhat less than in 2020, when 
the takeover value was given as €58½ billion. The time at 
which mergers and acquisitions are captured in the balance 
of payments can, however, differ from that recorded by Re -
finitiv, meaning that the reported figures are not directly

investments in 2021 were in partner countries 
in Europe. Just over a third of all German direct 
investment was thus made in other euro area 
countries. Within the euro area, particularly 
large amounts flowed into Luxembourg and 
the Netherlands, both significant holding com -
pany locations. Outside the euro area but still 
within Europe, comparatively high amounts 
were made available to affiliated enterprises in 
Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Outside 
Europe, the United States was the recipient of 
considerable German investment.
Foreign enterprises provided domestic enter -
prises with direct investment funds totalling 
€62 billion in 2021. This was about half the 
amount of funds provided to affiliated enter -
prises in 2020 in net terms, a year in which the 
inflow of capital was fairly large even in com -
parison to previous years. Foreign firms boosted 
the equity capital they provided to German 
branches by €37 billion. Moreover, they also 
made €25 billion in loans available to affiliated 
enterprises domiciled in Germany, largely via 
trade credits.
Direct investment by firms from the United 
Kingdom was especially high (€23 billion). This 
was dominated by intra- group lending, which 
has been noticeably gaining importance over 
the last few years, not least because of reloca -
tion of business activities to Germany. Enter -
prises in Germany received a combined €35½ 
billion from euro area countries in 2021. The 
majority of these funds were also distributed 
via intra- group lending.
Other investment
Other investment, comprising loans and trade 
credits (where these do not constitute direct in -
vestment) as well as bank deposits and other 
assets, saw net capital imports of €135 billion 
in 2021. In 2020, other investment gave rise to 
net capital exports of €81 billion. The balance 
of other investment often sees high volatility – including changes in sign – but the reversal of 
trend in 2021 was particularly large.
This was largely due to considerable net in -
flows reported via the banking system. The 
Bundesbank’s liabilities to non- residents arising 
from currency and deposits increased by €196 
billion in 2021. For the most part, the increase 
in foreign liabilities was driven by a rise in 
deposits  of non- euro area residents at the 
Bundes bank. This includes the balances of for -
eign central banks, monetary authorities, inter -
national organisations and commercial banks. 
These deposits often show a clear temporary 
rise at the end of a given year – as was the case 
in 2021.12 The Bundesbank’s liabilities arising 
from the allocation of euro banknotes within 
the Euro system went up by €36½ billion last 
year. Above and beyond that, the counterpart 
of special drawing rights allocated by the IMF 
recorded as a liability also rose strongly (see the 
reserve assets section on pp. 55f. for further in -
formation).
The Bundesbank’s gross claims on non-  
residents also increased (by €123½ billion) in 
2021. These primarily reflected the Bundes -
bank’s higher TARGET2 claims on the ECB 
(€124½ billion). Their recent increase mirrored 
increased asset purchases as part of the APP 
and PEPP . The close relationship between the 
development of the Bundesbank’s TARGET2 
claims and asset purchases by Eurosystem cen -
tral banks had already been observed in previ -
ous years.13 In 2021, the corresponding rise in 
German TARGET2 claims was, however, com -
paratively small. This was down to the counter -
vailing effects of the financing and outpayment 
flows resulting from the European support pro -
grammes NGEU and SURE.14 On balance, the 
transaction- related increase in liabilities was 
€103½ billion larger than the increase in the 
Bundesbank’s claims on non- residents in 2021.Inflows of

Transactions via the accounts of other monet -
ary financial institutions (MFIs) also saw net in -
flows of capital into Germany in 2021. These 
amounted to €46½ billion net. This was pri -
marily down to higher deposits by foreign insti -
tutions, particularly group- affiliated banks. 
Additionally, deposits by foreign enterprises 
and households with domestic MFIs also rose 
on a smaller scale. In lending business, MFIs 
domiciled in Germany (excluding the Bundes -
bank) increased their deposits with foreign in -
stitutions. Above and beyond that, they issued 
more funds to foreign borrowers. On balance, 
their loan claims on foreign banks rose, primar -
ily vis- à- vis group- affiliated banks, more 
strongly than their claims on enterprises or 
households abroad.
Other investment by non- banks led to net out -
flows of funds abroad. At €15 billion, net cap -
ital exports in 2021 were nevertheless much 
lower than in 2020 (€61½ billion). In this con -
text, enterprises’ and households’ transactions 
produced net capital exports of €18½ billion. 
They issued loans to foreign business partners 
and again increased their deposits at foreign 
commercial banks. As with financial derivatives, 
this reflected (to an extent) counterpart entries 
to their transactions involving structured secur -
ities issued in Germany. Unlike in 2020, their 
liabil ities to non- residents also rose steeply as 
they took out more loans –  especially short-  
term loans – from overseas. By contrast, trans -
actions by general government gave rise to net 
capital imports of around €4 billion.
Reserve assets
The Bundesbank’s reserve assets rose by €32 
billion in 2021 on account of transactions. Of 
this, €31 billion was accounted for by its share 
of new special drawing rights allocated by the 
IMF,15 which, in August 2021, had decided 
upon and implemented a large allocation of 
special drawing rights to its member coun -
tries.16 Special drawing rights simultaneously 
constitute a liability and an asset on the Bun -desbank’s balance sheet. On the one hand, 
they are recognised as reserve assets in the 
Bundesbank’s external position. On the other, 
an equal counterpart entry is made on the li -
abilities side as an adjustment item for special 
drawing rights. The allocated special drawing 
rights thus do not change a country’s net ex -
ternal position and instead create a balance 
sheet extension.

fluenced by balance sheet adjustments which, Other MFIs also

Eurosystem and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  1 Figures are daily averages
for the reserve maintenance period ending in the month indicated. Following the
changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the

allocated to the ECB on a monthly basis. The counterpart of this adjustment is shown
under “Other factors”. The remaining 92% of the value of the euro banknotes in
circulation is allocated, likewise on a monthly basis, to the NCBs, with each NCB
showing in its balance sheet the share of the euro banknotes issued corresponding to
its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-
system and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  7 Equal to the difference bet-

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the
currency concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's
price competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective
exchange rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitive-
ness. The weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more
detailed information on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the
Deutsche Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1  The
calculations are based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral
exchange rates of the euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following countries: Australia,
Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan,
Norway, Poland, Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United
Kingdom and the United States. Where current price and wage indices were not avai-lable, estimates were used.  2 ECB calculations. Includes countries belonging to the
