Economic conditions
Underlying trends
In the second quarter of 2016, the German 
economy will probably post a significantly 
slower pace of growth than at the beginning 
of the year. A number of factors indicate this. 
The favourable weather effects from the final 
quarter of last year and the first quarter of this 
year have run their course, meaning the con -
struction sector in particular is lacking stimulus. 
Moreover, after rising sharply in the first quar -
ter, industrial output is likely to take a brief 
pause. Industrial orders have not quite kept up 
with production, and even fell of late. The vola -
tile development of German economic growth 
expected in the first half of this year masks the 
economy’s continuing and fairly robust under -
lying cyclical trend. The positive sentiment indi -
cated by surveys of both firms and households 
suggests that economic growth is likely to re -
gain momentum in the second half of the year 
following a weak second quarter.
Industry
German industrial output advanced clearly by a 
seasonally adjusted 1% in April compared with 
the relatively weak figure for March, and at the 
beginning of the second quarter it matched the 
average level of the first quarter as a result. 
Production volumes were rather heteroge -
neous across the individual categories of 
goods. Whereas the output of consumer goods 
saw no appreciable change compared with the 
first quarter, the changes in the production vol -
umes of intermediate (-¾%) and capital goods 
(+¾%) largely balanced each other out. The 
substantial growth rates in automotive manu -
facturing were particularly noticeable. As a re -
sult, the automotive sector was able to con -
tinue the already strong upward movement 
seen in the previous quarter.Industrial orders received in April showed a 
substantial seasonally adjusted decrease (-2%) 
compared with March, the March figure having 
been markedly revised upwards. The volume of 
incoming orders was therefore down slightly 
(-½%) on the first quarter of 2016. Looking at 
the individual sectors of the economy, only 
intermediate goods producers posted an in -
crease in orders (+4½%). By contrast, the order 
books of producers of capital goods (-3½%) 
and consumer goods (-2%) saw sharp declines. 
Heterogeneity was pronounced in regional 
terms, too. Growth in orders from Germany 
was robust (+1¾%), whereas orders from 
abroad fell sharply (-2¼%). Excluding foreign 
orders for other transport equipment, which in 
April were a good two-fifths up on the average 
of the first quarter, orders received from both 
the euro area (-2¾%) and non-euro-area coun -
tries (-5%) fell substantially.
Industrial sales in April rose markedly by ¾% 
on the month after seasonal adjustment. How -
ever, the figure for April only reached the level 
for the first quarter of 2016. A marked decline 
was recorded in domestic sales (-1%), whereas 
foreign sales went up by almost the same ex -
tent (+1%). Growth in export sales was primar -
ily attributable to non-euro-area countries, with 
producers of capital goods benefiting in par -
ticular. Nominal exports of goods in April re -
mained largely unchanged on the month. 
However, given the sharp increases in the pre -
vious two months, the average of the first 
quarter of 2016 was nonetheless exceeded 
quite considerably (+1¾%). The decline in ex -
port prices meant that the increase was even 
slightly greater in real terms (+2%). Nominal 
imports of goods were down marginally on the 
month (-¼%). The average of the last three 
months was undershot by a far greater extent 
(-1¾%). The decrease was at much the same 
level when calculated in real terms.Sluggish

Construction
Seasonally adjusted construction output in 
April posted a steep 1¾% decline on the 
month, the figure for March having been re -
vised slightly upwards. Output in April also fell 
significantly (-3%) below the average of the 
previous quarter, which saw a very sharp rise. 
The decrease was attributable to the main con -
struction sector, which suffered particularly 
severe  losses (-5½%). This was due in part to 
the fact that the extremely mild weather condi -
tions had temporarily led to higher output, not -
ably in February, and that these stimuli are no 
longer being generated in the second quarter. 
Output in the finishing trades, which main -
tained the previous quarter’s level, cushioned 
the downturn somewhat. Despite the severe 
decline in activity in the main construction sec -
tor at the beginning of the second quarter, 
construction activity in Germany is still robust. 
This is borne out by orders received by the 
main construction sector, which showed a sub -
stantial quarter-on-quarter increase of 6½% in 
the first quarter of 2016 (data are available up 
to then). In the first three months of this year, 
building permits measured in terms of the esti -
mated costs of work likewise rose very steeply 
on the quarter (+12¼%).
Labour market
There was a further steep rise in employment in 
April, too. The seasonally adjusted number of 
persons in work in Germany climbed by 41,000 
compared with March, with the year-on-year 
increase amounting to 544,000 persons, or 
1.3%. For quite some time now, employment 
growth has been driven by an expansion in the 
number of employees subject to social security 
contributions. In March, this figure was 
681,000, or 2.2%, up on the same month one 
year earlier. According to both the Ifo employ -
ment barometer and the labour market barom -
eter of the Institute for Employment Research 
(IAB), enterprises’ willingness to recruit new 
staff remains high. The Federal Employment Construction 
output well below positive, weather-related level of winter months

Agency’s BA-X labour market index even rose 
quite considerably again in May from its al -
ready high level.
In May, the seasonally adjusted figure for regis -
tered unemployment fell significantly on the 
month, as it had in April. As this report went 
to press, 2.70 million persons were registered 
with the Federal Employment Agency as un -
employed. The unemployment rate went down 
by 0.1 percentage point to 6.1%. Compared 
with the same month one year earlier, there 
were 98,000 fewer persons out of work and 
the unemployment rate was 0.3 percentage 
point lower. Total underemployment (excluding 
short-time work) as recorded by the Federal 
Labour  Agency was up of late, however, as the 
scope of labour market policy measures was 
expanded. This was partly the result of the 
growing use of instruments to get refugees 
into work who would otherwise be registered 
as unemployed. The most recent results of the 
IAB labour market barometer to the effect that 
registered unemployment could edge upwards 
over the next few months are probably also 
linked to the growing number of refugees 
entering the job market.
Prices
Crude oil prices continued on their upward tra -
jectory in May after a brief pause at the begin -
ning of the month. Average prices were just 
less than 11% higher than in April, but were still 
just over 25% lower than in May 2015. In the 
first half of June, prices rose somewhat on the 
month. As this report went to press, the price 
of a barrel of Brent crude oil stood at US$48.3. 
The premium on crude oil futures was US$2.0 
for deliveries six months ahead and US$3.3 for 
deliveries 12 months ahead.
Import and producer prices in April were largely 
unchanged compared with the previous month. 
Energy prices were higher as a result of crude 
oil price hikes. However, this was more or less 
offset by the muted price trend for other goods in the case both of imports and of producer 
prices, even though the decline in prices for 
other imported goods was weaker of late than 
in previous months. The year-on-year price de -
cline widened to 6.6% in the case of imports. 
As for industrial producer prices, the negative 
year-on-year gap remained at 3.1%.
Consumer prices rose by a seasonally adjusted 
0.2% in May. This was mainly due to higher 
energy prices as a result of further crude oil 
price hikes. By contrast, food prices dropped as 
a result, above all, of tumbling dairy product 
prices. Excluding the marked rise in the prices 
of tobacco goods, price increases for industrial 
goods excluding energy were on the weak 
side. The same is true of services including 
rents. The national Consumer Price Index (CPI) 
edged up 0.1% on the year, while the Harmon -
ised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) changed 
by 0.0%. Both indexes had been in slightly 
negative territory (-0.1% and -0.3% respect -
ively) in April. Going by current financial market 
expectations of oil price developments, the rate 
of increase is likely to gain pace slowly in the 
months ahead.
Public finances1
Public long- term  
care insurance scheme
In the first quarter of 2016, the public long-  
term care insurance scheme recorded a bal -
anced budget in the core area. Receipts equiva -
lent to one- tenth of a percentage point of the 
contribution rate were transferred, as planned, 
to the Long- term care provident fund, which 
was thus topped up by just under €½ billion. 
This constituted a marked year- on- year finan -
cial deterioration. Total receipts –  as well as Widening of

Deterioration

1 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Reports (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
the development of public finances during the preceding 
quarter. For detailed data on budgetary developments and 
public debt, see the statistical section of this report.Deutsche Bundesbank

employee contributions – saw significant year- 
on- year growth of 5% owing to favourable 
employment and wage developments.2 How -
ever, the rise in total expenditure was distinctly 
stronger, at 10%. Just over two- thirds of this 
expenditure growth stems from an increase in 
non- financial benefits. The latter still largely re -
flects the benefit increases enacted by the 2015 
Act to Strengthen Long- term Care; their full im -
pact on expenditure is likely to have unfolded 
only after a certain time lag. Furthermore, the 
transfer to the Long- term care provident fund 
was even lower in the same quarter of the pre -
vious year.3
A surplus – albeit reduced – is expected in the 
core area for the year as a whole. With contri -
bution receipts remaining robust, increases in 
expenditure are likely to tail off markedly. In 
parallel with this, the Long- term care provident 
fund will be further topped up by a total of just 
over €1 billion, as planned (thus reporting a 
corresponding surplus). As of 2034, the deple -tion of the reserves accumulated in the fund 
should curb the expected increases in the con -
tribution rate.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €118.7 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in April 2016 was up slightly on 
the previous month’s figure (€114.0 billion). 
However, after deducting redemptions and 
taking   account of changes in issuers’ holdings 
of their own debt securities, the outstanding 
volume of domestic debt securities fell by €3.5 
billion. Foreign debt securities worth €15.3 bil -
lion were placed in the German bond market 
during the reporting month, which meant that 
the outstanding volume of debt instruments in 
the German market increased by €11.8 billion 
overall.
In April, the public sector redeemed debt secur -
ities worth €12.7 billion net. On balance, this 
was attributable almost exclusively to central 
government, including the resolution agency 
which is classified as part of it (€12.0 billion). 
Predominantly five- year Federal notes (Bobls) 
and ten- year Federal bonds (Bunds) were re -
deemed in net terms (€13.6 billion and €7.5 bil -
lion respectively). This contrasted with net issu -
ance of two- year Federal Treasury notes 
(Schätze ) worth €4.5 billion, 30-year bonds 
worth €2.1 billion and Treasury discount paper 
(Bubills) worth €1.7 billion. State governments 
redeemed bonds to the value of €0.7 billion in 
net terms.
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
issued bonds worth €2.0 billion net, compared 
with €4.5 billion in the previous month. On bal -Surplus expected

ance, these were almost exclusively bonds with 
maturities of more than one year. Non- financial 
corporations were issuers (€2.4 billion), while 
non- bank financial enterprises redeemed bonds 
in net terms.
Domestic credit institutions issued bonds total -
ling €7.2 billion net in April. Above all, debt 
securities  issued by specialised credit institu -
tions (€6.6 billion) and other bank debt secur -
ities which can be structured flexibly (€1.5 bil -
lion) were placed in the market, as were, to a 
lesser extent, mortgage Pfandbriefe (€0.6 bil -
lion). By contrast, the outstanding volume of 
public Pfandbriefe declined by €1.4 billion.
Domestic non-  banks, including insurers and 
invest ment firms, and the Deutsche Bundes -
bank were the primary buyers of debt securities 
in April. The former bought bonds worth €23.7 
billion net, with interest focused on foreign 
paper. The Bundesbank acquired debt secur -
ities worth €15.8 billion net under the Eurosys -
tem’s asset purchase programmes; this involved 
almost exclusively domestic paper issued by the 
public sector. This contrasted with net sales on 
the part of foreign investors totalling €22.6 bil -
lion. Domestic credit institutions, too, offloaded 
interest- bearing paper worth €5.1 billion net.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed only small quantities of new shares in 
the German equity market. The volume of for -
eign equities in the German market fell by €1.1 
billion over the same period. Domestic non-  
banks were the sole purchasers, adding a net 
€1.2 billion worth of equities to their portfolios, 
all of which were foreign shares on balance. 
However, non- resident investors offloaded do -
mestic shares with a net value of €1.7 billion. 
German credit institutions also reduced their 
share portfolios (by €0.6 billion overall).Mutual funds
In April, domestic mutual funds recorded in -
flows of €6.7 billion net. Specialised funds re -
served for institutional investors benefited from 
this in particular (€5.0 billion). Among the asset 
classes, bond funds (€2.1 billion), funds of 
funds (€1.5 billion), mixed securities funds (€1.5 
billion) and open- end real estate funds (€1.4 
billion) were able to sell the highest volume of 
new shares. By contrast, money market funds 
redeemed their own shares (€0.5 billion). The 
outstanding volume of foreign funds distrib -
uted in Germany increased by €6.2 billion dur -
ing the reporting month. In April, mutual fund 
shares were purchased mainly by domestic 
non- banks (€13.8 billion), as well as by resident 
credit institutions (€0.7 billion). By contrast, for -
eign investors sold German mutual fund shares 
worth €1.6 billion in net terms.Rise in credit

Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €28.8 billion in April 2016. This is €1.1 billion 
down on the figure posted one month earlier 
as surpluses dipped slightly in both the goods 
account and the invisible current transactions 
item, the latter comprising services as well as 
primary and secondary income.
The surplus in the April goods account shrank 
by €0.5 billion on the month to stand at €27.8 
billion because goods exports fell more strongly 
than goods imports.
April saw the surplus on invisible current trans -
actions come in at €1.0 billion, €0.6 billion 
short of the March figure. This decline came as 
net receipts in the primary income balance fell 
by €3.9 billion to €3.5 billion, largely on the 
back of higher dividend payouts to foreign in -
vestors, which improvements in the other two 
sub- accounts failed to offset. The deficit in the 
services sub- account was €1.3 billion narrower 
at €0.8 billion, with the decline in travel ex -
penditure, which had risen sharply one month 
earlier, playing a notable role in this regard. The 
secondary income deficit stood at €1.7 billion, 
its €1.9 billion decline being driven primarily by 
an upturn in government revenue from current 
taxes on income and wealth as well as a fall in 
government expenditure, notably on account 
of lower payments to the EU budget.
Market players’ expectations over the future 
path of monetary policy in the major currency 
areas continued to have a bearing on develop -
ments in international financial markets in April. 
This was the backdrop against which Germa -
ny’s cross- border portfolio investment ran up 
net capital exports of €46.3 billion. Resident 
investors continued to accumulate large quan -
tities of foreign paper (€20.4 billion), some of 
which promised higher yields than their domes -
tic counterparts. They displayed particularly 
strong demand for foreign bonds (€14.2 bil -
lion) and investment fund shares (€6.2 billion), 
and offloaded €1.1 billion in foreign equities. Current account

Investor activity in the other direction saw non- 
residents shed €25.9 billion worth of domestic 
securities, mainly public sector bonds (€29.2 
billion). The Bundesbank once again acquired a 
sizeable volume of German bonds from non-  
residents as part of the expanded asset pur -
chase programme (EAPP). On a lesser scale, 
foreign investors also pulled out of equities 
(€1.7 billion) and investment fund shares (€1.6 
billion) issued by residents, instead adding 
more private debt securities issued in Germany 
(€1.2 billion) as well as a notable volume of 
money market paper (€5.5 billion) to their port -
folios.
April saw direct investment yield net capital im -
ports of €2.3 billion. Foreign enterprises in -
jected €5.3 billion into their German affiliates 
by stepping up both their intra- group loans 
(€3.5 billion) and their equity stakes (€1.7 bil -
lion). German enterprises, meanwhile, supplied 
their affiliates abroad with funds to the tune of 
€3.0 billion, primarily by increasing their equity interests, and pared back their intra- group 
loans to non- resident group entities.
Other statistically recorded investment, com -
prising loans and trade credits (where these do 
not constitute direct investment) as well as 
bank deposits and other investments, saw net 
capital imports of €4.5 billion in April. Monet -
ary financial institutions (excluding the Bundes -
bank) accounted for the bulk of this figure 
(€27.9 billion), having seen a sharp increase in 
deposits by non- residents. General govern -
ment, too, attracted net inflows of funds from 
abroad (€3.2 billion), while cross- border cor -
porate and household activity in April yielded 
net capital exports of €14.6 billion. Transac -
tions sent the Bundesbank’s unsecuritised net 
external position €11.9 billion higher; on bal -
ance, this was solely due to higher claims from 
the TARGET2 payment system.

Outlook for the German economy – 
macroeconomic  projections  
for 2016 and 2017 and an outlook for 2018
The German economy’s underlying cyclical trend is fairly robust. Its main driver is buoyant domes -
tic demand, which is being bolstered by the favourable situation in the labour market and by 
rising household income. This year, domestic demand is being additionally boosted by purchasing 
power gains resulting from renewed falls in crude oil prices and from an expansionary fiscal 
policy  . Foreign business, by contrast, is receiving only weak stimuli on account of the sluggish 
growth in world trade. In the coming years, however, it is likely that it will gain more traction and 
compensate for domestic demand, growth of which is expected to tail off somewhat.
Overall, the German economy could grow by 1.7% in 2016, 1.4% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018. Here, 
calendar effects mask the rather uniform growth rates in working- day- adjusted terms of 1.6% in 
both 2016 and 2017 and 1.7% in 2018. The expected growth rates are therefore higher than the 
estimated increase in potential output, which has been raised slightly as a result of the higher 
labour- market- oriented migration that is now expected. Aggregate capacity utilisation at the end 
of the projection horizon is therefore likely to be significantly higher than the long- term average. 
The attendant increase in labour market bottlenecks and the resulting higher wage growth will 
continue to be mitigated by high levels of migration, particularly this year and in 2017. In terms 
of public finances, the previously attained sizeable surplus is likely to be largely depleted in 2016 
and only just remain in positive territory for the remainder of the time horizon.
Against this background, consumer price inflation is likely to increase considerably. The dampen -
ing effect of the renewed fall in the prices of crude oil and other commodities at the start of 2016 
should largely vanish as of 2017, which means that the robust growth in domestic wage costs is 
likely to once again manifest itself more visibly in consumer price inflation. As measured by the 
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), inflation could rise from 0.2% this year to 1.5% next 
year and 1.7% in 2018. Excluding energy, HICP inflation is expected to climb from 1.0% in 2016 
to 1.8% in 2018.
Compared with the projection from December 2015, expectations for economic growth in 2016 
and 2017 have been slightly lowered, while inflation projections have been brought down signifi -
cantly. The revision of expected price developments was attributable in part to lower than 
expected core inflation, but above all to the unexpected renewed fall in crude oil prices. Fluctu -
ations in these prices continue to present a risk, particularly to the inflation forecast, but on the 
whole appear balanced, as do the risks to economic growth. However, there is a downside risk 
for the price projection if wage growth were to falter or if higher labour costs were not passed 
on to consumers to the extent assumed here.Deutsche Bundesbank

Economic outlook1
The German economy grew strongly in the 
period spanning the fourth quarter of 2015 and 
the first quarter of 2016. Real gross domestic 
product (GDP) rose by 0.9% in seasonally and 
calendar- adjusted terms, and thus slightly more 
strongly than expected in the December pro -
jection.2 This was chiefly attributable to the 
particularly high growth in the first quarter of 
2016, which was boosted by special factors. 
For example, the industrial  sector expanded its 
production un expectedly strongly following the 
subdued second half of 2015, while the con -
struction sector was the main beneficiary of the 
mild weather. A countermovement of sorts 
may therefore be expected in the second quar -
ter. The current expectation indicators and new 
orders in the manufacturing industry are indi -
cating a flatter underlying upward trajectory in 
this area. Lastly, the beneficial effects of the 
favourable  weather conditions in the construc -
tion sector will not carry over.
The current volatility of economic growth in 
Germany, which is attributable to special fac -
tors, masks a rather strong underlying ten -
dency, which, in light of the overall favourable 
conditions (see the box on pages 18 to 21), is 
likely to continue through to the end of the 
projection period. Domestic economic activity 
looks set to continue to benefit from strong 
employment growth, which is being driven to a 
considerable extent by employment- related 
migra tion from European Union countries, and 
from robust income growth. This is expected to 
have an impact on private consumption and 
housing construction. In the current year, do -
mestic demand is additionally being supported 
by the renewed fall in the price of crude oil and 
the attendant purchasing power gains. Further -
more, fiscal policy will have been particularly 
expansionary in 2016 thanks in no small part to 
additional government expenditure in connec -
tion with refugee migration. Foreign business, 
by contrast, is likely to receive only limited stim -
uli in the current year, as world trade is grow -
ing at only a subdued rate. In annual average terms, an impact is also being felt on account  
of German exporters having had to surrender 
some of their considerable previous gains in 
market share in the second half of 2015, a de -
velopment likely to continue somewhat in 
2016. Over the next two years, exports are 
expected  to again grow more in line with sales 
markets and thus compensate for a slight drop 
in the momentum of domestic demand growth.
Growth in calendar- adjusted real GDP could 
therefore increase to 1.6% in 2016 and 2017, 
possibly followed by an additional marginal rise 
in 2018. However, due to variations in the 
number of working days from one year to the 
next, the unadjusted annual average growth 
rates reveal a slightly different picture over the 
time horizon, with growth rates of 1.7% for 
2016, 1.4% for 2017 and 1.6% for 2018 (see 
the table on page  15). Thus, for 2016, GDP 
growth is expected to be slightly lower than 
assumed in the December projection, with the 
boost from lower oil prices being counteracted 
by the less favourable prospects for exports. 
The expectations for 2017 have been revised 
downwards by 0.3 percentage point, above all 
because  the international environment is now 
assumed to be somewhat less favourable over 
the entire projection horizon (for more infor -
mation on the revisions since the Decem  ber 
projection, see the table on page 25).
According to this projection, the German econ -
omy is consistently expanding at a faster rate 
than production capacity. The utilisation rate, 
which is already above average this year, is 
therefore continuing to rise, with the result 
that capacity utilisation at the end of the pro -
jection horizon will be significantly higher than 
the long- term average. Potential growth – at 
1.4% in both 2016 and 2017 and marginally 
less in 2018 – is once again estimated to be Strong growth

somewhat higher than of late. This is because 
the beneficial effects of the upwardly revised 
assumptions for labour- market- oriented migra -
tion outweigh the countervailing effects of 
lower refugee migration.3
The positive outlook for the German economy 
hinges in key measure on exports regaining 
their footing over the projection horizon. 
Growth during the period spanning the last 
quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016 fell 
significantly short of the rates projected in 
Decem ber. International trade continued to de -
velop only at a sluggish pace. Furthermore, 
German exporters have been losing market 
share in their sales markets since the middle of 
2015. Particularly where trade with non-  euro-  
area countries is concerned, this should prob -
ably be interpreted mainly as a correction of 
previous market share gains not explained by 
price competitiveness. This process could con -
tinue further into 2016 according to Ifo and 
DIHK surveys, in which industrial firms reported 
subdued export expectations and only a com -
paratively moderate increase in exports this 
year. Given the assumed growth in the inter -
national sales markets, exports should none -
theless pick up pace again slightly as 2016 pro -
gresses. Exports are expected to expand 
roughly in line with foreign demand in both 
2017 and 2018.
Along with the surprisingly rapid upturn in 
manufacturing activity, corporate investment 
rose more sharply than expected over the 
period spanning the final quarter of 2015 and 
first quarter of 2016. While enterprises upped 
their investment in new buildings, in particular, 
at the end of 2015, purchases of new machin -
ery and equipment, especially motor vehicles, at 
the beginning of 2016 likewise played a role.

strong, a further pick- up in foreign demand and 
capacity utilisation set to expand again grad -Exports growth

ually over the projection horizon, enterprises 
are likely to invest more in expanding produc -
tion capacity in addition to replacement and 
modernisation projects. The healthy financial 
position of enterprises and the fact that finan -
cing conditions remain extremely favourable 
mean that investment looks to increase further. 
Over the projection horizon, the price- adjusted 
industrial investment ratio could therefore 
match its peak in previous economic cycles.
Housing construction investment gained greater 
momentum in the period spanning the fourth 
quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016 than 
predicted in the December forecast. This was 
due to intermittent spells of mild weather as 
well as to a strong pick- up in housing demand 
reflected in a sharp increase in orders received 
and building permits.4 In addition to the gener -
ally upbeat labour market situation and positive 
outlook for income and job security, high levels 
of immigration and a reduction in interest rates 
on mortgage loans are likely to have played a 
role in this development. Because these favour -
able conditions are largely set to continue over 
the projection horizon, housing investment 
should expand strongly this year and next. 
However, in 2018, the unfavourable demo -
graphic trends that Germany is currently experi -
encing could intensify as immigration decreases, 
which will probably be accompanied by a per -
ceptible decline in housing demand and con -
siderably weaker investment activity in the 
housing market.
It is assumed that, over the projection period, 
government investment will grow more 
strongly than of late, mainly in connection with 
rising construction investment.5 First, central 
government is planning to make improvements Housing con-
struction invest -
ment to expand strongly in 2016 and 2017 before slowing in 2018 due to demo-graphic factors

4 However, anticipatory effects stemming from the tight -

2016 are also likely to have played a part in the sharp rise 
in building permits observed over the last few months.
5 At times, fluctuations in investment in machinery and 
equipment perceptibly influence the dynamics of govern -
ment investment as a whole. These fluctuations are mainly 
due to military procurements which are recorded in the na -
tional accounts at the time of delivery.Deutsche Bundesbank

in the area of maintaining the public infrastruc -
ture. Second, the room for manoeuvre that the 
relatively good budget situation of many states 
and local governments6 may provide over the 
next few years is also expected to be put 
towards  more investment.
This means that gross fixed capital formation 
will rise fairly substantially overall this year and 
next. In terms of growth rates, it should be 
borne in mind that calendar effects in 2017 will 
be decidedly negative. As things currently 
stand, fixed capital formation is also expected 
to rise to a similar extent in 2018 as counter -
vailing trends in corporate and housing invest -
ment will practically offset each other.
Private consumption significantly boosted eco -
nomic growth in the period spanning the final 
quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016. How -
ever, despite a marked decline in energy prices, 
households’ real disposable income did not rise 
quite to the extent expected as recently as 
Decem ber 2015 and the saving rate went up 
slightly. Nonetheless, the underlying trend in 
private consumption is still following a clear 
upward trajectory, on which it is likely to also 
remain owing to extensive employment 
growth, low unemployment and noticeable 
wage growth over the projection horizon. Two 
one- off factors will lend additional momentum 
this year – the renewed marked decline in oil 
prices and rising government transfers, mainly 
on account of the large numbers of refugees 
arriving in Germany, will further boost price-  
adjusted household income. Although the sav -
ing rate is likely to increase marginally, private 
consumption may therefore show slightly 
stronger growth than in 2015. Real disposable 
income will probably rise less markedly in the 
following years as consumer price inflation 
rebounds . The saving rate, which has gone up 
slightly since 2014, partially on the back of the 
fall in oil prices, should recede somewhat over 
the projection horizon if households gradually 
convert purchasing power gained from earlier 
falls in the price of oil, some of which was ini -
tially channelled into savings, into higher con -sumer spending. The anticipated reduction in 
real consumption growth based on house -
holds’ income projection will thus be more 
gradual. Growth rates for 2017 and 2018 are 
still expected to be significantly above the aver -
age increase recorded since German reunifica -
tion.
Overall, real government consumption is likely 
to increase slightly more sharply again this year 
than in 2015, and is then expected to show Gross fixed cap-
ital formation set to expand fairly substan-tially across the board

Major assumptions underlying the macroeconomic 
projections 
This projection is founded on assumptions 
made by the Eurosystem’s experts concern-
ing the global economy, exchange rates, 
commodity prices and interest rates based 
on information available as at 10 May 2016. 
The assumptions regarding economic activ-ity in the euro area are derived from projec-tions made by the national central banks of the euro- area countries. With respect to the 
fi  scal policy framework in Germany, this 
projection incorporates all measures which 
have been adopted or adequately specifi  ed 
and are regarded as likely to be imple-mented. In addition, assumptions needed 
to be made for the projection horizon con-
cerning the migration of refugees and its 
fi  scal and macroeconomic effects.
Global economic growth fl  agged in the 
period spanning the fourth quarter of 2015 
and fi  rst quarter of 2016 and thus once again fell short of the expectations con-
tained in the previous projection. One fac-
tor in the slowdown was to be found in the 
US economy, despite the fact that the underlying cyclical trend in the United States has probably remained intact. The advanced economies as a group, too, can 
be expected to quickly overcome the tem-
porary lull. The other factor was that, in the 
fi  rst quarter, the commodity- exporting emerging market economies (EMEs) con-tinued to feel the effects of falling com-
modity prices in the global markets, and the pace of growth in the Asian EMEs receded again slightly. As a consequence of expect-
ations that commodity prices will continue 
to gain strength and that the Chinese econ-omy will undergo economic policy stimulus measures, economic activity in these groups 
of countries may be expected to rebound 
somewhat in the coming months, however. 
Nonetheless, the emerging market econ-omies’ outlook for growth remains muted 
overall, and, compared with the December projection, has been downgraded yet again 
for the coming year as well. The current projection presumes that the global econ-omy as a whole (excluding the euro area) will grow by 3% in the current year, picking 
up only slightly to 3¾% in 2017 and 2018 
(purchasing power parity- weighted).
In line with global economic growth, world 
trade also looks set to accelerate again over 
the course of this year and the next.1 The 
import slump in the past half- year spanning 
the fourth quarter of 2015 and the fi  rst quarter of 2016 was regionally broadly 
based and led to a considerable downward 
revision for the current year. The EMEs, by 
contrast, are the sole reason why imports are projected to continue recovering at a more modest pace throughout the rest of 
the projection horizon than assumed in De-cember. Overall, international trade (exclud-
ing the euro area) is assumed to grow by 
1¾% this year, followed by growth rates of 
3½% and 4%, respectively, in the two fol-
lowing years.
Following the fi  nalisation of the December 
projection, crude oil prices initially remained under considerable pressure. It was only at the end of January that this situation began 
to unwind. The prospect of a smaller glut may have been a contributory factor. Al-though the temporary drop in prices had 
been fully recouped by the time this projec-
tion was completed, the forward quota-
tions from which the crude oil price assump-tions are derived are showing a signifi  cantly fl  atter upward trajectory over the projection 
horizon than assumed in the December projection. The crude oil prices underlying this forecast will therefore, in 2017, too, 
remain  well below the assumptions made in 
1 Over the medium term, the projection presumes a 
global trade elasticity, ie the ratio of the rates of 
change of global trade and global economic output, of 
around one, and thus a considerably lower value than 
had been assumed prior to the global fi  nancial and economic crisis. The decline in global trade elasticity 
can be explained to a major degree by the sustained 
growth lead of the EMEs over the advanced econ-
omies since the former show a much lower trade elas-ticity and their weight is on the rise. For more on this,

the preceding projection. Owing to the 
apprecia tion of the euro against the US dol-
lar, the discrepancy is actually a little greater 
still if calculated in euro. Quoted prices for 
other commodities likewise fell away sharply up until the beginning of the year but they, too, have rebounded perceptibly since then. 
Given the expected moderate growth of the global economy, in 2017 and 2018 prices are likely to rise again even on an 
annual  average.
As already announced in October 2015, the 
Governing Council of the ECB, at its De-
cember meeting, reviewed the accommo-dativeness of its monetary policy and de-
cided to further loosen its monetary policy 
stance. In March 2016 the ECB Governing 
Council adopted a further package of meas-ures.
2 These accommodative monetary pol-
icy measures contributed to a further sharp 
decline in interest rates. Market expect-
ations regarding future interest rate move-
ments and the technical projection assump-
tions derived therefrom for the trajectories 
of short- term interest rates and the yields 
on nine to 10-year government bonds are 
at a very low level, well below the assump-tions contained in the December projection 
round. The same goes for the forecast of 
interest on bank loans in Germany. Accord-
ing to an economic survey conducted in 
early summer by the Association of German 
Chambers of Industry and Commerce 
(DIHK) and the Ifo Credit Constraint Indica-
tor, access  to credit in Germany is still ex-
tremely favourable.
Following the ECB Governing Council’s Decem ber meeting, the euro appreciated somewhat, as the adopted measures had 
probably fallen short of market participants’ expectations. In addition, poorer economic data from the United States, in conjunction 
with the expectation that the US Federal 
Reserve would only gradually raise its policy 
rates, along with surprisingly upbeat euro- 
area economic data for the fi  rst quarter, caused the single currency to gain further ground against the US dollar. In addition, 
the euro also rose against the pound ster-
ling on the back of uncertainty about 2 Under the December 2015 package, the deposit 
facility  rate was cut and the asset purchase programme 
(APP) was extended to March 2017 or, if necessary, 
even longer. The March 2016 package of measures 
contained not only a policy rate cut and an increase in 
the monthly volume of asset purchases but also an expansion  of the APP to include a corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) and four new targeted longer- term refi  nancing operations (TLTRO II). At the 
same time, the Governing Council made it clear that its policy rates would remain very low even after the pur-chase programmes have expired.Major assumptions of the projection

whether the United Kingdom will remain in 
the European Union. In the period used for 
deriving the exchange rate assumptions, the euro traded at US$1.14, 4½% higher 
than assumed in the December projection. 
In relation to the 38 most important curren-cies in terms of foreign trade, the euro ap-preciated by 4¼%.
The euro- area economy grew considerably to kick off the year. Bearing in mind that 
fl  uctuations in quarterly rates of change are 
not unusual and that the mild weather will 
have probably had a positive impact on the 
fi  rst quarter, developments in the period spanning the fourth quarter of 2015 and fi  rst quarter of 2016 are largely consistent with the continuation of the recovery pro-
cess anticipated in the December projection. Domestic demand is set to continue provid-
ing strong growth stimuli over the projec-tion horizon. Export growth rates can be 
expected to rise gradually in line with devel-opments in foreign sales markets. Exporters are likely to benefi  t, above all, from mount-
ing demand within the euro area. Some 
countries might see a positive impact from 
higher price competitiveness in foreign mar-kets outside the euro area owing to the per-
sistently low infl  ation rates and the lagged 
effects of earlier euro depreciations.
Given the tapering- off of external infl  u-ences from outside the euro area, GDP growth in the euro area (excluding Ger-many) is expected to be slightly down on 
the December projection at 1.6% this year 
and 1.7% next year. This means that aggre-
gate economic capacity utilisation in the 
euro area as a whole could be back at nor-mal levels by the end of the projection hori-zon, even if it does not quite get there. The 
rather strong growth in the euro area ex-
cluding Germany, in connection with these 
countries’ high trade elasticity, means that 
German exporters’ sales markets will grow 
somewhat more strongly than global trade over the projection horizon.
In the area of public fi  nances, the fi  scal pol-
icy measures considered in this projection 
will worsen the general government fi  scal balance up to 2017 by ½% of GDP com-
pared with 2015 (primarily in 2016).3 On the 
revenue side, the countervailing infl  uences 
will almost entirely cancel each other out. Whereas, above all, income tax will be 
reduced  over the projection horizon (includ-
ing higher income tax allowances and a rightward shift in income tax rates in the current year), social contribution rates will increase. The health insurance institutions 
in particular raised their additional contribu-
tion rates by an average of ¼ percentage 
point at the beginning of the year. In 2017, 
the contribution rate to the public long- 
term care insurance scheme – as part of the second reform of long- term care – is to be 
increased by an additional 0.2 percentage 
point. On the expenditure side, the benefi  t 
increases brought about by the long- term 
care reforms of 2015 and 2017 will weigh 
on general government budgets (in some 
cases with a time lag). Moreover, changes 
to the law in the areas of healthcare and housing allowances will also make them-
selves felt in the current year. Elsewhere, ex-
penditure on areas such as infrastructure, 
child day- care, social housing construction 
and the military is expected to be upped 
progressively. The fi  scal effects of the meas-ures included will be insignifi  cant in 2018.
In the light of recent developments, the 
assump tions relating to the extent of refu-
gee migration to Germany for the 2016 to 
2018 period have been revised sharply 
lower compared with the December projec-tion.

basis and thus, for the most part, in 2017.

expected over the 2015 to 2018 period.5 
Since only part of this number –  albeit a 
considerable part – will be granted asylum 
in Germany and some refugees will volun-
tarily leave again, it is possible that a total 
of nearly 1.1 million recognised refugees 
could stay in Germany, just over 800,000 of 
whom of working age.
However, owing to language and skills obs-
tacles, refugees will probably often enter 
the labour market only after something of a 
delay. For these reasons, a comparatively 
large share of recognised refugees will be either unemployed or not in gainful em-
ployment for other reasons over the projec-tion horizon, even despite the high demand 
for labour, including for simple tasks.6 The 
cumulative increase in the labour force will 
probably therefore be modest, at around 
1% over the 2015 to 2018 period. Around 
three- fi  fths of these members of the work-force could be employed by 2018, with the rest unemployed.
The infl  ux of refugees will not only impact 
on the labour market but also exert a posi-tive infl  uence on domestic demand, through an increase in additional – unfunded – gov-
ernment spending. Expenditure on social 
transfers in kind (especially for healthcare), 
other tangible goods purchases (such as to cover basic needs and for accommodation) 
and personnel will drive up government consumption. As more and more applica-tions for asylum are approved, an ever- growing share of support will be provided 
as means- tested monetary social welfare benefi  ts (especially unemployment bene-fi  t II), thus propping up private consump-tion. This projection assumes that the in-creased expenditure in connection with 
refugee migration was rather restrained last year compared with 2014
7 (the year prior to 
the rapid acceleration), will this year rise 
considerably to around ½% of GDP , and will 
subsequently stabilise at that level until 
2018.
5 According to data provided by the Federal Offi   ce for 
Migration and Refugees, in the year ended 440,000 
new applications for asylum were received; these are 
joined by an additional 300,000 to 400,000 refugees 
whose applications were not registered by the end of 2015. For that reason, a gross infl  ux of 800,000 refu-gees is assumed for 2015. Once asylum seekers whose applications have been rejected (but also some recog-nised refugees) have exited the country, a net infl  ux of 660,000 refugees is likely to be left over.
6 See Deutsche Bundesbank, The current infl  ux of 
refugees – projected impact on the labour market and 
public fi  nances, Monthly Report, December 2015, 
pp 24-28.7 One reason why expenditure over 2015 as a whole was low relative to the numbers of incoming refugees was that the infl  ux only picked up considerably in the 
second half of the year, which meant that the new 
arrivals, for the most part, needed support for only a 
few months.Projected infl  ux of refugees and its impact on the labour market between  2015 and 2018

similar annual growth to real GDP . The tempor -
ary pick- up in pace primarily reflects additional 
spending in connection with refugee migra -
tion. Benefit increases brought about by the 
care reforms of 2015 and 2017 –  some of 
which will only become evident after a time 
lag – as well as additional healthcare spending 
and higher personnel expenditure in the areas 
of childcare, education, police and the military 
will also boost growth.
Over the projection horizon, imports are likely 
to reflect developments in final demand, in par -
ticular. Moreover, based on the continuing 
international division of labour, the import 
share in key expenditure components is ex -
pected to continue its moderate increase. With 
an assumed import share of over 40%, exports 
and investment in machinery and equipment, 
in particular, will play a key role here. The accel -
eration in the growth rates for these compon -
ents expected over the projection horizon is set 
to more than offset the dwindling growth in 
private and government consumption in the 
next few years. Imports will therefore probably 
expand more sharply in 2017 and 2018 than in 
2016. Owing to a rebound in price competi -
tiveness, exporters from other euro- area coun -
tries should benefit more than suppliers from 
outside the euro area.
Germany’s trade surplus rose again perceptibly 
in 2015, mainly due to the price effect caused 
by lower crude oil prices and the depreciation 
of the euro.7 Lower crude oil prices will lead to 
a strong improvement in the terms of trade this 
year, too. However, import prices should rise 
over the rest of the projection horizon if crude 
oil and commodity prices stabilise as assumed. 
The positive domestic dynamics and strong im -
port growth are therefore likely to assume an 
increasingly prominent role, meaning that the 
trade surplus could narrow somewhat. The cur -
rent account surplus, too, should therefore fall, 
albeit slightly. This is due, among other things, 
to the fact that the surplus for primary income 
may continue to rise due to the steady increase 
in external assets.Labour market
The labour market performed surprisingly well 
in the period spanning the fourth quarter of 
2015 and first quarter of 2016. Employment 
rose by 310,000 persons during this time, 
which was substantially higher than the figure 
forecast in the December projection, while 
seasonally   adjusted unemployment, defying 
expect ations, fell markedly. Another contribut -
ing factor was the fact that, as far as the Ger -
man labour market is concerned, the compos -
ition of migrant inflows was more favourable 
than assumed in the previous projection. The 
number of migrants from other EU countries, 
who integrate comparatively quickly into the 
labour market, remained very high. By contrast, 
the level of refugee migration was lower than 
expected.
In principle, the labour market is likely to remain  
buoyant in the coming months. Nonetheless, 
available leading indicators are pointing to a 
possible slowdown in employment growth. 
According  to the IAB labour market barometer, 
unemployment could edge upwards over the 
next few months. This is partly attributable to 
the number of asylum applications being suc -
cessfully processed rising and some refugees 
subsequently registering as job seekers.
Employment is likely to rise further later over 
the remaining projection horizon, while un -
employment will probably remain broadly un -
changed at the low level that it has reached. In 
this context, growing labour market bottle -
necks will be mitigated by employment- related 
migration. This influx of workers, particularly 
from EU member states, is forecast to slowly 
fall in net terms from an estimated 440,000 in 
2015 to 300,000 in 2018. This is based on the 
expectation that employment- related migra-
tion from eastern EU member states will decel -Considerable

erate only gradually.8 On top of this is refugee 
migration, which, according to estimates, will 
expand the labour force by a total of 450,000 
persons in the period between 2015 and 2018.
In the light of demographic changes, the share 
of the native- born population that is of work -
ing age will contract sharply over the next few 
years. In addition to recruiting foreign workers, 
shortages resulting from enterprises’ expected 
persistently high demand for labour can, as a 
general rule, be counteracted by activating 
domestic  reserves. However, the rise in the par -
ticipation rate of the native- born population 
has been stunted in recent years, especially fol -
lowing the introduction of the option to retire 
on a full pension without actuarial deductions 
at the age of 63. That said, these braking 
effects  are likely to have largely dissipated in 
the meantime, with the trend of increasing 
labour  force participation –  bolstered by the 
rise in the statutory retirement age  – set to 
undergo a resurgence.9
Overall, the labour force is likely to expand by 
almost 1% in 2016 and again in 2017 due to 
the expected high level of migration and rising 
labour force participation. With unemployment 
falling once again relative to the average in 
2015, employment looks set to pick up slightly 
more strongly still in 2016. However, the fur -
ther decline in the unemployment rate actually 
envisaged for next year could be masked by 
higher unemployment among refugees. There -
fore, despite the favourable economic situ -
ation, it is possible that employment will rise at 
a slightly lower rate than the potential labour 
supply. At the end of the projection period, in -
creasing labour shortages and a perceptible 
fall- off in employment growth are expected in 
the face of diminishing migration figures. This 
is likely to be offset by the fact that increasing 
capacity utilisation should also raise working 
hours per employed person.10 Furthermore, the 
negative impact of labour market tightness on 
macroeconomic activity could be curbed by a 
potentially sharper rise in productivity over the projection horizon thanks to the persistently 
positive economic backdrop.

8 Estimates regarding the inflow of migrants excluding asy -
lum seekers are higher than in the December projection as, 
contrary to expectations, there does not appear to have 
been a fall in the number of eastern European migrants in 
2015. At the same time, the influx of refugees has plum -
meted since the start of 2016. In the light of lower refugee 
migration estimates, it is therefore likely that the partial 
crowding- out effect on other migration, which had still 
been assumed in the December projection, will be minimal.
9 Having initially been held down by the high proportion of 
inactive refugees, the participation rate for migrants is ex -
pected to go back up as recognised refugees are gradually 
integrated into the labour market as of 2017.

employment are low by international standards, meaning 
that there is scope here to raise working hours.Deutsche Bundesbank

engin eering industries and the main construc -
tion sector were moderate and fell short of the 
rises expected in the December projection. Sev -
eral collective wage agreements from previous 
years envisage lower rises in their second stage, 
which takes effect in 2016, than in their first 
stage. Zero months without pay increases and 
negative base effects due to high one- off pay -
ments in 2015 will further curb the pick- up in 
negotiated rates of pay in 2016. Consequently, 
the rises adopted in this year’s pay round (as 
well as projected increases in the case of pend -
ing agreements) will only be fully observable in 
the average growth rates for 2017.11 On bal -
ance, negotiated rates of pay are set to climb by 2.1% in 2016 and 2.4% in 2017. In 2018, 
growing labour market shortages and rising 
capacity utilisation could lead to a markedly 
higher increase. From a monetary policy per -
spective, it is important in this context that the 
current temporarily subdued level of inflation 
does not become entrenched via second- round 
effects.
This year’s rise in actual earnings is expected to 
be only marginally greater than negotiated 
rates of pay. While there was a distinctly posi -
tive wage drift last year, chiefly driven by the 
introduction of the statutory minimum wage, a 
comparable stimulating effect is lacking this 
year. Consistent with above- potential growth 
in the overall economy and increasing work -
force shortages in the labour market, the wage 
drift is likely to be slightly positive in 2017 as 
well; in 2018, overtime pay and higher bonuses 
to employees could then contribute to mark -
edly higher growth in actual earnings. Labour 
costs as measured by compensation per em -
ployee follow a similar pattern. However, the 
resulting higher cost burden is likely to be 
largely offset by a simultaneous increase in 
productivity gains. Following a slight slowdown 
this year, unit labour costs could therefore con -
tinue to rise by around 2% per annum,  as has 
been the case since 2013.
While it had been expected back in the Decem -
ber projection that consumer price inflation 
would slowly start to rise as early as at the start 
of 2016, it fell in the period spanning the fourth 
quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016. As 
measured by the growth rate of the HICP , aver -
age inflation in the first quarter of 2016 re -
corded a year- on- year rise of +0.1%, deviating 
from the figure estimated in the projection 
(+0.9%). This was due primarily to a renewed 
fall in oil prices. However, even excluding Accelerated rise

energy  , actual inflation still fell markedly short 
of projection expectations. Declining prices of 
imported industrial goods excluding energy 
provided noticeable relief and were probably 
attributable, in part, to the appreciation of the 
euro. In addition to weaker wage growth, an -
other factor affecting services prices was the 
fact that the measured rise in rents remained 
flat. Given the current sharp hikes in housing 
prices, this is noteworthy and is possibly con -
nected to methodological changes in the sub- 
index for rents. Inter alia,  the sample used for 
this has been gradually adjusted since the start 
of 2015. At the current juncture, the impact of 
this changeover on the sub- index for rents is 
difficult to assess. However it could cause rents 
as recorded by the Federal Statistical Office to 
increase at a lower rate than would be ex -
pected in view of the situation in the housing 
market.
It is anticipated that consumer price inflation 
will increase markedly through to the end of 
the projection period. In addition to the damp -
ening effect of the drop in crude oil prices 
being likely to have largely dissipated by the 
end of 2016, other commodity prices are set to 
pick up again, meaning that domestic price 
pressures arising from robust wage growth and 
rising capacity utilisation will probably make 
themselves increasingly felt. Overall, consumer 
price inflation (as measured by the annual HICP 
rate) could rise from 0.2% in the current year 
to 1.5% in 2017 and 1.7% in 2018.
This year’s projection for energy prices is 
shaped by the heavily reduced prices of fuel 
and heating oil at the start of the year. Although  
crude oil prices have now undergone a marked 
resurgence and consumer prices for fuel and 
heating oil are set for a further slight increase 
as the year progresses, the energy component 
of the HICP should be significantly lower on 
average in 2016 than in 2015. Energy prices are 
likely to go back up over the rest of the projec -
tion horizon, but this increase will probably be 
fairly weak. The prices of mineral oil products, 
for instance, will probably see just a moderate rise owing to the assumed low increase in 
crude oil prices. Gas and electricity prices could 
even abate somewhat up to the end of the 
projection horizon. In the past few years, they 
have been geared less towards the crude oil 
prices of the recent past, and more towards 
their own forward prices at the wholesale level. 
The latter pointed to falling prices as this pro -
jection was finalised. Expected increases in 
other cost components, such as grid charges, 
should thus be more than offset.

in 2016 are likely to be marginally lower than in … and might

the previous year, reflecting the fact that wage 
costs will rise somewhat more weakly in 2016, 
probably temporarily. Diminishing import prices 
as well as steeply reduced prices for some agri -
cultural products owing to global oversupply 
are also providing relief. From 2017, the damp -
ening effects relating to import prices should 
cease; according to the assumptions, renewed 
price rises are also expected for food raw ma -
terials from this point. Since the externally in -
duced relief will tail off, non- energy consumer 
price inflation is likely to approach the inflation 
rate for domestic value added throughout the 
projection horizon. For the GDP deflator, an in -
crease of approximately 2% per year, consist -
ent with the growth in unit labour costs, is ex -
pected in the projection period, as already in 
the period from 2013 to 2015; this is because 
profit margins will probably remain stable for 
the most part, given an unchanged level of 
competitive intensity. In the past, easing effects 
stemming from declining import prices are also 
likely to have played a role in these stable mar -gins. Thanks to their improving cyclical pos -
ition, however, enterprises should be able to 
largely pass on higher labour costs to the con -
sumer, even if import prices rise again. Annual 
HICP inflation excluding energy should increase 
from 1.0% in the current year to 1.8% in 2018. 
This particular form of inflation would thus be 
slightly higher in Germany over the entire pro -
jection period than in the rest of the euro area, 
in a likely reflec tion of the varying cyclical pos -
ition.
Public finances
After recording a distinct surplus last year 
(+0.6% of GDP), the government budget is 
likely to manage just a slight positive balance 
this year. As things stand, then, no further 
major change is anticipated before 2018. On 
the one hand, the general conditions for public 
finances, characterised by low interest rates as 
well as a sound labour market situation and 
healthy economic growth, should remain 
favour  able. On the other hand, government 
spending relating to refugee migration is likely 
to rise, especially in the current year, added to 
which the budgetary stance will be expansion -
ary over the entire projection horizon.12
Specifically,13 slight budget relief is to be ex -
pected this year from both the favourable eco -
nomic setting and the further decline in interest 
expenditure. The structural primary balance 
(that is, the structural balance less interest ex -
penditure) is likely to deteriorate significantly, 
however, because it is affected by growing ex -
penditure on refugees as well as fiscal policy 
measures that have a detrimental impact on From 2017, 
domestic price pressure will be manifest in increased non- energy inflationFavourable  conditions for public finances, but additional expenditure on refugees and expansionary stance

Projection
12 This projection was finalised prior to the publication of 
the May revision to the national accounts figures for 2015; 
the new information has practically no bearing on the pro -
jection, however. Particular uncertainty continues to sur -
round refugee migration. Additional expenditure could also 
be incurred in connection with the sale and transfer of cer -
tain assets belonging to HSH Nordbank, or in the course of 
phasing out nuclear energy, for instance.

balance. In addition, growth in pension ex -
penditure will remain high, chiefly because of 
the sharp pension increase around the middle   
of the year.
Although in the coming year economic activity 
will be roughly neutral from a budget perspec -
tive, the bulk of the one- off proceeds from the 
2015 frequency auction will be recorded then.14 
The decline in interest expenditure is also likely 
to continue. However, the factors providing 
relief  will be offset by a renewed, albeit more 
minimal deterioration in the structural primary 
balance. Given little change in spending relat -
ing to refugee migration, the indications here 
are of a continued slightly expansionary budget -
ary stance as well as similarly high increases in 
pension expenditure as in the current year. In 
2018, the proceeds from the frequency auction 
will largely drop off, while the economy will 
provide somewhat stronger relief for the gov -
ernment budgets. The structural balance, too, 
would thus hardly change.
Although the debt ratio would drop relatively 
rapidly under these conditions, it would not yet 
fall below the 60% limit in 2018 either (end of 
2015: 71.2%). Given the prospect of only slight 
surpluses from 2016, the decline will be chiefly 
due to nominal GDP growth in the ratio’s 
denom inator. Furthermore, the liabilities of 
government- owned bad banks are likely to be 
reduced further.
Risk assessment
The risks to economic growth appear to be 
broadly balanced. Looking at the external set -
ting, the upswing in a number of commodity- 
exporting EMEs could prove weaker than 
assumed  in this projection, for one thing. There 
is also a certain risk of growth in China under -
going a stronger slowdown. The underlying 
pace of economic activity in a number of key 
advanced economies could also be slightly 
overstated in the baseline underpinning this 
projection; in particular, there is a perceived risk that the referendum on 23  June 2016 could 
result  in the UK voting to leave the EU. Finally, 
simmering geopolitical tensions could be re -
ignited, dampening the global economy. On 
the other hand, a cautious assessment was 
made of the outlook for German exports com -
pared with assumed growth in the sales mar -
kets, especially in the current year, with the 
result  that the assumed revival in global eco -
nomic output could also lead to stronger ex -
port growth and thus to greater business in -
vestment.
With respect to domestic demand, the risks are 
similarly more or less balanced. In the event 
that the assumed decrease in the saving ratio 
does not materialise, on account of heightened 
geopolitical tensions for example, private con -
sumption could see somewhat weaker growth. … hardly any

By contrast, an even stronger increase in hous -
ing construction investment is conceivable. At 
present, any assessments of the effect on the 
housing supply of the unusual combination of 
extremely favourable financing terms and a 
population that is expanding, chiefly due to 
high levels of migration, can only be made 
under conditions of great uncertainty. More -
over, the influx of refugees and the attendant 
economic implications are subject to major un -
certainty, as before.
The downward slide in crude oil prices came to 
a halt at the start of the current year, and prices 
have risen again somewhat in the intervening 
period. The risks in relation to the assumed 
future  path of crude oil prices are considerable, 
but more or less balanced.15 If price develop -
ments were to deviate significantly from the 
assump tions, this would entail major repercus -
sions for economic growth and for the inflation 
rate in particular, as in the past.
The risks to overall price developments are 
pointing downwards, by contrast. There is a 
certain upside risk in the event that the euro 
were to depreciate on account of growing dif -
ferences in the monetary policy stance com -pared with other currency areas. On the other 
hand, though, the impact of adverse demo -
graphic trends in Germany on the labour sup -
ply and on the associated wage pressure is un -
certain. Higher labour mobility within Europe 
than previously assumed could counteract the 
expected supply- related wage pressure in Ger -
many more significantly than predicted. What 
is more, fiercer  competition facing domestic 
producers, possibly partly as a result of the 
structural reforms  carried out in a number of 
euro- area countries, could induce German en -
terprises to pass on a smaller amount of the 
higher labour costs to consumers and thus to 
squeeze their profit margins. Finally, another 
downside risk to the price projection could re -
sult from the aforementioned methodological 
changes in the sub- index for rents, which 
accounts  for a sizeable share of just over 10% 
in the HICP basket of goods. This could imply a 
weaker increase in rents than assumed in the 
current projection baseline.Price risks in 
connection with the assumed crude oil price path are  considerable but balanced

were to expand its oil supply even more. On the other 
hand, unexpectedly severe cutbacks in production owing 
to lower investment in the crude oil industry would result 
in higher crude oil prices.Deutsche Bundesbank

The macroeconomic impact of quantitative 
easing in the euro area
Against the backdrop of subdued inflation prospects and falling market- based inflation expect -
ations at the zero lower bound on interest rates, the ECB Governing Council introduced an asset 
purchase programme (APP) in March 2015 and has since expanded this on multiple occasions. 
The declared aim of this programme is a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation towards 
inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.
As the euro area has no experience, to date, with the effectiveness of quantitative easing of this 
kind on real economic developments and inflation, model- based analyses play an important role 
in evaluating these non- standard monetary policy measures.
The simulations presented in this article show that the various model approaches differ consider -
ably in terms of how they evaluate the effectiveness of quantitative easing on macroeconomic 
developments and inflation. Nevertheless, they bear out the experience of other currency areas 
– namely that, all other things being equal, quantitative easing can have an expansionary effect 
on aggregate demand and inflation.
In addition to those effects of quantitative easing intended by the ECB Governing Council, there 
is, however, also the potential for unwanted side effects. These include an increasing nexus 
between monetary and fiscal policy, risks relating to the profitability of financial institutions and 
an excessively high propensity to run risks. The longer the highly accommodative stance remains 
in place, the more likely its side effects are to deepen. This is why monetary policy, which is 
currently  using expansionary measures in a bid to lift inflation from its very depressed level, must 
usher in the normalisation of monetary policy once it reaches a price path that is compatible with 
the Eurosystem’s stability target – irrespective of the state of public finances or financial stability  .Deutsche Bundesbank

Non- standard Eurosystem 
measures since mid-2014
Since 2007, the Eurosystem has adopted a 
range of non- standard measures to counteract 
the impact of the banking, financial and sover -
eign debt crisis. Prior to June 2014, its primary 
objective was to safeguard the functioning of 
the monetary policy transmission process.1 The 
remaining scope for policy rate cuts increas -
ingly became an issue during 2014 (see the 
chart below)2 and, with inflation prospects sub -
dued and market- based inflation expectations 
falling, a series of new non- standard measures 
was therefore gradually adopted from June 
2014 onwards with the aim of achieving a 
more accommodative monetary policy stance 
(see the chart on page 31).
In June 2014, the Eurosystem announced the 
introduction of targeted longer- term refinan -
cing operations (TLTROs). These allow banks to 
borrow from the Eurosystem at fixed interest 
rates for a period of up to four years in a series 
of eight operations conducted at quarterly 
intervals starting in September 2014.3 In Sep -
tember 2014, the Eurosystem also announced 
the launch of two further asset purchase pro -
grammes: the asset- backed securities purchase 
programme (ABSPP) and the third covered 
bond purchase programme (CBPP3).In January 2015, the Eurosystem finally an -
nounced the introduction of the expanded 
asset purchase programme (APP) in order to 
further loosen its monetary policy stance. The 
majority of the ECB Governing Council deemed 
this measure necessary as the inflation fore -
casts and measures of market participants’ 
long- term inflation expectations had fallen fur -
ther despite the many measures taken. How -
ever, survey- based inflation expectations do 
not back up this decrease, which can be taken 
as a sign that the decline in market- based ex -
pectation measures could be related to an in -
creasingly negative inflation risk premium (see 
the chart on page 32).Eurosystem’s

households, excluding loans to households for house pur -
chases) as at 30 April 2014, while, for the remaining six 
operations, the evolution of eligible lending since May 
2014 is key. The interest rate on the first two TLTROs was 
set at a ten basis point spread over the main refinancing 
rate prevailing at the time when each TLTRO was con -
ducted. This spread was eliminated for the remaining six 
TLTROs.Deutsche Bundesbank

The APP marks the start of quantitative easing 
in the euro area as, in addition to ABSPP and 
CBPP3, which were introduced prior to this, its 
chief component is the comprehensive pur -
chase of public sector securities (public sector 
purchase programme, or PSPP). Initially, total 
APP purchases were to amount to €60 billion a 
month until the end of September 2016, or be -
yond, if necessary, and, in any case, until a sus -
tained adjustment was seen in the path of in -
flation that is consistent with the aim of achiev -
ing inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over 
the medium term.4 In the light of forecasts 
being revised downwards, the ECB Governing 
Council took the decision in December 2015 to 
extend the programme until March 2017.5 This 
was followed by the decision in March 2016 to 
increase the volume of monthly purchases by 
€20 billion to €80 billion from April 2016. As of 
June 2016, this also includes the purchase of Long-term inflation expectations in the euro area

4 The individual components of the APP take differing 
forms with respect to risk- sharing. The ABSPP , CBPP3 and, 
as of March 2016, the corporate sector purchase pro -
gramme (CSPP) are subject to full risk-  sharing. Under the 
PSPP , 20% of asset purchases are subject to the principle of 
risk- sharing. Purchases of assets issued by European institu -
tions – these assets make up 10% of the additional asset 
purchases under the PSPP and are acquired by the national 
central banks – are subject to loss- sharing. The ECB holds 
10% of the assets purchased additionally under the PSPP . In 
March 2016, the decision was made to decrease the share 
of purchases of bonds issued by supranational institutions 
from 12% to 10% and to raise the share of purchases con -
ducted by the ECB from 8% to 10% – overall, the risk-  
shared part of the PSPP remains unchanged at 20%. The 
remaining 80% of asset purchases by the national central 
banks under the PSPP are not subject to loss- sharing. For 
more on this, see the ECB press release of 22 January 2015, 
available at http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/ 2015/
html/pr150122_1.en.html
5 The ECB Governing Council also decided to reinvest the 
principal payments on the assets purchased under the APP 
as they mature and to cut the interest rate on the deposit 
facility to -0.3%. Furthermore, it decided to continue con -
ducting the main refinancing operations as fixed rate ten -
der procedures with full allotment at least until the end of 
the last reserve maintenance period of 2017 and to include 
euro- denominated marketable debt instruments issued by 
regional and local governments located in the euro area in 
the list of assets that are eligible for regular purchases by 
the respective national central banks under the PSPP . For

corporate bonds.6 The non- standard measures, 
particularly the PSPP , have, since August 2015, 
represented the most significant component of 
Eurosystem liquidity provision (see the adjacent 
chart).
Transmission channels of 
quantitative easing
The ultimate goal of quantitative easing is to 
raise the inflation rate. Much like conventional 
interest rate policy, quantitative easing also in -
fluences macroeconomic developments via 
various channels. The main way that this works 
is that asset prices or yields are influenced by 
purchases of government bonds. It is perhaps 
somewhat surprising, however, that, in theory, 
such purchases need not necessarily have an 
effect on asset prices and yields – and, by ex -
tension, on inflation. Therefore, we will first 
briefly outline the conditions under which any 
purchases of assets have an impact on macro -
economic developments before moving on to 
explain individual transmission channels.
Neutrality of asset purchases 
for monetary policy purposes?
Traditionally, the “liquidity trap” plays a key role 
in the economic debate on the effectiveness of 
quantitative easing. If, at the zero lower bound 
on interest rates, risk- free, short- term assets 
(particularly government bonds) and central 
bank money are largely identical from the 
banks’ perspective, asset purchases by the cen -
tral banks will only result in the volume of 
short- term government bonds held by banks 
falling and the amount of central bank money 
hoarded rising correspondingly. Purchases of 
these assets for monetary policy purposes 
would then be “neutral” in that they would 
have no effect on real economic activity and 
goods prices.
However, the purchase of long- term, possibly 
risky assets by a central bank can, under certain conditions, also be neutral in this sense.7 If the 
central bank assumes risks by purchasing assets 
that were initially held in the private sector, the 
real economic allocation remains unchanged if 
these risks – should they come to pass – ultim -
ately have to be shouldered again by the pri -Quantitative

vate sector through (additional) taxation 
(known as Wallace neutrality).
However, this postulate of neutrality is based 
on a series of very strict assumptions (see the 
box on pages 36 and 37) that are likely too re -
strictive to apply in monetary policy practice.8 
In particular, it cannot be assumed that the 
functioning of the financial markets is com -
pletely frictionless as the markets are affected, 
inter alia,  by liquidity limitations (especially 
after the onset of the financial crisis), funding 
constraints and market segmentation. Further -
more, individual investors probably have a pref -
erence for certain maturities and asset classes 
that cannot be attributed to purely pecuniary 
differences. The conditions under which quan -
titative easing produces real economic effects 
that impact aggregate price developments via 
a multitude of channels are thus fulfilled (see 
the chart9 on page 35).
Portfolio rebalancing channel
In the absence of Wallace neutrality, quantita -
tive easing causes investors to adjust their port -
folios in various ways; this is reflected in relative 
yield shifts for individual asset classes and, 
above all, a flattening of the yield curve. This 
portfolio rebalancing channel is based chiefly 
on what is referred to as the preferred- habitat 
theory to explain the yield curve,10 which com -
bines the liquidity premium and market seg -
mentation theories.11
– The liquidity premium theory asserts that 
long- term assets with a residual maturity 
that exceeds risk- averse investors’ (short) in -
vestment horizon are only bought if they 
promise a premium that grows over the in -
vestment horizon (term premium). Accord -
ing to this hypothesis, this term premium 
(which is constant within each maturity) is 
always positive.
– According to the market segmentation the -
ory, certain investors have a preference for specific (residual) maturities (preferred habi -
tat), meaning that the term premium does 
not necessarily rise monotonously with re -
sidual maturity.12 Market segmentation the -
ory assumes that the bond market comprises 
individual segments; bonds in these seg -
ments are not completely interchangeable, 
and arbitrage opportunities are limited ac -
cordingly. Changes in the supply of and 
demand  for specific bonds may therefore be 
reflected in a change in the market price of 
these bonds.
In this environment, the purchase of long- term 
government bonds influences the yield curve 
via several channels. On the one hand, pur -
chasing long- term bonds lowers their supply in 
the market (segment) in which the purchases 
take place. Market segmentation means that 
investors with a preference for these bonds will 
be prepared to pay a higher price.13 This re -
duces the yield not only on this bond class but 
also on close substitutes. If, on the other hand, 
the central bank purchases very large volumes 
of long- term bonds, the average maturity of 
the portfolios held by investors – and therefore … however,

9 The channels depicted are widely considered the most 
significant in quantitative terms. A range of other channels 
can be found in the literature (see A Krishnamurty 
and A Vissing-  Jorgensen (2011), The effects of quantitative 
easing on interest rates: channels and implications for 
policy  , Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 43(2), 
pp 215-287), but these can be broadly subsumed under 
the channels presented here (see also S D’Amico, W Eng -
lish, D López-  Salido and E Nelson (2012), The Federal Re -
serve’s large-  scale asset purchase programmes: rationale 
and effects, The Economic Journal 122(564), pp F415-F446).

12 According to this theory, individual investors have het -
erogeneous preferences for bonds with different properties 
(eg a preference for certain maturities due to institutional 
or regulatory factors, as is the case for pension funds and 
life insurers) that cannot be attributed to purely pecuniary 
differences.

the aggregate term premium – will fall (dur -
ation effect).14
Portfolio adjustments and therefore a potential 
fall in long- term yields can also be triggered in 
an environment in which negative interest is 
applied to central bank balances and in which 
the level of excess liquidity held by commercial 
banks is high.15 For example, a (sharp) increase 
in commercial banks’ central bank account bal -
ances or the attendant rise in their excess li -
quidity16 following asset purchases can – irre -
spective of the maturity of the assets pur -
chased – lead to a fall in long- term yields. The 
drop in long- term yields is a result of an in -
crease in demand for long-  term bonds on the 
part of commercial banks that, as part of their 
portfolio and balance sheet management, are 
attempting to restore their optimal profitability 
and risk structure by purchasing long- term 
bonds with a greater duration. The overall ef -
fect that it exerts on the yield curve means that 
any purchase of government bonds then like -wise has a positive impact on aggregate de -
mand and, ultimately, on inflation.
Signalling channel
The signalling channel is independent of the 
Wallace neutrality outlined above and is based 
on expectations theory, according to which the 
long- term interest rate is (approximately) 
equivalent to average short- term interest rate Excess liquidity 
can be used by banks to restore their optimal portfolio structure Expansion in total assets as a signal of future monetary policy stanceTransmission process *

Wallace neutrality*
Assuming Wallace’s postulate of neutrality 
holds true, purchases of risk- prone secur-
ities by a central bank count as neutral in 
that they do not engender any macroeco-
nomic consequences. However, the postu-
late in question rests upon a number of 
assump tions.
– Any losses incurred by the central bank 
are offset and fi  nanced by private sector 
taxes.1
– No fi  nancial frictions or constraints are in 
place; as many securities as desired can 
be acquired for the same price.2 No mar-
ket segmentation of any kind exists.3
– All eligible securities are valued solely on 
the basis of their pecuniary returns. As such, non- pecuniary factors that could 
play a role in the holding of certain assets remain disregarded.
Under the assumptions listed above, the private sector sees the value of a given asset as arising from the current value of 
those uncertain payoffs associated with the 
asset in question.4 Any simple reallocation 
of assets between the central bank and the 
private sector not resulting in a change in 
the real quantity of available resources for 
private consumption in different environ-ments, or “states of the world” as Wood-
ford puts it, then has no effect on the mar-ket price of a given asset, nor does it impact the economy as a whole.
5
This result evidently contradicts the port-folio balance theory, according to which 
the purchase of risk- prone securities by the 
central bank gives rise to macroeconomic effects because it adds the risk to its own 
balance sheet. Conversely, the private sec-tor may hold debt instruments – in the form 
of risk- free bonds, for example – which yield the same amount regardless of the 
state of the world. From the perspective of 
the private sector, purchases of risk- prone 
securities by the central bank have reduced the level of risk and changed the real quan-tity of resources available to the private sec-tor.
In macroeconomic terms, however, this argu ment falls short of the mark. At the outset, purchases of risk- prone securities will shift the undesirable element of risk 
from the private to the public sector, which 
means that any losses that may arise are initially  borne by the central bank. Should 
* The following analysis is based on the speech 
“Methods of policy accommodation at the interest- 
rate lower bound”, delivered by M Woodford at the 
Jackson Hole Symposium on 31 August 2012.
1 See P Benigno and S Nisticò (2015), Non- neutrality 
of open- market operations, CEPR Discussion Paper, No  10594, p  7. The authors show that purchases remain  neutral in character even when government 
makes no transfers. However, in such instances, the 
central bank needs to be able to absorb the incurred 
loss using future retained earnings. Neutrality hinges 
on the private sector ultimately compensating for the 
reduced central bank profi  ts (transfers to the fi  nance 
ministry) by rendering higher taxes. That being said, if 
the level of losses sustained by the central bank is “too high”, the postulate of neutrality ceases to apply.

scribed by C T Carlstrom, T Fuerst and M Paustian (2014) in Targeting long rates in a model with seg-mented markets, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland 
Working Paper, pp 14-19.
3 While the quantitative easing administered by the 
central bank changes the level of state- dependent 
taxes, this is not refl  ected to the same extent in a cor-
responding change in the portfolio structure of those 
actors that are not affected by the central bank’s pur-
chasing activity (see also Woodford (2012), op cit, 
p 67).4 The current value, for its part, is determined by the 
stochastic discount factor attached to the investor, 
which is in turn derived from the marginal utility of the income generated in different states of the world.
5 If the real available quantity of resources does not 
change in any specifi  c state of the world, then the 
marginal utility of income remains unchanged, as does the stochastic discount factor.Deutsche Bundesbank

expectations.17 If, in addition to communicat -
ing the future evolution of policy rates (forward 
guidance), the central bank announces that it 
intends to purchase assets, market participants 
could interpret this as a further indicator of an 
expansionary monetary policy stance being 
maintained for some time to come. This would 
imply that what is being communicated is 
backed by concrete measures, supporting mar -
ket participants in their perception of the future 
path of policy rates (at the effective lower 
bound, if applicable). If quantitative easing is 
interpreted as a signal that policy rates will re -
main at the effective lower bound for longer 
than previously expected, long- term interest 
rates would continue to fall in line with the ex -
pectations hypothesis.18 This would have a 
positive impact on general financing terms and 
therefore credit demand, stimulating aggregate 
demand and increasing inflation.19
A change in assets prices and yields through 
the portfolio rebalancing channel and the sig -nalling channel creates the conditions under 
which quantitative easing can be transmitted 
through other channels.
Bank capital and balance sheet 
channel
The bank capital channel attributes special im -
portance to a commercial bank’s balance sheet 
position. If asset prices increase as a result of 
purchases, the assets of a bank, too, will in -the public sector subsequently raise taxes in 
order to fully absorb the losses incurred by 
the central bank, real after- tax income generated  by the private sector will ultim-
ately remain exposed to the risk in question, albeit only indirectly. Therefore, even in the wake of the central bank’s purchasing activ-ity, the private sector cannot consume more than it could previously. In this respect, any 
such purchases are neutral in nature inas-
much as they have no effect on aggregate demand or on price developments.
The assumptions that were outlined at the 
beginning of this analysis and that are of 
pivotal importance to the postulate of neu-trality are, however, likely to be too restrict-
ive for use in monetary policy practice. In 
particular, it can be assumed that different 
funding restrictions (such as loan- to- value 
ratios) or market segmentation are at play 
here. Individual investors may also exhibit a preference for certain maturities that can-
not be attributed to purely pecuniary differ-
ences. The conditions under which quanti-
tative easing produces real economic effects  
that have an impact on aggregate price develop ments via a multitude of channels are thus fulfi  lled (see also the chart on 
page 35).6
6 The signifi  cance of possible fi  nancial restrictions and 
market segmentation is nonetheless not set exogen-
ously but instead depends on the macroeconomic situ-
ation. For instance, market participants’ risk aversion in times of crisis is likely to be far more pronounced, thus causing market segmentation to play a weightier role. 
This state dependence is likely to strengthen the impact  of quantitative easing. See S Gürkaynak and J H  Wright (2012), Macroeconomics and the term structure, Journal of Economic Literature 50(2), 
pp 331-367.
17 According to the expectations theory, an asset invest -
ment should generate the same expected yield in a given 
period of time, irrespective of whether the investment was 
made in the form of several short- term assets or a one- off 
longer- term bond. The assets are perfect substitutes for 
one another, which means that the signalling channel has 
an equal effect across all interest rates.
18 The literature also makes reference to what is known as 
the inflation channel, through which quantitative easing 
impacts directly on inflation expectations as well as influen -
cing the distribution (ie uncertainty) of inflation expect -
ations (see A Krishnamurty and A Vissing-  Jorgensen (2011), 
op cit).

crease. All other things being equal, the result -
ing profit has the effect of increasing commer -
cial banks’ capital. This increase enables com -
mercial banks both to meet the higher capital 
requirements of a growing loan portfolio and 
facili tates their access to the funding needed to 
refinance their loans to enterprises, increasing 
banks’ willingness to provide credit.
What is known as the balance sheet channel 
applies similar reasoning to the borrower’s 
financial  situation.20 The higher a borrower’s 
capital (eg as a result of increasing asset prices 
induced by quantitative easing), the lower the 
credit default risk21 and the smaller the risk pre -
mium that lenders will demand to protect 
themselves against a default.22 Hence, external 
financing becomes more affordable for bor -
rowers, making it easier for them to realise in -
vestment projects.
Exchange rate channel
The exchange rate channel is particularly im -
portant for open economies in which foreign 
trade makes up a notable share of economic 
activity. If an asset purchase programme causes 
the yields of assets denominated in domestic 
currency to fall in relation to those denomin -
ated in foreign currency, this will diminish the 
appeal of domestic bonds for foreign investors, 
and demand for domestic currency (which 
would be needed to purchase such bonds) will 
decline. This creates (at least temporary) down -
ward pressure on the domestic currency.
First, such a depreciation makes exports of 
domestic  goods and services cheaper, which 
tends to stimulate demand for such products 
from abroad. Second, foreign goods and ser -
vices become more expensive for domestic 
consumers, causing domestic demand to focus 
increasingly on domestic rather than foreign 
products. Overall, this creates a positive effect 
in terms of (domestic) aggregate demand and 
spurs domestic inflation (due to higher prices 
for imported products, amongst other things).23Impact of quantitative easing 
in the euro area
According to the theoretical considerations, 
bond purchases should impact on aggregate 
demand and inflation via changes in financial 
market variables. Quantitative easing should, 
all other things being equal, cause long- term 
interest rates to fall, the euro to depreciate and 
–  potentially with a certain lag  – strengthen 
lending, consumption and investment activity. 
In a first step, selected financial market indica -
tors are outlined below in order to obtain initial 
indications of whether their development is 
largely consistent with theoretical reasoning 
thus far. However, this anecdotal evidence 
should not be regarded as a conclusive empir -
ical assessment or even as evidence supporting 
the theoretical statements. Subsequently, the 
effects of the APP on macroeconomic develop -
ments and inflation are analysed.

20 Against this backdrop, borrowers are required to hold 
sufficient collateral for the lender to even consider them as 
potential clients. However, owing to asymmetries of infor -
mation between the lender and the borrower, the lender is 
obliged to assess the borrower’s collateral and investment 
project. This entails costs, which the lender offsets by char -
ging an interest rate premium. Moreover, a greater prob -
ability of the borrower becoming insolvent results  in a 
higher interest rate premium.
21 This is because if the borrower is willing to stake a large 
amount of capital, this suggests a high level of confidence 
in the investment project on the part of the party with the 
better information and represents an incentive for the bor -
rower to undertake every effort to make the project a suc -
cess so as not to forfeit his capital.

23 If, in addition to the depreciation, inflation expectations 
increase (be it due to a higher level of aggregate economic 
activity or more expensive imports), real interest rates will 
also fall. However, lower yields in the euro area should in -

regard ing the signalling channel, expectation 
effects might have been a factor, given that 
expect ations of a comprehensive Eurosystem 
purchase programme increased noticeably dur -
ing the second half of 2014 and at the begin -
ning of 2015. Yet, the monetary policy meas -
ures decided before the APP was announced, a 
less favourable development of the real econ -
omy and international influences, too, might 
have contributed to the decline in long- term 
interest rates and the depreciation of the 
euro.24 Drawing conclusions about the isolated 
contribution of quantitative easing to the de -
cline in yields is, therefore, difficult.
An analytical decomposition of the change in 
the ten- year interest rate only allows a distinc -
tion to be made between the contribution of 
interest rate expectations and the term pre -
mium (see the chart on page 40).25 The results 
suggest that the decline in the ten- year interest 
rate was attributable to both a lower term pre -
mium and declining interest rate expectations, 
with the term premium initially of greater im -
portance. Recently, however, the declining 
interest rate expectations have begun to carry 
more weight. In this context, developments be -
tween April and June 2015 were particularly 
striking when a range of factors temporarily 
caused longer- term interest rates to rise signifi -
cantly and volatility in the financial markets was 
slightly elevated for a short period of time.26 
This example illustrates that changes in interest 
rate expectations and the term premium can 
also reflect different economic outlooks for the 
euro area, global influences and changes in 
preferences which are empirically difficult to 
distinguish from the effects of Eurosystem 
monetary policy measures.
Besides the above- mentioned effects on long-  
term capital market rates, there was a general 
decline in interest rates on loans to the non-  
financial private sector in the euro area. Look -
ing at corporate loans, the decline began back 
in spring 2014 and was particularly pronounced 
in countries where banks had raised their lend -ing rates disproportionately strongly during the 
sovereign debt crisis (see the chart on page 41).
As with capital market yields, the isolated im -
pact of the APP on lending rates cannot be de -
termined a priori  given that other determin -
ants, including the other monetary policy 
measures, are likely to have played a role. How -
ever, the April 2016 Bank Lending Survey (BLS) 
provides more concrete indications that the 
APP may have helped ease lending policies. 
Accord ing to the BLS, the APP had an easing 
effect on the lending policies of the surveyed 
euro- area banks in the previous six months. 
Although  the impact of the programme on 
credit standards for loans to non- financial cor -
porations and households was minor, the ques -
tioned banks on balance reported a notice able 
easing effect on the terms and conditions for 
new loans across all business lines.

policy measures might also have supported 
credit growth. Annual growth rates of corpor -Long- term

24 With regard to the APP , an initial event study for the 
euro area identified a number of events prior to its official 
announcement which might have influenced market par -
ticipants’ expectations regarding the programmes and im -
pacted on financial market prices. See C Altavilla, G Car -
boni and R Motto (2015), Asset purchase programmes and 
financial markets: lessons from the euro area, ECB Working 
Paper No 1864.
25 The decomposition is based on the estimation approach 
by S Joslin, K J Singleton and H Zhu (2011), A new perspec -
tive on Gaussian dynamic term structure models, The Re -
view of Financial Studies 24(3), pp 926-970. However, par -
ticularly in the context of a flattening yield curve and the 
existence of a potential zero lower bound on interest rates, 
the results are exposed to high levels of estimation uncer -
tainty. Ten- year interest rates (see chart on p 40) are repre -
sented by the overnight index swap (OIS) curve as it does 
not limit the analysis to national government bond markets 
in which yields may be influenced by liquidity effects (espe -
cially German Federal bonds) or credit risks.
26 This countermovement can, amongst other things, be 
attributed to previous exaggerations being corrected, the 
economic outlook stabilising, low market liquidity and fur -
ther technical market factors. Against the backdrop of 
asset purchases conducted by central banks, such an at 
times perceptible correction in long- term interest rates 
could be observed not only in the euro area but also in the 
United States and Japan. See also S Steins Bisschop, M Boer -
mans and J Frost (2016), A shock to the system? Market

ate loans in the large euro- area countries 
reached their lowest point at the end of 2013/
beginning of 2014 and subsequently recovered 
in line with real economic developments. Indi -
vidual countries have recorded net inflows 
again since 2014, although credit growth has 
remained subdued on the whole (see the chart 
on page 42).
These considerations on developments in se -
lected financial market indicators alone high -
light how difficult it is to identify and quantify 
the effects of quantitative easing in isolation. 
First, expectation effects make it harder to per -
form an event date analysis as the impact of 
the measures are priced in before the actual 
decision is taken or implemented. Second, de -
velopments in the relevant financial market 
variables are subject to numerous other influ -
ences besides quantitative easing, including 
other Eurosystem monetary policy measures as 
well as real economic factors and monetary 
policy decisions outside the euro area.
The impact of quantitative 
easing on the real economy 
and inflation
However, in the end it is not the impact of the 
APP on individual financial market variables that is crucial in assessing the effectiveness of 
quantitative easing but rather a quantification 
of the programme’s effects on macroeconomic 
developments and inflation. It should be noted 
in advance that no direct conclusions as to the 
effectiveness of the APP can be drawn from 
actual  inflation trends in the recent past as 
hypothetical price developments without the 
APP cannot be observed. The macroeconomic 
time series for the euro area currently do not 
yet have sufficient information to enable an 
empirical evaluation of the APP’s impact on in -
flation. Macroeconomic model simulations are 
therefore used below.
However, at the current juncture, no consensus 
has yet emerged in the literature regarding a 
universally accepted procedure for simulating 
the macroeconomic effects of monetary policy 
asset purchase programmes. Instead, a multi -
tude of approaches is currently being used, 
which can roughly be divided into two groups.
– In the two- step (indirect) procedure, the 
impact  of quantitative easing on long- term 
interest rates and other financial market vari -
ables is initially estimated using a partial or 
satellite model. In a second step, this estima -
tion is used to determine the effects on ag -
gregate demand and inflation. Under this 
approach, it is assumed that, within the rele -
vant macroeconomic model (eg time- series 
models, traditional macroeconomic but also 
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium 
(DSGE) models), long- term interest rates will 
exogenously diminish by the value deter -
mined in the first step. Hence, the impact of 
quantitative easing on long- term interest 
rates is not determined within the model 
when using this procedure.27Quantifying

– By contrast, the one- step (direct) approach, 
which is always based on DSGE models, sim -
ultaneously estimates the impact of quanti -
tative easing on both long- term interest 
rates and the resulting macroeconomic de -
velopments. The effect is thus determined 
within the model.28 This procedure thus 
allows the influence asset purchases have on 
aggregate demand and inflation to be ob -
served consistently within a single model 
framework.
The Bundesbank’s internal analyses of the 
effects  of the APP are primarily based on the 
direct method (see the chart on page 45). In 
the estimated DSGE models used here, as 
usual, conventional monetary policy affects 
macroeconomic developments owing to nom -
inal rigidities (such as price and wage rigidities). 
In order for quantitative easing to have any im -
pact on the real economy – ie so that Wallace 
neutrality (see the box on pages  36 and 37) 
does not apply –, additional frictions must be 
assumed. Two modelling approaches that in -
clude aspects of the portfolio rebalancing 
channel are therefore selected.
The method that is probably the most com -
monly used is based on a principal- agent prob -
lem29 in which, like in the deliberations involv -
ing the bank capital channel, a bank’s equity 
capital plays a crucial role.30 It assumes that a 
bank’s loan supply is restricted by the amount 
of its equity capital. If asset prices in the capital 
markets rise as a result of asset purchases, the 
value of the assets held by the banks also goes 
up. The resulting boost to their capital makes it 
easier for banks to access other sources of 
funding which they need in order to expand 
their lending. The increase in the loan supply 
ultimately leads to growth in aggregate de -
mand for goods. The original framework of the 
model can be expanded to integrate a further 
balance sheet restriction on the part of non-  
financial corporations. This can lead to other 
feedback effects on capital.31An alternative method of modelling the port -
folio rebalancing effects is based on the idea 
that other participants are, like banks, also sub -
ject to constraints.32 For example, although

foundation of dynamic macroeconomic relationships. It is 
thus possible to analyse the impact of economic policy

ations. See Deutsche Bundesbank, Development and appli -

between banks and households, households only entrust a 
limited proportion of their savings to banks because they 
fear that banks with insufficient capital will not use de -

and government bonds (which banks presum -
ably consider to be perfect substitutes), they 
are restricted in terms of their funding. In order 
to receive additional deposits from households, 
banks must hold more capital. Households, 
too, are constrained in terms of their invest -
ment options because they face funding re -
strictions.33 Furthermore, they can only invest 
their savings with banks, not other assets. By 
influencing yields on public- sector bonds, gov -
ernment bond purchases by central banks also 
have an impact on yields on corporate bonds 
and therefore ultimately on households’ fund -
ing restriction.34
The results of the Bundesbank’s model simula -
tions of the impact of the APP – as announced 
in January 2015 and launched in March – on 
real gross domestic product (GDP) and inflation 
are presented in the chart on page 45. Model 1 
in the chart refers to the modified version of 
the first modelling approach, while Model  2 
refers  to the second modelling approach. All 
in  all, the estimates for the macroeconomic 
effects  of the APP point to a positive real eco -
nomic effect accompanied by positive inflation -
ary effects. The macroeconomic effects of the 
APP as presented in the chart disregard param -
eter and data uncertainty, which is inevitably 
associated with the estimations of both models. 
If these uncertainties, too, were to be mapped explicitly, the range of results presented in the 
chart would be much wider. The high level of 
uncertainty raises the question, in particular, of 
how statistically significant the results are. 
Comparable simulation or estimation results 
are found for the purchase programmes of the 
US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England 
(see the box on pages 46 to 50).
The simulations show that, based on the an -
nounced purchase path of the APP , the two 
model types result in fairly different quantita -

33 In this model, households issue the corporate bonds 
because they accumulate the physical capital. This assump -
tion is made solely for the purpose of simplification and 
does not affect the model’s key findings.
34 A third approach focuses exclusively on households. It 
assumes that not all households are homogeneous, and 
that only some can invest their savings in the market for 
longer- term bonds. Although the remaining households 
can participate in both the market for short- term bonds 
and in the market for longer- term bonds, unlike the other 
households, they must pay a premium if they wish to par -
ticipate in the market for longer- term bonds. The assumed 
market segmentation means that purchases of (longer-  
term) government bonds reduce the longer- term yields on 
the bonds and increase their price and correspondingly the 
incurred  savings, giving the restricted households, in par -
ticular, scope for greater consumption. See H Chen, V Cúr -

tive estimations.35, 36 For example, the models 
differ from one another by around 1 percent -
age point in their assessment of the impact on 
real economic developments in 2016 and 2017; 
the differences between the inflation rates 
accord ing to each model are even larger. As 
research  currently stands, these two model 
types map the lower and upper bounds for the 
effectiveness of quantitative easing – at least 
for the DSGE model category.37
As mentioned at the beginning of this article, 
the ECB Governing Council has decided to ex -
pand the asset purchase programme. The add -
itional effect of its decision in December 2015 
on the inflation rate in 2016 to 2018 is likely to 
be between 0.1 and 1.0 percentage point per 
year.38
The results of the simulations shown here are 
heavily dependent on the underlying assump -
tions. These include, on the one hand, the way 
in which the expectation formation process is 
modelled. The better a monetary policy meas -
ure is anticipated, the more strongly behaviour 
is modified in the present (frontloading). In 
other words, the more transparent the commu -
nication surrounding a purchase programme, 
the larger its macroeconomic impact. On the 
other hand, assumptions about the form of the 
purchase path, including the exit strategy from 
the purchase programme, heavily influence the 
simulation results.39
The ceiling that Model 2 represents can be 
seen as too optimistic because the frictions the 
model contains may overstate the reality. This 
model assumes, for instance, that investors’ ini -
tially binding funding restrictions will continue 
to be eased for as long as the central bank 
maintains its quantitative easing programme. In 
practice, this is not always necessarily the case. 
For example, funding restrictions might con -
ceivably be eased once a certain purchase vol -
ume has been reached, and any additional pur -
chases would therefore have no extra effect on 
the real economy and inflation.It must also be remembered that the model 
simulations disregard any structural breaks that 
may have taken place since the onset of the 
financial crisis. They also fail to take into ac -
count that aggregate demand has been subject 
to significant levels of uncertainty in the wake 
of the financial crisis. Against this backdrop, 
private consumer demand and aggregate in -
vestment could show a comparatively weak 
response to the Eurosystem’s monetary policy 
measures in the current environment.
All in all, at the current juncture, the analysis of 
the quantitative effects of monetary policy pur -
chase programmes involves greater uncertainty 
about the scale of the effects compared with 
the effects of traditional interest rate policy. 
Nevertheless, the simulation results presented 
here bear out the qualitative results of other 
studies (see the box on pages 46 to 50), namely 
that, all other things being equal, quantitative 
easing can have a positive effect on aggregate 
demand and inflation.… although 
results of the observed models vary significantly 
Both the 
design of the analysis  …
… and the 
choice of model have an impact on the simula-tion resultsResults for euro area consistent with estimates for other currency  areas
35 Nevertheless, both models replicate the stylised facts 
relating to the quantitative impact of an interest rate policy 
measure.
36 There is also considerable variation in the results for the 
United States and the United Kingdom (see the box on 
pp 46-50).
37 Additional estimates relating to the APP by the ECB are 
within the range described here. See M Draghi (2016), De -
livering a symmetric mandate with asymmetric tools: mon -
etary policy in a context of low interest rates, speech held 
at the Oesterreichische Nationalbank on 2 June 2016. One 
of the main reasons for the relatively large effects that are 
observed in the context of Model 2 in comparison to 
Model 1 is that credit- constrained investment demand is a 
key restriction and reacts sensitively to the easing of fund -
ing restrictions in response to monetary policy. In simple 
terms, the differences between the models described here 
are due to the fact that, in the context of the second 
model, the underlying restrictions are “amplified”, whereas 
in the first model, the opposite is sometimes true for cer -
tain restrictions – here, through falling interest rates, pur -
chases of government bonds lead to a decline in banks’ 
profitability. However, this effect does not play a significant 
role in the second model.
38 According to rough calculations, the expansion of the 
APP announced in March 2016 will probably have a slightly 
smaller impact than the expansion announced in Decem -
ber 2015.

Potential implications of a 
prolonged period of expan -
sionary monetary policy
Besides the desired implications, quantitative 
easing can, however, also entail risks and un -
wanted side effects.
Fiscal policy implications of 
asset purchases
The nexus between monetary and fiscal policy 
is becoming stronger as a result of the pur -
chase of government bonds in the euro area. 
The extensive purchase programmes are turn -
ing Eurosystem central banks into the biggest 
creditors of their home governments. For a sig -
nificant share of sovereign debt, government 
finan cing costs are therefore becoming de -
coupled from capital market conditions.40 In 
other words, for government bonds purchased 
by central banks, interest rates are no longer 
being differentiated according to the sound -
ness of a country’s public finances (which is 
otherwise a principle of capital market fund -
ing). On the whole, this weakens market dis -
cipline which would, along with the fiscal rules, 
help ensure sustainable budgeting in the euro 
area. There is thus reason to fear that efforts 
for consolidation in the euro area will wane.41 
The more fiscal policymakers come to rely on 
the very favourable financing conditions, the 
more resistant they may subsequently be to 
normalising monetary policy, should this be -
come necessary in the light of price develop -
ments.
The impact of quantitative 
easing on banks’ profitability
There are recurrent concerns that the pro -
longed period of low interest rates could ser -
iously impair the earnings position of banks 
and other financial institutions. Similar fears are 
being voiced about quantitative easing, which 
can affect profitability in different ways. For one thing, quantitative easing leads to a further 
decline in the general interest rate level (see 
page 38 et seq). For another, it plays a major 
role in the flattening of the yield curve.42 All 
other things being equal, the zero lower bound 
on interest rates poses something of an im -
pediment to the drop in deposit funding costs. 
A priori,  in an environment of low interest 
rates, quantitative easing may have both a 
positive and negative impact on banks’ profit -
ability.43
All else being equal, a flatter yield curve erodes 
banks’ interest margins and thus reduces the 
earnings of financial institutions, especially 
those which rely primarily on classic deposit 
and lending business. The low lending rates 
created by monetary policy (implicitly assuming 
interest rate pass- through) reduce interest in -
come (per individual loan) for banks whose 
main business is lending. At the same time, the 
zero lower bound on interest rates hinders de -
posit funding costs from falling further.44 The 
assets and liabilities side of banks’ balances 
sheets consequently adapt asymmetrically to 
the interest rate floor. The degree to which the 
compression of the interest margin negatively 
affects banks’ profitability overall thus depends Governments’ 
financing conditions  are becoming decoupled from capital market conditions
Impact of the 
low- interest- rate level on earnings  uncer-tain a prioriLow- interest- rate environment may impair the interest margin , …
40 Since the purchases ultimately increase banks’ excess 
liquidity, the bottom line is that governments are obtaining 
this share of their funding at the – currently negative – de -
posit rate.
41 If cyclical improvements are factored out of the euro-  
area countries’ budget deficits, adjusted for interest ex -
penditure, the relevant primary surpluses have either 
moved sideways or have even dropped over the past two 
or three years.
42 For more information about the effects of low interest 
rates on the profitability of German banks and life insurers, 
see Deutsche Bundesbank, Financial Stability Review 2015.
43 In quantitative terms, the impact of a low- interest- rate 
policy on the financial industry could differ from the impact 
of quantitative easing. See M Woodford (2016), Quantita -
tive easing and financial stability, NBER Working Paper 
No 22285.
44 There are currently no signs that banks are reducing 
deposit rates to below zero on a large scale. Their reluc -
tance to charge negative interest rates on deposits, particu -
larly those of retail customers, may be due to fears of a 
widespread withdrawal of deposits and a loss of custom -
ers, which could ultimately jeopardise individual banks’ 
business models.Deutsche Bundesbank

on factors such as how heavily they rely on de -
posit funding or other sources of income.45
However, the very expansionary monetary pol -
icy can also have a positive impact on banks’ 
profitability. First, despite the interest rate floor 
for deposits, the cost of obtaining funding via 
the interbank market and the central bank 
could continue to fall.46 Second, higher asset 
prices mean that banks can realise a (one- off) 
gain by selling some of their holdings (see pages 37 
and 38). Finally, inasmuch as the low- interest-  
rate environment and quantitative easing help 
the economy to pick up, they can have a posi -
tive effect on banks’ profitability via macroeco -
nomic “feedback effects”: amidst increasing 
credit demand, the “quantitative effect” could 
offset the narrow interest margin. Because the 
creditworthiness of new and existing borrowers 
also generally increases in the context of im -
proved economic activity, the number of loan 
defaults tends to fall, which also boosts profits.
Which effects will ultimately dominate, how -
ever, cannot be determined on the basis of 
these theoretical considerations alone.47 Some 
empirical studies indicate a positive correlation 
between the interest rate level and the slope of 
the yield curve, on the one hand, and banks’ 
profitability, on the other.48 This therefore means 
– all other things being equal – that a lower 
interest rate level and a more gently sloping 
yield curve impair the banking sector’s profit -
ability.49 However, this is only the case when … nonetheless, 
positive effects on profitability are possible

Real gross domestic product 45 The negative impact on banks whose funding comes 
primarily from deposits by retail customers and enterprises 
is expected to be stronger because, unlike for deposit fund -
ing conditions, the zero lower bound does not represent 
the lower limit for financing costs in the capital market. In 
the short term, the negative impact will also be greater for 
banks that provide loans at variable rates or that issue a 
large volume of short- term loans, because, in these cases, 
interest income reacts more sharply and more rapidly to 
lower interest rates than at other banks. Furthermore, the 
interest margin does not have the same degree of influ -
ence on overall profitability at all banks. The extent to 
which shrinking interest margins weigh on banks’ profit -
ability therefore ultimately depends on their business 
model. Profitability depends, among other things on banks’ 
ability to compensate for low interest margins with other 
sources of income such as commission, fees or gains from 
capital market exposures. The degree to which this is pos -
sible could be limited in a competitive market environment. 
At present, the margins for consumer credit in Germany are 
tending to widen, while margins for loans to enterprises 
are showing a tendency to narrow somewhat. See 
Deutsche Bundesbank, Indications of portfolio shifts into 
higher- yielding assets in Germany, Monthly Report, May 
2016, pp 34-37.
46 All other things being equal, a negative interest rate on 
deposits and excess liquidity impairs banks’ profitability. On 
the other hand, following the ECB Governing Council’s 
monetary policy decisions, as of March 2016, banks (ex 
post) have been able to obtain liquidity from the Eurosys -
tem at a negative interest rate under certain conditions.
47 If the effects causing poorer profitability are dominant 
in relation to those resulting in improved profitability, banks 
could respond by increasing their lending rates or possibly 
by reducing risk on their balance sheets. The latter could be 
achieved either by lowering the volume of new lending or 
by substituting riskier loans, as they mature, with less risky 
new loans. On the other hand, banks might see this as an 
incentive to compensate for any loss of earnings by taking 
on more risk. If, however, the dominating effects are those 
which lead to increased profitability, the prolonged period 
of expansionary monetary policy should have a favourable 
impact on lending, in turn with positive implications for 
economic activity and inflation. A positive net effect on 
profitability could reduce structurally weak banks’ motiv -
ation to make balance sheet adjustments, though, poten -
tially causing their postponement.

The effects of quantitative easing in the United States and 
the United Kingdom
Initial estimates of the effectiveness of asset 
purchase programmes are available for 
both the United States and the United King-
dom. For the United States, triggered by the 
subprime crisis, the Fed has started several 
successive so- called large- scale asset pur-chase programmes (LSAP 1 to 3).
1 In the 
United Kingdom the Bank of England like-
wise announced a purchase programme, the asset purchase facility (APF),
2 shortly 
after LSAP 1 had been launched.3
Model- free event studies have frequently 
been run in order to analyse the effects of 
such purchase programmes on long- term 
interest rates. Such studies look at changes in yields within a short timeframe surround-ing the announcement of a monetary policy 
measure. These approaches are based on the assumption that, when such an an-nouncement is made, the announcement itself is the primary reason for the main movements in yields. The monetary policy announcement thus dominates all other 
shocks that typically determine movements 
in yields. This is why high- frequency data are usually used in such event studies, so that the effect of the announcement of a 
monetary policy measures can be identifi  ed with a certain degree of precision.
However, if monetary policy decisions are 
taken “in a package”, the main diffi   culty lies 
in disentangling the announcement effects 
of quantitative easing from the other meas-ures in the package.
4 Moreover, the event- 
study approach has its limitations if the 
measures have shifted expectations already prior to the announcement.
A second approach to analysing the effects 
of quantitative easing on long- term interest rates is based on the estimation of dynamic term structure models. Such models, which 
depict the cross- sectional and time- series 
variations of interest rates of different ma-
turities,5 can be used for purposes such as 
1 LSAP 1 was announced in November 2008 and 
reviewed  and expanded signifi  cantly in March 2009. 
Under this programme, the Fed announced that it 
would purchase a total of US$1,750 billion in fi  nancial 
assets. LSAP 2 was announced in November 2010, with purchases of government bonds coming to a 
total of US$600 billion by the end of the second quar-
ter of 2011. LSAP 3 was announced in September 
2012, yet without announcing the extent of asset pur-chases ex ante. Under this programme, the Fed initially 
purchased a monthly volume of US$40 billion in 
mortgage- backed securities (MBS). In December 2012, the Fed decided to purchase an additional US$45 bil-
lion worth of government bonds every month. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System press releases published on 25  November 2008, 18  March 2009, 23  September 2009, 3  November 2010, 13  September 2012 and 12  December 2012 
(http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/ 2016monetary.htm).
2 Under its APF1 programme, the Bank of England 
purchased a total of £200 billion worth of assets be-
tween March 2009 and January 2010 (see Bank of 
England, Quarterly Bulletin Q3 2011, pp 200-212). The 
programme was expanded in several steps between October 2011 and July 2012; the total size of pur-
chases under the programme currently stands at £375 billion (around 18% of UK GDP in 2015). See Bank of 
England, Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee 
meeting held on 4 and 5 July 2012. Available at http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/minutes/Documents/mpc/pdf/ 2012/mpc1207.pdf.
3 The volume of asset purchases announced by the 
Fed under the various LSAPs is equivalent to around 
25% of US GDP in 2015. To put that fi  gure into per-
spective: asset purchases by the Bank of England rep-
resent around 18% of UK GDP , and the announced asset purchase programme (APP) by the Eurosystem 
corresponds to around 17% of euro- area GDP (likewise using 2015 as the benchmark).4 See also D L Thornton, An evaluation of event- study 
evidence on the effectiveness of the FOMC’s LSAP program : are the announcement effects identifi  ed? 
Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis Working Paper 2013-033B.5 There are three factors in particular which infl  uence 
the term structure: (1) market participants’ expect-
ations regarding the future movements of short- term 
interest rates, (2) uncertainty about the expected pat-tern of interest rates and thus about interest rate risk, 
and (3) various other factors which impact on secur-
ities prices (including the securities’ liquidity, institu-tional and regulatory aspects which could lead to a 
market segmentation and permit limited arbitrage op-
portunities between securities with varying residual 
maturities).Deutsche Bundesbank

disentangling term premiums and expect-
ation components from yields.6
Current studies corroborate for both ap-
proaches that quantitative easing reduced both the slope and the level of the yield 
curve.7 It is hard to tell, however, which of 
the transmission channels discussed in the 
main article assumes a particularly promin-
ent role. Whereas model- free event studies 
often (but not always) produce indications 
of the signal channel,8 term structure 
models often (but likewise not always) fi  nd that the portfolio rebalancing channel is of 
particular importance.9 The variety of 
methods used limits somewhat the compar-
ability of the various studies on the effects 
of quantitative easing on sovereign bond yields. Differences in the selection of data 
6 Disentangling these quantities and their movement 
over time before and after the announcement and im-
plementation of quantitative easing provides valuable 
information that contributes to a better understanding 
of their transmission. However, the benefi  ts of this pro-
cedure are also limited if expectations have already 
shifted prior to the announcement, or if the idea is to 
disentangle announced monetary policy measures 
from other news.7 See also S D’Amico, W English, D López- Salido and E Nelson (2012), The Federal Reserve’s large- scale asset purchase programmes: rationale and effects, The Eco-nomic Journal 122(564), pp F415–F446; E T Swanson (2011), Let’s twist again: a high- frequency event- study

looked at in isolation – ie for given macroeco -
nomic conditions; this means that none of the 
positive effects of expansionary monetary pol -
icy, brought about by increased economic 
activity  as well as all resulting positive effects 
on banks’ profitability, are taken into account. 
Currently, however, there is little evidence to 
suggest that the contractionary effects  of the 
present low- interest- rate environment are 
dominant in terms of the macroeconomic 
effects . For example, German banks’ interest 
income as a source of earnings did not decline 
last year, and German credit institutions’ risk 
provisioning is at a very low level.50
However, the survey conducted in mid-2015 by 
the Bundesbank and the Federal Financial 
Supervisory Authority (BaFin) on the profitabil -
ity and resilience of German credit institutions 
in a low- interest- rate environment has revealed 
that the profitability of small and medium- sized 
German credit institutions will, based on the 
institu tions’ own targets and projections, come under pressure.51 Participating banks stated 
that the low- interest- rate environment is for -
cing them to replace higher- yielding credit and 
securities transactions, as they mature, with 
new positions that generate a lower rate of re -
turn. As explained above, funding costs are di -
minishing at the same time, but credit institu -
tions need to keep deposit rates in positive ter -
ritory for business policy and competitive rea -
sons. Looking ahead, these developments will 
squeeze margins in banking business consider -
ably, although the currently positive economic

Increased risk propensity in 
low- interest- rate environment?
The risk- taking channel describes how an ex -
pansionary monetary policy stance – brought 
about, for example, by quantitative easing  – 
creates an incentive to take on greater risks.53 
Here, an expansionary monetary policy leads 
not only to growth in bank lending – as is gen -
erally described in the context of other monet -
ary policy transmission channels – but can also 
lead to higher-  risk lending overall. If, all in all, 
“too many” risky projects are being funded, the 
likelihood of a future financial crisis can in -
crease.
Thus, the risk- taking channel describes how 
monetary policy measures, especially a change 
in the policy rate or the interest rate path, alter 
perception of risk and/or risk tolerance.54 The 
risk- taking channel therefore encompasses the 
impact of monetary policy measures on the 
perceived or measured risk of investment port -
folios, asset valuation and funding costs.55 Un-
like other monetary policy transmission chan -
nels, such as the interest rate channel or ex -
change rate channel, the risk- taking channel is 
less tightly circumscribed; rather, it comprises a 
range of mechanisms.56 It can exert its influ -
ence in various ways.57
First of all, a search for yield can increase the 
propensity to run risks. An expansionary mon -
etary policy stance –  brought about, for ex -
ample, by quantitative easing – normally leads 
to a reduction in nominal yields. Those financial 
market participants whose long- term liabilities 
are nominally fixed owing to contractual or 
statutory obligations are then potentially pre -
pared to make riskier investment decisions with 
higher expected returns in order to meet their 
profit targets. For example, instead of com -
paratively safe government bonds, financial 
market participants could invest in higher-  interest- bearing securities which, however, typ -
ically come with higher risks.58
In addition, an expansionary monetary policy 
normally has the effect of raising asset prices, 
which lead to increased lending via the balance 
sheet channel and are ultimately reflected in 
higher aggregate income streams. An eco -
nomic stimulus induced in this way, however, is 
likely to influence financial market participants’ Expansionary 
monetary policy stance can contribute  to excessive  
 risk- taking
This can occur in 
various ways …
… via the 
“search for yield” or …… through 
rising  asset 
prices and 
income streams
52 Given the improvement in their capital base over the 
past few years, the resilience of the German banks is never -
theless considered strong overall. See A Dombret (2015), 
The impact of low interest rates – results of a survey among 
German banks, Statement for a media briefing on the low- 
interest-  rate survey conducted by the Bundesbank and 
BaFin, 18 September 2015.
53 It should be remembered here that a low policy rate in 
itself does not necessarily imply an expansionary monetary 
policy stance. That depends in decisive measure on the 
level of the “natural rate of interest”, ie on the interest rate 
which is compatible with price stability.

taking and monetary policy: a missing link in the transmis -

55 G Dell’Ariccia, L Laeven and R Marquez (2014), Real 
interest rates, leverage, and bank risk- taking, Journal of 
Economic Theory 149, pp 65-99 develop a microeconomic 
partial equilibrium model for which two assumptions es -
sentially suffice for the existence of a risk-  taking channel. 
The first of these is the assumption of limited liability and 
commercial banks’ possibility to choose the riskiness of 
their portfolios by themselves. However, since the portfo -
lio’s risk is not directly observable to creditors, the commer -
cial bank’s capital structure plays a decisive role. The 
second assumption is that commercial banks’ financing 
costs are a function of the level of a risk- free reference rate. 
On the basis of these assumptions, risk- taking is deter -
mined largely by three partly conflicting forces or aspects: 
a pass- through effect, a risk- shifting effect and the degree 
of leverage. The authors find that a reduction in the risk-  
free interest rate generally leads to increased risk- taking.

risk perception.59 For example, with rising asset 
prices and higher income streams, financial 
market participants will typically reckon with 
fewer defaults and sinking asset price volatility, 
which could, in turn, encourage them to take 
on additional risks.
Empirical studies confirm the existence of the 
risk- taking channel. For instance, in both Eur -
ope and the United States, there is evidence of 
a positive correlation between falling short-  
term interest rates and the granting of bank 
loans to borrowers with lower credit ratings.60 
Indications of this can also be seen outside of 
the banking sector. For the United States, for 
example, it could be shown that both money 
market funds and pension funds added riskier 
assets to their portfolios during periods of low 
interest and following the implementation of 
non- standard monetary policy measures; in 
other words, they intensified their “search for 
yield”.61, 62 However, the results of these studies 
differ with respect to the strength of the risk-  
taking channel, meaning that no reliable as -
sessment can currently be made to quantify the 
significance of this channel for monetary policy.
Finally, it should be noted that the specific form 
of the risk- taking channel is likely to depend on 
the monetary policy regime. If the central bank 
is operating in a “normal” interest rate environ -
ment, a monetary policy- induced interest rate 
cut is usually associated with a steepening of 
the yield curve, since short- term interest rates 
typically have a stronger reaction to rate cuts 
than long- term interest rates. This tends to 
have a positive effect on expected earnings 
and thus on banks’ perceived resilience.
By contrast, if the central bank wants to make 
its monetary policy more expansionary at the 
zero lower bound and, for example, wishes to 
reduce long- term interest rates through bond 
purchases, this tends to have a flattening effect 
on the yield curve. A “search for yield” is then 
more likely to contribute to the risk- taking 
channel. Amongst other things, this could be 
reflected in investors not only opting for riskier financial instruments but also switching to 
other forms of investment such as property. 
This potential dependence on the interest rate 
environment makes it even more difficult to 
gauge the current significance of the risk- taking 
channel, since the end of the observation 
period of many empirical studies was either 
prior to or coincided with the onset of the 
finan cial crisis in 2007-08. Thus, these studies 
do not cover the period after the zero lower 
bound on interest rates was reached and the 
asset purchase programmes were launched.
Summary and outlook
Against the backdrop of subdued inflation pro -
spects and falling market-  based inflation ex -
pectations at the zero lower bound on interest 
rates, quantitative easing measures were intro -
duced in the euro area with the objective of 
bringing about a sustained adjustment to the Quantitative

59 This aspect of the risk- taking channel bears a certain 
resemblance to the “financial accelerator” in that, due to 
credit market imperfections, a reduction in the monetary 
policy rate will ultimately lead to an increase in borrowing 
and in aggregate demand, therefore amplifying the original 
monetary policy stimulus through feedback effects.

path of inflation in line with the goal of achiev -
ing inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over 
the medium term. As the euro area has had no 
experience with quantitative easing to date, 
model- based analyses play a major role in 
evaluating these non- standard monetary policy 
measures. The estimates presented in this art -
icle show, in particular, that the various model 
approaches differ considerably in terms of how 
they evaluate the effectiveness of quantitative 
easing on macroeconomic developments and 
inflation, and that there is great uncertainty 
surrounding its effects. These models demon -
strate, all other things being equal, that quanti -
tative easing can have an expansionary effect 
on aggregate demand and inflation.
In addition to the risk of an increasing nexus 
between monetary and fiscal policy, possible 
side effects of quantitative easing in a low-  interest- rate environment include risks to finan -
cial institu tions’ profitability and a heightened 
propensity to run risks. These side effects and 
the realisation of the risks associated with the 
ultra- expansionary monetary policy may, in 
turn, affect price behaviour and monetary poli -
cymakers’ ability to maintain price stability. 
Monetary policymakers should therefore not 
lose sight of these effects of their policies. The 
longer the highly accommodative stance re -
mains in place, the more likely its side effects 
are to deepen. This is why monetary policy, 
which is currently using expansionary measures 
in a bid to lift inflation from its very depressed 
level, must usher in the normalisation of mon -
etary policy once it reaches a price path that is 
compatible with the Eurosystem’s stability tar -
get – irrespective of the state of public finances 
or financial stability.… but quantita-
tive easing can also entail risks and unwanted side effectsDeutsche Bundesbank

Structure and dynamics of manufacturing 
production depth as reflected in the 
financial  statements of German enterprises
In the discussion about Germany’s position as an industrial location and the establishment of 
new production strategies in connection with the increasing international division of labour, the 
value added of the non- financial corporate sector is often the focus of interest in the sphere of 
economic policy. Empirical analyses of this key reference variable for the productive activity and 
economic output of industries and sectors are based almost exclusively on national accounts 
data.
This study enhances this approach by drawing on data from the Bundesbank’s corporate financial 
statements statistics, the aggregated variables of which move virtually in parallel with the national 
accounts data. By incorporating the microdata on enterprises’ balance sheets and income state -
ments which underlie these statistics, it can be shown that a strong relationship exists between 
the various business models and the degree of production depth.
The aggregated results clearly show that the value added increase in the manufacturing industry 
during the period between 1997 and 2012 did not keep pace with the expansion in output. 
Rather, intermediate consumption is gaining ever more in importance owing to the growing pro -
pensity to outsource and shift corporate activities, with the result that the production depth has 
declined on a permanent basis. Nevertheless, the contribution of industry to the total value added 
of all non- financial corporations in Germany has changed only insignificantly, although major 
differences can be seen at the sectoral level.
The analysis of the microdata shows that around one- quarter of enterprises generate more than 
half of their output internally and, contrary to the overall economic trend, have, in some cases, 
even increased the depth of their production. These enterprises, which mainly operate as very 
flexible small companies in regional markets with made- to- order or small- batch production pro -
cesses or which are found in the SME sector of the specialised capital goods industry, achieve a 
very high return on sales with predominantly in- house production; this, however, is associated 
with perceptibly slower growth dynamics. Their business model is subject to special conditions, 
which do not apply to the majority of enterprises in the manufacturing industry.Deutsche Bundesbank

Value added and production 
depth as approaches for 
measuring and modelling 
the economic structure
Production depth – the ratio of value added to 
gross revenue – is a key reference variable for 
macroeconomic structural analyses of indus -
tries or economic sectors. This ratio, which is 
derived from the output approach of the na -
tional accounts, quantifies in- house production 
as a share of total output and reflects the de -
gree of vertical integration in production pro -
cesses.1 Given the growing international div -
ision of labour and the associated modernisa -
tion strategies of the industry, questions such 
as these are increasingly the main focus of eco -
nomic policy analyses at present.2
From a business perspective as well, the choice 
between producing products and services in -
ternally or procuring them externally (“make-  
or- buy” decision) is a key issue within the 
framework of strategic corporate planning and 
supply chain management. The last decade, 
espe cially, has seen a systematic management 
of the production depth and a continuous shift 
of operational activities in value-  added chains 
and networks in the manufacturing industry. A 
study recently published by the Eurosystem’s 
Competitiveness Research Network (CompNet) 
clearly shows that the division of labour in the 
production of goods and services in the form 
of global value- added chains and networks 
has, in many areas, now emerged as the pre -
dominant production strategy worldwide.3 
Here, the spectrum stretches from more 
hierarchy-  driven to more market-  related forms 
of coordination, ranging from a shift of pro -
duction activities to subsidiaries and asso ciated 
companies, the establishment of joint ventures 
and networks, to the outsourcing of produc -
tion to third- party companies. In doing so, 
enter prises can make use of production capaci -
ties and production locations both domestically 
(nearshoring) and abroad (offshoring).4National and international studies alike on this 
topic typically draw on national accounts re -
sults. However, these data provide an insuffi -
cient basis for more nuanced structural ana -
lyses as it is not only a sector- specific differenti -
ation of the results that is required, but also 
breakdowns by corporate characteristic, such 
as size and legal form. The relationships be -
tween business models, the organisation of 
production and the resulting impact they have 
on the various balance sheet and income state -
ment ratios of manufacturing enterprises in 
Germany are also of central importance in this 
context. Such questions can be extensively ana -
lysed using the Bundesbank’s microdata, which 
are also used as the underlying data basis for 
this study.5
Factors determining the 
depth of production
From a production theory perspective, deter -
mining the optimal production depth is primar -
ily a cost- based decision, although the defin -
ition and substance of the expense items in 
question can differ significantly. If the question 
of the optimal production depth is boiled down 
to a straightforward outsourcing decision, ie 
the choice between external procurement and 
complete in- house production, the difference 
between internal production cost and external 
market prices constitutes the relevant decision- 
making parameter. Viewed from this angle, Production

outsourcing production activities to third par -
ties will always be the more favourable option 
if, in the short view, the market price demanded 
in the procurement markets is lower than the 
variable cost of in- house production or, from a 
long- term perspective, if the outsourcing costs 
are lower than the total cost of in- house pro -
duction.6
These considerations can be linked up to the 
accumulation of generic competitive advan -
tages, which can be achieved mainly through 
cost leadership and by focusing on the core 
business.7 By specifically harnessing the advan -
tages of specialisation and the cost- cutting po -
tential offered by economies of scale, econ -
omies of scope and learning curve effects, busi -
nesses strive to achieve the biggest possible 
cost advantage over the competition and to 
consequently strategically secure their market 
position, as a low unit cost provides particularly 
effective protection against rivals. As far as 
managing the production depth is concerned, 
this results in the systematic outsourcing of 
those product areas which are not top per -
formers and which are suboptimal from a pro -
duction cost and competitive perspective.
Instead of the straightforward, dichotomous 
choice to either “make or buy”, the decision-  
making problem can, however, also culminate 
in setting different degrees of vertical integra -
tion and thus creating intermediary forms of 
organisation between market- and hierarchy-  
driven arrangements. Here, the main focus is 
on the transaction cost resulting from the 
transfer of rights of disposal and activities be -
tween enterprises. These comprise initiation 
cost, agreement cost, settlement cost, moni -
toring cost as well as adjustment cost and are 
the outcome of imperfect markets in which 
agents operate with bounded rationality and 
opportunistic and supposedly risk- neutral be -
haviour.8 Given that exogenous environmental 
factors and conduct risk among market players 
give rise to transaction- related uncertainty and 
that cost- reducing effects, economies of scale 
and synergy effects can be realised with a growing number of identical transactions, the 
minimisation of transaction cost plays a de -
cisive role when determining the degree of ver -
tical integration.
Another point that can be included in such 
optimisation  considerations is that the exist -
ence of imperfect factor markets means that 
tangible and intangible resources are distrib -
uted heterogeneously across enterprises and 
therefore constitute, primarily in the form of 
knowledge- based core competences, the piv -
otal basis for realising comparative competitive 
advantages and sustainable revenue surpluses.9 
Such strategically distinctive resources are char -
acterised by the fact that they are seen by cus -
tomers as adding value, but also as being diffi -
cult to imitate, hard to substitute and scarce. 
All areas of activity must therefore be checked 
during production planning to see whether 
they contain any strategic resources. Insofar as 
the latter are used during production, external 
procurement measures would run up a high 
opportunity cost by neutralising competitive 
advantages. Hence, only those products and 
services whose production does not require 
any such core competences should be out -
sourced. Joint ventures, meanwhile, come into 
play as intermediary solutions whenever an 
enter prise’s own pool of resources is outdated 
and they open up an opportunity to acquire 
new core competences from competitors, or if

must also be factored into this costing model in the form 
of the contribution margin lost as a result of other produc -
tion activities not being carried out.

markets.10
It is to be assumed that in the business oper -
ations of globally active enterprises, all the the -
oretical explanatory factors will ultimately play 
a more or less important role in determining 
the production depth. However, the respective 
weight of these factors is likely to be influenced 
by economic dynamics and the attendant ad -
justments that need to be made in a highly 
competitive global environment.
Data and study design
The present study is based on data taken from 
the Bundesbank’s corporate financial state -
ment statistics for manufacturing enterprises 
for the period from 1997 to 2012.11 This com -
prehensive stock of single- entity financial state -
ments can be used to representatively model 
the situation in manufacturing by extrapolating 
distributions and to drill down the national 
account  aggregates to the firm level.12 The fol -
lowing will first examine whether the national 
account aggregates can be coherently mod -
elled with the results of the corporate financial 
statement statistics, which is a prerequisite for 
carrying out further structural studies with the 
microdata. Based on extrapolated corporate 
finan cial statement data, an analysis will then 
be made of the longer- term developments and 
the distribution of value added and production 
depth by sector. The second part of the study 
focuses on factors determining value added 
and production depth at the enterprise level. 
For this purpose, enterprises are grouped by 
degree of production depth so that a compari -
son can be made between the extrapolated 
ratios of the group of enterprises with high 
production depth and those of the remaining 
enterprises. This study also looks into the ques -
tion of what bearing the diverging business 
models of enterprises with different degrees of 
production depth have on the balance sheet 
and income statement. The study concludes by 
analysing developments in the results of oper -ations and net assets of these two groups over 
the last 15 years.
Developments in industrial 
value added and production 
depth in the corporate 
financial  statement statistics
Our analysis starts out by comparing develop -
ments in the gross and net value added aggre -
gates taken from the national accounts with 
the extrapolated results from the Bundesbank’s 
corporate financial statement statistics for the 
manufacturing industry in the period between 
1997 and 2012. The gross value added series 
show an almost identical pattern, albeit only 
from 2000 and only up to 2011.13 The observed 
deviation in annual results remains at less than 
2%. Net value added moved in a similarly syn -
chronous fashion, but with levels diverging by 
just over 10% per year, the gap over the period 
as a whole is far wider. These stronger devi -
ations in the net variables are due primarily to 
differences in the statistical recording of depre -
ciation in the Federal Statistical Office’s struc -
tural surveys and the corporate financial state -Empirical

11 1997 was the starting date for the Bundesbank’s data 
pool. It provides a consistently coherent data history be -
cause it not only has a uniform classification scheme but 
also ensures that the information has a high level of com -
pleteness.
12 The statistical data for the manufacturing industry ex -
trapolated for the population are based on around 23,000 
financial statements per year. The individual dataset for the 
2012 financial year contains financial statements from al -
most 21,000 manufacturing enterprises. The data are ex -
trapolated using the expansion by ratio estimate broken 
down by sector, legal form and size category on the basis 
of sales figures from the company register. It is inevitable 
that the variance of the extrapolated aggregates will tend 
to be understated, as only group arithmetic means are 
weighted and not the firm- level data. For more information 
on the extrapolation procedure see Deutsche Bundesbank,

corporate balance sheet statistics, Monthly Report, Octo -
ber 1998, pp 49-64.
13 The even sharper divergence in the series from 1997 to 
1999 is likely to be due to the build- up phase for the data 
pool, while the discrepancy last year is a result of the data 
in the Bundesbank’s corporate financial statement statistics 
still being incomplete at the current end.Deutsche Bundesbank

ment statistics.14 For all the methodological 
discrepancies, a comparison of the results as a 
whole shows that the dynamics are strongly 
aligned, even in different phases of the eco -
nomic cycle. This finding is a major precondi -
tion for investigating value added aggregates 
at a more disaggregated level based on finan -
cial statement data and for calculating indica -
tors derived therefrom that shed light on struc -
tural changes in the German economy.
According to the extrapolated results of the 
Bundesbank’s corporate financial statement 
statistics, gross and net value added in manu -
facturing rose by just over one- third on average 
across all areas of activity in absolute terms in 
the 1997-2012 period under review (see the 
table on page  60). They thus increased only 
around half as strongly as output or gross rev -
enue plus other operating income. Growth in 
value added variables was far weaker because 
intermediate consumption has become increas -
ingly important, both in the form of raw mater -
ials, consumables and supplies and services 
purchased. Intermediate consumption roughly 
doubled in value in the period under review. 
This is because enterprises have increasingly 
outsourced functional areas of operational ac -
tivities to third parties or shifted them into 
value chains and networks.
On balance, manufacturing industry is showing 
a sustained trend toward lower production 
depth. The period under review saw this indica -
tor fall by 6 percentage points from 29.3% to 
23.3% in gross- value- added terms.15 The im -
portance of intermediate consumption pur -
chased for output has increased steadily in all 
areas of economic activity to the extent that in 
2012 only a quarter of the enterprises analysed 
were still generating at least half of their out -
put internally. This is a pervasive structural pat -
tern, irrespective of the legal form and firm size 
under analysis and whether activities are more 
likely to rank among the winners or losers of 
structural change in industry. Ultimately, these 
truly far- reaching shifts in the production struc -
ture mean that, for many enterprises and parts of industry, production and manufacturing 
activ ities which, by rights, are typical hallmarks 
of this sector, are increasingly playing second 
fiddle; this is also making it more and more dif -
ficult to categorise them in the industry stand -
ard classification system.
The other areas of the non- financial corporate 
sector are also moving in this direction, with 
the result that the relative share of manufactur -
ing in the value added of non- financial enter -Trend towards

14 The Federal Statistical Office notes in this regard that it 
is practically impossible to record depreciation for the 
national  accounts data using a uniform measurement 
approach  and figures therefore have to be estimated, at 
least in part. See O Hennchen (2006), Strukturdaten zum 
Verarbeitenden Gewerbe. Methoden und Ergebnisse der 
Strukturerhebungen 2004, Wirtschaft und Statistik , No 7, 
p 738. The figures for the corporate financial statement 
statistics are collected on the basis of largely uniform de -
preciation rules under tax law which are also likely to be 
utilised given that such write- downs are tax deductible.

gross value added, as does the present study, as it means 
that the aggregates calculated using both counting 
methods have the closest match.Deutsche Bundesbank

prises in Germany as a whole – in both gross 
and net terms – has shown only minor changes 
throughout the period under review. The share 
in 2011 was even unchanged against the start -
ing year at 40.5%; there was a difference of 
only ½ percentage point in net terms. The cor -
porate financial statement data therefore pro -
vide no empirical evidence to indicate a signifi -
cant structural shift in the German economy 
towards the services sector.16
However, this overall picture of German indus -
try suggesting a relatively stable underlying 
pattern turns out to be far more nuanced and 
much more dynamic in a sector- based analy -
sis.17 Above- average growth in both gross and 
net value added can be ascertained for the 
manufacture of transport equipment, machin -
ery and equipment, and computer, electronic 
and optical products and electrical equipment; 
this is associated with a perceptible increase in 
these sectors’ shares in the total value added of 
manufacturing (from 1 to 4 percentage points). Developments moved in the opposite direction 
in the manufacture of textiles, apparel, leather, 
leather goods and shoes and of wood and 
paper products and printing. In the period 
under review, these sectors saw a distinct de -
cline in value added, both gross and net, in ab -
solute terms, which resulted in a substantial fall 
in their contribution to total value added in 
manufacturing. Although below- average, the

16 However, such studies based on a sector classification 
also do not show the actual extent of the increase in 
production- related services which are included in both 
intermediate consumption and in- house production.
17 Note, however, that the problem of the growing share 
of services in industrial output is barely visible in the corpor -
ate financial statement statistics because much of the 
service- related intermediate consumption is impossible to 
isolate as a component of other operating expenses. More -
over, information on services purchased as a sub- item of 
cost of materials is not consistently available for all financial 
statements. According to the data extrapolated for manu -
facturing, they only amounted to around 10% overall and 
grew in proportion with the cost of materials, which is not 
consistent with the results of other empirical studies. See, 
for example, A Eickelpasch (2014), Funktionaler Struktur -

development of value added is at least still 
positive in absolute terms in other parts of 
manufacturing.18 Measured in terms of their 
share of value added, the importance of these 
sectors, which in any case represent only a 
small section of German industry, has dimin -
ished again somewhat, with the gross and net 
ratios dipping by as much as 1  percentage 
point. The metal- working industry is something 
of an exception; it managed to broadly main -
tain its position in the sector comparison, and 
its value added is in line with the manufac-
turing average. One reason for this is that al -
though output in this industry showed a strong 
increase, the positive effect was slightly over -
shadowed by the marginally sharper growth in 
intermediate consumption.
The findings show that the reduction in pro -
duction depth, which has seen individual sec -
tors experience a fall in their share of value 
added in the wake of intra- industrial structural 
change, differs from one sector to another. In the wood, paper and printing industry, for ex -
ample, below- average output growth has coin -
cided with a noticeable rise in the intensity of 
intermediate consumption, while the textiles 
and leather industry has even seen further rises 
in the intensity of intermediate consumption in 
conjunction with an absolute fall in the output 
volume. The structural change at the sectoral 
level sketched out in this article thus follows a 
pattern commonly seen in advanced econ -
omies, with the focus of production shifting 
ever further away from commodity-, labour- 
and capital- thirsty activities towards knowledge- 
intensive and technology- driven manufacturing 
structures, which are a major feature of the 
capital goods industry in particular.

The textiles, apparel, leather and shoes sector, 
the chemicals and pharmaceuticals industry, 
and the transport equipment manufacturing 
sector all have a low production depth, albeit 
for different reasons. In Germany’s textiles in -
dustry, cost considerations have pushed much 
of production – with the exception of technical 
textiles  – to low- wage countries since the 
1970s.19 By contrast, the situation in the chem -
icals and pharmaceuticals industry is largely the 
result of the particular production conditions 
required for the manufacture of industrial and 
base chemicals, the need for large quantities of 
commodities meaning that this sector has no 
more than a very low value added share. As for 
the transport equipment manufacturing sector, 
production depth is mainly low here because 
this sector has been a frontrunner in the cre -
ation of global value added chains and net -
works for many years, primarily with the aim of 
tapping new markets, optimising production, 
and increasing competitiveness.20Production depth is higher for the manufacture 
of machinery and equipment, the manufacture 
of basic metals and fabricated metal products, 
the manufacture of computer, electronic and 
optical products and electrical equipment, the 
manufacture of wood and paper products and 
printing, and for the manufacturing sectors 
grouped under the heading “other” as well.21 
The main reason for this is likely to be their spe -
cial production conditions. Indeed, customer-

20 Many car manufacturers and suppliers spun off entire 
development functions and components plants to subsid -
iaries or associated companies, transferred responsibility 
for supplying production facilities to logistics service pro -
viders, handed over model development to engineering 
partners and relocated the production of niche models to 
affiliated enterprises at home or abroad.

ments probably call for a high level of in- house 
production in these sectors.
The differences in the sector- specific arithmetic 
means for production depth suggest that the 
theoretically derived factors “transaction cost” 
and “specificity of factor use” can go a long 
way towards explaining production depth. 
Since sector, as a characteristic, is very highly 
correlated with production technology and re -
search and knowledge intensity, it is possible to 
clearly separate individual sectors where the 
use of advanced technologies, a high degree of 
technological specialisation, and research- and 
knowledge- intensive production play an espe -
cially important role. This is particularly the case 
in the manufacturing industry (above all the 
manufacture of machinery and equipment, the 
manufacture of computer, electronic and op -
tical products and electrical equipment, and 
the manufacture of basic metals and fabricated 
metal products).22
Comparison of enterprises 
with varying degrees of 
production  depth
Structural differences exposed by the sectoral 
breakdown can be analysed in an even more 
nuanced fashion by grouping the manufactur -
ing enterprises contained in the Bundesbank’s 
data pool for the 2012 financial year by pro -
duction depth and then comparing them. 
These data are likewise extrapolated to achieve 
the most representative results possible. This 
comparison places the focus, above all, on 
those enterprises that buck the general trend 
by continuing to operate with a very high pro -
duction depth. To isolate these particular enter -
prises, the extrapolated distribution is divided 
into quartiles, with the top 25% of enterprises, 
accounting for just under 29,500 of the almost 
118,000 manufacturing firms, being assigned 
to the group with a high degree of production 
depth, ie over 50% in- house production. The 
remaining enterprises, numbering just over 
88,000, are represented by the control group of enterprises with a low or medium level of 
production depth (ranging from more than 6% 
to 50%).
As expected, the sector- specific differences in 
the distribution of production depth are also 
reflected in the structural profile of the extrapo -
lated sectoral composition of the groups of en -
terprises with a high and low value added level. 
Sectors with an, on average, low share of in-  
house production are far less common in the 
group of manufacturing- intensive enterprises 
than those with high levels of in- house produc -
tion. This can be seen clearly with the sectors 
that manufacture textiles, apparel, leather and 
shoes, and transport equipment, where the 
share in the control group is nearly three times 
as high as that of enterprises with a high de -
gree of production depth. The metal- working 
industry and the residual group of enterprises 
are significantly overrepresented in this latter 
category, with the sector for the manufacture 
of computer, electronic and optical products 
and electrical equipment also being slightly 
overrepresented.
Clearly, production depth also varies with 
enter prise size. 96.1% of enterprises with a 
high degree of manufacturing intensity belong 
to the category of smaller enterprises with sales 
of less than €10 million, just 2.9% are medium- 
sized enterprises (sales from €10 million to less 
than €50 million), and only 0.7% are large 
enter prises (sales from €50 million and more). 
In the control group, meanwhile, only 82.9% 
are small enterprises, 12.0% are medium- sized 
enterprises and no less than 5.1% are large 
enter prises. The breakdown of production 
depth by legal form correlates with that by size 
category. Thus, the share of non- corporations Relevance of

22 Although the dispersion is quite similar in the sector 
comparison, with highly symmetrical curves, it must not be 
forgotten that the high degree of aggregation in the 
double- digit economic activities in no way implies the 
grouping- together of uniform production structures. A 
more nuanced view ought to be taken here, but the avail -
able data do not allow this. Moreover, as already men -
tioned, the extrapolation procedure systematically causes 
an underestimation of variance.Deutsche Bundesbank

among manufacturing- intensive enterprises is 
around 7 percentage points higher than for the 
control group, with the exact inverse being 
true for corporations. This is consistent with 
the finding that standalone enterprises make 
up just over 10 percentage points more of the 
group of manufacturing- intensive enterprises 
than of those which generate less than half of 
their output internally.
A comparison of selected balance sheet and in -
come statement ratios reveals just how funda -
mentally the business models of enterprises 
with a high degree of production depth differ 
from those for which intermediate consump -tion accounts for the bulk of their gross rev -
enue. Looking at the assets side there is, as 
might be expected, a sizeable difference in the 
deployed capital stock. Investment in fixed cap -
ital by enterprises with overwhelmingly in-  
house production amounts, on average, to 
38.3% of total assets, which is 11 percentage 
points higher than in the control group of 
enter prises with a low or medium level of pro -
duction depth. The latter only have a tangible 
fixed asset ratio of 27.3%, which shows that 
substantial in-  house manufacturing operations 
call for a corresponding capital stock. This also 
explains the large differences in the depreci -
ation ratios of both groups, the figure of 5.3% 
for the manufacturing- intensive enterprises 
being nearly twice that of the other enterprises.
Similarly striking differences can also be seen in 
inventory levels. The inventories- to- total- assets 
ratio for enterprises with a high level of in-  
house production stands at 15.1%, which is just 
over half that of companies that largely out -
source production (27.0%). The higher propor -
tion of capital tied up in the form of inventories 
is due, above all, to large buffer stocks of work 
in progress, finished goods and merchandise. 
These enterprises hold large- scale inventories 
with a view to cushioning production risks and 
maintaining a strong capacity to deliver goods 
to downstream buyers in the process chain. A 
likely factor here is that the ability to optimise 
logistics management in the form of flexible 
order contracts or just- in- time deliveries, and in 
doing so, to shift inventory risk to suppliers 
tends to be largely the preserve of particularly 
large enterprises and powerful players in the 
procurement market.23 As is to be expected, 
trade receivables at enterprises with a high de -
gree of intermediate consumption is likewise 
perceptibly higher than for the group of enter -
prises with a low level of outsourced produc -
tion. Businesses that focus on in- house produc -

and unforeseeable expenses, which is reflected 
in a cash- to- total- assets ratio that is about one- 
quarter higher. Various empirical studies have 
found clear evidence that there is an exchange 
relationship of a kind between maintaining 
such a liquidity buffer and drawing on short-  
term liabilities .24
While the manufacturing- intensive firms can 
generally be expected to have a markedly 
higher equity capital ratio than the others (be -
cause they also strive for a certain degree of 
financial autonomy), the difference is not that 
great, as these enterprises also take up external 
funds on a considerable scale, particularly in 
the form of bank liabilities. Liable capital makes 
up 30.3% of the total assets of manufacturing- 
intensive firms, which is only 4  percentage 
points higher than the corresponding figure for 
the other enterprises (26.3%). Bank liabilities 
account for 33.5%, constituting a gap of al -
most 7 percentage points, with differences in 
both short- term and long- term liabilities being 
recorded. This suggests that the higher level of 
bank borrowing is partly attributable to less re -
course being made to trade credit and intra-  
group financing. In the case of trade payables, 
the ratio of the enterprises in the fourth quar -
tile (11.5%) is only about half as high as that for 
the other manufacturing enterprises. For group 
liabilities, the latter are almost 4  percentage 
points ahead. It therefore also appears plaus -
ible that firms in the first to third quartiles 
– which are integrated to a greater extent in 
group structures and can also cover their fund -
ing requirements via intra-  group sources – are 
less inclined to cultivate their equity capital be -
cause, if need be, a group financing vehicle or 
the group parent will raise the external funds 
and cover the loans with their liable capital.
The manufacturing- intensive enterprises fare 
much better in terms of the performance meas -
ures derived from the income statement.25 At 
9.5%, their return on sales was more than 
three times as high as that of the control group. 
This reflects the fact that, at an arithmetic 
mean of 61.7%, the manufacturing- intensive firms’ gross value added ratio is almost twice as 
high as that of enterprises with a high level of 
intermediate consumption (33.7%), which, of 
course, also has something to do with group -
ing the enterprises according to production 
depth. A key determinant of the differences in 
the returns on sales is the considerably lower 
cost of materials, which, at 21.6%, is just over 
28 percentage points below the comparative 
value for firms with a high level of intermediate … and in

25 These major differences are not primarily caused by the 
divergent composition of the two groups, consisting of 
corporations and non-  corporations, and thus by the im -
puted entrepreneur’s remuneration that is to be taken into 
account for the latter. The arguments put forward against 
this are that there is only a 6 percentage point difference in 
the shares of non- corporations in the two groups and the 
gap between the respective annual result before taxes is 
just as marked. Furthermore, even if the corporations and 
non- corporations are viewed in isolation, there are still 
large differences in the returns of the manufacturing-  
intensive enterprises and the other enterprises.Deutsche Bundesbank

consumption (49.7%). A low production depth 
results per se  in a significantly lower return on 
sales, but this should not necessarily be taken 
as indicating that the return on equity is corres -
pondingly poor. The fact that the ratio of net 
income for the year to gross revenue for enter -
prises with a large production depth is particu -
larly high is primarily due to an overall more 
favourable cost structure, which can be seen in 
the operating result with a gap of almost 
26 percentage points. The very significant dif -
ferences in production cost are mainly down to 
comparatively low personnel expenses, which, 
in the case of manufacturing- intensive enter -
prises, do not fully offset the cost advantages 
of sourcing less intermediate consumption. For 
enterprises with a high production depth, the 
ratio of personnel expenses to gross revenue 
comes to 44.1%, while the cost- of- materials 
ratio is only 21.6%. By contrast, firms that pre -
dominantly procure products and services ex -
ternally and thus have a very high material cost 
(49.7%), record a disproportionately lower comparative value of 26.1% for personnel 
expenses  . Overall, this means that these two 
expense items amount to 65.7% of gross rev -
enue for manufacturing-  intensive enterprises, 
while for the other enterprises they make up a 
considerably greater share of 75.8%. This im -
pacts in full on returns and explains why the 
return on sales after taxes of the manufactur -
ing enterprises under review in the fourth quar -
tile is more than three times as high.
Judging by the empirical findings presented 
earlier in this article, one could be led to con -
clude that the increased division of labour as 
well as the close-  knit German economy, with 
the associated high degree of specialisation 
and attendant outsourcing of production, are 
down to a lack of competitiveness and a poor 
performance by domestic industry. That line of 
thinking is put forward, for instance, in studies 
on the import content of German exports, … different cost 
and revenue structures

which sometimes depict the German economy 
as a type of bazaar economy.26
However, a longer- term comparison of devel -
opments in value added, output and earnings 
of the two groups of enterprises under review 
over the course of the last 15 years shows that 
the economic reality is more complex and con -
siderably more nuanced. As was made clear by 
the study results presented above, the enter -
prises with a high degree of production depth 
that the study focuses on are primarily small 
enterprises which operate very successfully, 
generally in regional markets, using production 
strategies based on “made to order” or small- 
batch manufacturing. However, there is also a 
group of larger medium- sized manufacturing 
firms which have succeeded in carving out an 
excellent market position and sustainably im -
proving their performance, also on a longer-  
term basis, by intensifying their in- house pro -
duction in research- and knowledge- intensive 
as well as technologically specialised niche 
sectors . These enterprises were able to further 
increase their gross income, value added and 
operating result from an already very high level 
by around 4  percentage points during the 
period under review, and thus to almost double 
their return on sales on a sustainable basis 
– measured in terms of the annual result after 
taxes – compared with the start of the observa -
tion period in 1997.27 However, this strong 
earnings performance goes hand in hand with 
fairly moderate growth in the business volume 
(+26%) and the company size or total assets 
(+73.8%) during  the 15 years under review. By 
contrast, enterprises with a low or medium 
production depth saw reductions of between 
3  and 4 percentage points in their gross in -
come, value added and operating result and 
were only able to marginally improve their prof -
itability from 2.7% to 3.1%. However, these 
comparatively unfavourable developments in 
the cost and earnings structure of these firms 
were accompanied by significantly more dy -
namic growth in the business volume and total 
assets. While sales went up by 69%, total 
assets saw as much as a two- fold rise.In summary, based on these findings, the con -
clusion can be drawn that the reduction in pro -
duction depth caused by the changes in the 
global division of labour and new global pro -
duction strategies has tended to weigh on the 
earnings structure of the majority of manufac -
turing enterprises in Germany. By contrast, 
however, these firms have reaped even greater 
benefits from international trade and growth in 
the global economy by breaking into new sales 
markets and gaining new customers. This had 
a lasting positive impact on the long-  term 
growth trend of German industry, as clearly 
illus trated by a recent Bundesbank study of 
value added flows.28 In this respect, opening 
up German industry to a more international 
division of labour was a very suitable strategy 
for success in a globalised economy.
Conclusion
Changes in the global economic setting have 
brought about lasting structural change in the 
manufacturing industry over the last 15 years. 
While the industry’s overall contribution to 
gross domestic product has remained broadly 
stable, the weightings of individual sectors of 
this key area of the German economy have 
shifted considerably, with the capital goods 
sector benefiting from a marked process of 
intra- industry structural change.
Microdata analysis has shown that the produc -
tion strategies and the associated business 
models are sometimes very different even 
within individual sectors. On the one hand, 
alongside the bulk of typical small enterprises 
with manufacturing- intensive “made to order” 
and small- batch manufacturing, the manufac -
turing industry also comprises very successful, Increase in

more medium- sized enterprises in highly spe -
cialised, research- and knowledge- intensive 
high- tech areas, sometimes with a niche char -
acter. Both groups of enterprises have a rela -
tively high value added combined with a higher 
production depth and, thanks to their strong 
market position, are able to generate returns 
on sales that far eclipse the averages. However, 
this comes at the price of below- average sales 
growth.
By contrast, for the vast majority of industrial 
enterprises operating internationally, opening 
up the industry to a more global division of 
labour  and less favourable cost and earnings 
structures was a recipe for success in a global -
ised world economy and an effective way of 
participating in full in global growth. The asso -
ciated growing decline in production depth 
also seems to have driven the increased group 
formation observed in Germany, as the out -
sourcing of production and services requires subsidiaries and joint ventures to be set up or 
shareholdings to be acquired.29 In the single-  
entity financial statements, this phenomenon is 
reflected in a massive upturn in businesses 
interlinking their production and financing 
opera tions. The efficient management of this 
mounting complexity and the increased mutual 
dependencies is a key reason for the economic 
strength of German industry. Modelling these 
multifaceted sectoral developments in the non- 
financial corporate sector precisely and reliably 
presents an entirely new set of statistical chal -
lenges, particularly with regard to the provision 
of integrated macro and micro information.30Production shift

turns will decrease, at least in part, if group entities are
