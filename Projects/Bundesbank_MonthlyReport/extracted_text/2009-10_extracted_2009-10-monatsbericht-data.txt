5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Underlying trendsIn the third quarter of 2009, the German
economy recovered further from the cyclicallow it had entered following the downturn inthe final quarter of 2008 and the first quarterof 2009. There were a number of key factorsin this development. Following the reductionof inventories and with continuing signs of aneasing of tensions in the financial markets,demand for goods and services has beenpicking up for some time, and confidence inthe business outlook has been restored. Thefurther improvement in the internationalsetting also played an important part in this.By contrast, industrial investment, especiallythe procurement of machinery and equip-ment, is likely to have declined. Private con-sumption is unlikely to have generated anyfurther stimuli in the third quarter. Firstly,there was a slight decline in retail sales. Sec-ondly, there was a marked fall in the numberof purchases of private cars in the third quar-ter compared with the exceptionally highlevel recorded in the previous quarter. Thisdecline occurred before the funds made avail-able for the car scrapping scheme had beenexhausted at the beginning of September.
IndustryThe discernible upturn in demand for indus-
trial goods continued in August as well. Sea-sonally adjusted new industrial orders were1.4% up on the order volume for July, whichhad been boosted considerably by a majorarmaments order. On an average of theEconomy

6period of July and August, new orders were
73/C254% up on the level of the second quarter;
excluding the aforementioned special factor,the growth figure still amounted to 5
3/C254%. As
in the second quarter, domestic and foreignorders of intermediate goods rose quitesharply in the first two months of the thirdquarter as well. Excluding the temporary fac-tors in the automotive sector and the majorarmaments order, the pace of growth in thecapital goods industry was significantly moresubdued both with regard to domestic ordersand export customers. So far, there has beenno upturn in consumer goods; orders for con-sumer goods had previously declined muchless sharply, however.
Compared with the order situation, the re-
covery in industrial output has been rathermoderate so far. Industrial output in July andAugust combined was up by a seasonally ad-justed 1.9% on the quarter, yet there was nosignificant growth compared with the two-month period of May and June. Combiningmonthly results is particularly advisable withregard to the current situation, as the month-ly growth rates, which rose by 2.0% inAugust following a 1.0% decline in July, wereinfluenced by the exceptional way in whichthe holidays fell in the summer of this year.Significantly more intermediate goods wereproduced in the first two months of the thirdquarter (6%) than in the second quarter. Likemanufacturers of consumer goods, producersof capital goods, too, suffered slight losses onthe whole (-
1/C252%). This was due primarily to a
further sharp fall in the production of ma-chinery and equipment.Economic conditions in Germany*

7Domestic sales of industrial goods in July and
August rose by a seasonally adjusted3/C254%o n
the second quarter in real terms. The increasein intermediate goods, at 4
1/C252%, coincided
with a 21/C254% decline in capital goods. Never-
theless, there was a marked rise in the exportsales of German industry. The value of ex-ports of goods in July and August went up bya seasonally adjusted 5% on the quarter. Thecorresponding figure for imports of goodsstood at 3
1/C252%. With only minor changes in
the external price relationships, the foreigntrade surplus showed a significant increaseon the second quarter in seasonally adjustedterms.
ConstructionConstruction output in August, at a seasonal-
ly adjusted 4.2%, went up comparativelysharply on the month. This has now offsetthe decline in construction activity since theweather-related recovery at the beginning ofthe spring. Construction demand in July– more recent data are unavailable at present –went up by a seasonally adjusted 3
1/C252%o n
the quarter. Additional stimuli were gener-ated by nearly all the major subsectors, withresidential construction providing a verystrong boost. There was a perceptible slow-down in road construction, however, follow-ing three months of strong growth.
Labour marketDespite a gradual increase in pressures, the
recession is still having only a very muted im-pact on the labour market. As in the previousmonth, there was only a slight fall in thenumber of persons in work in August accord-
ing to initial calculations by the Federal Statis-tical Office. The year-on-year figure remainedunchanged at -0.4%. The number of employ-ees subject to social security contributionslikewise showed little change in July. As inAugust, the number of new registrations forshort-time work in September was just under100,000. The leading indicators point to afurther contraction in employment. The BA-Xindex remained broadly unchanged, albeit ata very low level. The Ifo employment barom-eter for trade and industry deteriorated againsomewhat.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment – based
on the current statistical definition – fellslightly to 3.46 million in September. Withoutthe changeover in the labour market statis-tics, however, the seasonally adjusted un-employment figure would have risen byaround 10,000 on the month. The officialunemployment figure showed a year-on-yearincrease of 266,000. The unemployment ratein the reporting period, at 8.2%, was 0.6 per-centage point up on the previous year’s level.
PricesInternational crude oil prices fell somewhat in
September after a sharp rise in August. Thisreflected continued weak demand and thelarge crude oil stocks in the United States. AtUS$68
1/C254on a monthly average, the spot
price for a barrel of Brent North Sea oil was6
1/C254% lower than in August. However, prices
have been rising again sharply during themonth of October so far. As this report wentto press, the spot price stood at US$74

six-month and 18-month deliveries respect-ively.
Prices at the upstream stages of the economy
rose again in August after seasonal adjust-ment. This was not due solely to the earlierrise in crude oil prices. Intermediate goodsalso became significantly more expensive,whereas the prices of capital and consumergoods showed little change. On the whole,imports were 1.1% more expensive than inJuly in seasonally adjusted terms, althoughthey were still just over one-tenth down onthe year. The rise in producer prices of indus-trial products, at 0.7%, was somewhat weak-er than in the previous month; the year-on-year decline fell to 6.9%.
Following a fairly sharp rise of 0.5% in
August, consumer prices fell by a seasonallyadjusted 0.2% in September. There was asharp decline in the cost of petrol and heatingoil owing to the lower crude oil prices. Sea-sonally adjusted food prices remained largelyunchanged. The cost of industrial goods (ex-cluding energy and food) went up slightly.Price reductions in the case of package holi-days and air travel led to a month-on-monthdecline in the cost of services. Overall con-sumer prices in September, according to thenational consumer price index, were 0.3%down on the year after remaining unchangedin the previous month. According to theHarmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP),the year-on-year rate of inflation was -0.5%,compared with -0.1% in August.Public finances

Local government finances
The preliminary cash statistics data from the
Federal Statistical Office show a further de-terioration in the budgetary situation of localgovernment in the second quarter of 2009.After recording a surplus of 33 billion a year
earlier, it posted a deficit of just over 31 bil-
lion. The decline in revenue accelerated con-siderably (-5% or 32 billion) compared with
the previous quarter. This was almost entirelydue to the sharp drop in tax receipts. The fallin (net) revenue from trade tax continued togather significant pace (-25%), while receiptsfrom local government’s share of joint taxesfell only moderately. By contrast, grants fromstate government of categories which arelargely linked to the level of tax revenue esti-mated in state government budgets – but arealso influenced by differences between esti-mates and results from previous years – in-creased again somewhat (+2
1/C252%o r 31/C254bil-
lion). Receipts from fees and state govern-ment investment grants, which also includeFederal Government subsidies under thesecond stimulus package that are only grad-ually being claimed, were again below theprevious year’s figures.
Total expenditure rose significantly (+5

9city of Stuttgart’s 31 billion participation in
the capital increase of Baden W/C252rttemberg’sLandesbank, LBBW. After adjustment for thisspecial effect, the increase in expenditure wassignificantly smaller (+3%) and the deficitwas also correspondingly lower. Year-on-yeargrowth in personnel costs (+3
1/C252%o r 31/C252bil-
lion) and other operating expenditure (+3%or3
1/C254billion) was more moderate than in the
previous quarter but still considerable, andspending on social benefits also increased by3% (or 3
1/C254billion). However, the Federal Stat-
istical Office regularly stresses that, owingto the ongoing introduction of commercialdouble-entry book-keeping, the results cur-rently have to be interpreted very carefullyand year-on-year comparisons in particularcan be distorted, above all, by possible under-recordings in the first half of 2008.
2Spending
on investment in fixed assets remained virtu-ally unchanged (-
1/C252%). The investment pro-
gramme adopted as part of the second eco-nomic stimulus package did not yet have anyeffective impact on cash statistics data in thesecond quarter (see comments on pages 24and 25).
Despite the deficit, the decline in credit mar-
ket debt continued in the second quarter. Itfell by 3
1/C252billion to just under 375 billion at
the end of the quarter. At the same time,however, the volume of short-term cashadvances was increased again by 31 billion
(to332
1/C252billion), providing evidence of the
growing strain on many local governmentbudgets. Nevertheless, a large number oflocal governments had apparently also builtup sizeable reserves in recent years, whichcan be used to finance deficits. These reserveswill probably shrink considerably in the com-
ing quarters. Particularly in view of the likelycontinuation of the sharp decline in revenuefrom local business tax and considerablyhigher spending on personnel as a result ofwage increases and, probably increasingly, onsocial benefit payments, the outlook remainsgloomy. Despite the high surplus it recordedin 2008, local government is likely to post asignificant deficit for 2009 as a whole and– owing chiefly to the continued marked de-cline in tax revenue, a reduction in grantsfrom state government of categories whichare largely linked to the level of tax revenueand a possible continuation of the rise in so-cial benefit payments – the deficit is likely toincrease further in 2010.Local government fiscal

10Excessive deficit procedure initiated against Germany
In the Treaty establishing the European Community
(hereinafter EC Treaty) – which is concretised and
supplemented by the European Stability and Growth
Pact – the member states of the European Union
committed themselves to avoiding excessive deficits.
In particular, the provisions stipulate that the gov-
ernment deficit ratio may exceed 3% only in narrow-
ly defined exceptional cases; the reference value for
the debt ratio is 60%. The objective is to safeguard
sound public finances and to aid the Eurosystem in
maintaining price stability. To ensure compliance
with these provisions, an early warning system for
undesirable developments in government budgets
and a sanction mechanism were set up. Through this
early warning mechanism, the Federal Government
of Germany informed the European Commission in
July 2009 that it expects a deficit ratio of 3.9% and a
debt ratio of 73.9% for this year.1
In response, the European Commission presented a
report on 7 October 2009 pursuant to Article 104(3)
of the EC Treaty examining whether the planned
overshooting of the reference values falls under the
exemption clauses. The deficit reference value may
be exceeded without the deficit being classified as
excessive if three conditions are all met at the same
time. First, the reference value may only be over-
shot in exceptional circumstances. The Commission
considers this criterion to have been fulfilled for
Germany as the overshooting comes in connection
with a severe economic downturn. Second, the def-
icit must remain close to the reference value. The
Commission does not regard this condition to have
been met as a deficit ratio of 3.9% has been report-
ed. Third, the reference value may be exceeded
only temporarily. This criterion, too, is not con-
sidered by the Commission to have been fulfilled as,
according to its spring 2009 forecast, the deficit
would rise to 5.9% in 2010 without consolidation
measures. This constitutes a breach of the deficit cri-
terion. The reference value for the debt ratio may
exceptionally be exceeded if it is sufficiently dimin-
ishing and approaching the reference value at a sat-
isfactory pace. The Commission also finds that this
requirement has been breached as the debt ratio is
set to reach almost 74% in 2009 and, according to
the Commission’s spring 2009 forecast, almost 79%
in 2010. In due course, the Commission will have to
decide whether to advise the Ecofin Council to for-
mally declare that Germany has an excessive deficit
and determine what deadline, if any, it proposes
for correction. The Ecofin Council could deliver its
judgement on the matter before the year is out.
Pursuant to the Stability and Growth Pact, an exces-
sive deficit should, as a matter of policy, be correct-ed during the year after it has officially been de-
clared – in this case, if a decision is taken before the
end of this year, in 2010. However, in light of the ex-
ceptional financial and economic crisis and the asso-
ciated downside risks, the Commission and the
Council recommended – also for Germany – an ex-
pansionary fiscal policy for 2010. The deadline for
correction may be extended in exceptional circum-
stances. If Germany were not required to correct its
excessive deficit until 2012 – three years after it is
likely to be officially declared – this could be justi-
fied on the grounds of the special situation. How-
ever, a longer deadline does not seem appropriate
for Germany as things currently stand. If the add-
itional stimulus measures are implemented as
planned in 2010 and no further decisions that
would, on balance, increase the deficit are taken
– which would, in any case, contravene the provi-
sions of the Stability and Growth Pact – a structural
consolidation of just under 1% of GDP would be re-
quired from today’s perspective in both 2011 and
2012 in order to comply with the 3% limit in 2012.
A substantial part of this would be achieved purely
through the fact that some of the temporary stimu-
lus measures will cease to have an effect on the
budget. For this reason – and given the sharply in-
creasing debt level and the foreseeable macroeco-
nomic stabilisation – the remaining adjustment re-
quirement seems both achievable and warranted.
Delaying consolidation would also jeopardise com-
pliance with the national budgetary rules, which
stipulate a substantial reduction in central and state
government deficits.
Alongside Germany, an excessive deficit procedure
was initiated against eight other countries at the
beginning of October, meaning that proceedings
are currently open against 20 of the 27 EU coun-
tries. The situation and outlook in the individual
member states differ widely in some cases, however.
All in all, it is essential that, following the often dra-
matic deterioration in their budgetary positions in
the wake of the financial crisis, all affected coun-
tries rapidly correct their excessive deficits and, in
addition, ensure that unduly high debt ratios are
reduced and that their public finances are sustain-
able in the long term. The European Commission,
the Council and the member states of the European
Union are responsible for safeguarding the credibil-
ity of the budgetary rules – especially in times when
there is a large adjustment requirement – and en-
suring fiscal discipline in the member states in the
long term.
1On 1 October 2009, the Federal Government reported a
deficit ratio of 3.7% and a debt ratio of 74.2% to theEuropean Commission. However, the Commission’s report
is based on the figures disclosed in July 2009.

11Securities markets
Bond marketIn August 2009, the issue volume in the Ger-
man bond market increased to 3146.0 billion
in gross terms (compared with 3112.6 billion
in the previous month). After deducting re-demptions and taking account of changes inissuers’ holdings of their own bonds, thevolume of outstanding domestic bonds in-creased by 311.9 billion, compared with a re-
duction of 313.5 billion in July. The outstand-
ing amount of foreign debt securities, in par-ticular those denominated in euro, fell by33.2 billion. Therefore, the total outstanding
volume of bonds in Germany rose by 38.6 bil-
lion.
German credit institutions increased their
capital market debt by 38.6 billion in the re-
porting month. This increase was focused ondebt securities issued by specialised credit in-stitutions ( 37.9 billion) and other bank debt
securities, which can be structured especiallyflexibly ( 34.7 billion). By contrast, there were
net redemptions of public Pfandbriefe ( 33.7
billion) and mortgage Pfandbriefe ( 30.3 bil-
lion).
In August, the public sector raised 33.8 bil-
lion in the capital market. The outstandingamount of Federal debt securities increasedby32.1 billion. Sales were concentrated pri-
marily on ten-year Federal bonds (Bunds) andTreasury discount paper (Bubills) totalling31.7 billion and 31.2 billion respectively. By
contrast, five-year Federal notes (Bobls) wereredeemed to the tune of 30.4 billion, aswere, to a lesser extent, Federal Treasury
financing paper, Federal savings notes andtwo-year Federal Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze)(each 30.1 billion). State governments raised
31.7 billion net in the capital market.
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises
redeemed bonds to the total of 30.5 billion
after having issued bonds totalling 31.7 bil-
lion in net terms in July.
Foreign investors were the sole net pur-
chasers in the German bond market in Au-gust, adding debt securities with a total valueof317.3 billion to their portfolios. By con-
trast, both domestic non-banks and domesticcredit institutions reduced their holdings (by34.8 billion and 33.9 billion respectively).
While non-banks primarily sold domestic se-curities in net terms, credit institutions chieflysold foreign bonds.
Equity marketIn the month under review, domestic enter-
prises issued 31.5 billion worth of new shares
in the German equity market, almost all ofwhich involved listed companies. By contrast,the outstanding amount of foreign shares inthe German market was down by 30.5 bil-
lion. Equities were purchased primarily byforeign investors ( 34.8 billion) but also by
domestic non-banks ( 30.6 billion). This was
counterbalanced to a degree by net sales bydomestic credit institutions totalling 34.4 bil-
lion.Sales of debt

12Mutual fund shares
Domestic mutual funds sold shares totalling
30.6 billion net in August (July 2009: 34.2 bil-
lion). Specialised funds reserved for institu-tional investors were the only net sellers ofshares ( 30.7 billion) whereas funds open to
the general public recorded slight outflows(30.2 billion). In particular bond-based funds
(30.5 billion), money market funds ( 30.2 bil-
lion) and share-based funds ( 30.1 billion) re-
purchased their own shares, while open-endreal estate funds and mixed securities fundswere able to sell shares in net terms ( 30.4 bil-
lion and 30.2 billion respectively). Foreign
funds traded in the German market also re-corded outflows ( 30.1 billion). Domestic non-
banks and credit institutions were the solenet purchasers of share certificates ( 30.5 bil-lion and 30.3 billion respectively). By contrast,
foreign investors sold 30.3 billion net worth
of fund shares.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus – in unadjusted terms – of 34.6 billion in
August 2009. The result was thus 36.8 billion
down on the month. This can be attributedto a smaller trade surplus and a larger deficiton invisible current transactions, which com-prise services, income and current transfers.
According to provisional figures of the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the foreign trade sur-plus in August decreased by 36.0 billion on
the month to 38.1 billion. After adjustment
for seasonal and calendar variations, it fell by31.9 billion to 310.6 billion. The value of ex-
ports fell by 1.8% while the value of importsgrew by 1.1%. However, seasonally adjustednominal exports for July and August com-bined were 5.1% above the second-quarteraverage. The corresponding seasonally ad-justed nominal imports rose by 3.6%.
The deficit on invisible current transactions
grew to 32.7 billion in August compared with
a minus of 31.4 billion in the previous month.
The main reason for this was the 31.1 billion
rise in the deficit on services to 34.3 billion,
which was largely holiday-related. In addition,the deficit on current transfers went up by30.4 billion to 33.1 billion. By contrast, net re-
ceipts from cross-border income rose slightlyfrom 34.5 billion to 34.7 billion.Sales and purchases

13In August, cross-border portfolio investment
resulted in net capital imports of 322.4 bil-
lion, compared with comparatively high cap-ital outflows in July ( 333.0 billion). This shift is
principally attributable to foreign portfolio in-vestors, who invested funds in Germany inAugust ( 318.6 billion) after selling domestic
securities in large quantities in the previousmonth ( 316.7 billion). In the main, they pur-
chased German debt securities ( 317.3 billion),
mostly longer-term papers. They also ac-quired a small amount of shares ( 31.6 billion).
Additional capital inflows stemmed from thedecline in German investment abroad ( 33.9
billion). German investors primarily sold debtsecurities ( 33.2 billion).
Direct investment in August resulted in net
capital inflows of funds ( 32.1 billion). The
main reason for this was the supply of cap-ital to German subsidiaries from their non-resident parent companies ( 36.8 billion). Con-
versely, domestic enterprises also providedtheir foreign branches with capital ( 34.6 bil-
lion) – above all, through raising existingequity stakes and in the form of reinvestedearnings.
Other statistically recorded investment com-
prising financial and trade credits (wherethese do not constitute direct investment) aswell as bank deposits and other assets sawnet outflows of funds from Germany of321.5 billion in August. Non-banks account-
ed for 35.5 billion of this sum. The activities
of enterprises and households resulted in cap-ital exports in the amount of 38.2 billion,

15The development of
government investmentFor some time now, general govern-
ment investment in Germany has dis-played a downward trend. Given theresultant falling capital stock ratiocoupled with a rising debt ratio, theoverall government asset position hasdeteriorated sharply over time. Owingto foreseeable high budget deficits,this trend is set to continue in the com-ing years. Looking further ahead, how-ever, the newly adopted debt rulescould reverse this development.
Investment in infrastructure is essential
for macroeconomic growth. However,it is almost impossible to determinethe optimal size of government capitalstock. Ultimately, each investment mustbe examined to determine whether itmakes economic sense and whether itwould be better accommodated in thegovernment or the corporate sector.This should also be borne in mindwhen assessing the decline in govern-ment investment in Germany which, inrecent years, has also resulted in partfrom the diminishing catch-up require-ment in eastern Germany. Governmentinvestment for the purpose of stimu-lating the economy is meaningful only– and on a limited scale – in times ofextraordinary crisis. One desirable ob-jective would be to stabilise the levelof local government investment, whichhas been procyclical in the past.

ment for the purpose of asset formation orpreservation. Investments are often made inareas that are of key importance for macro-economic growth prospects. However, thedefinition of investment can vary considerablydepending on the underlying concept. In thisarticle, investment is defined in the narrowersense of acquisition of financial and non-financial assets and not in the very broadsense including human or social capital. Thisarticle describes and analyses the develop-ment of general government investment inGermany, first from a longer-term perspectiveon the basis of the national accounts, whichbasically record the acquisition of non-financial assets. This is followed by a moredifferentiated exposition and classification ofthe changes over the past decade based onthe broader definition of investment used in
the central, state and local governmentbudgets and the associated government fi-nancial statistics.

Government non-financial assetformation and macroeconomic aspects
Overview and long-term tendenciesThe national accounts document a clear long-
term decline in government investment in re-lation to gross domestic product (GDP).
2They
record a fall from just over 41/C252% in the early
1970s amid fluctuations to 11/C252% in 2008,
which is low also by international standards(see chart on this page and box on page 17).By subtracting the consumption of fixed capitalrecorded in the national accounts, the devel-opment of net capital formation can also bederived. In relation to GDP , it initially fellsharply from just over 3% in 1970 to
1/C252%i n
the mid-1980s. After rising briefly on theback of German reunification, this measurehas actually been slightly negative since2003.
This is also reflected in a clear fall in the ratio
of the government capital stock to GDP . It isGovernment gross and

17true that government net fixed assets as re-
ported at replacement cost in the national ac-counts rose from 51% of GDP in 1970 to61% in the early 1980s (see chart on page 18),which was partly due to an increase in the re-corded value of the capital stock owing to aparticularly sharp price hike in public sectorconstruction. But thereafter the ratio fell,apart from some brief rebounds such as inthe initial post-reunification years, to 44% in2007. However, certain data restrictions mustbe borne in mind. For instance, changes inthe purchase price of existing capital stockare hard to gauge and the outsourcing ofsmaller entities is not sufficiently document-ed.
3Furthermore, undeveloped land, subsoil
assets and water resources are not includedin the calculations and the value of landunderlying buildings and structures has like-wise been excluded.
If land underlying buildings and structures
4is
included, government non-financial assetsamounted to about 50% of GDP in 2008.However, given the high level of general gov-ernment debt well in excess of the stock offinancial assets, this is offset by sharply nega-tive net financial assets which amounted to45% of GDP at the end of 2008. Govern-ment net worth was thus largely consumed.If no retrenchment measures are taken, theoverall asset position will deteriorate evenfurther in the next few years. If the implicitInternational comparison of
government investment
The national accounts data, which are collected in ac-
cordance with uniform rules, permit an internationalcomparison of general government investment. In theEU, at 1
1/C252%, Germany recorded a very small ratio of
government gross capital formation to gross domestic
product (GDP) in 2008, as it had done in previousyears. Only Austria, which has hived off major serviceentities, such as central government real estate and
motorway construction, from its general government
budgets, recorded a noticeably lower figure of 1%(see table below). At 5
1/C252% each, Ireland and the new
member states of Bulgaria, Estonia and Romania, who
received sizeable investment grants from the EU
budget, recorded the highest figures. But the ratiosin “old” member states such as Spain, France, theNetherlands, Sweden and Luxembourg were likewise
more than twice as high as in Germany. Outside the
EU, Japan recorded a comparatively high investmentratio of more than 3% in 2008, as did the UnitedStates, as a result of extensive economic stimulus
measures. However, international comparisons seem
to be hampered also over time by large differences inthe general ratio of public to private service provisionand in the outsourcing of infrastructure services from
general government budgets – even more so than in
the national context (see the comments in the sectionon explanatory factors regarding the decline in non-financial asset formation, pages 30f).

At the macroeconomic level, the ratio of gov-
ernment to private sector investment has alsodecreased noticeably – from a high of 20% inthe mid-1970s to barely 8% in 2008, al-though it should be noted that private invest-ment is far more volatile than government in-vestment, presumably for cyclical reasons (seechart on page 19). The ratio of governmentto overall net fixed assets has likewisedeclined. However, here the decrease fromalmost 19% in the early 1980s to just under14% in 2008 is less drastic on balance, inter
alia owing to the longevity of many infra-
structure investments.Government investment and growth
Investment in areas where services are trad-
itionally provided by the government sector isessential for potential output and macroeco-nomic growth (see box on pages 20 and 21).This concerns, in particular, the need for awell developed infrastructure. In addition toan adequate transport infrastructure, thiscomprises municipal utilities and disposal sys-tems and, in particular, educational facilitiesas well as those non-financial assets that arerequired for public administration and secur-ity.

A comprehensive assessment of governmentinvestment needs to consider not only thelong-term growth effects in isolation but alsotheir costs. This includes the financing cost,which in most cases ultimately takes the formof compulsory payments with distortionaryeffects. It must also be borne in mind that pri-vate investors could be crowded out and thatinvestments entail follow-up costs for govern-ment budgets. The overall result does notnecessarily always favour higher governmentinvestment. Furthermore, it is not possible toclearly define the optimal government capitalstock above which the additional costs of fur-ther investment would exceed the additionalbenefits, which depend partly on the prefer-ences of the inhabitants.Government net assets *

19Ultimately each case must be examined on its
merits to determine whether the benefits ob-tained by government investment outweighthe costs and whether non-financial asset for-mation is best performed by means of gov-ernment or corporate sector investment. Forinstance, investments or entire areas of oper-ations can be outsourced from governmentbudgets, where necessary, via new, morecost-efficient organisational structures. A ser-vice can then be provided by the private sec-tor in return for cost-covering fees or the gov-ernment can still be directly responsible buthire the facilities required that are set up andmaintained by a private contractor.
6One of
the issues that must be considered when se-lecting an organisational structure is whetherthe cost savings achievable by using privateservice providers are large enough to covertheir profit margins and the usually highercost of financing. The decision will dependnot least on the underlying framework, suchas antitrust legislation or the rules for award-ing contracts, but also on the public adminis-tration’s effectiveness in framing the contractprovisions and monitoring performance. Evenin the case of natural monopolies, such asmany supply and transport networks, govern-ment investment is not necessarily required.
7
Given that a long-term contractual relation-ship is necessary in this area, however, par-ticular caution must be exercised with regardto the detailed terms and conditions.
By international standards, Germany’s infra-
structure is currently rated as being “verygood”, in particular regarding basic provision(transport and communications, electricity,gas and water supply).
8However, a numberof studies also see some room for improve-
ment, not least given low government invest-ment during the past few years and infra-structural deficits in eastern Germany.

20Deutsche BundesbankStudies on the relationship of government investment with economic growth
In the empirical economic literature, the relationship be-
tween government investment and macroeconomic growth
is investigated using a number of different approaches. We
can distinguish between studies based on production func-
tions, those using a cost or profit function approach, inves-
tigations applying time series econometric methods and
analyses of the optimal public capital stock.1
In the production function approaches,2the public capital
stock is modelled either directly as a factor in an aggregate
production function or indirectly through its effect on a
productivity parameter of the production function. The
elasticity of gross domestic product (GDP) with respect to
changes in government investment is calculated empirical-
ly on the basis of this production function. However, the
validity of these approaches is disputed. They require far-
reaching and controversial assumptions regarding the for-
mulation of the aggregate production function. Moreover,
such studies face an endogeneity problem: thus while the
aim is to examine the impact of government investment on
growth, growth can also affect government investment.3
Furthermore, such studies often ignore the financing ofpublic investment and the associated macroeconomic costs.
By potentially disregarding both the interpendencies be-
tween investment and economic growth and the financing
costs, it is possible that such studies significantly overstate
the impact of government investment on economic devel-
opment. All in all, the results of empirical studies using a
production function approach – some of which find very
large growth effects of government investment
4– are
therefore to be interpreted very carefully.
Instead of the aggregate analysis of the macroeconomy ap-
plied in the production function approaches, studies basedon cost and profit functions examine the effects of public
investment on private-sector enterprises’ labour and cap-
ital costs and the associated output and growth effects.
One important focus of these approaches is whether pri-
vate investment is crowded out by public investment. Em-
pirical studies for Germany find only very limited evidence
of this.5In some studies, moreover, no evidence could be
found that government investment has any impact on the
costs of private enterprises.6As most investigations using
this approach analyse specific economic sectors, their abil-
ity to reliably assess the impact of government investment
on overall macroeconomic growth is limited.
Time series econometric studies – which use vector autore-
gression (VAR) or vector error correction (VEC) models – de-
termine all variables endogenously, can capture dynamic
adjustment processes and factor in indirect (feedback)
effects between the variables. This means, for example,
that possible interdependencies between government in-
vestment and economic growth can be taken into account.
However, it should be noted that these analyses, too, rely
on far-reaching assumptions regarding the economic rela-
tionships between the variables included.7Most time series
econometric studies find that investment has a substantial
positive impact on economic growth.8Nonetheless, the re-
sults depend heavily on the variables included, the precise
specification of the model and the assumptions regarding
the financing of government investment. When inter-
preting the results of these studies, it is important to note
that the inclusion of additional explanatory variables or
changes in the specification and economic assumptions can
clearly reduce the estimated impact of government invest-
ment. All in all, the time series econometric studies must
likewise be interpreted with caution. Although there are

contribution is D A Aschauer (1989), Is public expenditure productive?Journal of Monetary Economics 23(2), pp 177-200. — 3Econometric
techniques applied in empirical production function studies in orderto take account of the interdependencies between investment andeconomic growth include, for example, the simultaneous analysis ofthe determinants of investment and growth (the “simultaneousequation approach” is applied, for example, in H Esfahani andM T Ram/C237rez (2003), Institutions, Infrastructure and EconomicGrowth, Journal of Development Economics 70, pp 443-477), the useof more robust estimation methods in which the results are not influ-enced as heavily by the interdependencies between the two variables(eg the application of a generalised method of moments (GMM) esti-mator in C Ai and S P Cassou (1995), A Normative Analysis of PublicCapital, Applied Economics 27, pp 1201-1209) or reliance on instru-mental variables (see, for example, C Calder/C243n and L Serv/C216n (2002),The Output Cost of Latin America’s Infrastructure Gap, Central Bankof Chile Working Paper No 186). However, the number of studies ap-
plying these techniques is limited and most studies analyse US data ora cross-section of a large number of countries. This complicates theapplicability of the results to Germany. — 4For calculations for Ger-
many using this approach, see C Kamps (2006), New Estimates of Gov-ernment Net Capital Stocks for 22 OECD Countries 1960-2001, IMFStaff Papers 53, pp 120-150, or P O Demetriades and T P Mamuneas(2000), Intertemporal Output and Employment Effects of Public Infra-structure Capital: Evidence from 12 OECD Economies, Economic Jour-nal 110, pp 687-712. — 5See H Seitz (1994), Public Capital and the De-

21some indications that public investment has a positive im-
pact on economic growth, these effects are difficult to
quantify, and the inference that government investment is
worthwhile per se does not seem warranted.
Attempts to determine the optimal public capital stock for
maximising aggregate value added are generally promis-
ing in terms of their policy implications as they explicitly in-
clude the financing side of government investment9and
aim to estimate the effects of additional public investment
on the basis of existing public capital stock. One of these
approaches, by Conrad and Seitz (1994),10concludes that
Germany’s public capital stock tended to be undersized
from 1961 to 1979 and oversized from 1980 to 1988. In
more recent studies the optimal capital stock is calculated
on the basis of a non-linear relationship between govern-
ment investment and economic growth, and can therefore,
for instance, incorporate diminishing marginal returns on
public investment which might be accompanied by a rise in
capital stock.11Kamps’ (2005) application of this method
finds little evidence that Germany’s public capital stock is
too small, although the investment ratio at the beginning
of this decade is estimated to be too low to maintain pub-
lic capital stock at the optimal level. However, it should be
remembered that the more recent studies, too, can only
gauge the optimal capital stock fairly roughly and, more-
over, rely on far-reaching and, indeed, critical assump-
tions.12Another problem of these approaches – and of
macroeconomic models in general – is their inability to ad-
equately capture aspects relevant to concrete investment
decisions, such as the optimal response to specific instances
of congestion or quality problems affecting public infra-
structure.In addition to those already mentioned, other important
factors are omitted from most studies. In particular, due ac-
count should be taken of the fact that most public infra-
structure items are collective goods. The congestion effects
that occur in connection with such goods (eg traffic jams)
lend weight to the idea that – contrary to the assumption
in most studies to date – government investment and eco-
nomic growth are probably linked by a non-linear rela-
tionship. Another drawback of many empirical studies is
that expenditure categories with possibly greatly varying
growth impacts (eg investment in road construction or in
social services and healthcare) are lumped together in the
investment data. Studies that examine the effects of clearly
delineated subcategories of government investment offer
more in this respect.13Finally, studies in political economy14
show that government investment decisions are oftendriven by political rather than economic criteria, which
might dampen the associated growth effects.
In summary, the current literature generally finds that gov-
ernment investment has a positive impact on macroeco-
nomic growth; however, the results of such studies are
heavily influenced by the underlying assumptions and im-
portant aspects are omitted. Furthermore, studies on the
optimal public capital stock that investigate the effects of
additional investment based on the current level and take
explicit account of financing aspects suggest that, at most,
only limited expenditure rises for public investment are
warranted in Germany.

1989, Mittnik and Neumann (2001) estimate that additional public in-vestment leads to a significant increase in GDP – fully effective withinone year – equivalent to three times the amount invested.

22Government investment and
the business cycle
Besides its role in longer-term macroeconom-
ic development, government investment issometimes also considered an economic pol-icy tool in cyclical downturns. It is expected tohave a comparatively high short-term multi-plier effect on economic activity as the gov-ernment sector creates demand directly, thusensuring that leakages as a result of highersaving are not as substantial, and the importshare is relatively low.
However, a number of fundamental objec-
tions to discretionary macro-management ofthe economy apply especially to governmentinvestment. For instance, government invest-ment is associated with a lengthy planningphase and is carried out predominantly atthe subordinate level of local government.Furthermore, given the primary focus onparts of the construction sector, there is a riskthat the stimulus from such measures may re-main restricted to a relatively small part of theoverall economy which soon reaches full cap-acity utilisation, so that the impact largelyfades into sectoral price increases.
10
In the last thirty years, these constraints andexperiences prevented the goal of kick-starting the economy from playing a majorrole in government investment in Germany.Nevertheless, the development of govern-ment investment since 1980 in particular hasbeen procyclical, mainly owing to local gov-ernment activities (see also section on page 23).This is likely to reflect the interplay of sharpcyclical fluctuations in local government taxrevenue as well as state government transfers
and local government budgetary rules, theaim of which is rightly not to stabilise eco-nomic activity (see page 30).
However, the stimulus packages that have
been implemented since the final quarter of2008 to support economic activity lean heav-ily on government investment measures. Byfocusing on smaller-scale construction pro-jects spread throughout the regions, whichcan be completed relatively quickly, and onthe acquisition of moveable capital goods,the aim is to achieve the key economic policygoals of rapid implementation and broad im-pact. To accelerate this process, the govern-ment even eased the regulations governingthe award of contracts. However, the outflowof funds was slowed down by other factors –not least, the institutional features of Germa-ny’s federal political structure (see box onpages 24 and 25).
Insofar as government investment is currently
being expanded for fiscal stimulus reasons,care must be taken – not least given the re-cent signs of macroeconomic stabilisation –to ensure that due account is taken of theprinciple of cost-effectiveness. In contrast toa targeted structural rise in investment, meas-ures that are motivated solely by short-termcyclical considerations should aspire less to in-crease the capital stock or indebtedness thanto bring forward already planned invest-
10For example, the effect of the “Future Investment Pro-
gramme”, which was adopted in 1977, was not actually
felt until the next upswing and finished as this petered
out in 1980. This hence procyclical timing ultimately
played a substantial role in the sharp rise in construction
prices during this period.Government

24Deutsche BundesbankGovernment investment in the second fiscal stimulus package
To counteract the effects in Germany of the exceptionally
strong global economic slowdown, the German govern-ment launched two fiscal stimulus packages. A first pack-age of measures adopted in autumn 2008 included inter
aliaa temporary rise in central government investment in
transport infrastructure totalling 52 billion. This was
soon followed in January 2009 by a further stabilisationprogramme for 2009 and 2010 with a total volume of justunder 550 billion. In addition to permanent reductions in
income tax and a cut in the health insurance contributionrate, a key feature of the package is a temporary increasein general government investment
1of just under 5171/C252
billion (including state and local government’s share of
just under 531/C252billion). In this context, the debt-financed
central government special fund “Investment and Re-demption Fund” was set up in early March.
2The adminis-
trative agreement regulating implementation betweencentral government and all the state governmentsentered into force at the start of April. Investments eli-gible for subsidisation begun by the end of 2010 can nowbe principally financed by the fund as long as the in-voices are submitted by 2011 at the latest. It is planned touse at least half of the volume of funds during 2009.
Public procurement rules were temporarily eased so as to
expedite the stabilisation impact of the measures. In par-ticular, the thresholds up to which contracts can beawarded on a discretionary basis or via a limited tenderwere raised significantly. Possible cost savings from usingthe standard tender procedure were consequently subor-dinated to the aim of quickly reviving economic activity.
54 billion is available to central government from the
fund. As well as increasing investment in transport by 52
billion, a further 52 billion is to be used for building res-
toration, departmental needs and IT procurement. In ac-cordance with the Future Investment Act ( Zukunftsinves-
titionsgesetz ),510 billion is being set aside to help fund
state and local government projects (they must bear atleast a quarter of the total costs themselves as additionalco-contributions). 56
1/C252billion of the fund’s resources is
to be allocated to the education and training infrastruc-ture (including infant support and research) and 53
1/C252bil-
lion to other infrastructure measures (excluding sewer-age and local public transport). It was agreed that atleast 70% of investment is to be carried out by local gov-ernment.The 2006 federal structure reform placed relatively tight
restrictions on the promotion of state and local govern-ment investment by means of central government grants.Pursuant to Article 104b of the Basic Law, central govern-ment could assist such projects only if it had legislativecompetence in the respective area. The Future Invest-ment Act of March 2009 thus stipulates that the promo-tion of investment in educational buildings is coupled toenergy-saving measures and the promotion of municipalroad construction is restricted to noise abatement meas-ures. Article 104b of the Basic Law was modified by virtueof the 2009 federal structure reform, which entered intoforce at the end of July. In cases of special emergency,central government can now also provide investmentsubsidies without legislative authority. Ahead of thisregulation, central government had indicated that theassessment of compliance with the promotion provisionswould be based on the legislative status quo at the time
the relevant measure is completed. However, owing tothe risk of central government reclamations of funds inthe event of inappropriate use, there seemed little pointin awarding investments beyond the defined boundariesbefore the constitutional amendment was definitivelypassed. After the reform, the previously decreed narrowsub-constitutional legal restrictions on the use of subsid-ies were not amended, so that the permissible scope ofapplication of the funds still appears to be considerablyrestricted.
The Future Investment Act and the accompanying admin-
istrative agreement contain rules designed to ensure thatcentral government funds are used for investment that isboth supplementary to existing plans and will have a dir-ect impact on demand. An expansionary macroeconomiceffect is to be ensured by the requirement that state andlocal government’s investment volume for the three-yearperiod from 2009 to 2011 must exceed an adjustedbenchmark figure based on past years (60% of the sumof the five-year period from 2004 to 2008 or the totalamount of the three-year period from 2006 to 2008) bythe amount of the subsidised projects.
3The benchmark
figure, to be determined for each state, is reduced by 5%across the board. Further reductions are envisaged in theevent of particular burdens arising from falling revenueearmarked for investment purposes, such as in the eastGerman states as a result of declining special supplemen-tary central government grants. Furthermore, the refer-

25ence value is to be lowered by the percentage by which
average tax revenue during the promotion period lagsbehind actual receipts in 2008, when revenue was verystrong. Overall, these provisions significantly dilute thecriterion that the investment spending must be supple-mentary to the expenditure totals. However, it should beborne in mind that even a decision not to make cuts onmeasures already planned, which could otherwise benecessary owing to the relatively strict local governmentborrowing limits, will contribute to macroeconomicstabilisation.
Given the overall favourable financial development of
local government budgets in recent years compared withthe ongoing deficits of central government, it was im-portant for the latter to limit mere shifts of the fundingof measures already planned. It therefore stipulates thatprojects may not be sponsored if they have already beenappropriated in the budget plans. However, it cannot beassumed that every local government’s 2009 budget planhad already entered into force on the cut-off date at theend of January. Furthermore, municipalities are free tobring forward investment projects planned for futureyears which have not yet been appropriated in thebudget plans. Overall, the stipulation that investmentspending must be supplementary to existing plans istherefore likely to offer only limited protection againstthe shift of financial burdens. But ultimately, such effectsmust be accepted by central government in the interestof achieving a rapid increase in economically meaningfulinvestments by state and local government. At the end ofthe day, the support measures are intended to boost eco-nomic activity by releasing funds in the short term,whereas the decision on the long-term investment vol-ume should be made irrespective of cyclical fluctuations.
To encourage an efficient use of the funds, a minimum
co-payment by state or local government of 25% wasstipulated. While state government, in accordance withthe old borrowing limits which still apply, may take outloans to cover this co-payment, state government rulesapplying to local government in principle permit the lat-ter to show net new borrowing in its budget only if it candemonstrate that it has the financial capacity to serviceit. Although over the last three years positive fiscal bal-ances have been recorded by local government overall,many municipalities have not even achieved a balancedbudget. Rather, above all to finance current expenditure,
they took out additional cash advances totalling 532
1/C252
billion up to the present which would have to be repaid
before they could budget for new investment loans.Given the current steep decline in local business tax rev-enue, many more local governments will find it difficultto demonstrate the required ability to service new debtin their budgets. The state governments have given as-surances that they will also enable financially weak localgovernments to take part in the fiscal stimulus pro-gramme. In many cases, a limited reduction in the muni-cipalities’ co-contribution (to be determined by the indi-vidual state governments) was established. However, thisreduction will often not suffice unless the investmentmay be expected to yield significant cost savings. Thetemporary suspension of local government borrowingrules, which is apparently also planned in some cases,seems to be particularly problematic if their budgetswere already strained before the crisis, as it would makeit more difficult to meet the consolidation requirementunless the investments result in sufficient cost savings. Aplanned pre-financing of local government’s co-fundingshare through favourable state government loans willalso result in burdens for financially weak local govern-ments in the long term if the state government does notcompensate for this elsewhere. Ultimately, there is noalternative to requiring these local governments to limittheir investments to those which relieve their budgets.Some state governments took this aspect into account inthe implementation provisions. Possible delays in theoutflow of funds resulting from this should be accepted.
The fact that payments from the Investment and Re-
demption Fund for state and local government measuresreported up to the middle of August this year amountedto only 5100 million reflects the general delays associated
with government investment programmes as well as theproblems outlined above. However, the low outflow offunds is also due to the fact that funds cannot be re-quested until the invoices have been paid. The influenceon production activity to date is significantly higher. Thevolume of fund payments is also likely to rise consider-ably by the end of 2009. Even so, the drawdown targetset in the Future Investment Act of at least 50% of theprogramme volume is unlikely to be achieved.

quent incorporation of these debt instruments into the regular cen-tral government debt – as occurred in the case of the RedemptionFund for Inherited Liabilities – would appear incompatible with the
new debt rules. — 3Financial investments which, at most, make an

26ment spending recorded by central, state

In addition, depreciationfor wear and tear and for other losses invalue (for example, if government assistancemeasures booked as investments in the wakeof the financial crisis largely offset losses) isdisregarded in the cameralistic accountingsystem used by government entities.
Prior to the reform of the national debt rules
this summer, the total amount of investmentspending recorded in the budget basicallyalso defined the borrowing ceiling for centraland state government. This coupling, basedon the “golden rule for borrowing”, was in-tended to ensure that the incurrence of debtwas matched by the formation of equivalentassets. However, this failed to prevent a con-tinuous depletion of the government capitalstock, not least owing to the inadequate def-inition of government investment, and theprovisions proved to be unsuitable overall.The new fiscal rules for central and state gov-ernment stipulating a structural budget thatis at least close to balance are therefore wel-come, especially as they align the nationalrules more closely with the European provi-sions.

Basic tendencies over the past decade
The downward trend in investment expend-
iture in central, state and local governmentbudgets
15that resumed soon after German
reunification has continued over the past tenyears. After amounting to 3811/C252billion (4%
of GDP) in 1998, investment fell to just under364 billion (2
1/C252% of GDP) in 2007, mainly as
a result of a steep decline between 2002 and2004. However, in 2008 investment rebound-ed sharply to just over 375 billion (3% of
GDP), predominantly owing to extensive ac-quisitions of participating interests (recapital-isation of financial institutions in the wake ofthe financial crisis). Nevertheless, the share ofinvestment in the total expenditure of central,state and local government has decreased onbalance from 12% to 9
1/C252% since 1998 (see
chart on page 27 and table on page 28).
However, the development appears slightly
different if the highly volatile receipts fromthe sale of tangible fixed assets and partici-pating interests, loan repayments and invest-ment grants received are deducted. Startingfrom 340
1/C252billion (2% of GDP) in 1998, the
net budgetary burden arising from govern-ment investment expenditure – excluding theUMTS mobile phone licence receipts recordedin 2000 – fell to a record low of 326 billion
(1
1/C254% of GDP) in 2005. Since then, this figure
has climbed back up to 3551/C252billion in 2008,
mainly owing to a sharp fall-off in asset real-isations since 2005 and the extraordinary cap-ital transfers to banks. Investment adjustedfor the above-mentioned capital revenuesthus increased to 2
1/C254% of GDP .

27At times, the individual categories of invest-
ment expenditure developed fairly disparate-ly, albeit without any large, permanent shiftsoccurring in the overall breakdown. With arelatively stable average share of slightly morethan 50%, non-financial asset formation re-mains the largest component. On average, in-vestment grants account for a share of ap-proximately 30% although, over time, declin-ing payments by state and local government(in eastern Germany in particular) were notfully offset by a rise in central governmentgrants, eg to public enterprises such as theGerman railways or as part of developmentaid. Unlike the categories mentioned above,financial asset formation, which on averagemakes up almost one-fifth of investment,fluctuated greatly. This was due to large ac-quisitions of participating interests by stategovernments in individual years
16and to the
activities of the Financial Market StabilisationFund in 2008. Furthermore, the ERP SpecialFund, which granted loans of 33
1/C252billion on
average in the preceding years, was reorgan-ised in mid-2007 with the result that onlysmall amounts are now recorded in the gov-ernment’s financial statistics. After adjust-ment for these special effects, the level offinancial asset formation remained virtuallyunchanged.
Broken down by level of government, the
investment of central and state governmentshows a preponderance of financial assetformation and investment grants – evenafter excluding the partly large payments toother levels of government. Local govern-ment investment, by contrast, is weightedmuch more towards non-financial asset for-
mation.Investment expenditure of

owing to higher expenditure (financed in partby tolls) on German motorways (see chart onpage 30).
17The funds were dedicated almost
entirely to constructing and maintainingroads, while rail transport is financed by in-vestment grants. Following an increase in in-vestment for general secondary schools, edu-cation, science and arts accounted for 19
1/C252%
of investment in tangible fixed assets (upfrom 18
1/C252%), of which two-thirds was for
schools and therefore predominantly attribut-able to local government, and one-quarterfor state government measures for univer-sities. The share of municipal utilities (two-thirds of which for sewage disposal) recordeda clear fall of 2
1/C252percentage points to just
under 71/C252%, mainly owing to outsourcing.
The significant decline in the area of adminis-tration of 1
1/C252percentage points to 6% re-
flects not least the end of expenditure associ-ated with the government’s move to Berlin.
At an average of approximately 37 billion,
non-financial asset formation of central gov-ernment, which was largely invested in con-structing and maintaining motorways andother trunk roads in Germany, remainedrelatively stable over the course of the lastdecade. State government capital formation,by contrast, fluctuated from 38 billion in
1998 down to 36
1/C252billion in 2005 and
back up to 371/C252billion in 200818(see chart
on page 31). However, the bulk of govern-ment non-financial asset formation is carriedout by municipalities (local government and
special-purpose associations), although theirshare has diminished in recent years.
19The
reunification-related boom was followed by asharp decline from 1993 which eased withthe economic recovery around the turn of themillennium but then worsened again in theperiod from 2003 to 2005. The recorded vol-ume of non-financial asset formation plum-meted from just under 326 billion in 1998 to
319
1/C252billion in 2005; the decrease was par-
ticularly pronounced in the case of construc-tion measures and acquisition of real estate. Itwas not until the economy started to pick upin 2006 that the volume began to rise, reach-ing just over 321
1/C252billion in 2008.
The decline in non-financial asset formation
of local government varied greatly from re-gion to region. Whereas in western Germanythe contraction averaged
1/C252% per year, in-
vestment by eastern German local govern-ments fell almost continuously by an annualaverage of just over 5%. However, it shouldbe remembered that this started from a com-paratively high level. The expenditure lead ofeast German municipalities in terms of per
capita non-financial asset formation amount-
ed to two-thirds in 1998 and, despite the
17These are the most recent data based on accounting
figures available at this time.
18This rise is partly attributable to the fact that univer-
sities and road construction enterprises, which were in-
creasingly outsourced from the core budgets from 2000,
were included in the reporting group for the govern-
ment’s financial statistics from 2007.
19However, it should be noted that, according to the
cash statistics, a large part of local government invest-
ment (almost two-fifths in 2008) is financed by invest-
ment grants from state and central government.Non-financial

Explanatory factors for the decline innon-financial asset formation
Besides a gradually diminishing catch-up re-
quirement in eastern Germany, the continuedtense budgetary situation faced by manylocal governments is likely to be another keyreason behind the trend decline in govern-ment non-financial asset formation. Thebudgetary rules for local government, whichare more restrictive than the correspondingprovisions applicable hitherto to centraland state government, rightly allow debt-financing of investment only if this does notimpair the local government’s financial cap-acity. Not least given the overall high level ofand further rise in cash advances, it must
have been virtually impossible for many localgovernments to demonstrate such non-impairment, notwithstanding the high overallfiscal surpluses recorded recently. Conse-quently, the municipalities limited investmentloans to areas where refinancing is assuredthrough fees.
21It was clearly easier to put in-
vestment projects on hold than to raise taxesor cut current expenditure. As a result, theweight of local government spending grad-Non-financial asset formation in 200 6 broken down by purpose *

structure gap estimated vis-/C224-vis a selected group of west

nium. Comparing the respective public capital stocks, the
catch-up requirement was estimated at just over 380 bil-
lion for 2005 (see D Vesper (2001), op cit).

penditure.22Thus while social benefits com-
prised only 8% of total local government ex-penditure in 1970, this increased to justunder 18
1/C252% in 1998 and 23% ten years
later. During the same period, the non-financial asset formation ratio dropped fromover 35% in 1970 to barely 17
1/C252% in 1998
and down to 121/C252% in 2008, this also coin-
ciding with a considerable trend decline inthe ratio of local government expenditure toGDP since the 1990s. In addition, investmentgrants from state and central government, inparticular to local government in easternGermany, decreased by one-tenth ( 31 billion)
over the past decade.
Moreover (statistical) shifts also contributed
to the declining trend in the recorded level ofgovernment non-financial asset formationwithout this having a direct impact on the ac-tual level of provision of infrastructure. Onthe one hand, facilities were outsourced asseparate operations, especially from localgovernment core budgets, and thus removedfrom the reporting group for the govern-ment’s financial statistics. It often appearedadvantageous to outsource entities, in par-ticular, prior to the changeover to commercialdouble-entry bookkeeping, which local gov-ernments have made and some state govern-ments are now also making.
23As well as the
hope that operations could be managedmore efficiently, this decision is also likely tohave been motivated by the tight budgetaryrules for local government mentioned above.The outsourcing of tangible fixed assets andof upcoming debt due to be repaid helped tocreate temporary budgetary scope. On theother hand, it appears that, following the
changeover of accounting system, some ex-penditure previously declared as investmentspending, for instance on maintaining build-ings, was reclassified and is now reported asother operating expenditure. This may havecontributed to reporting subdued growth ininvestment in spite of the recent more favour-able financial situation overall.Non-financial asset formation

32However, it is difficult to quantify the signifi-
cance of these effects. Various studies haveshown that the volume of non-financial assetformation of outsourced entities majority-owned by local government might have re-cently exceeded the volume remaining inlocal government’s core budgets.
24However,
to date no time series exist that show out-sourced non-financial asset formation, mean-ing that the contribution of outsourcing tothe decrease in investment cannot be precise-ly measured. Developments have been betterdocumented at state government level,where not least numerous construction andreal estate enterprises as well as universitieshave been outsourced in recent years. For ex-ample, between 1999 and 2006 outsourcingapparently contributed two-fifths to the de-cline in non-financial asset formation report-ed for this level of government.
25
In addition to the outsourcing of entire en-tities, public-private partnerships (PPP) are anincreasingly important factor underlying theunderstated reporting of actual governmentnon-financial asset formation in the govern-ment’s financial statistics. Although thefinancing of infrastructure projects, too, isentrusted to the contractual partners in PPPschemes, major risks typically remain with thecommissioning government entity. In suchcases, it would be appropriate to allocate theasset acquisition to the government sector inthe government’s financial statistics, as is thecase in the national accounts. According to asummary report by the Federal Ministry ofTransport, Building and Urban Development,the investment volume of PPP contracts al-ready amounted to 4
1/C252% of government
non-financial asset formation in 2007.26
PPP agreements are normally expected togenerate substantial cost advantages,
27espe-
cially as the private partner is typically respon-sible for not only setting up the facilities butalso for their long-term operation and thushas a strong incentive to find sustainable eco-nomic solutions. However, countervailing ef-fects also ensue, not least from transferringmajor sub-risks of a project to a private part-ner, from the associated cost disadvantagesof financing and from the need for complex

However, a large part of the figures stated in the studies
are probably not attributable to the government sector
(see footnote 2) and thus overstate at least the extent of
the outsourcing discussed in this article.
25See also Deutsche Bundesbank, Outsourcing of ser-
vice entities from the core budgets, Monthly Report, July

state government level are construction, real estate and
road construction enterprises in North Rhine-Westphalia
and Rhineland-Palatinate and the special funds for har-
bour construction in Bremen and Hamburg. For informa-
tion about the investment volume concerned, see the

However, whether measured by construction progress
(relevant for the national accounts) or by payments (rele-
vant for the government’ s financial statistics), the ratio is
likely to have been much lower recently. Moreover, this is
also likely to include PPP projects undertaken by public
enterprises that do not belong to the government sector.

Conclusion
For a number of years now government non-
financial asset formation in Germany hasbeen characterised by a downward trend.The government capital stock has likewise de-clined perceptibly in relation to GDP and, ac-companied by a concurrent sharp rise in thedebt level, the overall government assetposition has deteriorated considerably. Thistrend is currently continuing. Looking furtherahead, however, the reform of the debt rulesshould put an end to this problematic devel-opment.
The decline in investment should be seen not
least against the backdrop of the diminishingcatch-up requirement in eastern Germany, in-creasing outsourcing from government corebudgets and the growing popularity ofpublic-private partnerships. Even negative netgovernment capital formation is not problem-atic per se . The key yardstick is whether the
population and the economy are being sup-plied with services efficiently and adequately.If necessary, this can also be achieved usingprivate investors as long as the latter arebound by clearly stipulated contractual condi-tions.
The most recent surveys on the level of provi-
sion of infrastructure in Germany continue toshow a favourable picture by international
standards on the whole. However, surveys orindicators based on simplified supply meas-ures often allow only limited conclusions tobe drawn as to necessary adjustments fornon-financial asset formation. Other studies,in particular those that focus on local govern-ment, indicate that a need for improvementhas arisen in some areas. However, it is neces-sary to assess each possible government in-vestment on its merits, taking into accountnot only the potential growth effects but alsothe costs and comparing these with privateinvestments. It may also be worth consideringrefinancing investments by levying use-related fees or charges rather than taxes.Ultimately, the precise size of the governmentcapital stock reflects political priorities.
With regard to concrete investments, trans-
parent and goal-oriented decision-makingprocesses are essential. The changeover toproduct-related budgets with commercialdouble-entry bookkeeping, which is wellunder way at the local government level andis now being taken on board by some stategovernments, can help support efficientbudgetary planning and implementation. Re-sources can be used more efficiently as per-formance can be measured by comparing re-sults with the targets and using local scopefor discretion to save costs.

34today, the present provisions appear insuffi-
ciently stringent, so that the calculations areonly of limited relevance. Outsourcing andpublic-private partnerships sometimes givethe impression that the main motivation be-hind them is not so much economic consider-ations as the greater scope they provide tocircumvent budgetary rules. Transparent dis-closure of the factors underlying investmentdecisions and the monitoring of performanceare crucial in the context of public account-ability.
Given the exceptionally sharp recession and
the severe downside risks, the recently adopt-ed fiscal stimulus programmes involving ashort-term expansion of government invest-
ment were warranted. Nevertheless, fiscalfine-tuning measures with a strong invest-ment component are generally a poormethod of stimulating economic activitygiven the attendant problems. However, con-sideration could be given to steadying gov-ernment non-financial asset formation, whichhas largely taken place at local governmentlevel and has tended to be procyclical. Thiscould be supported by reducing the cyclicalsensitivity of local government budgets whichresults especially from local business tax andstate government transfers. Sharp cyclicalswings in revenue could be better cushionedat the central and state government level.

35Firm-level and

volatilityThe volatility of key economic variables
affects the decisions of firms andhouseholds in a variety of ways. Ob-taining a deeper understanding ofhow volatility patterns evolve andwhich factors determine such develop-ments is therefore of great interestfrom an economic perspective. Manyof the studies on macroeconomic vola-tility focus on aggregate variables,thus disregarding the firm level, atwhich the decisions that form the basisof the macroeconomic findings aretaken. The present article is thereforethe first of its kind to examine this di-mension of volatility for the Germaneconomy and distinguishes two typesof volatility. Purely firm-specific volatil-ity changed only very little between1974 and 2005. However, volatility thatincludes the response of individualfirms’ business activity to the macro-economic environment or to economicstructural changes was trending down-wards, thus also matching the volatilityprofile of aggregate output. However,the abrupt end to the falling-volatilityperiod due to the escalation of thefinancial crisis has also shown that asupposedly stable environment canalso have deceptive elements.

36levels. Business activity, firms’ investment de-
cisions and households’ consumption, to namea few examples, are all affected by such fluc-tuations.
Economically speaking, such volatility cannot
be regarded as intrinsically bad or good. Thefact that the business cycle and economic de-velopments are inevitably characterised by acertain degree of ups and downs often re-flects a dynamic, changing economy. In thetradition of Schumpeter’s concept of “cre-ative destruction”, it is only such change thatcan clear the way for the new and thus im-prove the longer-term outlook for growth.
1
At the micro level, the volatility of individualfirms’ sales and profits is often what makes itpossible in the first place for investors to di-versify the risks in their asset managementdecisions.
However, volatility can also generate costs. At
the aggregate level, there has been a long-standing and animated debate on the rela-tionship between real sector volatility andlonger-term growth. A raft of empirical stud-ies – especially cross-sectional analyses ofless-well-developed economies – confirm anegative link.
2And, even when considering
welfare aspects and given plausible assump-tions about the preferences of householdsand firms, major variations in their economiccircumstances are associated with welfarecosts. Real sector volatility, via the fluctu-ations in labour and investment income thatusually result, generally impacts negatively onhouseholds’ decisions to smooth consump-tion over time in an attempt to increase theirlong-run overall utility. Moreover, the uncer-tainty associated with such ups and downs
can adversely affect the consumption deci-sions of risk-averse households: imperfect in-surance markets prevent households fromfully shielding their consumption against in-come fluctuations, and social welfare systemscan pick up only part of the slack. By thesame token, it is quite rational for investors,facing temporarily large uncertainty about fu-ture economic developments and thus futureearnings, to put off irreversible investmentdecisions for the time being. Other thingsbeing equal, economies with a high level ofcyclical uncertainty may therefore display alower level of investment and thus a lowerrate of growth.

Given that economic fluctuations are one ofthe determinants of key macroeconomic de-velopments, interest in empirical analyses ofeconomic volatility has been rising stronglyfor quite some time.

37analysing volatility at the microeconomic
level, or firm level, are fewer and further be-tween. It is, in particular, the volatility offirms’ activity and the factors influencing itthat provide valuable insights for a host ofissues that are also relevant from a macroeco-nomic perspective. For instance, households’ability to smooth consumption hinges on theavailability of alternative ways to diversifyrisk. Diversification potential is determined bythe extent to which firm risks are affected bymacroeconomic developments, ie aggregateand structural developments, which affect alarge number of firms in a similar manner,and by firm-specific, ie idiosyncratic, factors.It is crucial in this context that developed andfunctioning financial markets enable marketparticipants to disperse idiosyncratic firm-level risks. Furthermore, risks are easier to di-versify if the individual firms respond differ-ently to macroeconomic developments.
The present article is therefore the first to
analyse firm-level volatility and its key driversspecifically for Germany. Using the DeutscheBundesbank’s Corporate Balance Sheet Statis-tics, the volatility – captured by the fluctu-ation of real sales – of an average of up to30,000 firms per year from various sectors ofthe German economy will be analysed cross-sectionally and in a historical perspective.

Fluctuations in business activity may becaused by macroeconomic factors as well asby firm-specific factors. In particular, giventhe debate about the “Great Moderation”, itis particularly interesting to analyse the de-terminants of firm-level volatility separately.Therefore, the volatilities of firm activity whichare based on macroeconomic factors and onidiosyncratic factors are modelled in the
present article separately and analysed overtime for an extended observation period. Thisis followed by an analysis of volatility at theaggregate level. The article concludes with abrief look at the influence of the financial cri-sis – and its causes – on output volatility.
Firm-level output volatility
Firm-level volatility is measured here by the
standard deviation of rates of change in realsales.
5This measure is also referred to as
“unconditional volatility”. By contrast, “con-ditional” volatility is based only on the firm-specific, idiosyncratic component of salesgrowth.
6This is based on the idea that firms’
decisions are not only influenced by circum-stances which affect all firms similarly, such asprice movements in international commodityand financial markets or domestic and externalaggregate demand, but also depend on firm-specific factors such as changes in their pro-duction structures. The idiosyncratic compon-ent of sales growth is calculated econometric-ally by adjusting the rates of change of realfirm sales for macroeconomic influences usinga time series regression (see the annex onpages 46-48). This approach requires a suffi-ciently long reference period for the estima-

38tion. Below, conditional volatility will therefore
be analysed for those firms whose sales figuresare available for the entire observation period– in this case, 1971 to 2007. These firms arecalled “long-lived” because they do not enteror exit the market during this period of busi-ness activity. Estimates have shown that firmswith low sales growth and low leverage, aswell as large firms and public limited com-panies, are more likely to belong to this groupof firms (see the annex, pages 46-48). It will beshown below that both large firms and publiclimited companies display a relatively low levelof conditional volatility as well as a relativelylow level of unconditional volatility. In addition,the sales growth of shorter-lived firms is morevolatile by nature. The volatilities of long-livedfirms, analysed first in this article, are thereforelikely, in a sense, to form a lower bound.
The measure of volatility used with the stand-
ard deviation is not the only available option.Volatilities in economic activity are usuallydetermined with their cyclical component.There are various ways of adjusting the devel-opment of (aggregate or firm-level) outputvariables for their growth trend. One option isto use a filtering method; however, its specifi-cation needs to be fitted to the given ob-served output variable and, in the presentcase of a broad analysis of micro data, doesnot always produce plausible results. By con-trast, the standard deviation used here, whichis calculated for the year-on-year change inoutput, is a very tractable measurement. Theuse of moving time windows captures shiftsin the respective volatilities over time.

39the unconditional volatility and the condition-
al volatility are defined as the rolling standarddeviation of firm sales growth or its idiosyn-cratic component, centred over a five-yearperiod.
8The time profile of the firm median,
ie the median of the volatilities calculated forall firms in a given period, can be interpretedas the trend pattern of firm-level volatility.
The results show that the conditional volatility
of long-lived firms has changed little overtime. In each decade it averaged 7 percent-age points. Only during the 1990s was it
1/C254percentage point higher. However, in the
past four years, conditional volatility rose byjust over 1 percentage point, thus showing aweak trend rise. This is confirmed by microe-conometric studies which found a trend rise– albeit a small one – in conditional volatilityfor long-lived firms as a whole (see table onthis page and the annex, pages 46-48).
A number of firm-specific conditions come
into consideration as factors influencing thepattern of conditional volatility. Firm sizeprobably plays a role. For instance, large firmsare likely to be able to diversify risk morewidely internally, which should tend to damp-en fluctuations in individual sub-areas and re-duce overall volatility. The firm’s growth mo-mentum is also likely to be relevant: rapidlygrowing firms might be vulnerable to majorsetbacks, which would appear to indicate apositive relationship between firm growthand volatility. In addition, inventory behaviourcould influence the volatility of business activ-ity. Firms attempt to offset fluctuations in de-mand by keeping inventories of their finalproducts so that, as the marginal costs of theproduction process rise, they can cushion falls
in profits by smoothing their output. Firms’financing conditions might be an additionaldeterminant. This is indicated not only by ananalysis of the conditional volatility of firms ofvarying legal forms, economic sectors andsize categories but also by empirical studies.This type of volatility can also be plausibly ex-plained in the econometric analysis merely bythe idiosyncratic components of firm-specificfactors.

Several of these potential determinants ofconditional volatility will be examined moreclosely below. In many cases, the cross-sectional dimension – specifically, the ques-tion as to how these determinants have im-pacted on volatility across the observed firmsor sectors – is of interest.
The time profile of conditional volatility
shows only slight fluctuations for nearly allcategories of firms. Public limited companiesare the exception: in the 1970s, their condi-tional volatility was still well below the aver-age, yet since the early 1990s it has risen by2
1/C252percentage points and, in the current dec-
ade, has matched the level of firms of otherlegal forms.
Moreover, conditional volatilities also vary
among the individual economic sectors.Microeconometric studies can shed light onwhether or not these differences are due toinventory behaviour. At the firm level, theidiosyncratic component of the ratio betweeninventory stocks and sales is used as an indi-cator. For the manufacturing industry, it isfound that a higher inventory-to-sales ratio isassociated with weaker conditional volatil-ity.
10The negative relationship indicates that
firms with a generally highly volatile demandcan dampen the impact of such swingson production by adjusting their inventorystocks. This finding is consistent with trad-itional approaches which assume that, at themicro level, sales exhibit a greater variabilitythan output and that inventory managementtherefore has a countercyclical or stabilising
effect on firms’ business activity.
11
As regards the firm size, the conditional vola-tility of small firms turns out to be larger thanfor large firms. This is consistent with theother results inasmuch as the smaller firmsare likely to belong, above all, to the servicessector. Moreover, the assumption that intern-al diversification opportunities dampen thevolatility of large firms relative to smallerfirms is confirmed. The influence of firm sizeis also supported by the econometric findingthat volatility rises in line with the growth offirms – measured in terms of the idiosyncraticpart of their total assets.
By contrast, according to the empirical study,
the idiosyncratic leverage of a firm – the ratiobetween debt and equity capital adjusted formacroeconomic influences – has no percep-tible influence on conditional volatility.
When looking at unconditional volatility,
however, what is striking is that the overallvolatility of long-lived firms is, on average,
9To do this, the Heckman procedure is used. See J Heck-
man (1976), The common structure of statistical models
of truncation, sample selection, and limited dependent
variables and a simple estimator for such models, Annals
of Economic and Social Measurement, Vol 5, pp 475-
492.
10The estimation used total inventory stocks. Moreover,
in the balance sheet information it is impossible to de-
termine whether the finished goods therein are self-
produced or purchased from other firms.
11It is also assumed that the covariance of sales and in-
ventory changes is negative. See E Langmantel (2005),

structural time series approach using survey data, Journal
of Economics and Statistics (Jahrb/C252cher f/C252r National/C246ko-

theory is supported by the empirical finding that, for the
firms analysed here, the firm median of the (unadjusted)
inventory-to-sales ratios is declining over time. See the

412 percentage points higher than conditional
volatility. Moreover, it becomes clear that theunconditional volatility has declined notice-ably. During the second half of the 1970s, aperiod that was characterised by the reces-sion associated with the 1975 oil price crisis,it still averaged as much as 11
1/C254percentage
points and fell in the 1980s to an average of8
3/C254percentage points. This trend was inter-
rupted by the increase in volatility in the firsthalf of the 1990s owing to the post-Germanunification adjustment processes and theopening-up of the central and east Europeaneconomies. The fluctuations in business activ-ity, however, increased only temporarily. Inthe current decade, unconditional volatilityfell to 8 percentage points. This means that ithas fallen by a substantial 3
1/C254percentage
points in total since the 1970s.
With firm-specific volatility remaining con-
stant, the decline in overall volatility at thefirm level was due to economic developmentswhich affected firms in a similar way. Thisraises the question as to which conditionscommon to firms could have led to the ob-served decline in sales growth volatility. To ex-plain the (aggregate) volatility trend, threemain transmission channels are cited.
12One
line of argument holds that the intensity ofeconomic cycles could have been reduced byappropriate monetary and fiscal policy (the“good policy” hypothesis). Another empha-sises the influence of smaller exogenousshocks, such as oil price fluctuations (the“good luck” hypothesis). A further possibilityis that the volatility trend is dependent onstructural change in the economy, such astechnological progress, the underlying condi-tions for corporate finance or globalisation,
understood here as the growing integrationof the international goods and financial mar-kets. However, despite intensive research, afinal consensus has not yet been reached.
13
Including the firm level for analysing the influ-ence of macroeconomic factors on the volatil-ity pattern provides an interesting and de-tailed picture of the strength of these factors.The Bundesbank’s econometric studies showthat, in isolation, macroeconomic factors canexplain up to 60% of the variance in salesgrowth of a long-lived firm.
14However, on
average across firms, the explanatory powerof the individual macroeconomic develop-ments is only between 4% and 8%. This indi-cates significant differences between firmswith regard to the effects of the commonconditions on sales growth volatility.
These divergences are probably due to firm-
specific factors. There is empirical evidencethat large firms’ sales growth is more sensitiveto changes in price competitiveness than thatof smaller firms. This is probably because thebusiness activity of large firms is generallygeared relatively strongly to internationalsales markets. In addition, commodity prices

42have a lesser impact on the sales growth of
services firms than in other sectors because,for instance, imports of raw materials do notplay a significant role in service providers’ pro-duction process.
A look at the unconditional volatilities of vari-
ous categories of firms provides further clues.It becomes clear that macroeconomic devel-opments tend to have led to a decline in vola-tility for all firms – following high levels onthe heels of the first oil price crisis and Ger-man unification. Although the overall volatil-ity of public limited companies, unlike othertypes of firms, has displayed a trend rise sincethe early 1980s, this is largely due to an in-crease in their conditional volatility in the pasttwo decades, as mentioned earlier.
15By contrast, differences in sectoral businessactivity are likely to be the main reason whyvolatilities in manufacturing and services havediverged. The boom and bust period in the ITindustry around the turn of the millenniumcoincided with relatively strong volatility ofsales growth in services during the 1998-2002 period, whereas the volatility of long-lived manufacturing firms changed only little.However, it can be seen that the uncondition-al volatility of the services sector – as well asthe conditional volatility – has, on average,been above that of manufacturing (+
3/C254per-
centage point). This is not least because thewholesale and retail trade, which has a highervolatility than many goods-producing firms,is very strongly represented among the ob-served firms.
Moreover, market entries and exits of firms
also influence volatility. In order to incorpor-ate this effect, the present article will proceedby adding shorter-lived firms to the analysis.This group includes all firms for which salesgrowth figures are available for at least fiveconsecutive years and also includes the long-Aggregate output volatility *

43lived firms examined earlier.16It is found,
firstly, that the volatility of this sample offirms tends to have fallen much less, at only1
1/C252percentage points between the 1970s
and the current decade, than that of long-lived, stable firms. Secondly, the volatility is,on average, 2
1/C252percentage points higher. In
the first instance, this finding is a reflection ofthe fact that, as other studies have shown,newly established firms have a higher salesvolatility, which goes as far as the possibilityof exiting the market altogether.
Since macroeconomic factors were the main
reason for the reduction in unconditionalvolatility, it may be concluded that a stablemacroeconomic environment has encouragedlow firm-level volatility. Aggregate develop-ments thus also form a basis for firm-levelvolatility. Therefore, the picture of aggregatevolatility over time is likewise an importantelement of a comprehensive analysis.
Aggregate output volatilities
The aggregate volatilities under examination
are defined as rolling standard deviations ofthe annual rates of change of real valueadded as defined in the national accounts.On balance, this calculated volatility has atime profile that is similar to that of the vola-tility calculated for the firm level as a whole.In the last few decades before the financialcrisis, both variables were trending down-Output volatility and value-added

44wards. However, the largely uniform trend
patterns of these two variables over time isnot self-evident. In fact, their time profiles arequite capable of diverging. One reason isthat, in the national accounts, the individualfirms’ output reports are first compiled andthe volatility is then calculated using thesecondensed variables. For instance, using thismethod of calculation – and unlike the micro-level view – volatility in manufacturing wasan average of 2
1/C252percentage points higher
than that in services. Compilation on the ag-gregate level, as well as the micro-level com-position of firms, are thus very much capableof influencing sectoral volatility.
Another potential reason for differences in
firm-level and aggregate volatility profilescould lie in fluctuations in the contributionsof individual firms to gross value added. This
effect is difficult to quantify at firm level. Atan aggregated level, by contrast, the increas-ing importance of services output for theeconomy as a whole, owing to services’ lowvolatility, could also have led to a reduction inthe volatility of gross domestic product (GDP).
It should be noted, however, that the overall
variance (and thus the volatility) of the rate ofchange of overall gross value added dependsnot just on the weighted sum of partial vari-ances of individual firms’ rate of change (orsectors’ rate of change at aggregate level). Itis also affected by the covariance of firm-level(or sectoral) changes in value added, ie thetype and intensity of the common dispersion.If the percentage of low-volatility firms or sec-tors rises while the degree of synchronicitybetween individual firms or sectors also in-creases, the volatility of GDP might even in-crease. Accordingly – in an aggregate view –it is possible that, despite the growing signifi-cance of the services sector, the intensity ofGDP fluctuation increases if, at the sametime, the synchronicity between activity inthe services sector and that in other economicsectors increases.
At firm level, statistical dispersion measures
such as the interquartile range, ie the differ-ence, calculated for each year, between thesales growth of the firms with the lowest25% and the highest 25% rates of change,provides evidence of the degree of synchron-icity between firms. It turns out that the di-vergence between the sales fluctuations ofshorter-lived firms has, on an average of thecurrent decade, declined compared with thePairwise correlation of sectoral

451970s. This tendency has been especially pro-
nounced for long-lived firms and may be in-terpreted as greater synchronicity of firm-levelbusiness trends. By contrast, the correlationbetween the service sector’s contribution toGDP and that of goods and construction out-put has decreased noticeably, implying lowersynchronicity of sectoral trends. This supportsthe hypothesis that the greater significance ofthe services sector contributed to the subsid-ing volatility of German economic activity.
The decline in aggregate volatility in Germany
over the past few decades is consistent withobservations in other industrial countries thatshort-term volatility has been undergoing asimilarly pronounced fall not just in terms ofthe underlying trend but also quantitatively.This is a sign that the “Great Moderation”, asthis stylised fact is also called in the literature,is due to reasons that are common to manydeveloped economies. This is consistent withthe empirical firm-level finding that macro-economic factors are the main reason for thereduction in volatility in Germany. This out-come can also make a major contribution toexplaining the volatility trend during thecurrent financial crisis, which has left a se-verely changed macroeconomic environmentfor the German economy in its wake.
Output volatility in the financial crisis
The financial crisis which began around mid-
2007 spelled an abrupt end to the longperiod of the “Great Moderation”. The grow-ing intensity of financial market turbulence inthe late summer of 2008 triggered a globalcrisis of confidence and, in Germany, too, led
to severe output losses which caused aggre-gate volatility to rise considerably. It is there-fore likely that, over the next one and a halfyears, the volatility of German GDP will ex-ceed the peak levels of the early 1970s andthe period of German unification. For manyindustrial nations, which likewise saw theiroutput fall considerably in the wake of the fi-nancial crisis, the outcome is expected to bemuch the same.
This raises the question of what kept firm-
level and aggregate output volatility at a rela-tively low level since the mid-1990s. This find-ing may be regarded as the outcomes of mul-tiple mutually reinforcing effects.
17Such ef-
fects in this context include global financialmarket liberalisation, which made it mucheasier to obtain access to credit. Credit risktransfer instruments – above all, securitisa-tions – were used to package, diversify andpass on individually illiquid microeconomicassets. This coincided with increased lendingto firms and households and the expansion ofa formerly more liquidity-constrained finan-cing of their investment and consumption ac-tivities towards asset-backed financing. Thismade economic activity more susceptible tothe influence of movements in asset valuesand the associated risks. In addition, the rapidadvance of globalisation in the real sector, iethe rising number of countries participating inglobal trade, the vertical integration of pro-duction chains and the growing tradability of

46services, led to a succession of positive supply
shocks.
This led to a global expansion of aggregate
demand, amplified by strong credit growthand the fact that financial market supervisionwas, in many cases, not adequate to the riskinvolved; this expansion came up against agrowing supply of goods in the wake of glob-alisation. Added to this was a relatively longperiod of low (real) interest rates without anyconcurrent build-up of inflationary pressure.The outcome was an extended period of lowinflation and high output growth. The ex-tremely benign trends in the macroeconomicenvironment are also reflected by firm-levelvolatilities in Germany; the volatility of long-lived firms based on macroeconomic develop-ments was shrinking sharply during the cur-rent decade up to the outbreak of the finan-cial crisis. However, falling volatility in the realsector coincided with a distinct increase inthe medium-term ups and downs in aggre-gated asset prices and lending in major indus-trial countries since the 1980s.
The current financial crisis has shown that, in
the global cyclical upswing, continuously ris-ing asset prices, falling risk premia and ex-panded opportunities for obtaining debt fi-
nance enabled the development of self-reinforcing processes. These processes led tofinancial imbalances – ie high financial lever-age and excessive balance sheet extensions inthe banking system as well as, in the longterm, unsustainable borrowing in some coun-tries’ private non-financial sectors. These im-balances led to dislocations in the real sectorand, sooner or later, had to trigger painfulprocesses of adjustment.
This analysis of the volatility of German firms’
business activity has shown that idiosyncraticvolatility has changed little since the 1970s,whereas the component of volatility which isbased on macroeconomic factors was trend-ing downwards up until the outbreak of thefinancial crisis. This initially appears to indi-cate a benign macroeconomic environmentprior to the financial market turmoil. None-theless, the financial crisis has revealed thatthe empirically measured decline in real sectorvolatility at the end of the observation periodalso stemmed from developments that wereunsustainable; seen in that light, the ob-served short-term stability harboured decep-tive elements that emerged in all their viru-lence with the outbreak of the financial crisis.

47Equation (1) assumes that real sales growth of a
firm gitis determined by a vector of observed
macroeconomic factors dt, a vector of firm-specific
regressors xitand the error term /C15it. In equation (2),
the error terms /C15itare assumed to have a multifac-
tor structure. They depend on a vector of unob-served macroeconomic factors f
tand the idiosyn-
cratic error terms uit, which are assumed to be
uncorrelated with either the observed macroeco-nomic factors or the firm-specific regressors. Ac-cording to equation (3), the firm-specific regressorsare affected by observed and unobserved macro-economic factors alike. The error term v
itis that
component of the firm-specific variables on whichmacroeconomic factors have no effect. The errorterms u
itapproximate the firm-specific, idiosyn-
cratic component of a firm’s sales growth and areused to calculate the conditional, idiosyncraticvolatility of a firm.
Real domestic absorption, global demand for im-
ports and the German economy’s price competi-tiveness are included as observed macroeconomicfactors which reflect firms’ common sales termsand conditions. General cost developments aremodelled by commodity prices, the short-terminterest rate and the domestic rate of inflation. Theunobserved macroeconomic factors – in line withPesaran – are approximated by the annual cross-sections of firm-specific variables, real sales andasset growth, the inventories-to-sales ratio, andleverage. Firms’ average sales growth incorporatesshifts in trend growth and thus also, for instance,technological progress, since general increases inproductivity – such as those due to energy-savingmeasures – are associated with higher trendgrowth. The average inventories-to-sales ratioreflects technological progress with respect toinventory management and displays a decliningtrend. One possible reason may lie in innovativeinstruments that have improved the ability to
forecast the pattern of demand for goods, result-ing in a reduction in inventory stocks of final goodsneeded to ensure deliveries. Another is that im-provements in inventory management may berelated to “just in time” production and outsour-cing, which relieve firms of the need to maintainlarge stocks of inputs and final products. Theframework for corporate finance is taken intoaccount by average leverage, which is also modi-fied by firms in the wake of legislative changes inaccounting rules or capital requirements. Averageleverage tended to rise in the early 1990s beforethen receding distinctly. Trend developments infirm sizes are captured by firms’ average assetgrowth.
In order to calculate the idiosyncratic component
of business activity, sales growth of each firm overthe entire 1972-2007 observation period is re-gressed on the observed and unobserved macro-economic factors. The residuals of this estimationcorrespond to the error terms u
itfrom equation
(2). This approach enables the greatest heterogen-eity between firms to be obtained.
Panel estimation of conditional firm-level
volatility
To analyse the effects of firm-specific factors on
conditional firm-level volatility, a regression is per-formed for the firms pooled to a panel. That is, un-like the multifactor residual model, homogeneouscoefficients are estimated.
