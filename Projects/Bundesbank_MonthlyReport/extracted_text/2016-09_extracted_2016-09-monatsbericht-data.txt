Commentaries
Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Following quite strong growth in the second 
quarter, German economic output is likely to 
increase somewhat more slowly in the third 
quarter of 2016. This is revealed, for one thing, 
by the marked deterioration in business senti -
ment. Moreover, the economic indicators show 
that the quarter began very weakly, especially 
in industry. By contrast, the construction sector 
is clearly on a path of expansion again follow -
ing the weather-  related period of adjustment 
in the second quarter. Business activity in the 
services sectors is also continuing to point 
clearly upwards, which is indicated not least by 
the ongoing rise in employment. The high level 
of consumer confidence is also consistent with 
this picture. Given that the fundamentals re -
main favourable, the underlying cyclical trend is 
set to remain quite strong despite subdued in -
dustrial activity at present.
Industry
Seasonally adjusted industrial output in Ger -
many underwent a sharp month- on- month de -
cline in July (-2¼%). The decline was on a 
broad front with regard to the individual sec -
tors of industry. Motor vehicle production, 
which is characterised by strong volatility, stood 
out in particular, however, with losses of 5½%. 
This is probably due to an exceptional concen -
tration of plant shutdowns by German auto -
motive manufacturers in July, which is therefore 
likely to lead to a strong countermovement in 
this sector in August. This is also suggested by 
the data of the German Association of the 
Automotive Industry ( Verband der Automobil-
industrie,  VDA), which are already available for 
August. By contrast, a comparatively small 
number of days for school holidays fell in July 
compared with the long-  term average. Taken by itself, this may well have bolstered industrial 
production overall. Industrial output was also 
clearly down (-1¾%) on its average level of the 
second quarter, with the decline being espe -
cially strong in the case of capital goods. Over -
all, the results for the holiday month of July 
have to be interpreted with caution. A clearer 
view will not be possible until the figures for 
August have been published.
There was no more than weak month- on- 
month growth in industrial orders in July at a 
seasonally adjusted ¼%. The volume of orders 
thus persisted at the same level as in the second 
quarter. As in the preceding months, there 
were considerable differences across regions. 
German industry had to cope with substantial 
cuts in domestic orders compared with the 
second quarter (-3¼%). This contrasted with 
strong growth in orders from inside (+1¼%) 
and outside (+3¼%) the euro area. Broken 
down by category of goods, there was an in -
crease in orders of capital goods, while orders 
of consumer goods showed a particularly sharp 
fall. Large-  scale orders, especially from other 
euro- area countries, were the key factor be -
hind the balanced overall figure in comparison 
with the second quarter; if major contracts are 
excluded, the inflow of new orders was per -
ceptibly smaller (-½%).
Seasonally adjusted industrial sales in July were 
clearly down on the month (-1½%). The figure 
was thus considerably lower (-2¼%) than the 
average of the second quarter. The largest 
drops in sales were recorded in domestic busi -
ness and in non- euro- area countries. The fall in 
sales in the euro area was markedly smaller, 
however. It was mainly German consumer 
goods producers that benefited from this; they 
were able to increase their euro- area sales sub -
stantially in fact. Nominal exports of goods in 
July showed a sharp fall on the month (-2¾%). 
They were 3% down on the average of the pre -
vious quarter and rising export prices made the Growth in Ger-
man economy somewhat slower in Q3 than before

shortfall even larger in real terms (-3¼%). Nom -
inal goods imports in July were perceptibly 
below (-¾%) their level in June. It was there -
fore possible to maintain the level of the second 
quarter. Nevertheless, import prices continued 
to move upwards, which meant that a marked 
decline in goods imports was posted in real 
terms (-1%).
Construction
Construction output in July showed a sharp 
seasonally adjusted 1¾% increase on the 
month. Growth amounted to 2% compared 
with the average of the second quarter. This 
means that the construction sector – following 
a three- month weather- related period of ad -
justment and a slight increase in June – is 
clearly back on a growth path again. The rise 
was especially marked in the finishing trades 
(+3¼%). The main construction sector, too, 
showed a perceptible (¾%) pick- up in activity, 
however, with the expansion taking place 
equally in general construction and civil engin -
eering. In contrast to construction output, in -
flows of orders in the main construction sector 
in the second quarter – data are available up to 
then – largely maintained the very high level 
achieved at the beginning of the year. Together 
with the continuing high number of construc -
tion permits and – according to the Ifo Insti -
tute – higher capacity utilisation, this paints a 
very positive picture of activity in the construc -
tion sector.
Labour market
The steady rise in employment also continued 
at the beginning of the summer. In July, the 
seasonally adjusted employment figure was up 
by 39,000 on the month, which was nearly as 
strong as on an average of the first half of 
2016. The year- on- year increase was 535,000, 
or 1.2%. This is primarily due to the substantial 
increase in jobs subject to social security contri -
butions, even though the rise in June was small Construction 
sector clearly back on growth path again

according to the initial estimate of the Federal 
Employment Agency. Even so, 614,000, or 
2.0%, more positions were filled than one year 
previously. The positive development in em -
ployment should continue in the coming 
months. Despite the high levels already 
achieved, the Ifo employment barometer, the 
labour market barometer of the Institute for 
Employment Research (IAB), and the Federal 
Employment Agency’s BA-  X job index all 
showed an improvement.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment in August 
was down slightly on the month. There were 
2.68 million persons registered as unemployed 
with the Federal Employment Agency. As in 
July, the unemployment rate was 6.1%. Com -
pared with the same month one year earlier, 
there were 111,000 fewer persons out of work 
and the unemployment rate was 0.3 percent -
age point lower. The underlying cyclical trend 
can, in fact, be rated as somewhat more posi -
tive, as an increasing number of refugees are 
registering as unemployed with the Federal 
Employment Agency. The resulting rise in un -
employment is, however, being dampened in 
turn by the fact that labour market policy 
measures are being expanded with a focus on 
making refugees ready for work and integrat -
ing them into the job market. Over the next 
few months, official unemployment according 
to the IAB labour market barometer could 
show a further slight fall.
Prices
After falling in July, crude oil prices went up 
again until about the middle of August. This 
meant that, on a monthly average, the level 
was slightly higher than in July. In the first half 
of September, crude oil prices were fluctuating 
around the US$48 mark. As this report went to 
press, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil 
stood at just under US$47. The premium on 
crude oil futures was just under US$2½ for 
deliveries  six months ahead and just short of 
US$4½ for deliveries 12 months ahead.Import and producer prices continued to rise in 
July. There was a fall in the prices of energy im -
ports and domestic energy prices remained un -
changed. Prices for other goods showed a 
marked increase, however. Overall, the year-  
on- year decline narrowed to 3.8% in the case 
of imports and to 2.0% in the case of industrial 
products.
Seasonally adjusted consumer prices were un -
changed in August. While energy became 
cheaper again, food prices increased, albeit 
only marginally. Industrial goods also became 
slightly more expensive despite a marked sea -
sonally adjusted fall in the prices of clothing 
and footwear. The prices of services remained 
at the same level as in July. There was a slight 
acceleration in the rise in rents. The annual rate 
of inflation as measured by the national con -
sumer price index (CPI) remained at +0.4%. The 
annual HICP rate fell slightly from +0.4% to 
+0.3%. Going by current financial market ex -
pectations of developments in oil prices, the 
annual rate of increase is likely to go up slowly 
in the coming months.
Public finances1
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
The statutory health insurance scheme re -
corded a deficit of €½ billion in the second 
quarter of 2016, according to preliminary data. 
The improvement of €1 billion on the previous 
year is not only linked to the health insurance 
institutions’ more favourable financial circum -
stances following the considerable increase in 
additional contribution rates, but also to the 
health fund’s central government grant, which 
had returned to its standard level.Increased use of

1 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
September 2016

The health insurance institutions’ revenue, 
strengthened by the rise in additional contribu -
tion rates to an average of 1.08% at the start 
of the year, increased by just over 5%. By con -
trast, the rise of more than 4% in expenditure 
in the second quarter also fell noticeably short 
of the statutory health insurance estimators’ 
forecast level of 5½% for the year as a whole. 
Hospital treatment spending in particular saw 
below- average growth once more at 3%. A 
substantially higher increase had been ex -
pected here, not least due to the expansion in 
benefits introduced with the Hospital Struc -
tures Act (Krankenhausstrukturgesetz),  but im -
plementation of these changes appears to have 
been slow thus far. The increase in spending on 
pharmaceuticals was around average, with 
price reduction agreements helping to keep 
costs down. Expenditure on outpatient treat -
ment increased by a somewhat stronger 4½%.
Health fund revenue grew substantially in the 
second quarter with a rise of 6½% on the year. The sharp rise in employee contribution pay -
ments continued (+6%) thanks to ongoing 
positive wage and employment developments 
and the higher additional contribution rates. 
Pension contributions saw below-  average 
growth at 4½% as income from pensions 
climbed less steeply than earnings subject to 
compulsory insurance contributions.2 Overall, 
contribution receipts rose by just over 5½%. 
The central government grant also increased 
significantly by €½ billion and thus returned to 
its usual level, having been cut on an ad hoc  
basis in the preceding three years.
For 2016 as a whole a largely balanced budget 
is to be expected, as the central government 
grant to the health fund has reverted to its 
standard level of €14 billion. So far health in -
surance institution expenditure has grown less 
strongly than was forecast for the year as a 
whole. A certain upturn is to be expected here, 
however, particularly because the expansion in 
benefits should make an increasingly notice -
able impact. Overall, however, the health insur -
ance institutions appear likely to record a sur -
plus.3
The trend shows that statutory health insur -
ance scheme expenditure is increasing more 
strongly than revenue adjusted for contribution 
rate rises, a pattern which is still being influ -
enced by the expansions in benefits approved 
in recent years. To finance this excess expend -
iture, higher additional contribution rates will 
be necessary, at least once the in some cases Rise in health

2 An adjustment in the national accounts methodology in 
2014 reduced the 2015 pension increase by 1 percentage 
point. This was broadly balanced out by a correspondingly 
higher pension increase in mid-2016.
3 In general, unexpected developments on the revenue 
side affect the health fund because the size of transfers to 
the health insurance institutions is based on the statutory 
health insurance estimators’ revenue forecast (taking into 
account the additional contribution rate charged by the in -
stitution in question). By contrast, it is the health insurance 
institutions’ finances that benefit or suffer when there are 
deviations from the expected expenditure trend. The add -
itional contribution rates this year are roughly at the level 
the health insurance estimators calculate to be sufficient to 
cover expenditure. However, spending growth for the year 
as a whole is unlikely to match the projected increase of 
5½%.Deutsche Bundesbank

considerable reserves have been exhausted 
(down to the minimum amount). Therefore, to 
avoid excessive contribution rate increases, 
cost- cutting measures will be necessary.
The health insurance institutions will receive 
€1½ billion from the health fund’s liquidity re -
serves next year. This is to reimburse them for 
expected additional costs, particularly due to 
the temporarily increased amount of refugees 
accessing the statutory health insurance 
scheme for the first time upon being granted 
asylum.4 This separate transfer means that re -
course to reserves or higher additional contri -
bution rates will be avoided in 2017.
Public long- term care 
 insurance scheme
The second- quarter surplus recorded by the 
public long- term care insurance scheme (core 
budget) was down by just under €½ billion on 
the year. Additionally, the long- term care provi -
dent fund was increased by nearly €½ billion as 
planned. Revenue in the core budget rose by 
4%. The rise in employee contributions was 
disproportionately large (5%). However, overall 
expenditure5 increased substantially more 
strongly by almost 7½%, which is primarily due 
to maintained strong growth in non- cash bene -
fits, which are particularly significant in quanti -
tative terms. These were substantially increased 
by the first Act to Strengthen Long- term Care 
(Pflegestärkungsgesetz)  in 2015, but it seems 
that the full financial effects will only be felt 
with some delay. Consequently, the year- on- 
year rate decreased further in the second quar -
ter, which is likely to continue over the course 
of the year.
The core budget is likely to post a lower surplus 
for the year as a whole too. Additionally, the 
long- term care provident fund will be increased 
by just over €1 billion in total. From 1 January 
2017 the contribution rates are scheduled to 
rise by 0.2  percentage point from 2.35% to 
2.55% (plus a surcharge of 0.25  percentage point for childless persons). At the same time, 
the second Act to Strengthen Long- term Care 
(Pflegestärkungsgesetz II)  envisages sweeping 
reforms to long- term care benefits. In view of 
the resulting expansion of benefits, it is likely 
that, all in all, expenditure will continue to 
grow more strongly than eligible earnings. To 
this cover this gap in funding, the scheme is 
likely to draw on core reserves (which rose to 
€8½ billion around the middle of the year) in 
the first instance. In principle, however, there 
may well be more contribution rate increases in 
the future if the expenditure trend is not curbed 
further.Recourse to

Securities markets
Bond market
At €110.2 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in July 2016 was up on the June 
figure (€100.7 billion). However, after taking 
account of increased redemptions (€131.8 bil -
lion) and changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, the outstanding volume of 
domestic bonds declined by a net €26.6 billion, 
after already having contracted by €7.6 billion 
in June. The outstanding volume of foreign 
debt securities in the German market also fell 
(by €4.1 billion), which meant that the out -
standing volume of domestic and foreign debt 
instruments in Germany decreased by €30.7 
billion on balance.
German credit institutions reduced their capital 
market debt by €16.3 billion in July. As a result, 
the outstanding volume of debt securities is -sued by specialised credit institutions (which in -
clude public promotional banks, for example), 
in particular, fell by €14.1 billion. There were 
also net redemptions of other bank debt secur -
ities which can be structured flexibly and public 
Pfandbriefe (€2.4 billion and €1.0 billion re -
spectively). By contrast, mortgage Pfandbriefe 
worth €1.2 billion net were issued.
The public sector redeemed own bonds total -
ling €11.4 billion net in the reporting month. 
Only central government reduced its capital 
market debt (€15.5 billion), redeeming primar -
ily ten-  year Federal bonds (Bunds) (€20.4 bil -
lion). This contrasted with net issuance of two- 
year Federal Treasury notes (Schätze) and five-  
year Federal notes (Bobls) (€3.7 billion and €3.0 
billion respectively). The Federal states issued 
bonds to the value of €4.1 billion net.
In the month under review, domestic enter -
prises placed debt securities worth €1.1 billion 
net in the market. On balance, issuance was 
attributable exclusively to other financial inter -
mediaries.
The Bundesbank was the sole buyer of debt se -
curities in July, acquiring a total net €18.1 bil -
lion worth of paper, not least under the Euro -
system’s asset purchase programmes. By con -
trast, foreign investors sold bonds for €29.1 
billion net. German credit institutions and 
domestic  non- banks likewise offloaded debt 
securities worth €10.0 billion and €9.7 billion 
net respectively. While credit institutions sold 
almost only foreign instruments, non- banks ex -
clusively disposed of domestic paper.
Equity market
In the month under review, shares totalling 
€0.5 billion net were issued in the German 
equity market. The majority of issues emanated 
from non- listed enterprises. Sales of foreign 
shares in Germany totalled €2.4 billion in the 
same period. Domestic non- banks, in particu -

adding shares worth €4.8 billion net to their 
portfolios. Non- resident investors purchased 
domestic equities to the tune of €0.2 billion, 
while German credit institutions sold shares 
worth €2.1 billion in net terms.
Mutual funds
In July, domestic mutual funds recorded inflows 
of €7.9 billion. The fresh funds benefited mainly 
specialised funds reserved for institutional in -
vestors (€6.0 billion). Among the asset classes, 
equity funds (€3.4 billion) and bond funds 
(€2.3 billion) above all recorded the highest in -
flows. Foreign mutual funds sold shares total -
ling €1.7 billion net in the German market. On 
balance, domestic non- banks were the main 
purchasers of mutual fund shares in the report -
ing month (€9.9 billion). German credit institu -
tions acquired shares for €1.2 billion net, while 
foreign investors offloaded mutual fund shares 
worth €1.5 billion net.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €18.6 billion in July 2016, which was €7.7 
billion down on the level of the previous 
month. This was due above all to a deterior -
ation in the trade surplus, but a worsening of 
the deficit in the invisible current transactions 
account, which comprises services as well as 
primary and secondary income, also contrib -
uted to this result.
The surplus in the goods account shrank by 
€5.8 billion on the month to stand at €20.9 
billion in July because goods exports fell more 
strongly than goods imports.
The deficit in the invisible current transactions 
account came in at €2.2 billion in July, the €1.9 
billion increase on the month arising in connec -
tion with the wider deficits in the services and 
secondary income accounts, which outweighed 
the rise in net receipts in the primary income German mutual

item. The deficit in the services account was up 
by €1.4 billion at €4.0 billion, mainly because 
of higher travel expenditure as well as lower 
receipts from IT services and from other busi -
ness services. The deficit in the secondary in -
come account widened by €1.2 billion to €3.4 
billion, notably on account of lower general 
government revenue from current taxes paid 
by non- residents on income and wealth as well 
as an upturn in payments to the EU budget. 
The surplus in the primary income account 
stood at €5.2 billion. This €0.8 billion improve -
ment on the previous month was not least due 
to the renewed decline in dividend payments 
to non- residents following a considerable rise 
earlier in the year.
The after- effects of the UK referendum as well 
as market players’ expectations over the future 
path of monetary policy in the major currency 
areas had an impact on developments in inter -
national financial markets in July. Against this 
backdrop, German cross- border portfolio in -
vestment generated net capital exports of 
€29.9 billion. On balance, this development 
was solely attributable to the selling of secur -
ities by non- resident investors (€30.5 billion), in 
which cross- border sales to the Bundesbank as 
part of the expanded asset purchase pro -
gramme (APP) were also a factor. All in all, 
money market paper (€13.7 billion) and public- 
sector bonds (€8.8 billion) made up the bulk of 
securities sold to residents. Foreign investors 
also offloaded €6.6 billion in bonds issued by 
the private sector and mutual fund shares 
worth €1.5 billion, investing instead in domes -
tic shares to the tune of €0.2 billion. Resident 
investors disposed of a small volume of foreign 
securities in July (€0.6 billion) in net terms. 
Sales of money market paper (€3.1 billion) and 
bonds (€1.0 billion) contrasted with purchases 
of shares (€1.8 billion) and mutual fund shares 
(€1.7 billion).Direct investment in July likewise generated net 
capital exports; these amounted to €7.6 billion. 
This development was mainly driven by non-  
resident investors withdrawing funds from en -
terprises in Germany (€5.0 billion), achieved 
exclusively through net redemptions of intra-  
group loans (€6.5 billion). Trade credit played a 
significant role in this regard (€4.3 billion). By 
contrast, foreign investors increased their 
equity investments in German branches by €1.5 
billion over the same period. Resident investors 
expanded their direct investment abroad by a 
net €2.6 billion in July, primarily by raising their 
equity stakes (€4.9 billion). Meanwhile, intra-  
group lending to enterprises outside Germany 
declined (€2.3 billion). This was due to the €3.5 
billion drop in trade credit, which outweighed 
the €1.3 billion increase in financial credit.
Other statistically recorded investment, com -
prising financial and trade credit (where these 
do not constitute direct investment) as well as 
bank deposits and other investments, experi -
enced net capital imports of €25.8 billion in 
July. Monetary financial institutions excluding 
the Bundesbank recorded inflows of €16.4 bil -
lion. These contrasted with net capital exports 
resulting from unsecuritised cross- border trans -
actions on the part of enterprises and house -
holds (€11.0 billion) as well as general govern -
ment (€3.1 billion). The Bundesbank’s net claims 
vis- à- vis non- residents fell by €23.5 billion, pri -
marily on account of a €20.8 billion decline  in 
the TARGET2 balance. Furthermore, an increase 
in short- term deposits with the Bundesbank 
–  mainly by non- Eurosystem central banks  − 
caused the Bundesbank’s liabilities to increase 
slightly (€2.8 billion).

Distributional effects of monetary policy
In the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis, central banks worldwide reduced their pol -
icy rates to historical lows and took recourse to a range of unconventional policy measures, espe -
cially purchase programmes. Amongst other things, this has sparked a heated debate over 
whether and in what way monetary policy affects the distribution of income and wealth. Whereas 
the task of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy is to maintain price stability and the political man -
date for redistribution lies with fiscal policymakers, it is nevertheless important that monetary 
policymakers, too, analyse distributional effects in greater depth to gain a better understanding 
of the potential interaction between monetary policy and distribution to help them perform their 
monetary policy mandate in the best possible way. Much of the corresponding research on these 
issues is still in its infancy, and the findings depend to a large extent on the underlying models 
and assumptions. Caution is therefore warranted when interpreting the results. However, outlined 
below are a number of conclusions that can already be made as things stand today.
Contrary to earlier assumptions, monetary policy may, too, possibly exhibit distributional effects 
over the economic cycle, albeit comparatively weak ones. In conventional monetary policy mode, 
policy rate cuts may cause a slight reduction in distributional inequality; however, the reduction 
is marginal and relatively insignificant in terms of distributional developments over the past few 
decades.
The much- touted view that non- standard monetary policy measures demonstrably increased 
inequality cannot be corroborated. It is derived from analyses which are based on an inadmis -
sible generalisation, neglect lagged distributional effects and fail to select the correct reference 
scenario.
Against the backdrop of existing studies and taking into account the three aspects mentioned 
above, it appears very doubtful, to put it mildly, that the expansionary non- standard monetary 
policy measures in recent years have caused inequality to increase overall. This particularly holds 
true for the distribution of income. Viewed in isolation, conventional interest rate policy and non- 
standard measures have probably, if anything, reduced income inequality. By contrast, the way in 
which these policies and measures have affected wealth distribution is less evident.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
In times of exceptionally low interest rates, a 
growing chorus of voices have been lamenting 
the paltry interest earnings for savers as equity 
and real estate prices reportedly soar to record 
highs. These people suspect that income and 
wealth are being redistributed towards the al -
ready very wealthy households; in other words, 
that both income and wealth inequality are on 
the rise. While finding a socially acceptable or 
even desirable level of (in)equality is normally 
one of the main tasks of elected parliaments 
and governments, these developments are 
now pushing central banks into the spotlight as 
well. The historically low interest rates in the 
major economic areas and the abundance of 
non- standard monetary policy measures imple -
mented worldwide since the onset of the 
financial  crisis have sparked a mounting debate 
over whether central bank action systematically 
and persistently benefits certain parts of soci -
ety.
The distribution of income and wealth is a fun -
damental political concern, ranking as it does 
as one of the building blocks of social cohesion 
and an issue that is constantly measured up 
against the general public’s sense of justice. 
Monetary policymakers, by contrast, have a 
particular interest in distributional matters on 
two counts – first, in an indirect sense, because 
the distribution situation and developments 
have a bearing on the general monetary policy 
conditions through their effects on economic 
activity. Second, monetary policymakers also 
have a very clear direct interest in income and 
wealth distribution since, as a number of more 
recent research papers show, the impact of 
monetary policy measures hinges in part on the 
currency area’s prevailing distribution situation, 
amongst other things.1Taking stock of the 
 distribution situation
To answer the question of how income and 
wealth are distributed within society, it is first 
necessary to determine what exactly is to be 
examined. On the one hand, that means defin -
ing the underlying income and wealth concept. 
For income, it is particularly common, along -
side gross (pre- tax) income or market income 
(before taxes and public transfers), to use (net) 
disposable income after government redistribu -
tion. With regard to wealth, the focus is typic -
ally on net wealth, where liabilities are sub -
tracted from positive asset items.2 The chal -
lenge here is to correctly record and value not 
just assets like real estate and business assets 
which often have no market price, but also ac -
crued state pension assets. Income and wealth 
are calculated at the individual level or at the 
equivalised household level.3
On the other hand, the individuals or groups of 
individuals for whom the distribution is to be 
investigated need to be identified. In addition 
to ordering individuals or households according 
to their income or wealth and analysing the re -
sulting percentiles,4 it can also be revealing to 
analyse the distribution within and between Low interest 
rates and rising asset prices spark criticism of monetary policy

2 It is sometimes also worth analysing the distribution of 
certain income and wealth components such as entrepre -
neurial income or real estate assets.
3 To control for household size, the equivalisation ap -
proach assigns a value of 1 to the head of the household 
and lower values to each additional adult, especially to 
each child, because the needs of a household grow with 
each additional member but not in a proportionate way.
4 Percentiles are used to order individuals or households by 
income or wealth and then assign them to 100 equally 
sized groups for each of which the average income or 
wealth is computed. Similar measures for creating subsets 
include deciles (ten groups), quintiles (five groups) and 
quartiles (four groups).Deutsche Bundesbank

viduals, employed and unemployed individuals, 
creditors and debtors, tenants and home -
owners, individuals with and without share -
holdings.5
The heterogeneity in the dimensions stated 
above plays a key role for central banks in that 
economic agents react differently to monetary 
policy measures depending on their character -
istics and financial situation. As distribution 
changes along each of the outlined dimensions 
may also entail changes in the monetary policy 
transmission process, it is not only distribution 
at a certain point in time but also its variations 
over time which are relevant.
The analysis below looks at the household level 
without any further sub- divisions. Owing to 
survey inconsistencies and data availability 
issues, comparing the distribution over time is 
only possible for a small number of countries 
and even there only to a limited extent.Between roughly 1980 and 2005, inequality in

coefficient6 – increased in the majority of sur -
veyed countries; income inequality in Germany 
comes in just below midway in a comparison 
of all OECD, EU and EMU countries (see the 
chart on page 15).7 At the international level, 
distributional developments have been mixed 
since the financial crisis began in 2007. While 
income inequality measured in terms of the 
Gini coefficient has risen in the United States 
and France, it has remained almost unchanged 
in Germany and declined slightly in the UK.8
Wealth inequality in Germany is high by inter -
national standards, with only the OECD coun -
tries the Netherlands, Austria and the United 
States as well as Sweden and Denmark show -
ing similar or higher levels of wealth concentra -
tion.9 However, Germany’s wealth distribution 
did not see any noteworthy changes between 
2002 and 2012 – a finding that is backed up by 
Bundesbank data from the Panel on Household 
Finances (PHF) and the Household Finance and 
Consumption Survey (HFCS) (see the chart on 
page 17).10
Task of monetary policy and 
its channels of distributional 
effects
It is the Eurosystem’s task to ensure price stabil -
ity in the euro area by means of its monetary 
policy. Over the economic cycle, this normally 
means that, during booms (spells in which ag -
gregate demand outstrips supply at normal 
utilisation levels, sending prices up), the central 
bank will increase the policy rate to put a 
damper on economic activity, while during 
downturns with low price pressures, it will cut 
the policy rate to stimulate economic activity. 
As they approached the effective lower bound 
in the aftermath of the severe financial and 
economic crisis of 2008-09, central banks in -
creasingly turned to non- standard measures to 
provide monetary policy stimuli. It would seem 
reasonable to assume that monetary policy, 
being an important instrument of macroeco -nomic stabilisation policy, also influences in -
come and wealth distribution.11Distribution

Distributional 
changes over the economic 
cycle6 The Gini coefficient takes a value of 0 when all individuals 
exhibit identical income or wealth and a value of 1 when 
total income or wealth is held by a single individual or 
household. The coefficient says just as little about absolute 
wealth levels, equal opportunities or quality of life as it 
does about the extent of absolute poverty. An increase in 
the Gini coefficient cannot automatically be put down to 
tax or social policy measures with lower redistributive ef -
fects, since it can also be caused by demographic changes 
such as a higher birth rate, immigration of poorer individ -
uals or a decline in life expectancy or in average household 
size. A low Gini coefficient of income can exist alongside a 
high Gini coefficient of wealth, as in the case of Sweden. 
Other distribution measures besides the Gini coefficient in -
clude the following. First, income and wealth ratios for dif -
ferent percentiles (99/ 1, 95/ 5, 90/ 10, 90/ 50, 75/ 25), which 
attach a higher weight to differences in income at the tails 
of distribution, whereas Gini coefficient differences close to 
the median are given the same weight as those far away; 
see A B Atkinson (1970), On the measurement of inequality, 
Journal of Economic Theory 2, pp 244-263; second, abso -
lute measures such as the share of income or wealth in the 
hands of the poorest x% of society, which make it possible 
to gain a better understanding of the extent of (relative) 
poverty; see F G De Maio (2007), Income inequality meas -

(2016), Box 1. The high Gini coefficient readings for wealth, 
compared with those for the distribution of income, are 
attributable to the significant share of households or indi -
viduals without any positive wealth, amongst other things.
11 However, changes would take place in income and 
wealth distribution over the course of the economic cycle 
even in the absence of monetary policy measures. And even 
in a hypothetical economy without money, those who take 
on entrepreneurial risk would tend to enjoy greater income 
and wealth during a boom, while those same people would 
suffer disproportionately heavy losses during a downturn.Deutsche Bundesbank

While the finding that monetary policy meas -
ures also have a distributional dimension is not 
new, it was typical for that line of thinking to 
implicitly assume that monetary policy was 
distribution- neutral over the economic cycle, in 
that it favoured the one subgroup of society 
during the upswing and the other during the 
downturn.12
This theory is increasingly being called into 
question, however. It does not hold, for in -
stance, when there are asymmetries in monet -
ary policy behaviour, thus when monetary pol -
icy shows a stronger response to asset price 
declines, say, than to corresponding increases 
in the context of financial stability.13 A second 
reason behind the asymmetrical distributional 
effects of monetary policy might be its varying 
levels of effectiveness over the economic cycle. 
According to this view, unexpected policy rate 
changes tend, for the most part, to have a 
stronger impact on expenditure and prices dur -
ing upswings than downturns.14 It is, therefore, conceivable that asymmetries in one form or 
another might also result in monetary policy 
having distributional effects which do not fully 
offset one another over the economic cycle.
However, drawing conclusions on the distribu -
tional effects of monetary policy is fraught with Earlier 
 assumption of distribution- neutral monet -
ary policy over economic cycle increasingly

from the public pension scheme are also taken into account, and reporting rather than survey data are used. 1 A value of 0% corres-

Historical evolution of income and wealth distribution 
in Germany
An analysis of the evolution of income and 
wealth distribution in Germany forms the 
empirical basis for the current debate on cross- country income and wealth distribu-tion. The Gini coeffi   cient is used as the measure of the unequal distribution of in-come and wealth. German reunifi  cation 
provides a natural caesura in the evolution 
of wealth and income inequality over time. 
The text below fi  rst outlines the evolution of income distribution and then that of 
wealth distribution.
According to OECD data, the old Federal 
Republic of Germany prior to reunifi  cation 
(West Germany) was one of the wealthiest 
and most egalitarian countries, as meas-
ured by income.1 In the 1980s the Gini co-
effi   cient of West German net household 
income was below 25% and remained con-stant between 1960 and 1990 (see the 
chart below).2
Immediately after German reunifi  cation, 
there was initially little sign of any change 
in the distribution of income. While income 
inequality tended to increase owing to the 
unifi  cation of the west German population 
with their poorer neighbours in eastern Germany (the former German Democratic Republic), incomes in eastern Germany 
were distributed more evenly, thus reducing the disparity somewhat.
3 However, the for-
mer factor appears to have become more 
dominant over the years as the unequal dis-
tribution of gross income subsequently in-
creased.
The adjacent chart illustrates that net in-
come distribution after 1999 began to trace 
the path of the increasingly unequal distri-

many: rising inequality and the transformation of 
Rhine capitalism, Changing Inequalities and Societal Impacts in Rich Countries: Thirty Countries’ Experi-
ences, chapter 12, p 271ff.2 See OECD (2008), Growing unequal?: Income distri-
bution and poverty in OECD countries. Equivalised 
market income comprises wage income (including em-ployers’ shares in social contributions), entrepreneurial 
income, property income excluding capital gains, ex-
cluding government pensions and social transfers. Ag-gregating all the individual market incomes in a house-
hold gives the household market income. These in-
comes can be personalised within the household. This 
is done by converting the household market income into a personalised income using the equivalence 
weightings of the modifi  ed OECD scale, which take ac-count of the number and age of the household mem-
bers. The resulting income is termed equivalised mar-
ket income. Deducting tax from the household market 
income and adding transfers gives the net household 
income. For a precise defi  nition of market income, see: S Bach, G Corneo and V Steiner (2007), From bottom to top: the entire distribution of market income in Ger-

bution of gross income, as the rise in the 
Gini coeffi   cient for net income shows. The 
Gini coeffi   cient for net household income 
increased noticeably between 2000 and 2006. It then fell slightly, though without 
fully reversing the rise that had taken place over the previous decade. In 2012, the Gini 
coeffi   cient stood at 29%. According to OECD data, this was slightly below the 
OECD average (31.5%) and above the Gini 
coeffi   cients of the Nordic OECD countries, 
but below the value for the United States.4
According to Corneo et al (2014), the in-
crease in income disparity in Germany is 
linked to changes in the economic system, 
such as tax law, the labour market or the 
social security system.5 Biewen and Juhasz 
(2012) examine six possible determinants 
which together can explain some 80% of the rise between 1999-00 and 2005-06. About half of this increase is explained by wage differentiation and around a quarter 
is the result of employment trends.6
Besides income distribution, wealth distri-
bution also plays a signifi  cant role in analys-
ing households’ fi  nancial situation. How-ever, the data on wealth distribution are 
limited. The table above gives an overview 
of the Gini coeffi   cients available from vari-
ous surveys covering differing periods.

ler, Weber and Westerheide (2005)8 investi-
gate the development of inequality in 
wealth distribution since the 1970s based on the sample survey of income and ex-
penditure (EVS);9 additional data based on 
the German Socio- Economic Panel (SOEP) 
were used for the period since 2000.10 For 
the most recent past, ie since 2010, the data from the “Panel on Household Fi-
nances” (PHF) survey are additionally avail-
able.11 Although the individual studies take 
different approaches and use different 
methods when measuring wealth, they 
nevertheless produce comparable results.
The inequality of distribution of households’ 
disposable net wealth in western Germany 
prior to reunifi  cation declined from 74.8% 
in 1973 to 70.1% in 1983 and 66.8% in 
1988 (see the table on page 19).12 Gini co-
effi   cients for eastern Germany are only 
available for the years since reunifi  cation.
Following reunifi  cation of the two German 
states, a growing inequality of wealth distri-
bution in Germany was apparent until 
around 2008. The Gini coeffi   cient for the whole of Germany rose from 63.2% in 1993 to 68.5% in 2003 and 74.8% in 
2008.13 While this development was largely 
constant across western Germany, in east-
ern Germany there was initially a drop in the somewhat higher level of wealth in-equality, from 69.4% in 1993 to 67.6% in 
1998, before the increase that was also ob-
served in western Germany set in and ran 
until 2008.
According to the various data sources, the 
evolution of wealth distribution since 2008 
appears somewhat unclear, but largely fl  atlining. If the PHF study is taken as a 
basis, net household wealth for the period 
between 2010 and 2014 shows a consist-
ently high Gini coeffi   cient of around 76%.148 A Ammermüller, A Weber und P Westerheide (2005),

9 A detailed description of the EVS can be found in 
Hauser and Stein (2003). The EVS has been carried out 
by the Federal Statistical Offi   ce every fi  ve years since 1962-63 based on a survey of between 45,000 and 60,000 households. Data on wealth have only been 
collected since 1973. In 1973 and 1983, data on par-ticipating interests held in private businesses were col-
lected according to the taxation value and subse-
quently had to be adjusted to the market value. Finan-cial assets include tradable shares. The surveys in 1993 
and 1998 included estimates of the market prices of 
real estate and land. The exclusion of households with a monthly household income of €18,000 or more may 
have skewed the estimates downwards. As a regular, 
cross- sector survey, the EVS provides only limited com-parability over time.10 The German Socio- Economic Panel (SOEP) is a rep-
resentative longitudinal study of individual persons in 
German households. In 2002, a questionnaire on wealth was introduced with questions on various wealth components. To improve comparability over 
time, the wealthiest households are disproportionately 
highly represented in the SOEP and are continuously 
asked about the various wealth components in all sur-vey rounds. For details see J R Frick (2006), A General 
Introduction to the German Socio- Economic Panel 
Study (SOEP) – Design, Contents and Data Structure.11 The “Panel on Household Finances” (PHF) is a sur-
vey by the Bundesbank on German households’ wealth 
and fi  nances. Details can be found in U von Kalck-
reuth, M Eisele, J Le Blanc, T Schmidt and J Zhu (2012), The PHF: a comprehensive panel survey on household

uncertainty for a good number of reasons. First 
and foremost, it is extremely difficult to pre -
cisely determine the impact monetary policy 
measures have. This is because when monetary 
policymakers introduce measures they almost 
invariably do so in response to changes in gen -
eral economic conditions. Thus, it is very diffi -
cult to distinguish between the impact of mon -
etary policy measures and the economic 
changes that prompted their introduction 
when analysing the effects of such a rule- based 
monetary policy. So although the academic lit -
erature has made huge strides, it remains a 
challenge to clearly isolate the effects of mon -
etary policy from those caused by other simul -
taneous or slightly earlier events.15
Second, when studying the impact of a monet -
ary policy that responds to other influences, it 
is important to be aware of the counterfactual 
development, ie what would have happened in 
the absence of the monetary policy response. 
Not taking a monetary policy measure such as 
a policy rate move has a distributional effect as 
well. The alternative to the distributional ef -
fects of a given monetary policy measure is not 
the absence of distributional effects but differ -
ent effects, either as a result of other changes 
in the economy or precisely because of the ab -
sence of the monetary policy measure and the 
potential disappointed expectations that this 
entails. Estimating this counterfactual develop -
ment calls for a theoretical model, the results 
of which may, however, be driven by the as -
sumptions about the model structure as well as 
by the data.
Third, there is the matter of measurement 
problems surrounding the income and wealth 
of high net worth individuals16 or changes to 
the prices of illiquid assets such as real estate, 
to name just two examples.
Fourth, the distributional effect of a monetary 
policy measure is not necessarily constant over 
time. For example, a policy rate cut can in -
crease inequality in the short term, whereas the positive real economic effects only act to re -
duce inequality over a longer period.17
These considerations already show that a 
clearly delineated investigation of the possible 
distributional effects of monetary policy comes 
up against a number of challenges. To make 
the task more difficult still, the distributional 
 effects of monetary policy can materialise 
through a host of different channels.
The recent literature identifies five transmission 
channels.18 (i) Income composition: a change in 
the policy rate affects disposable income in a 
heterogeneous manner, depending on the pri -
mary type of income. Diminishing interest rates 
tend to reduce income from financial assets, 
whereas business income tends to rise. Labour 
earnings and transfers normally respond with a 
slight time lag, and do so particularly via un -
employment developments. The overall effect 
on the distribution of income following an ex -
pansionary measure through the income com -
position channel cannot be quantified ex ante . 
This does not apply to the income of house -
holds participating actively and frequently in 
the financial market. They are better placed 
than other households to benefit from a policy 
rate cut: the early bird catches the worm, as it 
were (ii: financial segmentation). Income is also 
dependent on the composition of the asset 
portfolio: households with a large share of pos -Challenges in

itions that are not protected against inflation 
suffer more from the inflationary effect of a 
policy rate cut (iii: portfolio). Expansionary 
monetary policy tends to increase income in -
equality through channels (ii) and (iii). However, 
this is offset by counterbalancing effects from 
two other channels: unexpected policy rate 
cuts or rising prices hurt savers and benefit bor -
rowers (iv: savings redistribution) and reduce 
unemployment at the same time, at least tem -
porarily (v: earnings heterogeneity). This curs -
ory overview alone makes it plain that the 
interrelationships between effects, even in the 
realm of conventional interest rate policy, are 
complex and do not clearly have the same out -come.19 The question of how monetary policy 
affects the distribution of income is therefore 
an empirical one. To make matters more com -
plicated, the studies which explicitly address 
this question often do not consider all the 
transmission channels outlined here, or the 
selected  techniques do not allow effects to be 
unambiguously attributed to individual trans -
mission channels.20 Nevertheless, the transmis -
sion channels described here provide a useful, 
didactic structure (see the adjacent table), with 
the aid of which this article will first analyse the 
distributional effects of conventional monetary 
policy before illuminating the distributional ef -
fects of the non- standard monetary policy 
measures which have been increasingly ob -
served over the past few years.
Distributional effects of 
 conventional monetary policy
Recent empirical studies for the United States 
and for the United Kingdom show that surprise 
policy rate hikes seem to increase income in -
equality in the short term, whereas surprise pol -
icy rate cuts reduce income inequality in the 
short term.21 The income composition channel 
(channel (i)) is identified as the major driver for 
the USA: whereas wages are virtually invariant Unexpected 
 policy rate cuts

of wage income response), thus dispro-
portionately benefi  ting poorer people 
who have a lower education level and 
are more at risk of unemployment
* Based on Coibion, Gorodnichenko, Kueng and Silvia (2016). 1 The heterogeneity of households with regard to their primary source of income determines the distributional effect. In the 
Consumer Expenditure Survey, households are questioned 
about the following four sources of income: labour earnings, 
business, fi  nancial and other. Since the elasticity of each source 
of income to policy rate changes differs in size, this results in distributional effects. See Coibion et al (2016), p 2 ff, section 3.4 
and Appendix Table 2. 2 This channel is often referred to as the 
Fisher channel after I Fisher (1933), The debt- defl  ation theory of

the redistribution of nominal wealth, Journal of Political Econ-omy 114 (6), pp 1069-1097.

19 In addition, the effects of expansionary and contrac -
tionary monetary policy through the various channels are 
not inevitably mirror images of each other, as in the case of 
channel (ii).
20 These channels cannot be entirely applied to the distri -
butional effects on wealth, partly because the examination 
of the latter has to include the adjustment in human capital 
formation, say.

All three papers focus on unexpected policy rate cuts and 
their inequality- reducing effect. Since the selected VAR ap -
proaches are linear, the symmetry produces mirror- image 
results for unexpected policy rate hikes. This approach inev -
itably fails to take into account the above- mentioned pos -
sible asymmetries between expansionary and contraction -
ary monetary policy measures.Deutsche Bundesbank

and entrepreneurial income rises, lower interest 
rates make financial income drop significantly 
while countercyclical transfers rise. The causal 
relationship between transfers and monetary 
policy is unclear, though. The rise in transfers, 
however, is a significant driver of diminishing in -
come inequality, since transfers make up much 
of the income of low- income earners.22 Still, 
monetary policy only goes a little of the way 
towards explaining the development of income 
inequality in the models, and it has had no influ -
ence on the trend growth in US income inequal -
ity since the 1980s.23 The distributional effect of 
monetary policy seems to be less pronounced 
when the central bank pursues an inflation tar -
get.24 This could be seen as an indication that 
the more central banks are bound to rules, the 
less important unsystematic monetary policy 
measures become for  distribution. Although 
the studies also find indications of effects along 
channels (ii) to (v), these would appear to be 
relatively negligible in quantitative terms.
The main finding made by Coibion et al (2016) 
– that expansionary monetary policy reduces 
income inequality, while contractionary monet -
ary policy increases it – can also be found in 
more recent structural models. In a New 
Keynesian model framework with labour mar -
ket frictions, in which the relative labour earn -
ings effect is modelled in detail depending on 
the employee’s qualification level, an expan -
sionary monetary policy initially reduces un -
employment; however, since it is precisely the 
bottom earners who are hit particularly hard by 
unemployment, an expansionary monetary pol -
icy acts to diminish inequality through the in -
come composition and earnings heterogeneity 
channels.25 Furthermore, an expansionary 
monetary policy reduces the inequality of the 
distribution of income and wealth in a model 
framework with illiquid asset positions, in 
which both the heterogeneity of household 
portfolios and liquidity constraints play an im -
portant role (see the box on pages 30 to 34).26 
In addition to channel (i), this model gives in-  
depth consideration to the portfolio channel 
(iii) and the savings redistribution channel (iv), though both are deemed to be of secondary 
importance.
Third and lastly, inequality- reducing effects of 
expansionary monetary policy can also be re -
vealed by conducting a detailed analysis of the 
heterogeneous effects of short- term changes 
in real interest rates. These real interest rate 
changes occur in conjunction with monetary 
policy measures and affect households to very 
different degrees, depending on their portfolio 
structure.27 In this approach, all five channels 
Distributional 
effect chiefly through the income effect of unemployment22 Insofar as the rise in transfers comes more in response 
to a downturn in economic activity than to an unexpected 
monetary policy measure, the inequality- reducing effect of 
expansionary monetary policy is probably overstated.
23 However, the results achieved by Coibion et al (2016) 
should be subjected to critical scrutiny insofar as they only 
relate to the unsystematic, surprising part of monetary pol -
icy, which is measured here using the narrative approach of 
Romer and Romer (2004); Ch D  Romer and D H  Romer 
(2004), A new measure of monetary shocks: derivation and 
implications, American Economic Review 94(4), pp 1055-
1084. The time series for such shocks, dubbed “monetary 
policy shocks”, is derived from (i) a time series of intended 
policy rate changes (determined inter alia from FOMC min -
utes) and (ii) the Fed’s internal inflation and GDP projec -
tions. The errors remaining when regressing (i) on (ii) then

Microsimulation studies for 
the euro area not explicitly 
related to monetary policy
Alongside analyses of the impact of monetary 
policy measures on distribution, microsimula -
tion studies, too, deliver useful information on 
the distributional effects of a surprise decline in 
price levels or an increase in asset prices. The 
strength of this microsimulation method lies in 
its ability to precisely replicate the actual distri -
bution of the various wealth components in 
different households, sectors and countries of 
the euro area. However, such studies are not 
analyses that explore the distributional effects 
of a monetary policy measure, since the first 
stage of the transmission of a monetary policy 
measure to the general price level or to asset 
prices is not modelled.28 Microsimulation stud -
ies are classical partial analyses which disregard 
certain parts of the overall impact, as well as 
feedback and second- round effects. Two of 
these studies which use Bundesbank data from 
the Panel on Household Finances (PHF) and the 
Household Finance and Consumption Survey 
(HFCS) are discussed below. They focus not on 
the distribution of income but on that of 
wealth.
The first study simulates a sudden and unex -
pected 10% drop in the price level and exam -
ines its impact on the wealth distribution.29 A 
decline on that scale can normally be expected 
to occur in the aftermath of a strong expansion 
in aggregate supply or a significant decline in 
aggregate demand, but it could also material -
ise in conjunction with an unforeseen, highly 
contractionary monetary policy, as this, too, 
dampens the rate of price growth. This paper mainly analyses the aforementioned portfolio 
and savings redistribution channels (iii) and (iv), 
and shows that a surprise drop in inflation of 
this magnitude increases net wealth inequality 
in the euro area as a whole, but reduces it in 
Germany, as well as in Austria and Malta. This 
is mainly down to leverage levels among 
young, middle- income households. In these 
three countries, young, middle- income house -
holds have very little debt, which is why the 
price decline does not raise their real debt 
levels by much, either. And the rise in wealth 
inequality is just as meagre, since the wealth of 
these typically less affluent young households 
does not diminish.
The second study, meanwhile, analyses the dir -
ect effect of a 10% increase in housing, bond 
and equity prices on the wealth distribution.30 
As explained below, this is the oft-  postulated 
isolated effect of an expansionary monetary 
policy measure (conventional or unconven -
tional) on asset prices. This paper looks particu -
larly at the income composition channel (i), as -
suming unchanged labour earnings. PHF/HFCS 
data31 reveal that wealth inequality increases 
when equity prices rise, but that it declines Microsimulation 
studies provide no information on distributional effects of  monetary policy, but they do very clearly illumin-ate certain  distributional aspects
Sudden drop in 
price level leads to redistribution among house-holds, sectors and countriesEquity price appreciation amplifies wealth inequality, hous-ing price infla-tion reduces it
28 It goes without saying that in the absence of a monet -
ary policy measure as a starting point, it is also not possible 
to analyse distributional effects through channels that are 
not directly related to wealth, such as parts of the income 
composition channel (i) and the earnings heterogeneity 
channel (v).

Distributional consequences of asset price inﬂ  ation
in the euro area
The non- standard monetary policy meas-
ures deployed by a large number of central 
banks tend to have a highly infl  ationary ef-
fect on asset prices. This asset price infl  a-
tion can be associated with substantial dis-tributional effects, which is why it is attract-
ing ever more attention from policymakers 
and the public at large.1
A recently published paper (Adam and 
Tzamourani, 2016)2 sets out to quantify the 
distributional effects of asset price infl  ation 
in the euro area. The data set used in the 
analysis is taken from the latest Eurosystem 
Household Finance and Consumption Sur-vey (HFCS), which provides detailed, har-
monised and representative information on 
euro- area households’ balance sheet items 
for the 2010 reference year.3 Altogether, 
roughly 62,000 households from all the 
euro- area countries at that time (except for Ireland) were surveyed.
Distribution of capital gains across the 
population
The paper begins by exploring the distribu-
tion of capital gains relative to household 
net wealth in the euro area given a 10% 
increase in equity, bond and housing prices.The table below shows that the capital 
gains associated with equity and bond price 
infl  ation are confi  ned to a relatively small 
group of euro- area households. The median 
household does not benefi  t at all from 
these price appreciations, while the top 5% of households that benefi  t most from them experience net wealth gains of roughly 3% 
to 4%. These gains are rather large given 
the 10% increase in bond and equity prices 
considered here. Housing price appreci-ations, by contrast, benefi  t a substantially 
larger proportion of the population than do higher equity or bond prices; here, the me-
dian household experiences large net wealth gains of close to 8%. The paper

then moves on to investigate whether the 
capital gains and household net wealth are 
systematically related. It does so by once 
again analysing capital gains, but not, as before, by ordering all the households ac-
cording to the size of their capital gains but by splitting them into four groups based on their net wealth.
Capital gains across the net wealth 
 distribution
The distributional effects of the capital 
gains in the euro area differ quite substan-
tially from one asset class to the next. The 
above chart shows the capital gains for the 
different household groups within the net wealth distribution (average group gains divided by average net wealth). “Poor households” are defi  ned as those in the bottom 20% of the euro- area net wealth distribution, “middle class households” as 
the 50% of households immediately above 
the poor ones, while “upper middle class households” are the 25% of households 
above that. Lastly, “rich households” are the top 5% of households in the net wealth dis-tribution.Capital gains from bond price appreciation 
display no signifi  cant variation across these 
four household groups. Relatively few households benefi  t from higher bond prices, and their number is roughly the same across the net wealth distribution. 
The situation is noticeably different for cap-ital gains from equity price increases, which are heavily concentrated among the richest 5% of households. The distribution of cap-
ital gains from housing price increases, 
meanwhile, has a hump shape, with gains 
being concentrated among middle class and upper middle class households in the 
euro- area net wealth distribution. Poor and 
rich households benefi  t to a lesser extent (relative to their net wealth) from housing 
price appreciations; fewer poor households own real estate, while for rich households, 
real estate accounts for a smaller share of 
their wealth.
As Adam and Tzamourani (2016) demon-
strate, the individual countries of the euro 
area display substantial differences to one another. Thus, there are some countries where poor households, too, are more 
likely to be homeowners and are highly le-
veraged. For this reason, these households 
benefi  t to a greater extent (relative to their net wealth) from rising housing prices than 
other wealth groups. The opposite holds 
true for Austria, Germany, France and Italy, where poor households are less likely to be homeowners and therefore benefi  t least of 
all (relative to other groups in the net 
wealth distribution) from housing price in-
creases. In Germany, where house owner-ship levels are particularly low, housing price increases do not affect the median 
household.
The resulting changes in net wealth in-
equality are refl  ected in the change in the 
Gini coeffi   cient for net wealth distribution.

cient to decline substantially, particularly in 
countries in which poor households benefi  t 
to a disproportionately strong extent from 
such increases. Rising equity prices cause 
the Gini coeffi   cient to increase signifi  cantly, 
while bond price appreciation leaves the 
net wealth distribution largely unchanged.
While the analysis of the HFCS data does 
not permit a causal analysis of the effects of 
monetary policy surprises, it is worth at 
least trying to gauge the direct distribu-
tional effects via asset prices. Following the paper of Peersman and Smets (2003),
4 this 
is done by determining how an unexpected policy rate change affects equity, bond and housing prices and then analysing the direct consequences for the distribution of wealth. The outcome is that an unexpected monet-
ary policy easing triggers a disproportion-ately large increase in the capital gains at the upper end of the net wealth distribu-
tion – the richest 5% of households experi-ence capital gains that are fi  ve times higher, on average, than those of the other house-holds. By the same token, these households experience capital losses that are fi  ve times 
heavier if monetary policy is unexpectedly 
tightened.
Distributional consequences of the 
ECB’s OMT announcements
The ECB’s programme of outright monetary 
transactions (OMTs) was announced over 
the summer of 2012, but these operations 
were subsequently never activated. The 
OMT announcement nevertheless had large 
and persistent effects on a range of fi  nan-
cial market prices. Following Krishnamurty 
et al (2004),5 the programme’s distribu-
tional consequences are derived from iden-
tifi  ed announcement effects on bond and 
equity prices, while the effects on housing 
prices were not included on account of 
data shortages.6 As far as the distributional consequences are concerned, the effects of 
the OMT announcements were found, in qualitative terms, to strongly resemble 
those of an unexpected easing of monetary policy. Here, too, the main benefi  ciaries are 
to be found at the top end of the net wealth distribution. Quantitatively speak-ing, the distributional implications of the OMT announcements largely matched 
those of a surprise loosening of the policy 
rate by 175 basis points. However, this mi-
crosimulation study does not observe all the 
transmission channels of an expansionary 
policy stance, which is why generalisations 
should be viewed with some caution.

when housing prices go up.32 However, the dis -
persion of the effects on wealth distribution is 
significant, notably in the case of housing price 
inflation. Whilst inequality clearly subsides in 
countries where home ownership rates are 
high (Spain, Finland), this effect is considerably 
weaker in countries with a high proportion of 
rentals, such as Austria, France and Germany 
(see the box on pages 25 to 27).
Distributional effects of 
 non-standard monetary 
 policy measures
In the current situation, with nominal policy 
rates hovering close to 0% in Japan, the euro 
area and the United Kingdom, the scope for 
reducing policy rates as a means of implement -
ing expansionary monetary policy is nearly ex -
hausted. Central banks have switched to other 
methods instead, such as purchasing large vol -
umes of long- dated bonds as a way of lower -
ing the long- term nominal interest rate.33 This, 
too, can give rise to complex distributional ef -
fects.34 The general public holds the central 
banks’ purchase programmes responsible for 
the considerable price increases seen in certain 
assets such as real estate and equities, which 
are associated with a redistribution towards 
wealthier individuals.
A view appears to have crystallised in the exist -
ing academic literature that non- standard mon -
etary policy measures have increased wealth 
inequality in the short term by raising asset 
prices. The medium to long- term effect on 
wealth distribution, however, is not clear, since 
this is strongly dependent on the macroeco -
nomic adjustment processes triggered in re -
sponse to the monetary policy measures. These 
adjustment processes have not been given the 
attention they deserve in the vast majority of 
existing studies (see the table on page 29). The 
effect of non-  standard monetary policy meas -
ures on the distribution of income is driven by 
the same arguments. While the non- standard 
measures tend to increase income inequality through that part of the income composition 
channel (i) that relates to financial income, they 
foreseeably reduce them through the parts of 
the income composition channel (i) that do not 
relate to financial income and through the sav -
ings redistribution channel (iv) and the earnings 
heterogeneity channel (v), albeit with a certain 
time lag. In light of the insights summarised 
above on the distributional effects of conven -
tional expansionary monetary policy, a decline 
in income inequality as a result of the non-  
standard monetary policy measures seems 
probable, insofar as non- standard measures do 
not have an entirely different impact on the 
distribution than conventional monetary policy, 
at least in essential respects. As changes in em -
ployment, in particular, have a huge bearing on 
distributional developments,35 any efforts to 
gauge the distributional effects of non- standard 
monetary policy measures should not only con -
sider the direct effects on asset prices, but also 
the lagged distributional effects caused by 
changes in the labour market.
Finally, it should be borne in mind that distribu -
tional developments are, for the most part, 
analysed in relation to the status quo  prior to 
the implementation of the monetary policy 
measure in question; it would be more rele -
vant, however, to compare them with the 
counterfactual situation – that is, a situation in 
which the central banks took no action.36Asset price infla-
tion in wake of non- standard monetary policy measures just one aspect of their distribu-
tional effect
Expansionary

transmission 
channels over medium term, making overall 
impact  uncertain
32 Equity price increases benefit only a small number of 
rich households, whereas a rise in housing prices makes 
significantly more households wealthier in nominal terms 
– in particular the middle class. Bond price increases pro -
duce fairly equally distributed growth in wealth.
33 On top of this, the Eurosystem has conducted a series 
of very long- term refinancing operations (LTROs, VLTROs, 
TLTROs), which have had a similar effect on long- term 
bond yields.
34 Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2016) see this as a redistri -
bution from taxpayers to banks, and specific asset pur -
chases such as the Securities Markets Programme (SMP) 
quite possibly even as an international redistribution bene -

As mentioned above, an analysis of the distri -
butional effects of not taking the monetary 
policy measure requires a structural theoretical 
model that suitably captures both non- standard 
monetary policy measures and a sufficient de -
gree of household heterogeneity. Bayer et al 
(2015) take a first step in this direction.37 The 
starting point of their analysis is a sudden shock 
to income risk, to which households respond 
with stronger demand for more liquid invest -
ment products. Excess demand for such invest -
ment products can lead to consumption and 
investment restraint and thus to welfare losses. 
This modelling approach captures an important 
aspect both of the acute financial crisis and of the ensuing weakness of economic activity that 
has lasted to this day, and the significance of 
monetary policy also quickly becomes appar -
ent. By providing an adequate measure of li -
quid assets, specifically central bank money, it 
can increase welfare but also contribute to 
asset price inflation. If the central bank acts ac -
cordingly with rule- based optimising behaviour, 
households with a high proportion of real 
assets and those with a low income (and the 
major advantage of high employment) benefit Taking into 
account the counterfactual situation and the status quo prior to imple-mentation of non- standard monetary policy measures, these appear to be welfare- boosting in spite of their distributional effectsDistributional effects of non-standard monetary policy measures in time series and partial equilibrium approaches

Distributional effect of monetary policy arising from 
 valuation and general equilibrium effects
Many important questions regarding the 
distributional consequences of monetary policy can only be answered within the context of a micro- based general equilib-
rium model. For example, owing to the en-dogeneity of monetary policy measures, the 
winners and losers of systematic monetary 
policy can only be identifi  ed using a coun-
terfactual analysis. A model of the kind de-scribed above additionally enables the user 
to break down the distributional effects of 
unexpected monetary policy measures into 
individual income and wealth effects. In particular, it yields information on welfare effects which go beyond those relating to 
the pure valuation effects of monetary pol-icy on assets.
For this purpose, it is important to capture 
the interaction of monetary policy measures and the distribution of income and assets in 
a theoretically consistent manner: Bayer, Luetticke, Pham- Dao and Tjaden (2015),
1 
and, building on their work, Luetticke 
(2015)2 have developed a model framework 
that addresses these matters. Expanding on 
the New Keynesian model with its price- 
setting rigidities by incorporating household 
heterogeneity, it accounts for the distribu-
tion of wealth and liquidity of assets.
In this model framework, the (welfare) ef-
fects of monetary policy measures are very unevenly distributed. Monetary policy has a distorting effect on the relative prices of la-bour and illiquid and liquid assets and thus changes the level of total household assets 
(including human capital) in a number of 
very different ways. Hence, monetary policy 
infl  uences aggregate demand not just by means of intertemporal substitution but 
also through its distributional effects.A New Keynesian model incorporating heterogeneous households
Compared with a New Keynesian model in-
corporating a representative agent, as is 
customarily used for analysing monetary policy, Bayer et al (2015) and Luetticke 
(2015) deviate from the assumption of com-
plete fi  nancial markets, ie the notion that 
the household sector can fully protect itself 
against income risks. Since households are 
borrowing- constrained, they accumulate 
precautionary savings in the form of nom-
inal and real assets, albeit with differing de-
grees of liquidity: nominal assets are more 
liquid than real assets. In this context, poorer households hold a larger share of 
their total assets in low- yielding liquid nom-
inal assets (eg in the form of savings and overnight deposits) while most wealthy 
households invest in more illiquid real assets 
that offer a higher return (eg real estate). According to the Survey of Consumer Fi-
nances (SCF), this pattern is also refl  ected in 
the empirical distribution of portfolios in 
the United States (see chart on page 31).
The private sector can create illiquid assets 
by investing in physical capital, with the ef-
fect that a change in demand for illiquid 
assets is directly refl  ected in a change in in-
vestment. By contrast, any change in de-mand for liquid assets or in the supply of 
such assets, for instance as a result of cen-
tral bank policy, only has an indirect effect 
on investment in the economy inasmuch as

it modifi  es the relative returns generated by 
illiquid and liquid assets.
Thanks to the model framework used here, 
it is now possible to look beyond the distri-butional effects of the macroeconomic con-
sequences induced by monetary policy (ie 
the business cycle effect) and to study the 
central bank’s infl  uence on changes in the 
prices of nominal and real assets (ie the 
portfolio effect/debt defl  ation).
Distributional effects of an unexpected 
change in the policy rate
Luetticke (2015) examines the distributional 
effects of an unexpected temporary in-
crease in the nominal interest rate by one 
standard deviation, ie by 18 basis points. As with a model incorporating a representative 
agent, this approach initially generates a decline in aggregate consumer demand and demand for capital goods, causing 
GDP to fall by 0.54% on impact.3
That said, this policy affects the wealth and 
income of households very differently. The 
table below quantifi  es the losses and gains 
experienced by individual wealth deciles in the period during which an unexpected 
change in the policy rate occurs, relative to 
the average consumption level within the 
decile, and thus illustrates the magnitude of 
those changes for the respective wealth

groups.4 Higher nominal interest rates, 
coupled with falling infl  ation, lead to an 
even sharper increase in the real interest 
rate on nominal debt securities and there-
fore result in a redistribution from debtors 
to savers. The model assumes that, in ac-cordance with the SCF data, slightly more than 20% of households start off as net 
debtors. Due to the mechanism known as 
debt defl  ation (Fisher, 1933), the share of 
these households rises alongside their level of debt.
5 Private households’ efforts to save 
incur a further decline in aggregate con-sumer demand, thereby highlighting the 
interaction between redistributional conse-
quences and the macroeconomic effects of monetary policy.
A restrictive monetary policy additionally in-
tensifi  es the degree of income inequality 
and therefore indirectly also wealth inequal-
ity because the mostly wealthier entrepre-
neurial households benefi  t from rising profi  t margins while labour income falls on ac-
count of dwindling demand for labour. On 
the other hand, wealthier households 
– which tie most of their wealth up in il-liquid real assets – have to contend with 
losses in value due to falling capital goods 
prices. However, since these losses are only partially realised owing to the long- term in-
vestment horizon, the overall degree of 
wealth inequality nonetheless increases.
The adjacent chart shows the changes in 
the Gini coeffi   cients for wealth and income 
in basis points and over time. Monetary 
tightening only increases wealth inequality 
to a minimal degree while income inequal-ity goes up perceptibly in the short term but more or less returns to the initial state after about a year.
These results are consistent with the empir-
ical fi  ndings of von Coibion et al (2012) 
which demonstrate that a restrictive monet-
ary policy heightens inequality.6 Unlike a 
vector autoregression (VAR) model, the 
model in question has the advantage of de-
picting, distinguishing between and quanti-
fying the individual income and wealth 
 effects, as shown in the table on page 31.
Distributional effects of systematic

damentals, it is no longer possible to empir-
ically identify the contribution of monetary 
policy to the overall economy and to in-
equality as compared to simultaneous changes in other factors. In view of the 
above, it is therefore essential to consult a 
theoretical model.
With this in mind, Bayer et al (2015) com-
mence by pointing out that a higher level of income risk leads to a decline in both con-
sumer and investment demand as house-
holds are inclined to increase their precau-
tionary savings by primarily building up re-
serves in liquid securities while liquidity- constrained households tend to liquidate real assets. This behaviour causes infl  ation to fall, investment activity to contract and 
illiquid capital goods to depreciate.
In particular, Bayer et al investigate the dis-
tributional effects of stabilising monetary 
policy in response to a slump in aggregate 
demand. During the “Great Recession”, the 
US economy’s slow pace of recovery was 
mainly attributed to a persistently low level 
of demand. While tighter credit standards 
and the need for deleveraging are often cited as explanatory factors,
7 Bayer et al 
(2015) show that heightened uncertainty concerning future income developments can also play a key role in weakening de-
mand.The model allows the user to make a coun-
terfactual analysis and, notably, to draw a comparison between stabilising and non- stabilising monetary policy in the event of 
changes in demand. The central bank is in a position to stabilise the economy as a whole by enlarging the monetary base in response to any increase in demand for liquid assets, thus countering any defl  ationary pressure.
Such stabilising monetary policy on the part 
of the central bank has a positive effect on 
overall economic welfare. The household sector would, on average, be willing to forego around 0.8% of its annual level of 
consumption in order to prompt stabilising 
central bank intervention measures. How-
ever, the above table makes clear that this 
average fi  gure masks highly heterogeneous changes in welfare.
Whenever the central bank stabilises the economy, this leads to an increase in the 
prices of illiquid assets (eg real estate) rela-tive to labour income and compared with a 
scenario in which no intervention occurs. 
Exceedingly high- income households (top 
quintile of the distribution of income) which 
have accumulated only small quantities of 
illiquid assets lose out under a policy geared 
to stabilisation. If the central bank were to

policy action in the model, while households 
with a high income but low holdings of real 
assets tend to be worse off (see the box on 
pages 30 to 34).
Conclusion
Given the mandate of monetary policy to safe -
guard price stability and the division of tasks 
with policy areas in national ownership, distri -
butional effects are not, nor can they be, a pri -
mary or secondary goal of monetary policy. 
That said, the distributional status quo  does 
have a bearing on the effects produced by 
monetary policy measures. For central banks, 
then, a profound understanding of these ef -
fects, and thus research on the interplay be -
tween monetary policy and distribution, will 
remain important topics going forward.Many questions surrounding the impact of 
monetary policy measures on the distribution 
of income and wealth and more still on the 
consequences of a certain income and wealth 
distribution for the transmission of monetary 
policy still have not been extensively explored. 
The fact that the first two waves of the Bun -
desbank’s wealth survey (Panel on Household 
Finances, PHF) showed no strong signs of sig -
nificant redistribution between 2010-11 and 
2014 could be taken as an indication that the 
non- standard monetary policy measures car -
ried out by the Eurosystem up to 2014 did not 
have any major redistributive effects.38 How -
ever, further research on this topic – notably 
assessments of distributional microdata in con -Distributional 
effects provide useful insights for monetary policy but not a monetary policy objectiveResearch on monetary policy and distribution still in its infancyallow a recession to occur, these house-
holds would be affected by falling labour income, yet this negative effect would be more than offset by the more favourable 
purchase price of real assets. According to 
the model, households with highly liquid 
assets are likewise placed at a disadvantage 
as they bear the burden of funding the 
monetary expansion. Conversely, stabilising 
monetary policy particularly benefits wealthy households whose assets are 
mostly real, as well as poor and low- income 
households that are wholly dependent on their labour income and for whom stabil-ised wages and demand for labour are of critical importance. Eventually, stabilised incomes , especially those of liquidity- constrained households with a high pro-pensity to consume, will impact positively 
on consumer demand and thus on the ef-
fectiveness of systematic monetary policy.
38 However, a number of factors qualify this statement. 
These include the time lag before redistributive effects be -
come visible in wealth distribution, the fact that strong 
 redistributive effects might have been offset by equally 
strong countervailing redistributive effects caused by other 
factors, and finally the fact that the counterfactual devel -
opment without monetary policy measures is unknown.Deutsche Bundesbank

junction with theoretical models – would ap -
pear to be necessary to gain a rough idea of 
the counterfactual situation that is so crucial 
for evaluation yet often disregarded and more 
difficult to communicate in the public debate.
Drawing on the existing research, it would ap -
pear reasonable to draw the following conclu -
sions from the current perspective.
First, contrary to earlier assumptions, monetary 
policy may, too, possibly exhibit distributional 
effects over the economic cycle, albeit com -
paratively weak ones.
Second, in conventional monetary policy mode, 
policy rate cuts may cause a slight reduction in 
distribution inequality; however, the reduction 
is marginal and relatively insignificant in terms 
of distributional developments over the past 
few decades.
Third, there are three reasons why the much-  
touted view that non- standard monetary policy 
measures had demonstrably increased inequal -
ity cannot be corroborated. That view was de -
rived from analyses which are based on an in -
admissible pars pro toto  assumption, neglect 
lagged distributional effects and fail to select 
the correct underlying reference scenario.
Regarding the first reason, most available stud -
ies confine themselves to analysing asset price 
developments and their effects on the distribu -
tion of wealth and income. Once asset price 
increases become associated, to a greater or 
lesser degree, with monetary policy measures, 
it is then argued that monetary policy has in -
creased inequality. This is incorrect insofar as 
that is just one aspect of the effect of monetary 
policy measures. Besides affecting asset prices, 
monetary policy measures in general and the 
non- standard measures applied over the past 
few years in particular have also had a bearing 
on economic activity, employment, macroeco -
nomic uncertainty and confidence among mar -
ket players. A major driver of income inequality, 
in particular, is the labour market and the risk of unemployment for low- skilled, poorer 
households.39 Severe recessions lead to signifi -
cant welfare losses, in particular through their 
effects on the labour market.40 Monetary pol -
icy measures which reduce the risk of un -
employment therefore have a great deal of po -
tential to reduce distributional inequality.
As for the second reason, it is also true of mon -
etary policy distributional effects that they can -
not materialise everywhere simultaneously. 
Equity prices, for example, move almost imme -
diately in response to monetary policy meas -
ures, whereas price changes for illiquid assets 
are only measurable with a considerable delay, 
at best, and the same holds true for real eco -
nomic effects through consumption, invest -
ment and employment. It therefore follows 
that the distributional effects of non- standard 
monetary policy measures can also change as 
time progresses since the measure in question 
was taken and that measures which initially ap -
pear to be redistributing upwards can turn out 
to have the opposite effect later on.
The third and final reason is that the status quo  
before the measure is taken often serves as the 
reference point when assessing monetary pol -
icy measures. This does not make sense, how -
ever, insofar as the measure was often intro -
duced precisely because this status quo  was 
about to change due to unforeseen circum -
stances. The right reference point for analysing 
the distributional effect of a monetary policy 
measure, then, is not the distribution before 
the measure is implemented, but the distribu -
tion that would have materialised if the meas -
ure had not been introduced. However, deter -
mining this counterfactual situation calls for a 
whole series of assumptions which can best be 
made using a consistent theoretical model.Current level of

Judging by what the existing literature says 
about these three points, it appears very doubt -
ful, to put it mildly, that the expansionary non- 
standard monetary policy measures in recent 
years have caused inequality to increase over -
all. Whereas the non- standard measures, viewed in isolation, are likely to have reduced 
inequality in terms of the distribution of in -
come, their aggregate effect on the distribu -
tion of wealth still remains unclear in view of 
the three reasons described above.Deutsche Bundesbank

Globalisation and the transmission 
of global financial shocks to the euro- area 
countries – implications for (national) 
 economic policy
In recent years, the experiences of several emerging market economies in the wake of the global 
financial crisis have underscored the crucial impact of global factors on the financial markets and 
the limited power of national economic policy to smooth capital inflows and outflows. This has 
given rise to the theory that there is no longer much scope for national monetary policy to influ -
ence domestic financial conditions and that regulating capital flows is the only way to tame 
global financial flows. The countries of the euro area, where the Eurosystem is responsible for 
monetary policy and the financial markets are highly integrated, also face this problem. The key 
question is whether the single monetary policy tends to cushion the impact of global shocks or 
whether it makes the member states even more vulnerable to external factors. The proper func -
tioning of the monetary union also hinges on the options available to national economic policy -
makers to prevent macroeconomic imbalances and ensure sustainable conditions both internally 
and in external relations.
Empirical studies by the Bundesbank, which also include the effects of the global financial crisis, 
show that membership of the European monetary union strengthens resilience in the global 
financial setting. Given the euro area’s size, the Eurosystem is better able than the central banks 
of small countries to influence the monetary and financial conditions in its geographical remit 
and reap the benefits of a floating exchange rate regime. Commercial banks’ equal access to 
Eurosystem open market operations and the redistribution of liquidity within the Eurosystem 
through the TARGET mechanism partly offset the asymmetric effects of global shocks on the dif -
ferent member countries. However, the experiences of some euro- area countries have also shown 
that being shielded from abrupt reversals of capital flows can delay necessary real wage adjust -
ments. Establishing a European capital markets union may help to further increase international 
risk sharing based on market mechanisms whilst also creating incentives for more efficient eco -
nomic structures. This is all the more important given that, in recent years, the influence of domes -
tic factors on private capital flows has increased again relative to global factors.
Combined with an appropriate policy mix of sound public finances, effective financial sector 
regulation and targeted macroprudential measures, the leeway that the monetary union’s pro -
tective role affords its member states must be used to safeguard financial and macroeconomic 
stability. By contrast, regulation of capital flows between member countries would pose a major 
hindrance to the internal market and disrupt monetary policy transmission; it should therefore be 
considered only as a temporary solution and a last resort.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
During the financial crisis, global factors again 
had a key influence on the capital flows of sev -
eral emerging market economies. US monetary 
policy in particular has a major impact on inter -
national financial markets and limits the op -
tions available to national economic policymak -
ers – especially in smaller countries – to smooth 
capital inflows and outflows. This raises the 
question of whether the “impossible trinity” 
theory still holds true in today’s globalised 
world. The theory goes that, in principle, a 
state can achieve (only) two of the three fol -
lowing economic policy objectives at the same 
time: independent monetary policy, stable 
exchange  rates and free capital mobility. In re -
cent years, however, doubts have grown as to 
whether floating exchange rates alone are suf -
ficient to grant national central banks sufficient 
scope for independent monetary policymaking. 
Consequently, it may be that only direct capital 
controls can prevent undesirable external spill -
overs to the domestic economy and the finan -
cial sector.1 The effectiveness of monetary pol -
icy in the face of global shocks is also a matter 
of importance to the euro- area countries, espe -
cially as the Eurosystem’s monetary policy can -
not always satisfy sometimes conflicting na -
tional interests. However, the economic weight 
of the euro area in the global economy com -
bined with its floating exchange rate regime 
can also help to assuage the effects of external 
shocks on euro- area economies. The degree to 
which changes in the global financial setting 
have asymmetric effects on capital flows to the 
individual member states and how such diver -
gences can be absorbed are of crucial import -
ance to the cohesion and proper functioning of 
the European monetary union. Irrespective of 
this, precautions must be taken to counteract 
the build- up of macroeconomic imbalances at 
an early stage.Global financial  integration
There is no single accepted definition of the 
term “globalisation”. Generally speaking, it de -
notes the process of growing international 
interconnectedness  and a global integration of 
markets. The impact of globalisation goes far 
beyond purely economic considerations. As 
natural and man- made borders become less 
important, political ideas, knowledge and cul -
tural influences spread ever faster and more 
widely. Well into the middle of the past cen -
tury, trade in goods was the main driver of 
international economic relations. In the 1980s, 
advances in information and communications 
technology led to rapid growth in cross- border 
capital mobility. Transaction costs fell substan -
tially and geographical distance lost much of its 
significance. An important measure of a coun -
try’s global financial integration is its financial 
openness. It is defined as the sum of a coun -
try’s cross- border assets and liabilities as a ratio 
of its gross domestic product (GDP). Its coun -
terpart is real openness, which denotes the 
global integration of trade in goods and ser -
vices and is the ratio of a country’s total ex -
ports and imports to GDP .
In most economies, financial openness has 
seen a significantly greater rise in the past 40 
years than real openness. However, levels differ 
substantially between the advanced economies 
and most emerging market economies. While 
Germany’s external assets and liabilities at the 
end of 2014 were almost four times the size of 
its GDP of that year, China’s financial openness 
stood at only 100% in 2014, although this was 
still considerably higher than in most other 
emerging market economies. The United States 
and Japan scored just under 300% and 250% 
respectively.
Another measure of global financial integration 
is home bias. Most notably, this indicator is Key influence of

often applied to portfolio investment in shares 
or debt securities; it gauges the preference for

resented in the domestic portfolio.
In most countries around the world, home bias 
is on the decline, especially for shares.3 The

United Kingdom, for example. Financial inter -
connectedness among the euro- area countries 
is particularly strong.
Cross- border optimisation of capital allocation 
improves efficiency and thus has a positive im -
pact on economic welfare. International diver -sification of financial assets can also help to 
better spread risks and consequently reduce 
the overall risk attached to investments. On the 
other hand, this also increases interdepend -
ence between economies and makes it more 
difficult for individual countries to decouple 
from adverse developments abroad. The rise in 
international financial flows and the capital 
markets’ rapid responses have therefore funda -
mentally changed the conditions for national 
economic policy in open economies.
Especially in small open economies, global fac -
tors sometimes have a greater influence on 
cross- border capital flows than domestic cir -
cumstances. For emerging market economies 
with relatively underdeveloped financial sec -
tors, this already began to pose a significant 
problem in the 1990s.4 During the recent finan -
cial crisis, the issue became particularly acute. 
While previous crises mainly affected emerging 
market economies, this time the financial tur -
moil was triggered by the collapse of Lehman 
Brothers in the United States, which initially hit 
the advanced economies of North America and 
Europe the hardest.5 In the years that followed, 
the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy included 
non- standard measures, which brought money 
market rates down to a historic low. The Fed’s 
purchases of long- term US government bonds 
(quantitative easing) also put substantial pres -
sure on capital market rates in the industrial 
countries, especially as the monetary policy 
stance in other industrial countries was also 
very expansionary.6 This created incentives for 
investors to channel capital into emerging mar -
ket economies, which had largely been spared 
the direct impact of the financial crisis and also 
had higher interest rates. In some of these 
countries, the sudden surge in capital inflows

caused the national currency to appreciate in 
real terms and thus reduced price competitive -
ness. In addition, foreign debt (some denomin -
ated in foreign currency) rose, posing add -
itional risks to financial stability. The Fed’s an -
nouncement in spring 2013 that it intended to 
taper its quantitative easing (“tapering talk”) 
led to sudden portfolio rebalancing away from 
many emerging market economies or an ab -
rupt depreciation of their currencies.7
The global financial cycle
Financial shocks generally comprise all unex -
pected factors which change the financial en -
vironment as seen by financial market actors. 
Whatever their specific cause, they tend to pre -
cipitate a change in market participants’ assess -
ment of risk, which in turn is reflected, for in -
stance, in the responses of various indices of 
volatility in international equity markets (eg the 
VIX for the S&P 500 stock price index). The ex -
tensive spillover effects of financial shocks can 
have a far- reaching impact on the macroeco -
nomic and financial stability of individual econ -
omies. There is animated debate in the aca -
demic literature about an approach according 
to which the global redistribution of liquidity 
through cross- border bank lending creates a 
global financial cycle with international syn -
chronicity of lending flows and real estate 
prices, which individual countries have trouble 
evading.8 According to this line of thinking, 
even flexible exchange rates do not provide 
complete insulation against the ups and downs 
of capital waves. Although a restrictive national 
monetary policy might be capable of averting 
unwanted liquidity gluts, the price paid is mas -
sive local currency appreciation and a threat to 
international competitiveness. Also, high differ -
entials between domestic and foreign interest 
rates, so the theory, provide incentives to bor -
row in foreign currency. This not only lessens 
the impact of national monetary policy on 
goods and asset price movements but also in -
creases borrowers’ financial risks in the event 
of a reversal on the international foreign ex -change markets and a potential depreciation of 
the local currency.
Conversely, fixed exchange rates feed the 
global financial cycle, thanks to the unlimited 
and virtually risk- free exchange of foreign cur -
rency into local currency, thus further fuelling 
speculative bubbles in local asset markets.9
If this analysis holds, national monetary and 
foreign exchange policy faces a trade- off be -
tween maintaining an external equilibrium and 
ensuring domestic financial stability. If, in the 
event of a global liquidity glut, it controls the 
national monetary aggregate and resists poten -
tial asset price bubbles, it jeopardises the coun -
try’s price competitiveness. However, if it 
adapts the local money supply to the foreign 
monetary environment in order to limit interest 
differentials and exchange rate fluctuations, it 
encourages excessive lending in connection 
with rising asset prices. The associated risks in 
the financial sector may not become apparent 
until global liquidity dries up and assets posted 
as collateral lose value.10
Amidst perceptions that national economic 
policy has lost control, many in the economic 
policy debate, but also the International Mon -
etary Fund (IMF), have come to regard active 
capital flow management as a suitable policy 
measure to reduce vulnerability to exogenous 
shocks.11 However, interference in the free 
movement of capital should only be used as a Dominance of 
global factors can lead to global financial cyclesTrade- off between exter-
nal equilibrium 
and financial 
stability

regulation of capital flows as justifiable under certain circum-stances
7 The countries most affected were Brazil, India, Indonesia, 
South Africa and Turkey, which came to be known as the 
“fragile five”.

9 In addition to the relationship outlined here, other trans -
mission effects could also play a role. For instance, port -
folio shifts could cause financial crises to spill over to coun -
tries with a smaller degree of financial interconnectedness.

last resort. Empirical studies show that the im -
pact of capital controls dissipates over time, 
since they increasingly trigger evasive action. 
Over the long term, they are thus better suited 
to altering the composition of financial flows 
than to regulating their absolute size.12 More -
over, capital controls also mean foregoing the 
potential advantages of an efficient diversifica -
tion of risks. Greater protection against ex -
ogenous shocks implies less opportunity to 
guard against the adverse impacts of local 
events. Arguments in favour of the unfettered 
movement of capital, which gives each investor 
the greatest possible choice of investment op -
tions, include not only broader risk diversifica -
tion but also efficiency aspects. After all, unilat -
eral measures taken against foreign investors 
can always be expected to trigger reprisals, 
which usually defeat the purpose of the ori -
ginal measures.13
European monetary union 
and global financial shocks
The euro- area countries are, in several ways, in 
a unique position in terms of the transmission 
and absorption of financial shocks from non-  
euro- area countries, one that sets them well 
apart from the starting situation faced by other 
economies. Their monetary policy responsibil -
ities have been transferred to the Eurosystem; 
individual euro- area central banks can no 
longer conduct an autonomous monetary pol -
icy. Their scope for national action is thus more 
strongly constrained than that of economies 
which are able to pursue an independent mon -
etary policy. This renunciation of sovereignty is 
particularly noticeable where individual mem -
ber states differ in terms of labour market flexi -
bility and their tax and social welfare systems, 
which means that financial shocks affect them 
in different ways. In this case, they may also 
have diverging monetary policy interests. To 
make matters worse, the single European mar -
ket means that the European Union (EU) can -
not impose capital controls. Within the euro 
area, such controls would, moreover, impair the proper functioning of monetary policy. The 
current controls in force in Greece or the ex -
ceptional restrictions in Cyprus (which have 
since been rescinded) should be seen only as a 
last resort to avert the threat of a collapse of 
the financial system. They are by no means a 
standard policy instrument to stabilise capital 
flows within the euro area.
On the other hand, the Eurosystem itself repre -
sents a large currency area and thus has a per -
ceptible impact on global liquidity develop -
ments. At the same time, its members benefit 
from the advantages of exchange rate flexibility 
between the euro and other currencies. A sin -
gle monetary policy thus serves the global 
interests of the euro area as a whole. The cohe -
sion of the euro area will hinge on whether all 
member states ultimately benefit from these 
cooperation gains and on whether or not there 
is a mechanism to offset, at least in part, the 
asymmetrical effects of an exogenous shock 
despite the constraints imposed by a single 
monetary policy.
Alongside this short- term view, it is important 
to examine the extent to which the EU, and 
especially the euro area, have medium-  term 
correction mechanisms to prevent the build- up 
of macroeconomic and financial imbalances 
within the individual member states and in 
their relationships to one another. This also 
raises the issue of the responsibility of national 
economic policy and the role of macropruden -
tial measures that are not based on discrimin -
ation between local and foreign actors and 
thus cannot be regarded as capital controls in 
the narrower sense.
The high degree of financial integration in the 
euro area would, in principle, lead one to ini -
tially expect a strong transmission of financial Special features 
of the European monetary unionCorrection mechanisms needed to pre-vent long- term imbalances

shocks. However, unfettered movement of 
capital does not necessarily also imply a higher 
volatility of capital flows. Empirical studies have 
shown that cross- border bank lending, which is 
predominantly procyclical, is offset in part by 
countermovements in other financial instru -
ments, thereby smoothing the overall capital 
account. This is especially true of highly de -
veloped economies such as the euro area.14 In 
the worst- case scenario, the misuse of capital 
controls can even make capital flows more 
volatile overall. That would be the case if they 
were applied to instruments which are thought 
to be subject to high volatility but are nega -
tively correlated with other capital flows. Even 
in the member states of the euro area, capital 
movements for individual financial instruments 
sometimes go in opposite directions. This is evi -
dent even from the standard breakdown into 
foreign direct investment, equities, debt secur -
ities and other investment. Equities, debt secur -
ities and other investment, in particular, are 
close substitutes and are thus less volatile in 
concert than in isolation. Foreign direct invest -
ment, which is longer- term in orientation, is 
less affected by short- term shocks anyway and 
is thus generally regarded as a particularly 
effective  risk diversification instrument.
However, one particularity of cross- border pay -
ment flows between euro- area member states 
only shows up if other investment is further 
broken down into lending relationships among 
private investors and financial relationships be -
tween national central banks and the ECB.15 
The mutual claims and liabilities within the Eu -
rosystem are based not only on balancing items 
for national differences in cash in circulation 
but also, and primarily, on TARGET balances 
created by daily settlement of cross- border 
payments between participants.16 These 
TARGET flows are highly negatively correlated 
with private credit flows, in particular.
Empirical research by the Bundesbank has con -
firmed the prominent importance of equal ac -
cess to monetary policy instruments and the 
redistribution of liquidity between national cen -tral banks in cushioning global financial shocks 
within the euro area (see box on pages  45 
to 49). According to the estimates, the mem -
ber states are initially affected in very different 
measure by an unexpected increase in per -
ceived risk in the US equity markets – which is 
often used as an indicator of global uncertainty 
in empirical research. Following a period of 
heightened volatility, net private credit flows 
into some European periphery countries with 
less solid fundamentals decline over the me -
dium term. Such countries include Greece, Ire -
land, Italy, Portugal and Spain (known as GIIPS). 
To compensate for the difficulties in obtaining 
funding on the interbank market, the affected 
commercial banks increasingly participate in 
Eurosystem open market operations through 
their responsible central banks, where the 
terms and conditions are the same for all par -
ticipating credit institutions irrespective of their 
nationality or country of domicile. Private li -
quidity outflows ultimately show up in the na -
tional central bank’s balance sheet as an in -
crease in claims on the domestic banking sec -
tor and in an increase in the TARGET liability to 
the ECB. On balance, no perceptible impact on 
net credit flows can be discerned for the other 
euro-  area countries. Although the increase in 
their TARGET claims on the ECB reflects the rise 
in the liabilities of the periphery countries’ cen -
tral banks, suggesting private net inflows from 
this region, this is largely offset by less recourse 
to funds from non- euro- area countries.

shocks, which are initially asymmetrical, tend to Substitutive

credit but also the category “cash and deposits”. In the

become dispersed more broadly across euro-  
area member states with regard to overall net 
capital flows. In the last stage of transmission 
to the real economy, there is a weakened de -
cline across the euro area in lending by com -
mercial banks to enterprises and households.
In economic terms, the uniform supply of li -
quidity to all euro- area commercial banks rep -
resents a special form of international risk shar -
ing, which is available to euro- area member 
states but not to non- euro- area economies. 
This is why the recoverability of the collateral 
pledged to central banks is of primary import -
ance for mitigating the risks to be borne by the 
community. The quality standards for eligible 
securities also determine the extent of poten -
tial liquidity provision by the Eurosystem.
However, one should be careful not to overesti -
mate the overall influence of global and Euro -
pean factors on private capital movements in 
the individual euro- area countries. A forward 
error variance decomposition (FEVD) can be 
performed in order to assess the significance of 
various determinants for unexpected changes 
in a variable. This instrument maps the overall 
variance in the prediction of a variable to ex -
ogenous shocks in the individual model vari -
ables and thus illustrates the causes of uncer -
tainty. According to the estimation model used, 
prior to the onset of the European debt crisis, 
uncertainty about future US equity price move -
ments and US monetary policy accounted for 
around 7% of the error variance of cross- border 
credit flows to euro- area member states in the 
long run (including intra- European credit flows). 
Another 24% was explained by European fac -
tors which can be attributed to the single mon -
etary policy.17 The majority of forecast uncer -
tainty, however, was either due to national fac -
tors or impossible to pinpoint.
The impact of non- European factors has even 
diminished somewhat since the start of the 
European debt crisis.18 This is particularly true 
of the countries worst hit by the crisis. Uncer -
tainty about the future trajectory of private credit flows in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal 
and Spain was caused almost exclusively by do -
mestic factors in the past few years and was 
itself responsible in key measure for the volatil -
ity of TARGET flows between the Eurosystem’s 
national central banks. Moreover, the develop -
ment also reflects efforts by European banks to 
bring their capital levels into line with tougher 
regulatory standards. In many cases, this in -
volved a reduction in foreign business and con -
centration on core business and core markets 
(deleveraging).19
When monetary union was established and 
TARGET was set up, it was in no way envisaged 
that the Eurosystem would play the role of “cri -
sis manager” in the event of a disruption to pri -
vate credit transactions or that there would be 
a large- scale reallocation of central bank money 
between the member states. Until the onset of 
the global financial crisis in the autumn of 
2008, private cross- border payments between 
member states were largely in equilibrium. 
TARGET balances were only temporary and on 
a small scale.
However, in the months that followed, TARGET 
balances within the Eurosystem increased 
markedly and reached a temporary peak of 
€421 billion in cumulated claims and liabilities 
in the first quarter of 2009. At the same time, 
euro- area countries weathered the global tur -
moil better than many other advanced econ -
omies. As the financial situation in the United 
States stabilised, the interbank markets also 
started to function better again and TARGET 
balances in the Eurosystem temporarily dipped. … leads to a

The transmission of fi  nancial shocks through cross- border 
lending
The global integration of the fi  nancial mar-
kets has meant that developments in key 
money and capital markets propagate rap-
idly across borders.1 This results in the for-
mation of a global fi  nancial cycle with an 
international co- movement of credit fl  ows, 
from which it is diffi   cult for individual coun-
tries to break free. Rey (2015) uses a vector 
autoregression (VAR) model to analyse the 
transmission of global fi  nancial shocks via international credit fl  ows to the fi  nancial markets of emerging market economies.
2 
This question is also relevant to the member 
states of the euro area, although due ac-
count has to be taken of the particularities of the monetary union.
3 A panel VAR model 
can be used to analyse the effects of an un-expected rise in uncertainty in the US stock 
markets – as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX). It is shown that the fi  nancial shock 
modelled in this way triggers a response in 
the effective volume- weighted overnight rates for the US dollar (federal funds rate) 
and the euro (EONIA). These overnight rates 
represent the monetary policy response in 
the USA and in Europe to the more strained 
fi  nancial setting. In addition to the cross- 
border credit fl  ows, which are described in 
the literature as central transmission chan-
nels of the global fi  nancial cycle, the model 
used also takes into account the fi  nancial relationships between the national central 
banks and the ECB via the TARGET system.4 
Both variables are entered into the equa-
tions over national gross domestic product 
(GDP). The impact on the national variables 
in the euro- area member states themselves 
is refl  ected in the growth rates in lending to 
the private sector and real GDP .
The panel comprises the 11 founding mem-
bers of the euro area, as well as Greece, with quarterly data from the fi  rst quarter of 
1999 up to the fi  nal quarter of 2014. Here, 
a clear distinction is made between those 
countries that are deemed to be compara-
tively vulnerable, namely Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain (GIIPS), and the 
other member states. The VAR model is es-
timated using a least square dummy vari-
able (LSDV) estimator.5 The order in which 
the variables are inserted into the equation 
system is determined on the basis of Cholesky restrictions, which are used to 
identify shocks. Each variable can simultan-
eously respond to disturbances in the pre-
ceding variables, but does not respond to 
the subsequent variables until the following 
quarter at the earliest. Given that GDP re-sponds the most sluggishly of all the vari-
ables under consideration, it is the fi  rst vari-
able that is entered into the model. This is 
followed by the growth rate of domestic loans to the private sector. Cross- border credit transactions and TARGET fl  ows re-
spond immediately to these national factors and, in turn, have an immediate impact on the VIX and the overnight rates in the USA 
and in Europe. The overall sequence is as

follows:6 real economic growth, credit 
growth, private sector lending, TARGET 
fl  ows, VIX, the federal funds rate and 
EONIA.
Thomson Reuters Datastream was used for 
the VIX and the US overnight rate data, 
whereas ECB data were used for the EONIA. 
The data pertaining to cross- border credit 
fl  ows were taken from Eurostat’s balance of 
payment statistics. Eurostat also provides 
the fi  gures for GDP and domestic lending to 
the private sector. Information regarding 
payments made in connection with offi   cial 
assistance programmes can be found on 
the websites of the European Commission 
and the International Monetary Fund, 
whereas the TARGET balances are published 
in the ECB’s Statistical Data Warehouse.
Impulse response functions illustrate the im-
pact that global shocks have on national 
credit growth in both country groups and the associated transmission channels. An 
increase in the VIX results in a drop in the 
effective overnight rate in the USA, which, 
in turn, is refl  ected accordingly in the 
EONIA. According to the model, the private 
net credit fl  ows to the GIIPS countries re-
spond signifi  cantly to the disturbance, des-
pite the monetary policy easing, and, fol-lowing a period of heightened volatility in the fi  rst few quarters, fall back below the starting level over an extended period of time. The fl  uctuation in the private credit 
fl  ows is, however, largely offset by the con-
trasting use of central bank liquidity by 
commercial banks and fund fl  ows within 
the Eurosystem in the form of TARGET 
transactions.
In the rest of the euro area, this results in 
reverse capital fl  ows in TARGET. However, the private infl  ows of funds from the per-
iphery recorded over the medium term are 
not, on balance, refl  ected to a signifi  cant extent in the private sector lending of the 
core countries as the commercial banks in 
these countries conduct, in turn, fewer refi  -nancing transactions with credit institutions 
outside the euro area. As a result, the ori-
ginally asymmetric effects of the exogenous shock are more widely dispersed across the Eurosystem through the liquidity redistribu-tion and the impact on private credit growth is similar in both country groups.
Subdividing the sample into the time period 
prior to the onset of the European debt cri-
sis and the time period thereafter clearly 
shows that the impact of global factors on 
the credit fl  ows of the euro- area member 
states has diminished.7 This applies to the 
GIIPS in particular. The forward error vari-
ance decomposition (FEVD) provides infor-
mation about the determinants to which 
the uncertainty regarding the future path of a certain variable is attributable. As long as the confi  dence of international investors in 
the rapidly growing southern Mediterra-
nean countries and Ireland was still intact, 
over 30% of uncertainty regarding the net 
credit fl  ows to these countries was attribut-
able to US factors (VIX, federal funds rate) 
or to factors linked to European monetary 
policy and the Eurosystem (EONIA, TARGET).

European debt crisis, global and European

6 All the variables used in the sample are stationary at 
a signifi  cance level of 5%. The unit root tests of Im, 
Pesaran and Shin as well as the Fisher PP and ADF test

and Statistics 61, pp 631-652.7 Other studies have also shown that spillover effects 
from fi  nancial shocks can change dramatically over 
time. See, for example, N Metiu, B Hilberg and M Grill (2016), Credit constraints and the international propa-
gation of US fi  nancial shocks, Journal of Banking and

However, these balances soon began to rise 
again in the second quarter of 2010, when the 
Greek government gave the first indications 
that it might not be able to service public debt 
on time and in full, causing capital drain from 
the country. This time, unlike two years earlier, 
the causes of the financial disruption thus lay 
inside the euro area. The shock absorption 
mechanism provided by the generous provision 
and redistribution of liquidity via the central 
banks, as well as an extensive assistance pack -
age from the international community, helped 
to avert a collapse of the Greek financial sector 
(along with possible domino effects on other 
European countries) during this period.
Overall, it is evident that international risk shar -
ing via the Eurosystem is a suitable way to re -
duce the immediate strain of financial disrup -
tions. At the same time, however, there is a 
danger that the weaker penalties imposed by 
the capital market could lead to necessary ad -
justment processes being delayed. Bundesbank analyses show that this is particularly true of 
financially vulnerable sectors that had seen par -
ticularly rapid growth in borrowing prior to the 
onset of the global financial crisis. The gener -
ous provision of liquidity by the Eurosystem in 
the aftermath of the crisis meant that real 
wages in the affected enterprises were rela -
tively high. There is therefore a risk of competi -
tiveness being lost in the long term if there is 
a renewed rise in funding costs (see the box 
on pages 50 to 52). Irrespective of which effect 
ultimately  predominates – the benefit of lower 
capital costs or the drawback of higher wage 
costs – it is clear that the single monetary pol -
icy can cause not only regional distributional 
effects, but also sectoral shifts.
If a situation is to be avoided in which long-  
term risks are mutualised and structural devel -
opments are influenced by the Eurosystem, 
measures must be taken both at Community 
and national level which promote private risk Risk sharing via 
the Eurosystem can cause adjustments to be delayedtransactions dwindled in importance. This, 
however, is likely to have been due less to a 
greater resilience to external shocks than to 
the large- scale decoupling of the domestic 
fi  nancial sector from the international cap-
ital markets.
This decoupling is also refl  ected in the fact 
that since 2010, the variance of the forecast errors for the TARGET fl  ows of these coun-
tries has almost exclusively been attribut-
able to uncertainty regarding private credit 
fl  ows. This confi  rms the importance of un-
restricted access to central bank liquidity 
and its redistribution via the TARGET system as a substitute for private sector lending. By 
contrast, the changes in the TARGET bal-
ances in the other euro- area member states 
are primarily infl  uenced by the TARGET 
transactions of the national central banks in 
the crisis countries, as is suggested by the 
variance decomposition analysis tool.Deutsche Bundesbank

The inﬂ  uence of central bank liquidity provision on internal 
adjustment to a sudden stop*
The fi  nancial and sovereign debt crisis led to 
massive capital outfl  ows from various Euro-pean countries within and outside the euro 
area, comparable to a sudden stop. The Euro system reacted to this liquidity shock, and to the strained situation on the euro- 
area fi  nancial markets, with extensive provi-
sion of central bank liquidity. While coun-tries inside the euro area (Greece, Ireland, 
Italy, Portugal and Spain, hereinafter GIIPS) 
were able to access this liquidity, Eastern European countries outside the euro area with currencies pegged to the euro (Bul-
garia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, hereinafter BELL) were not. However, alongside this dif-
ference, the two groups of countries also 
share one signifi  cant common feature: nei-
ther BELL nor GIIPS were able to react to 
the liquidity shock by depreciating their ex-
change rate (external adjustment). Instead, 
the necessary adjustments had to be made 
internally – in other words, through a 
change in relative prices.
This quasi- natural experiment enables us to 
examine how liquidity provision infl  uenced 
internal adjustment to the liquidity shock, 
using sector- level panel data from the BELL 
and GIIPS countries. The baseline hypoth-
esis is that the liquidity shock exerts greater 
adjustment pressure in those sectors which are relatively heavily dependent on external fi  nancing. Since liquidity provision cushions 
the impact of the original shock, it might alleviate the internal adjustment in fi  nan-cially dependent sectors. On the other hand, sectors which need little external fi  nancing  should be hit less hard by the 
shock in the fi  rst place. Therefore, possible 
liquidity provision by the central bank 
should also affect these sectors less strongly 
than the fi  nancially dependent sectors. To test this hypothesis, and therefore to an-swer the question of how liquidity provision 
by the Eurosystem infl  uenced internal ad-justment, the following difference- in- differences regression equation is esti-
mated:1
Δtlog (Yikt)  = αiτ + αit+ αkτ + αkt 
+ β[FVk×Xit] 
+ γ[FVk×LPit] + εikt
∆tlog (Yikt) is a measure of sectoral adjust-
ment to the country- specifi  c liquidity shock. 
Sectoral adjustment is measured on the 
basis of cumulative changes to nominal and 
real wages and to prices. The regression 
equation contains time- varying fi  xed effects 
α encompassing all the (observable and 
non- observable) country and sector- specifi  c infl  uential factors. FV
k measures the extent 
to which a sector depends on external fi  -
nancing.2 LPit represents liquidity provision 
by the Eurosystem; for BELL countries, this 
variable stands at zero throughout.3 Xit are

open market operations by the Eurosystem, but the entire extent of central bank liquidity available to 
member states as compensation for a “sudden stop”.Deutsche Bundesbank

other control variables. The central param-
eter is γ , which measures whether expan-
sion of liquidity (fi  rst difference) infl  uences 
adjustment differently if a sector has been 
more strongly affected by the original li-
quidity shock because of greater depend-ence on external fi  nancing (second differ-
ence).4
As the above table shows, increased liquid-
ity provision did not signifi  cantly infl  uence 
the adjustment of nominal wages. In con-
trast, the estimated coeffi   cient for real 
wages is positive and of high statistical sig-
nifi  cance: as a result of increased liquidity 
provision, real wages in fi  nancially depend-ent sectors did not fall as steeply as in sec-
tors which are less dependent on external 
fi  nancing.5
The negative and highly signifi  cant param-
eter in the regression equation for prices re-veals that liquidity provision caused smaller 
price rises in fi  nancially dependent sectors than in fi  nancially independent sectors. At 
fi  rst glance this seems surprising, since the 
aim of these non- standard monetary policy 
measures is precisely to raise prices. How-ever, these results refl  ect the interplay be-tween liquidity provision on the one hand 
and a negative liquidity shock on the other. 
In such a setting, businesses might try to compensate for a negative liquidity shock 
by expanding their margins and raising their 
prices.6 The empirical results show that price increases following the liquidity provi-
sion tended to be lower in fi  nancially de-
pendent sectors, perhaps because they par-
ticularly benefi  ted from more favourable funding costs. On the other hand, there were no signifi  cant differences in the ad-justment of nominal wages. Overall, real 
wages in fi  nancially dependent sectors fell 
less steeply following increased liquidity provision. This less pronounced fall in real 
wages, however, went hand in hand with a greater decline in employment in these sec-tors.
These empirical results are in line with the 
theoretical paper by Schmitt- Grohé and 
Uribe (2016). These authors emphasise the

sharing, but which also ensure that member 
states themselves shoulder responsibility.
Capital markets union
The European Commission is advancing a cap -
ital markets union as a key measure to promote 
private risk sharing at the European level.20 Pro-
ponents currently still see considerable poten -
tial for expansion, particularly concerning the 
cross- border use of securitisations and equity 
instruments. If this potential were harnessed, it 
would not only increase efficiency, but would, 
above all, also provide alternatives to pro-  
cyclical bank loans. In addition to generating 
compensatory capital flows, a broader distribu -
tion of income risks in the case of equity instru -
ments could also have a stabilising effect. Com -
pared to, say, debt investors, equity investors 
can be expected to be more responsive to the 
economic policies in the investment countries and less likely to tolerate unsustainable local 
developments.
Financial integration in the euro area is already 
well advanced and is significantly greater than 
the degree of financial integration that exists 
between other advanced economies. However, 
if the aim is to limit implicit risk sharing via the 
Eurosystem and, at the same time, to strengthen 
the cohesion of the euro area, the degree of 
other countries’ integration in the global econ -
omy is not the appropriate yardstick. If, instead, 
one compares private risk sharing within the 
euro area with risk sharing between the indi -
vidual US states, there is still a lot of catching 
up to do, despite the undeniable progress that 
has been made since the introduction of the Capital markets 
union to pro-mote private risk sharing, …… which is lower in the euro area than 
in the United 
Statessignifi  cance of asymmetric wage rigidity in 
fi  xed exchange rate regimes. In this setting, 
real wages can be reduced by higher prices. Thus, unemployment rises if real wages do 
not fall suffi   ciently on account of down-
ward rigidity in nominal wages.
Although this analysis cannot draw any 
conclusions about the macroeconomic im-
pact of liquidity provision, it reveals an im-
portant trade- off. On the one hand, liquid-
ity provision can reduce price adjustment 
pressure precisely for those sectors of the 
economy which are hit hardest by a nega-
tive liquidity shock, such as the construction 
sector. This means that necessary adjust-
ments to (relative) prices can be stretched out over a longer period of time. On the other hand, there is a risk that this extra time will be bought at the cost of higher unemployment and that necessary (struc-tural) adjustments will be postponed for too long.

euro as a single currency.21 Market integration 
should not, however, mean that differences be -
tween the individual euro- area countries in the 
assessment and the design of financial instru -
ments will disappear completely. Such differ -
ences may well be economically justified and 
should in that case certainly not be eliminated 
for political reasons.22
The European action plan on building a capital 
markets union will presumably have only a 
minor impact on stock markets. A considerable 
portion of shares, at least in the main listed 
companies, are already held by non- residents, 
and there is already brisk international trade in 
these shares. This is evident not least from the 
extremely low home bias for equities. In some 
countries, shares from other European coun -
tries are already overweighted compared to the 
relative proportion of these shares in the global 
portfolio. Other segments of the capital mar -
ket, such as securitisations, crowdfunding or 
venture capital, are, however, still relatively 
weak in some member states and highly frag -
mented at the European level.
Furthermore, debt financing still enjoys tax ad -
vantages over equity financing in most member 
states, hampering substitution. However, in 
stepping up efforts to promote cross- border 
equity capital flows, policymakers must take 
care to ensure that no new distortions arise. 
They should also examine the extent to which 
market- based forms of financing lead to new 
financial stability risks, such as those caused by 
pronounced information asymmetry between 
lenders and borrowers, which can be particu -
larly severe in a cross- border context. Further -
more, as far as private risk sharing is concerned, 
risk- takers must actually be able to absorb po -
tential loss events. In particular, new systemic 
risks, which could ultimately lead to a govern -
ment bail- out, must not be allowed to arise. In 
order to prevent possible unsound develop -
ments, the expansion of the common capital 
market must be accompanied by the introduc -
tion of appropriate microprudential and macro -
prudential instruments.23Responsibility of the member 
states
International risk sharing via the capital market, 
just like risk sharing through the provision and 
redistribution of liquidity by the Eurosystem, can 
only work in the long term if it actually consti -
tutes fair protection – akin to an insurance pol -
icy – against the effects of exogenous shocks. 
The “insurance benefits” should therefore tend 
to offset each other in the long term, or at least 
have the same expected value a priori  for all 
participants. Neither the capital market nor the 
single monetary policy can or should provide 
ongoing transfers to offset permanent imbal -
ances. When implementing the capital markets 
union, it is therefore vital to harmonise stand -
ards but also, above all, to ensure that instru -
ments have a high degree of transparency. 
Monetary policymakers must additionally apply 
high quality standards when implementing their 
instruments. This applies not only to the collat -
eral requirements for traditional refinancing 
operations , but also, in particular, to the use of 
non- standard measures such as the expanded 
asset purchase programme (APP).
Beyond this, however, responsibility for a con -
sistent and sustainable economic policy lies 
with the euro- area member states themselves. 
The impact of global financial cycles on the 
emergence of macroeconomic imbalances 
manifests itself directly in the formation of 
asset price bubbles.24 From the point of view of 
long- term sustainable economic development, 
the question thus arises as to how policymak -Expansion of the

External liabilities and asset prices
The long- term impact of sustained in and 
outfl  ows of funds on an economy’s fi  nan-
cial and macroeconomic stability can be de-
termined by looking, for instance, at the 
relationship between aggregate capital 
fl  ows and domestic asset and goods prices.1 
The experiences made in previous fi  nancial 
crises have shown that real estate markets 
are frequently at the epicentre of specula-
tive bubbles in the fi  nancial sector. In add-
ition, the literature on the mechanisms of the international fi  nancial cycle concludes that there is a close relationship between 
cross- border bank loans and developments on the housing market.
2
This text will examine this relationship for 
the eleven founding members of the Euro-
pean monetary union, as well as Greece, 
with quarterly data from the fi  rst quarter of 2005 up to the fi  nal quarter of 2014.
3 Coin-
tegration tests as described by Pedroni (2001) and Kao et al (1999) confi  rm, at a signifi  cance level of 95%, that real house prices (house) are cointegrated with “pri-
vate” gross external debt (priv_debt), the 
average capital adequacy ratio of commer-
cial banks (car) and the consolidated bal-
ance sheet total of the Eurosystem (bal).4
In line with the procedure described by Kao 
and Chiang (2000), a version of the dy-
namic ordinary least square (DOLS) estima-
tor pursuant to Saikkonen (1992) and Stock and Watson (1993) is tailored to panel data 
and applied.5 The endogeneity in the rela-
tionship between the variables and serial 
correlation is recognised by including 
country- specifi  c leads and lags of the fi  rst 
differences of all variables on the right- hand 
side of the regression equation:6house i,t=↵0,i+↵1debt i,t+↵2car i,t

onwards. Given the short observation period, the sam-
ple cannot – unlike in the analysis on pp 45-49 – be 
broken down into the time before and after the onset 
of the European debt crisis. Similarly, the limited num-
ber of observations means that no differentiation is made between the periphery countries Greece, Ire-
land, Italy, Portugal and Spain and the other euro- area member states.2 See M Drehmann, C Borio and K Tsatsaronis (2012),

cation of estimation and inference in panel cointegra-
tion, Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics 61, pp 693-711. All the tests cited here were conducted 
beginning with just two variables and the gradual in-
clusion of an additional variable, until a cointegration 
relationship was confi  rmed (bottom up). This rules out the existence of more than just one cointegration rela-
tionship. Real house prices are represented using the 
logarithm of the house price indices defl  ated using the harmonised consumer price index; the data on private 
gross external debt (external debt excluding central 
banks’ TARGET liabilities) are normalised with the na-
tional gross domestic product (GDP); the Eurosystem’s consolidated balance sheet total is in logarithmic form. The data on harmonised consumer prices, on GDP and 
on commercial banks’ capital adequacy ratio are pro-
vided by Eurostat, house price indices, TARGET bal-ances and the Eurosystem’s consolidated balance sheet are published by the ECB, and the information 
on external debt is taken from the World Bank’s exter-nal debt statistics.

As was to be expected, large levels of pri-
vate external debt are associated with 
higher real house prices. Undesirable devel-
opments on the real estate markets can 
therefore, as a general rule, be combatted 
by controlling capital fl  ows, which limits the 
volume of external liabilities. However, real 
house prices are also infl  uenced by capital 
levels at commercial banks and the provi-sion of liquidity by the Eurosystem. The member states of the euro area therefore have at their disposal instruments, espe-
cially in the form of macroprudential meas-ures that target commercial banks’ balance sheet metrics, that do not confl  ict with the 
free movement of capital enshrined in the 
EU’s acquis communautaire  or with the 
OECD’s Code of Liberalisation of Capital 
Movements.
Other asset markets besides the real estate 
sector are also sensitive to cross- border 
capital fl  ows. This is particularly true of 
equities, where the effective fi  nancial mar-
ket exchange rates may give an indication 
of valuation in an international compari-son.
8 The effective fi  nancial market ex-
change rate, in turn, displays a stable long- 
term correlation with a country’s total ex-ternal liabilities in the form of equity (ext_equ) and debt (ext_debt) and with overall 
government debt (gov_debt) , in each case 
relative to GDP:9refer i,t=15.820

Within the euro- area member states, the 
level of external debt and the scale of exter-
nally provided equity is therefore relevant for price formation on the domestic stock 
markets. Moreover, both forms of fi  nancing 
make a very similar contribution. It is obvi-
ous that capital infl  ows that are not directly used to buy shares and other equity also in-
directly boost demand for these forms of 
investment. Unlike aggregate external liabil-ities, public debt has a dampening infl  uence on domestic equity prices. While aggregate capital infl  ows from abroad and the result-
ing increase in external liabilities do, to a 
certain degree, refl  ect the attractiveness of 
the domestic economy for foreign invest-
ors, high levels of government debt hurt in-
vestor confi  dence and therefore have the opposite effect. Sound public fi  nances are 
therefore an important contribution of eco-nomic policy in order to ensure a country is fi  nancially competitive.
Pronounced capital infl  ows result not only 
in high asset prices, they can also drive up 
consumer prices. Like the effective fi  nancial market exchange rate, the consumer- price-

ers can influence the relationship between ag -
gregate capital flows and national asset prices.
Empirical studies show that economic policy, 
even in financially open economies, is indeed 
able to mitigate the impact of global financial 
conditions on the domestic economy in the 
long term.
For example, macroprudential policy measures 
aim to regulate commercial banks’ lending and 
to prevent an excessive increase in real prop -
erty prices.25 In contrast to capital controls, 
they do not interrupt the global financial cycle 
at the national border, but instead target the issuance of real estate loans by private com -
mercial banks. As macroprudential policy meas -
ures do not discriminate between residents and 
non- r esidents, it is possible, in principle, to rec -
oncile them with the European single market 
and the principles of monetary union. In recent 
years, the German Financial Stability Commit -
tee has recommended a number of new instru -ments for the macroprudential oversight of real 
estate loans,26 instruments which are also ad -
vocated by the European Systemic Risk Board 
(ESRB).27 In order to avoid distortions between 
the member states and a deterioration of 
standards through regulatory competition, it is 
essential that the measures taken are coordin -
ated at the European level.28
In addition to providing effective financial mar -
ket regulation, policymakers must also address … through 
macroprudential policy measures and …… sound fiscal policybased real effective exchange rate (reer)10

A high effective exchange rate can be the 
result of strong demand for domestically 
produced goods and services, but it may also refl  ect low price competitiveness. As 
with the cause of high capital infl  ows, inter-
preting this variable requires a more in- depth analysis of the situation at hand. In 
the long term, however, high levels of gen-
eral government debt must be accompan-
ied by a low valuation for the domestic cur-rency as measured by the real effective ex-change rate if the emergence of an external imbalance is to be avoided.

macroeconomic stability. The estimates pre -
sented in the box on pages 54 to 56 support 
the view that sound public finances help in -
crease a country’s attractiveness for inter -
national investors and boost the domestic 
economy’s competitiveness on world markets.
The EU’s Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure 
is, in principle, a suitable instrument for verifying 
whether member states are acting responsibly 
and for demanding consistent economic policy. 
Under this procedure, special attention should be 
paid to countries’ compliance with the Stability 
and Growth Pact. It is the key pillar for prevent -
ing macroeconomic imbalances at the national 
level and is complemented at the European level 
by effective financial market regulation and 
banking supervision. However, the existing co -
ordination mechanisms need to be supple -
mented by new instruments that are capable of 
interrupting the vexed relationship between 
states and financial markets on a lasting basis, as 
this is the only way to credibly strengthen na -
tional responsibility. The Bundesbank presented 
potential reforms in this vein in June of this year.29
Conclusion
In principle, the financial integration of the 
world economy presents all countries with op -
portunities for a more efficient allocation of 
capital and a better diversification of risk. How -
ever, it also increases interdependence and fa -
cilitates the transmission of potentially adverse 
financial influences. The global financial crisis 
showed this to be a double- edged sword and 
revealed that the global financial system needs 
considerable reform.
The euro area is unique in this context, as its 
constituent members have relinquished monet -
ary policy autonomy to the Eurosystem and 
have thus lost an important adjustment instru -
ment for tackling exogenous shocks. That said, 
in an environment of global financial shocks, 
the monetary policy options are in any case 
limited. This is particularly true of small, open economies. By contrast, the single European 
monetary policy is certainly capable of influen -
cing global monetary developments. Moreover, 
the centralised provision of central bank liquid -
ity, in conjunction with the possibility of redis -
tributing existing Eurosystem liquidity between 
the central banks, represents an effective 
mechanism for smoothing the impact of finan -
cial shocks between the member states.
However, this centralised provision of liquidity 
by central banks, in conjunction with an offset -
ting of private credit flows with TARGET flows 
between the central banks, implies a transfer of 
risk from the private sector to the Eurosystem. 
Furthermore, there is a risk that this will not just 
cushion short- term disturbances, but also fuel 
structural imbalances.
The reforms made to the European framework, 
as well as those currently planned, aim to limit 
this trade- off. Private risk sharing via the capital 
markets is therefore one of the declared ob -
jectives of the European capital markets union. 
Moreover, the Single Supervisory Mechanism is 
intended to ensure effective and undistorted 
oversight of the banking sector. The control 
measures within the framework of the EU’s 
Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure also help 
to identify the build- up of macroeconomic im -
balances at an early stage and to take correct -
ive action.
The hypothesis of a dilemma requiring capital 
controls on account of the increasing power -
lessness of economic policy in the face of 
global factors does not appear to hold true for 
the countries of the euro area. Instead, a trinity 
of monetary union can be defined where the 
single monetary policy, the free movement of 
capital and effective regulation together make 
it possible, at least in principle, to reconcile 
short-  term stabilisation with sustainable eco -
nomic development.Macroeconomic

The performance of German credit 
 institutions in 2015
German banks’ operating income was €4.0 billion up on 2014 to stand at €127.9 billion notwith -
standing the persistence of the low- interest- rate environment. This effect was largely driven by 
one major bank which achieved a substantial increase in its current income from equities and 
other variable- yield securities, participating interests and shares in affiliated enterprises. By con -
trast, banks’ net income from traditional interest business declined by €0.9 billion to €78.1 billion, 
although this was offset by an increase of €1.2 billion to €30.5 billion in net commission income.
Higher staff costs and additional costs in meeting regulatory requirements, which include the 
bank levy imposed in the reporting year for the first time under new European rules, put a strain 
on the expenditure side. As a result, the cost/income ratio, which is used as a measure of cost 
efficiency, deteriorated by 1.2 percentage points to 70.4%.
Once again, the lower level of banks’ risk provisioning in their portfolios thanks to the current 
macroeconomic conditions proved to be a mainstay of profitability. This led to a marked increase 
in profit for the financial year before tax to €26.5 billion.
The shortening of maturities on the liabilities side associated with the growing concentration on 
overnight deposit products stands in contrast to loans with considerably longer interest fixation 
periods. Viewed in isolation, this bolsters income from interest business, but at the same time it 
also heightens further the maturity transformation risk on banks’ balance sheets.
Thanks to a much improved balance sheet capital base, German banks currently have a high 
resilience to the burdens arising from the low- interest- rate environment. They again transferred a 
large part (€9.7 billion) of their profit for the financial year to capital in 2015.Deutsche Bundesbank

Banks’ business environment
The German economy remained in good shape 
in the reporting year. Consumption was bol -
stered by steep increases in employment, 
marked wage growth and rising purchasing 
power due to the continued decline in oil 
prices. Positive stimuli also came from govern -
ment spending to provide support and accom -
modation for refugees. A further boost came 
from the continuing rise in housing investment. 
In December 2015, the annual growth rate in 
loans to households for house purchase stood 
at 3.5% – the highest increase for more than 
13 years. By contrast, growth in the commer -
cial property segment for the year as a whole 
was lower than in 2014. Foreign trade bene -
fited from the favourable euro exchange rate 
and the upturn in demand from the euro area. 
However, demand impulses from China and 
the commodity- producing emerging econ -
omies were lacking towards the end of the 
year.
After the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM)1 
entered into force on 4 November 2014, pre -
paratory work for the introduction of the Single 
Resolution Mechanism (SRM),2 the second pillar 
of the banking union, got underway in the re -
porting year. The SRM establishes uniform rules 
and a uniform procedure for the resolution of 
distressed credit institutions in member states 
participating in the SSM.3 Core elements are 
the Single Resolution Board (SRB), which is 
endowed with relevant decision- making 
powers, and the Single Resolution Fund (SRF), 
which is administered by the SRB. When the 
SRB became fully operational as of 1 January 
2016, the SRF replaced the national resolution 
funds of the participating member states. The 
SRF intends to reach its target volume of at 
least 1% of the amount of covered deposits of 
all the institutions authorised in all of the par -
ticipating member states (around €55 billion) 
by the end of 2023. The bank levy was col -
lected in the reporting year for the first time in 
accordance with new European rules, with Ger -
man institutions paying around €1.6 billion.4Persistently low interest rates are posing ever-  
greater challenges to the interest- driven busi -
ness models of many German credit institutions. 
Among these are building and loan associ -
ations,5 which are included in our analysis for 
the first time (see the box on pages 64 to 66). 
The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority 
(BaFin) and the Bundesbank conducted a survey 
again in 2015 on the performance and resili -
ence of German credit institutions in the low-  
interest- rate setting in order to gain an insight 
into the assessment of the medium to long-  
term outlook for profitability by credit institu -
tions that are particularly dependent on net 
interest income. Taking part were around 1,500 
of the less significant institutions, which con -
tinue to be under the direct supervision of the 
national competent authorities. According to 
the institutions’ own projections and based on 
prudentially defined interest rate shock scen -
arios, the institutions expect their profitability to 
come under considerable pressure over the 
forecast horizon to 2019 if interest rates remain 
low. Given the existing capital buffers and avail -
able hidden reserves, however, the losses of 
earnings that are predicted up to 2019 as a re -
sult of the low- interest- rate setting seem to be 
manageable for most institutions at present.
The process of consolidation in the banking 
sector was continuing in the reporting year.

levy on 4 December 2015, big banks and regional banks 
accounted for €0.9 billion, Landesbanken for €0.3 billion 
and certain other institutions such as mortgage banks and 
financial  service providers for €0.2 billion; savings banks

Methodological notes
Data based on individual accounts 
in accordance with the German 
 Commercial Code and on monthly 
 balance sheet statistics
The results from the profi  t and loss ac-counts are based on the published annual reports of the individual institutions in ac-cordance with the provisions set forth in the German Commercial Code ( Handels-
gesetzbuch, or HGB) and the Regulation on 
the Accounting of Credit Institutions (Ver-ordnung über die Rechnungslegung der 
Kreditinstitute, or RechKredV). They differ in 
terms of their conception, structure and 
defi  nitions from the internationally custom-
ary IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) accounting standards
1 for cap-
ital market- oriented banking groups, which means that – from a methodological view-
point – the respective business results and 
certain balance sheet or individual profi  t and loss items are not comparable across the national and international accounting 
frameworks.
For reasons of comparability within Ger-
many, it is advisable to consider the individ-
ual accounts when analysing the fi  nancial 
performance. Using group accounts would 
make a meaningful analysis diffi   cult as, fi  rst, 
many German banks are not part of a group, meaning that their individual ac-counts drawn up in accordance with the 
German Commercial Code would still have 
to be used; second, not all group accounts are prepared according to international ac-counting standards.
The fi  gures for balance sheet capital (total 
equity), total assets and other stock vari-
ables are not obtained from the annual re-
ports but are calculated as annual average 
values on the basis of the monthly balance 
sheet statistics reported for the institution 
as a whole.Reporting group
The reporting group for statistics on banks’ 
profi  t and loss accounts (profi  t and loss stat-istics) includes all banks within the meaning 
of the German Banking Act ( Gesetz über 
das Kreditwesen, or KWG) that are monet-
ary fi  nancial institutions and are domiciled in Germany. Branches of foreign banks that are exempted from the provisions of section 53 of the Banking Act, banks in liquidation and banks with a fi  nancial year under 12 months (truncated fi  nancial year) are not included in 
this performance analysis. The category of 
building and loan associations has been in-
cluded in the analysis for the fi  rst time and 
the aggregate comprising “all categories of 
banks” extended accordingly from 1993. Long- term time series on profi  tability are 
available as PDF downloads on the Bundes-bank’s website.

Calculation of the long- term average
At the launch of European monetary union 
in 1999, the reporting group relevant for cal-culating the money supply and for monetary 
analysis was uniformly defi  ned by the ECB 
for the euro area as a whole and referred to 
as the monetary fi  nancial institutions (MFI) 
sector. Unlike the population of banks used 
for the Bundesbank analysis up to that time, 
building and loan associations are also in-
cluded. Except where another time period is 
explicitly mentioned, the calculations with 
regard to the longer- term average cover the years since the launch of European monetary union, ie from 1999 to 2015.
1 IFRS- based fi  nancial statements are of relevance, for 
instance, to matters of macroprudential analysis and 
oversight, concentrating on systemically important 
banks and their international business activities (includ-ing their foreign subsidiaries). For details, see Deutsche

operative bank sector, there was a further de -
cline in the number of institutions covered by 
the statistics on the profit and loss accounts6. 
As a result, the following comments on the re -
sults of these statistics are based on a reporting 
group comprising 1,679 banks (compared with 
1,715 in 2014).
Rise in net interest income
Net interest income generated by German 
credit institutions in 2015 rose substantially by 
€2.5 billion to €95.9 billion. As a result, net 
interest income accounted for 75% of operat -
ing income7 despite the persistence of low 
interest rates. This was 1.7 percentage points 
more than the long- term average.8 This posi -
tive development was not due to the result of 
interest business in the narrower sense but was 
driven primarily by the rise in current income 
from equities, other variable- yield securities, 
participating interests and shares in affiliated enterprises (by €3.7 billion to €15 billion). This 
item together with income from profit trans -
fers9 accounted for 8.9% (€17.8 billion) of all 
income included in the figure for net interest 
income; on a long-  term average, it accounted 
for 5.9%. By contrast, net income from trad -
itional interest business10 fell by €0.9 billion to 
€78.1 billion. Although there are no signs of a 
slump, this trend confirms expectations of a 
weakening outlook for profitability in a persist -
ent low- interest- rate environment. Pension ex -
penditure reduced net interest income11 to a 
limited extent, among other things because, in 
the low- interest- rate environment, pension 
provisions under German GAAP are increas -
ingly being brought into line with the rising 
market value of pension commitments.12
Despite a marked rise in net interest income, 
the interest margin, calculated as the ratio of 
net interest income to total assets,13 went up 
only marginally to 1.11% in 2015.14 This was at -
tributable to business expansions, which were 
reflected mainly in total assets and less in net

the existing plan assets to be carried at fair value. The Bun -
desbank calculates and announces the discount rates in 
accordance with the Regulation on the Discounting of Pro -
visions (Rückstellungsabzinsungsverordnung). Effects of 
these calculations on profit or loss are reflected in net inter -
est income, staff costs or often, according to the data pub -
lished in the annual reports, in the net other operating re -
sult. See also IDW Accounting Principle: Handelsrechtliche

interest income. The interest margin gives an 
important indication of the general profitability, 
above all, of those credit institutions which 
focus on traditional deposit and lending busi -
ness. In particular, this category of banks com -
prises credit cooperatives and savings banks, 
whose interest margins are invariably higher 
than those of the other banking groups and 
also show lower volatility over time. Neverthe -
less, the further decline in interest margins at 
the networked institutions is confirmation of 
the growing pressure on margins: since 2011, 
net interest income generated by these banks 
at the group level has nearly always risen to a 
lesser extent than total assets. In the reporting 
year, the interest margin in the cooperative 
bank sector, at 2.14%, was 0.07  percentage 
point lower and in the savings bank sector, at 
2.06%, 0.03 percentage point lower than one 
year earlier.
German banks’ funding situation remains fa -
vourable. This was also confirmed by the banks participating in the Bank Lending Survey (BLS), 
which the Bundesbank conducts on a regular 
basis. Throughout the reporting year, the inter -
est rates on the main refinancing operations 
and the marginal lending facility were, at 
0.05% and 0.30% respectively, at their lowest 
levels up to that point in the history of the 
European Central Bank (ECB). Interest rates in 
the interbank market fell repeatedly to new all- 
time lows. On a monthly average, the interest 
rate on unsecured money market transactions 
between banks (Euro InterBank Offered Rate, 
Euribor) with a three- month maturity was 
clearly in negative territory at -0.13% in Decem -
ber, and the unsecured interbank overnight 
rate Eonia (Euro OverNight Index Average) 
stood even lower at -0.2%. In light of the

The effects of the low- interest- rate environment on building 
and loan associations
Prices on the German housing market con-
tinued to grow rapidly. Calculations based 
on bulwiengesa AG data show that house 
prices increased by an average of 6% in 
German cities in the year under review.1 A 
major cause of the price infl  ation is the in-
creased demand for residential property 
which is being supported by favourable funding conditions in the persistent low- 
interest- rate environment and good under-
lying macroeconomic conditions.
The 21 private- sector as well as the public- 
sector building and loan associations in 
Germany, which by defi  nition belong to the 
monetary fi  nancial institutions (MFIs), and 
which have therefore been included in the 
consolidated balance sheet of MFIs and 
money supply calculations for the purposes 
of monetary analysis since the launch of 
European monetary union in 1999, play an 
important role in real estate fi  nancing. Al-
though their total assets account for less 
than 3% of the aggregate total assets for all 
categories of banks, their market share of loans to enterprises and domestic house-holds, by contrast, amounts to around 
10%.
Building and loan associations are subject to the provisions of the German Banking Act (Gesetz über das Kreditwesen) in par-
ticular, as well as the German Building and 
Loan Associations Act (Bausparkassenge-
setz), and are supervised by the Federal Fi-
nancial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and 
the Bundesbank. The building and loan as-
sociation business model focuses on ac-cepting interest- bearing deposits on the basis of long- term contracts and granting money loans from the accumulated 
amounts for real estate purchases to savers 
who fulfi  l the allocation criteria, ie those 
whose contracts have reached the lending 
phase. At the time the contracts are con-cluded, deposit and loan conditions are 
agreed in the form of fi  xed rates.
In the persistent low- interest- rate environ-
ment of recent years, savers with old, high- 
interest contracts eligible for allocation in-creasingly stopped taking out loans under 
savings and loan contracts and instead took 
advantage of the favourable deposit inter-
est rates, seeing them as a lucrative invest-
ment opportunity. Any funding needs they 
may have had for real estate projects were 
met with housing loans at current market conditions, where interest rates on loans 
were signifi  cantly lower than those agreed 
under the old savings and loan contracts. 
This is another reason why loans under sav-
ings and loan contracts, which have been 
declining since the mid-1990s, have con-
tinued to do so in recent years in spite of

the growing demand for housing and in-
crease in bank lending. At the same time, however, the number of new savings and loan contracts has signifi  cantly risen again 
since its lowest point in 2009. Savers enter-
ing into these new contracts secure them-
selves the favourable current interest rates 
for future real estate projects as well as 
reasonably- priced follow- up fi  nancing. The 
targeted savings amounts have also in-
creased.
This growth in deposits with building and 
loan associations on the liabilities side and 
the simultaneous decline in loans under savings and loan contracts on the assets side present the building and loan associ-
ations with the major challenge of generat-
ing income on a sustainable basis, as their 
business activities and investment options are subject to strict statutory regulations. 
For example, deposits may only be used for 
advance fi  nancing and bridging loan pur-poses temporarily and to a limited extent. 
Aside from this, the building and loan asso-
ciations may only invest the available col-
lective savings in safe assets as far as pos-
sible, such as Federal bonds (Bunds), which 
currently only have a low yield. An add-
itional complication is that the interest rate 
terms of the old contracts cannot be adapted to the altered market conditions. 
Therefore, net interest income decreased by 
16% between 2011 and 2015 to just €2.8 billion, while total assets consistently rose 
during the same period. These peculiarities account for the substantial reduction in the interest margin, which has narrowed signifi  -cantly from 1.71% in 2011 to just 1.32% in 
2015.2 The decline in net interest income 
could not be offset by an improvement in 
the structurally negative net commission in-come either – as in previous years, high net 
charges of €0.6 billion were recorded for this item in the year under review. Unlike 
most other categories of banks, the build-ing and loan associations hardly receive any 
fee and commission income, but primarily book commissions paid for contracts con-
cluded and brokerage by distribution part-
ners. Moreover, the other operating result and the trading result barely help to in-
crease profi  tability as both income compon-ents have very little to no relevance for the 
building and loan associations. At €2.2 bil-
lion, operating income reached an all- time 
low. Administrative spending was substan-
tially reduced to just €1.7 billion, and while 
this saw the cost/income ratio rise only marginally on the year, it was signifi  cantly higher than the long- term average, which 
substantiates the deterioration in cost effi   -
ciency.
The regulatory requirements relating to the 
building and loan associations’ special busi-ness model in particular only allow them to 
tap alternative sources of income, in add-ition to their net interest income, to a limited extent. In the past few years they 
have benefi  ted from lower loan- loss provi-

€200 billion between December 2014 and De -
cember 2015. The interest rate payable on 
these holdings – the deposit facility rate has 
been negative since June 201416 – resulted in 
expenses for credit institutions totalling €248 
million17 in the reporting year. Although these 
were almost seven times higher than in the 
previous year, they reduced interest income in -
sofar as it was posted as a negative compon -
ent,18 by no more than 0.1%.
The announcement at the beginning of 2015 
that the Eurosystem would be extending its 
existing securities purchase programmes (ex -
panded asset purchase programme, APP) 
caused bond yields to contract again percep -
tibly. The German yield curve19 continued to 
flatten and shifted downwards. Taken in isol -
ation, this development puts pressure in par -
ticular on the interest margins of those banks 
that generate a large part of their income from 
balance sheet maturity transformation. Amid 
volatile developments later in the year, the yield curve was characterised mainly by a widening 
of negative yields in the lower maturity seg -
ments. This makes borrowing on the money 
and capital markets increasingly more attractive 
than funding through deposits because market- 
based financing, unlike deposits by retail cus -
tomers and non- financial corporations, is not

banks whose funding comes primarily from de -

 characterised by negative yields in the short to medium- term maturity  segmentssions. Although the net valuation result had 
deteriorated considerably compared to the 
previous year at -€0.1 billion, as a percent-
age of total assets it was still higher, at 
-0.03%, than the long- term average of 
-0.05%. On balance, profi  t for the fi  nancial 
year before tax was lower by half on the 
year at €0.4 billion, meaning that the return 
on equity almost halved to 4.5% on ac-
count of a stronger capital base.
Legislators have taken into account the 
changed underlying conditions and the per-
sistent low- interest- rate environment and have comprehensively revised the Building 
and Loan Associations Act, which had last 
been amended in 1990, as well as the Regulation concerning Building and Loan Associations (Bausparkassen- Verordnung) 
at the end of 2015. A signifi  cant innovation is the more fl  exible use of the fund required 
by the building and loan association rules (Fonds zur bauspartechnischen Absiche-
rung, or FbtA). The original purpose of this special item was to make waiting times be-tween the beginning of a savings and loan contract and its allocation consistent and as short as possible, even when liquidity is low due to a lack of new deposits. As a result of 
this legislative amendment, FbtA funds can 
now also be released to assure the interest 
margin necessary for the sustainable oper-
ation of the building and loan association 
business as a whole and to counteract the 
effect of depressed earnings in the current 
low- interest- rate environment. To a limited 
extent, building and loan associations are 
now also able to invest in higher- risk assets, such as shares.

effect is likely to be reflected in further declin -
ing net interest income and lead to adjust -
ments in the structuring of terms and condi -
tions or in the financing structure.20
As in previous years, the liabilities side of the 
balance sheets was characterised by a build- up 
of short- term deposits and a reduction in 
longer- term deposits, especially by non- banks. 
Additionally, the ongoing build- up of overnight 
deposits was encouraged by the renewed rise 
in the saving ratio accompanying households’ 
considerably higher disposable incomes and by 
German enterprises’ strong liquidity position. 
The shortening of maturities on the liabilities side associated with the growing concentration 
on overnight deposit products is leading to 
more and more loans with significantly longer 
interest fixation periods being financed on a 
short-  term basis. Thus, particularly networked 
institutions active in traditional deposit and 
lending business are being exposed to a higher 
maturity transformation risk on their balance 
sheets. Since 2008 – shortly after the outbreak Ongoing build- 
up of overnight deposits raises maturity trans-formation riskMajor income and cost items for individual categories of banks in 2015p

of the financial crisis – the share of the liabilities 
side of the balance sheet accounted for by 
non- banks’ overnight deposits almost doubled 
to around 43% in the case of credit coopera -
tives and to roughly 41% in the case of savings 
banks. By contrast, the share of the asset side 
of the balance sheet accounted for by long-  
term loans to non- banks increased by only 
5.4 percentage points to just under 54% in the 
case of credit cooperatives and by no more 
than 5.8 percentage points to just over 56% in 
the case of savings banks.
Against the backdrop of the further growth in 
banks’ stock of deposits and cheap liquidity 
provided by the Eurosystem, market- based 
funding became steadily less important. Since 
2008, the percentage of total assets accounted 
for by negotiable debt securities has dropped 
by almost one- third to around 15%. Ongoing 
targeted balance sheet reductions imple -
mented, notably, by capital- market- oriented 
Landesbanken and mortgage banks, are likely 
to have played a crucial role in this. On the de -
mand side, it is likely that more stringent regu -
latory requirements have made investment in 
long- dated unsecured bank bonds, in particu -
lar, less attractive for institutional investors.21 
Bank bond redemptions exceeded new issues 
by €77.3 billion in the reporting period.Loans to the private sector rose distinctly in the 
reporting period. The volume of loans to 
households (adjusted for securitisation and 
sales) grew by a total of 2.8%. As in the previ -
ous year, such growth was driven mainly by 
loans to households for house purchase, the 
annual growth rate of which accelerated mark -
edly last year, posting the highest increase in 
over 13 years in December 2015 at 3.5%. The 
historically favourable interest rate and finan -
cing environment – the average interest rate 
charged by banks on new loans for house pur -
chase showed a further fall from 2.0% to 1.8% 
in the course of the year – as well as the re -
duced attractiveness of alternative investment 
opportunities played a key role in the high level 
of demand for residential properties and the 
associated loans.
In contrast to 2014, loans to non- financial cor -
porations registered a slight net increase in the 
reporting year. However, at an annual rate of 
0.5% in December 2015, growth remained very 
moderate, partly due to the substitution of 
bank loans with own funds and other sources 
of credit. By contrast, lending to the German 
public sector decreased, with the annual 
growth rate standing at -0.7% in December 
2015.
Net interest income,

categories of banks. Net interest income at the Waning import -

big banks increased by €1.7 billion to €22.2 bil -
lion (67.8% of operating income). The contri -
bution of current income and income from 
profit transfers to this result rose by a total of 
€2.3 billion to €10 billion, while the net result 
from traditional interest business declined by 
€0.7 billion to €12.2 billion. In the case of the 
regional institutions of credit cooperatives, net 
interest income grew by €0.4 billion to €1.5 bil -
lion (71.4% of operating income). Within this 
figure, the total of current income and income 
from profit transfers went up by €0.3 billion to 
€0.9 billion. Furthermore, the net result from 
traditional interest business improved by €0.1 
billion to €0.6 billion. This growth was not at -
tributable to widened margins, however, but 
mainly to special factors.22 In tandem with in -
creasing total assets, the interest margin of the 
big banks widened by 0.04 percentage point to 
0.81% and that of the regional institutions of 
credit cooperatives by 0.11 percentage point to 
0.51%.In the Landesbanken sector, which was af -
fected by restructuring measures, net interest 
income was unchanged on the year at €8.2 bil -
lion (82.5% of operating income); given further 
reduced total assets, this meant that the inter -
est margin rose somewhat to 0.76%. In the 
case of the mortgage banks, net interest in -
come showed a clear improvement of €0.2 bil -
lion to €2.2 billion despite declining total 
assets. This growth was accompanied by 
strongly countervailing effects arising from two 
institutions closing derivatives positions. The 
fact that net interest income in this category of 
banks marginally exceeded total operating in -
come in the reporting year, with the relevant 
ratio standing at 97.6% even on a long-term 
average, testifies to the low level of diversifica -
tion in income sources compared with the Landesbanken:

other categories of banks. This probably indi -
cates an ongoing high degree of dependency 
on maturity transformation as a source of in -
come. The interest margin increased by 
0.12 percentage point to 0.6%.
Thanks to the larger credit volume of loans for 
house purchase and the further increase in ma -
turity transformation on the balance sheet, net 
interest income at the savings banks – at €23.3 
billion (78.1% of operating income) – and at 
the credit cooperatives – at €17.1 billion (78.4% 
of operating income) – held steady at the pre -
vious year’s level. The regional banks and other 
commercial banks increased their net interest 
income by €0.3 billion to €13.8 billion (65.9% 
of operating income). As with the networked 
institutions, the interest margin also receded in 
this heavily interest- dependent category of 
banks on the back of significantly higher total 
assets and, at 1.56%, fell short of the previous 
year’s figure by 0.06 percentage point.
Clear increase in net 
 commission income
Net commission income improved considerably 
by €1.2 billion to €30.5 billion and, with a 
23.8% share in operating income, exceeded 
the long- term average by 1.5  percentage points. In the search for alternative sources of 
income to offset the diminishing yield potential 
in interest business, net commission income is 
gaining ground as the second most important 
income source. In particular, this concerns fees 
for giro transactions and payments as well as 
for securities and safe custody business, and 
remuneration  for brokerage activities relating 
to loan contracts, savings agreements, savings 
and loan agreements, and insurance contracts. 
In line with this, more than half of the banks 
that participated in the 2015 survey on the 
low- interest- rate setting reported that they had 
raised their fees and commissions in response 
to the low rates. According to the institutions’ 
own plans, net commission income is the only 
component of operating business that is ex -
pected to grow at least marginally in relation to 
total assets, thus stabilising earnings. Nonethe -
less, the commission margin was unchanged 
on the year at 0.35% and therefore only at the 
same level as the long- term average.
Fees in securities- related business, in particular, 
are likely to have benefited from the positive 
developments in the stock markets, especially 
in the first half of the year. In addition, price 
gains boosted the contribution to net commis -
sion income made by safe custody account 
management, which hinges on the safe cus -
tody account volume.23 Bank customers’ sus -
tained high level of interest in mutual fund 
shares probably also had a positive impact. 
Among the retail funds, highly sought- after op -
tions included not only mixed securities funds 
but also, in particular, equity funds, which had 
been receiving little attention in the previous 
year. In total, sales of retail fund units increased 
almost eightfold on the year to €30.4 billion. 
Sales of specialised fund units, which are very 
much in demand amongst institutional invest -
ors, also rose significantly by nearly 24% to 
€115.7 billion.Net interest

The bulk of the increase in net commission in -
come (€0.8 billion in total) took place in the 
categories of banks that were the focus of the 
survey on the low- interest- rate setting. The sav -
ings banks increased their net commission in -
come by 5.2% to €6.8 billion (22.7% of operat -
ing income), the credit cooperatives did so by 
5.5% to €4.6 billion (21% of operating income) 
and the regional banks and other commercial 
banks by 4.3% to €5.5 billion (26% of operat -
ing income). Key factors in this growth were 
additional revenue from payment transactions 
as well as from securities and safe custody 
business, and, in the case of the savings banks 
and credit cooperatives, from brokerage with 
network partners (building and loan associ -
ations, investment fund companies, insurance 
companies). This helped the networked institu -
tions to reach new all- time highs in net com -
mission income. Although total assets grew 
concurrently, the commission margin saw just a 
minor year- on- year increase of 0.02 percent -
age point to 0.60% for the savings banks, and 
of 0.01  percentage point to 0.57% for the 
credit cooperatives, while for the regional 
banks and other commercial banks the figure 
declined marginally by 0.01 percentage point 
to 0.62%.
The big banks, for which commission business 
traditionally plays a greater role than for the 
other categories of banks, increased their net 
commission income by €0.4 billion to €11.8 bil -
lion (36% of operating income). However, the 
commission margin matched the previous 
year’s level at 0.43%. Net commission income 
in the Landesbanken sector, which has been 
depressed since 2009 by high expenditure for 
government guarantees issued by individual 
Landesbanken, improved by €0.1 billion to €1 
billion (10% of operating income); this was 
chiefly due to declining guarantee fees. None -
theless, it was still noticeably lower than the 
average of the period from 1999 to 2008.Trading business just higher 
than prior- year level
In a shaky financial market setting, the trading 
result, which is typically highly volatile, in -
creased slightly by €0.1 billion to €3.7 billion. 
The percentage of operating income accounted 
for by the trading result also marginally ex -
ceeded the long- term average at just under 
3%. According to the published annual reports, 
trading business rarely constitutes proprietary 
trading originating in the institutions, but ra -
ther is dominated by customer-  initiated busi -
ness.
For the regional institutions of credit coopera -
tives, the trading result accounts for 9% of op -
erating income on a long- term average, mak -
ing it a more important source of income than 
for the other categories of banks. It saw a dis -
tinct year-  on- year reduction of €0.1 billion to 
€0.3 billion (15.5% of operating income). This 
was mainly due to derivatives income and ex -
penses similar in nature to interest being 
reclassified   to net interest income, which rose 
accordingly. In the big banks sector, the trading 
result was also €0.1 billion lower at €2.5 billion 
(7.6% of operating income). Significant losses 
in the trading result were largely offset by high 
income arising from withdrawals from the spe -
cial item pursuant to section 340e (4) of the 
German Commercial Code (HGB).24 The net 
trading result in the Landesbanken  sector was 
shaped by positive valuation and currency ef -
fects, rising significantly by €0.4 billion to €0.5 
billion (5.4% of operating income).Growth

Other operating result again 
has high negative balance
The other operating result is a summary item 
used to record income and expenditure from 
operating business that have no connection to 
the net interest, commission or trading result. 
The balance was once more in clearly negative 
territory at -€2.2 billion – the corresponding 
figure for 2014 was -€2.5 billion – which was 
again due to high expenditure by the big banks 
for litigation and recourse risks. Moreover, in -
come effects stemming from the accounting 
for pension obligations had a negative impact, 
as had been the case over the past few years.25 
By contrast, relief was provided by the absence 
of expenditure incurred by the reimbursement 
of loan processing fees26 among the regional 
banks and other commercial banks; this had 
weighed – heavily in some cases – on individual 
banks in the previous year.
Marked rise in administrative 
spending
The banks’ expenditure side is largely shaped 
by administrative spending, which encom -
passes staff costs and other administrative 
spending.27 The total figure saw a distinct in -crease of 5% (€4.3 billion) to €90 billion, reach -
ing a new all- time high. Measured in terms of 
total assets, however, it remained at the same 
level as the long- term average.
Staff costs include not only wage and salary 
payments but also social security contributions 
and operating expenses for pensions. Owing to 
pay increases under collective agreements and 
the payment of variable remuneration com -
ponents, wage and salary payments rose by 
€1.1 billion to €36.4 billion, despite continued 
job cuts. Social security contributions and oper -
ating expenses for pensions went up by €1 bil -
lion to €9.6 billion. Of this additional spending, 
roughly half (around €0.5 billion) was attribut -
able to transfers to the pension provisions, 
which expanded to €3.7 billion. Other adminis -
trative spending grew markedly by €2.2 billion 
to €44 billion. Besides the costs of the bank 
levy, this item includes mainly non- staff costs 
and expenditure on external services such as 
legal, auditing and consultancy costs and the 
costs of IT services. The growth was attribut -
able, alongside other factors, to the additional 
expenditure in connection with the European 
bank levy, and is probably also due, not least, 
to additional implementation costs and current 
administrative spending to fulfil more stringent 
regulatory requirements.
Wage and salary payments increased consider -
ably, especially at the big banks, rising by 7.9% 
(or €0.7 billion to €9.6 billion). In addition to 
negotiated pay rises, this stemmed from the 
payment of variable remuneration components 
and, in part, from exchange rate effects. For 
the other categories of banks, additional wage High expend-
iture for  litigation and recourse risks again had adverse impact

26 In its judgements of May and October 2014, the Federal 
Court of Justice confirmed the unlawfulness of loan pro -
cessing fees, since the processing of a loan is not a service 
rendered for the customer. It ruled that it is instead in the 
bank’s own interests to check the customer’s solvency and 
prepare the contract. The court therefore decided that, in 
compliance with certain limitation periods, reimbursements 
of loan processing fees paid in the last ten years can be 
requested.

and salary expenditure was within the range of 
the pay rises agreed in collective bargaining 
and was much more moderate.28 The smallest 
increase, of 1.4% in each case, was recorded 
by the savings banks (up by €0.1 billion to €9.8 
billion) and the credit cooperatives (by €0.1 bil -
lion to €7 billion). In the case of the mortgage 
banks, on the other hand, wage and salary 
payments were reduced by as much as 6.5% 
(by €0.03 billion to €0.4 billion), mainly as a 
result of declining staff costs at one bank.
Most of the increase in other administrative 
spending was accounted for by the big banks; 
this cost item rose considerably by €1.4 billion 
(10.2%) to €15.7 billion. One of the reasons 
cited for this was additional regulation-  related 
expenditure, and, in the case of one big bank, 
high charges from the group accounts, though 
these were partly offset by additional receipts 
for services provided within the group which 
were booked in net commission income. In the 
case of the regional institutions of credit co -
operatives, the appreciable growth in other ad -
ministrative spending of 23.4% (up by €0.1 bil -
lion to €0.7 billion) was mainly attributable to 
higher project costs in addition to the bank 
levy. Credit cooperatives, which have substan -
tial fixed costs owing to their relatively dense 
branch network, recorded the lowest growth, 
at 1.6% (an increase of €0.1 billion to €5.8 bil -
lion). Additional spending of 2.2% (growth of 
€0.2 billion to €7.6 billion) was posted by the 
regional banks and other commercial banks, 
3.9% (up by €0.3 billion to €7.6 billion) by the 
savings banks and 5.2% (by €0.2 billion to €3.4 
billion) by the Landesbanken. For the mortgage 
banks, this cost item fell by 8% (by €0.1 billion 
to €0.7 billion), primarily as the result of re -
duced IT and consultancy costs at one bank.
In view of declining earnings prospects, espe -
cially in interest rate-  related business, and 
growing competitive pressure with regard to 
the supply of financial services both within and 
outside of the banking sector, banks are in -
creasingly reconsidering their business strat -
egies. The cost/income ratio, a key perform -ance indicator which expresses the ratio of ad -
ministrative spending to operating income, 
provides information on cost efficiency. In prin -
ciple, the lower the ratio is, the more efficient a 
bank is at generating profit. In the reporting 
year, the additional receipts from operating 
business failed to offset the rise in administra -
tive spending. For every €100 generated, banks 
had to spend €70.40, which was €1.20 more 
than in the previous year and as much as €3.70 
higher than the long- term average.
For some time now, credit institutions have 
been trying to cut costs by way of mergers and 
adjustments to their branch structures. The 
trend towards closing down and consolidating 
bank branches also continued in the reporting Other adminis-
trative spending, by category of banks

28 On 1 July 2014, the association of employers in the pri -
vate banking industry and the trade union ver.di concluded 
a new collective agreement in the banking sector. The 
agreement, covering around 200,000 employees, provides 
for a two- stage pay rise (of 2.4% from 1 July 2014 and 
2.1% from 1 July 2015) as well as a one- off payment of

year. In total, the number of savings bank 
branches was reduced by 492 to 11,459, credit 
cooperatives lowered their branch count by 
447 to 10,822, as did the big banks by 203 to 
7,240 branches.
Although they benefit from economies of scale, 
big banks lagged behind the other categories 
of banks in terms of cost efficiency with a sig -
nificantly increased cost/income ratio of 82.9%. 
In the savings bank sector and the cooperative 
bank sector, the ratio remained within its usual 
range at 68.9% and 66.6% respectively. Higher 
operating income and administrative spending 
saw the cost/income ratio of the regional insti -tutions of credit cooperatives deteriorate no -
ticeably to 63.1%, while the Landesbanken as 
well as the regional banks and other commer -
cial banks improved their ratios slightly to 
69.1% and 64.6% respectively. Thanks to de -
clining administrative spending and an increase 
in operating income, the mortgage banks’ 
cost/income ratio of 51.2% was much more 
favourable  than in 2014. The cost efficiency 
figures  should nevertheless be interpreted with 
caution, particularly when making a cross-  
category comparison, as the business models 
of the various categories of banks differ signifi -
cantly with regard to their cost structure.29

The net valuation result comprises the effects 
of value adjustments, write-  ups and write-  
downs on accounts receivable and securities in 
the liquidity reserve. In addition, income and 
charges in connection with transfers from and 
to loan- loss provisions are taken into account,30 
as are transfers and releases relating to undis -
closed reserves pursuant to section 340 f of the 
German Commercial Code. The net valuation 
result makes use of the cross- offsetting op -
tion31 permissible under the German Commer -

serves pursuant to section 340g of the German 
Commercial Code (fund for general banking 
risks) are not recorded in the profit and loss ac -
count, but are recognised only in the context

of profit distribution as part of the present 
profit and loss analysis.32
Year- on- year net valuation charges were al -
most halved, falling to an all- time low of €3.6 
billion. With a ratio of 0.04%, this result also 
fell short of the long- term average of 0.2% 
when measured by total assets. If an economic 
downturn, for example, were to send the risk 
provisioning requirement back to the level of 
the long-  term average, a further €14 billion 
would need to be transferred to the net valu -
ation result, which – all other things being 
equal – would place a considerable strain on 
profitability. Thanks to positive economic con -
ditions and the good portfolio quality, how -
ever, there is currently only a minor need for 
loss provisioning. The continuing strong state 
of domestic activity is also reflected by the de -
clining trend for some years now in the number 
of business and consumer insolvencies. Since 
the introduction of the Insolvency Code in 
1999, the number of business insolvencies has 
reached a new low, and the number of con -
sumer insolvencies has fallen for the fifth time 
in succession.33
Owing to considerably lower transfers to credit 
risk provisions as well as capital gains from the 
sale of securities in the liquidity reserve, the big 
banks posted net earnings for the first time, 
amounting to €0.1 billion. For the savings 
banks and the regional institutions of credit co -
operatives, the net valuation result was once 
again positive at €0.1 billion in both cases. Al -
though the credit cooperatives increased their 
net valuation charges by €0.3 billion, their net 
valuation result of -€0.5 billion was still at a 
very low level. In the Landesbanken sector, net 
valuation charges fell by almost one- third to 
€1.1 billion. Within this category, however, the 
results were mixed. While the end of one- off 
negative effects at one Landesbank as well as 
guarantee effects at another institution brought 
about a significant reduction in risk provision -
ing expenses, the persistently high need for 
credit risk provisions for shipping loans at other 
Landesbanken had a considerably negative im -pact. Not least on account of the differing busi -
ness models, there were widely varying reasons 
for the €0.2 billion rise in the net charges of 
regional banks and other commercial banks to 
€1.3 billion; one of the causes in this instance 
was also the poor quality of the shipping loan 
portfolio.Reduced

Expansion of negative 
 balance on other and 
 extraordinary result
The structurally negative balance shown in the 
profit and loss statistics for the other and extra -
ordinary result comprises, along with the extra -
ordinary profit or loss in the stricter sense,34 the 
result from financial investment business35 as 
well as loss transfers. Furthermore, charges 
arising from profit transfers36 are recorded 
here, as they cannot be assigned to actual op -
erating business. Overall, the negative balance 
grew by €1.3 billion to €7.8 billion. This was 
mainly attributable to the considerable increase 
in net charges in the extraordinary account in 
the narrower sense at two banks in the cat -
egory of regional banks and other commercial 
banks.37 Although the balance relating to fi -
nancial investment business changed only mar -
ginally, it was influenced by strongly opposing 
effects from two categories of banks. The big banks significantly expanded their negative bal -
ance from -€0.5 billion to -€1.8 billion as a 
result  of major write- downs on the affiliated 
enterprises at one institution, while the Landes -
banken returned to positive territory, their bal -
ance rising from -€1.0 billion to €0.4 billion, 
chiefly owing to the fact that a negative special 
factor ceased to apply in the case of one bank. 
The perceptible increase of €0.6 billion to €1.2 
billion in charges incurred through loss trans -
fers was due mainly to the result of one big 
bank which assumed the losses of a subsidiary. 
This increase contrasted with a considerable 
rise in income from loss transfers of €0.7 billion 
to €1.1 billion at individual regional banks and 
other commercial banks as well as mortgage 
banks.
Increased profit for the 
 financial year and balance 
sheet profit
German credit institutions’ profit for the finan -
cial year before tax went up by €1.5 billion to 
€26.5 billion owing, in particular, to a further 
decline in risk provisioning expenses. Along 
with a stronger balance sheet capital base 
again,38 the return on equity – calculated as 
the ratio of profit for the financial year before 
tax to balance sheet capital (total equity) – was 
virtually unchanged on the year; at 5.8%, it re -Significant

income from value readjustments in respect of participat -

mained stable at the level of the long- term 
average.
Developments across the categories of banks 
were mixed. Big banks’ profit for the financial 
year decreased significantly by €1 billion to €2.7 
billion, as the additional burdens in terms of ad -
ministrative spending and the extraordinary ac -
count were not entirely offset by the favourable 
developments in operating income and risk pro -
visioning. Along with a considerable strength -
ening of the balance sheet capital base, return 
on equity was down by 1.3 percentage points 
to 3%. The Landesbanken and mortgage banks 
benefited from the absence of negative factors 
outside operating business and managed to 
turn their respective losses of €0.4 billion and 
€0.2 billion in the previous financial year into 
profits of €1.8 billion and €0.7 billion in 2015. 
Together with a reduced balance sheet capital 
base, the return on equity in the Landesbanken 
sector, at 3.3%, and in the case of mortgage 
banks, at 4.9%, was in positive territory again. Credit cooperatives’ profit for the financial year 
fell by €0.3 billion to €6.7 billion, while the cor -
responding figure for savings banks was up 
€0.3 billion to €9 billion. With the balance sheet 
capital positions being significantly stronger 
again in both categories of banks, credit co -
operatives’ return on equity, at 10.7%, was dis -
tinctly below the previous year’s figure, while 
the savings banks’ ratio, at 9.7%, was slightly 
down on the year. Nevertheless, this meant that 
the networked institutions still retained their 
leading position in relation to the other cat -
egories of banks. In the case of the regional in -
stitutions of credit cooperatives, profit for the 
financial year more than halved to €0.3 billion, 
primarily as a result of high charges in the extra -
ordinary account. A further concurrent expan -
sion of their balance sheet capital base meant 
that their return on equity, at 1.7%, was signifi -
cantly lower than in the previous year.

almost 40% to €456 billion. The equity ratio, 
calculated as the ratio of total equity to total 
assets, has increased during this period from 
3.9% to 5.3%. In order to hedge against the 
special risks of banking business and to further 
expand the base of prudentially recognised 
equity capital, €7.2 billion net (compared with 
€10.6 billion in 2014) was transferred from the 
profit for the reporting year to the fund for 
general banking risks. It was mainly the net -
worked institutions that strengthened their 
capital positions. Reserves grew by €2.5 billion. 
Overall, total equity from internal financing 
rose by €9.7 billion in the reporting year.39
After deducting taxes on earnings, the German 
banks increased their net balance sheet profit 
by €0.7 billion to €2.7 billion. However, this 
was not connected to additional balance sheet 
gains – the figure for which fell by €0.6 billion 
to €7.4 billion – but to a significant €1.4 billion 
reduction in accumulated losses to €4.7 billion. 
The main factor behind this development was the release of reserves to reduce high losses 
brought forward at one mortgage bank.
Outlook
The unfavourable underlying conditions in the 
persistent low-  interest-  rate environment are 
likely to make it increasingly difficult to gener -
ate adequate returns in interest business. While

39 When interpreting the information on total equity, it 
should be borne in mind that the amounts transferred from 
the profit for the respective financial year do not increase 
balance sheet capital until the following year after the an -
nual accounts are adopted, while withdrawals from equity 
items are to be deducted from balance sheet capital at the 
latest when the annual accounts are prepared.

the market as a whole in terms of current prof -
itability, it can nevertheless give an indication of 
how banks’ financial performance is expected 
to develop in the current year. For example, the 
difficult and highly uncertain market environ -
ment in the first half of 2016 was reflected in 
considerably reduced profit before tax com -
pared with the same period last year, with 
lower administrative spending being accom -
panied by declining income from operating 
business. Risk provisioning expenses rose sub -
stantially, although their informative value is 
limited in the first half of the year and experi -
ence has shown that this item is subject to con -siderable adjustments up to the end of the 
year. Even though the profitability of German 
banks has proven to be robust thus far and the 
ongoing accommodative monetary policy 
stance is having a positive impact on banks’ 
funding conditions, low interest rates are

national banknotes still in circulation. 10The German contributions to the Euro- banknotes actually issued by the Bundesbank and the amount disclosed in
system’s monetary aggregates should on no account be interpreted as national accordance with the accounting regime chosen by the Eurosystem (see also footnote
