5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Underlying trends
The recovery in the German economy con-
tinued during the third quarter of 2010, even
though it was at a considerably slower pace
than in the second quarter of the year, which
was characterised by catch-up and backlog
effects. While industry benefited from on-
going rising global demand for high-quality
goods, construction is likely to have stag-
nated, albeit at a heightened level.
The sharp expansion in export orders and
high export expectations, even if the latter
were easing somewhat, indicate that industry
can increase its output further in the fourth
quarter. Additional stimulus came from the
domestic economy too, with domestic orders
for capital goods rising once again. The
growth in retail sector sales, increasing num-
bers of new private passenger car registra-
tions and household sentiment point to a sus-
tained revival of private consumption.
Industry
August saw a marked increase in industrial
output compared with July, which was im-
paired by holiday effects. On an average of
these two months, industrial output was a
seasonally adjusted 1.8% up on the second
quarter, when it had risen by 5.3%. Inter-
mediate, capital and consumer goods in-
creased to a similar extent, which is a sign
that the recovery in the manufacturing sector
has continued on a broad base.Economic

6August also saw a sharp month-on-month
increase in demand for industrial products,
due partly to the fact that, as in June, very
large orders were received by manufacturers
of other transport equipment. The average of
July and August was 21/C252% up on the average
of the second quarter in seasonally adjusted
terms. The strongest growth was recorded by
capital goods (3%), followed by intermediate
goods (21/C252%), compared with a decline of
1% in consumer goods. While there was no
increase overall in domestic orders despite
the rise in capital goods, more export orders
were received, although the increases from
the euro area markedly exceeded those from
non-EU countries in the period under review.
An important role in this respect is likely to
have been played by large orders placed with
European groups of enterprises/consortia,
which were shared out and distributed within
the euro area.
Domestic industrial sales increased in July and
August by a seasonally adjusted 11/C252% com-
pared with the second quarter, while export
sales rose by 13/C254%. Exports on an average of
July and August were 3% up on the second
quarter in terms of value, and imports were
as much as 31/C252% higher, although neither im-
ports nor exports matched their high June
level.
Construction
Construction output in August was down
somewhat on July, and the average of these
two months was a seasonally adjusted1/C254%
below the second quarter. Although building

7terms of volume, grew by1/C254%, the civil
engineering segment contracted by 11/C254%.
Construction orders increased sharply in July(more recent data are unavailable at present),although they failed to match the levelachieved during the first few months of 2010owing to the discontinuation of the govern-ment fiscal stimulus programmes.
Labour marketThe situation in the labour market continued
to improve in keeping with developments inthe real economy. In the initial report fromthe Federal Statistical Office, the number ofpersons in work in August according to theworkplace concept was a seasonally adjusted46,000 up on the month. This was due main-ly to increased flows of cross-border commut-ing. The increase was therefore considerablyweaker according to the residence concept.Domestic employment was 0.5% up on theyear. The number of short-time workers inJuly is likely to have fallen to one-fifth of itspeak in May 2009, with a further decline inprospect. The Ifo employment barometer andthe Federal Employment Agency’s BA-X indexindicate a further expansion in employmentover the coming months.
The official unemployment figure fell in Sep-
tember by a seasonally adjusted 40,000 to3.15 million. Unemployment in the broaderdefinition fell somewhat more sharply in fact.The unemployment rate (BA concept) wentdown to 7.5%, which was 0.8 percentagepoint lower than at the same time last year.Prices
Crude oil prices rose almost continuously
throughout September, with this upwardmovement persisting in the first half ofOctober. One major reason for this is likely tohave been the recent depreciation of the USdollar. The average spot price for Brent NorthSea oil in September was US$78
1/C254per barrel,
which was just 1% above the August figure.Comparing the end-of-month levels, how-ever, there was an increase of 7
1/C254%t o
US$811/C252. The marked appreciation of the
euro against the US dollar neverthelessmeant that the price of oil was virtuallyunchanged in euro terms. As this report wentto press, the spot price was US$84
3/C254. Future
deliveries of crude oil were being quoted withlower premiums, ie US$1
1/C254for six-month and
US$41/C252for 18-month deliveries.
The seasonally adjusted month-on-month
decline in import prices was somewhatstronger in August. This was mainly due tothe fact that energy prices were still falling inthis month. If energy is excluded, importprices actually rose slightly. Domestic pro-ducer prices presented a similar picture, al-though the fall in energy prices was muchweaker here owing to the lesser significanceof crude oil products, and the overall indexdid in fact show a rise. German industry alsoplayed a part in this, as the improved globaleconomic situation enabled it to further in-crease its prices in both domestic and foreignsales. Overall, import prices in August fell bya seasonally adjusted 0.5%, although therewas a positive year-on-year rate of 8.6%. Indomestic sales of industrial products, thereEmployment

8was a seasonally adjusted increase of 0.1%
on the month. The year-on-year figure fell to
3.2%.
The seasonally adjusted rise in consumer
prices in September was moderate, much like
in earlier months. Fuels and, in particular,
heating oil were more expensive. There were
no major movements in the other compo-
nents, however. A rise in consumer and dur-
able goods (excluding energy and food) was
offset by declines in travel costs. Overall, con-
sumer prices in September were 1.3% up on
the year, compared with 1.0% in August.
Public finances1
Local government finances
According to the latest cash statistics data
published by the Federal Statistical Office,
local government recorded a deficit of 311/C254
billion in the second quarter, which was only
slightly higher than one year previously ( 31
billion).2However, in 2009, the city of Stutt-
gart participated with 31 billion in the recap-
italisation of Baden W/C252rttemberg’s Landes-
bank, LBBW. After adjustment for this
baseline effect, the rise in the deficit was
correspondingly steeper. Overall, revenue was
up significantly on the year for the first time
since the end of 2008 (+23/C254%o r 31 billion).
Growth in tax revenue (+43/C254%), particularly
from local business tax (+141/C252% after deduc-
tion of the shares to be transferred to central
and state government, thus resulting in an
overall decline of 63/C254% during the first half of
the year), was completely offset by the sharpfall (-11%) in general grants from state
government that are linked to the level of tax
revenue, which are mostly transferred with a
time lag. On balance, the increase in total
revenue is thus mainly attributable to higher
proceeds from asset realisations and fees. By
contrast, investment grants from state gov-
ernment barely exceeded the level recorded a
year earlier, meaning that there was appar-
ently still only a very limited take-up of pay-
ments from the Investment and Repayment
Fund, which was set up as part of the second
economic stimulus package.
At the same time, expenditure also rose per-
ceptibly (by 3% or 311/C254billion), particularly
after adjustment for the city of Stuttgart’s
participation in the above-mentioned recapit-
alisation (+51/C252%). The principal causes were
growth in social benefits (+61/C254% or just over
31/C252billion) – primarily in the areas of social as-
sistance and assistance for young people, as
well as accommodation costs for recipients of
unemployment benefit II – and a rise in fixed
asset formation, probably mainly as a result
of the second economic stimulus package
(+13% or 31/C252billion). However, personnel ex-
penditure (+31/C254%) also increased perceptibly
1In the short report on public finances which regularly
appears in the Monthly Report, the emphasis is on recent
outturns. The quarterly editions of the Monthly Report
(published in February, May, August and November), by
contrast, contain a detailed description of general gov-
ernment budget trends during the preceding quarter. For
detailed statistical data on budgetary developments and
public debt, see the statistical section of this report.
2The problem of sharp intra-year fluctuations and the
need for revisions still persists as a result of sometimes in-
complete or incorrect recordings following the introduc-
tion by many local governments of the commercial
double-entry bookkeeping system. Consequently, since
spring 2009, the Federal Statistical Office has published
only cumulated cash statistics data rather than a detailed
breakdown for individual quarters.Consumer

9again, not least because of the rise in negoti-
ated pay rates agreed at the beginning of2010. Other operating expenditure likewiseincreased significantly (+3
1/C252%), while interest
expenditure continued to decline. Neverthe-less, the Federal Statistical Office continues tostress that, following the gradual introductionof the commercial double-entry bookkeepingsystem, year-on-year comparisons in individ-ual expenditure categories, such as personnelexpenditure, other operating expenditure andfixed asset formation, may be distorted.

The ongoing deficit also brought the declinein credit market debt, which had been record-ed until very recently, to a standstill. Itappears that, in contrast to previous quarters,overall the reserves were no longer used tohelp finance the deficit. However, the situ-ation for cash advances, which are actuallyonly intended to bridge short-term liquidityshortfalls, is a particular cause for concern. Atthe end of June, the volume of cash advanceshad increased by 32 billion (to 339
1/C252billion)
compared with the end of the previous quar-ter as a result of the further deterioration inthe budgetary situation. In particular, thelocal governments in the federal states ofSaarland, Rhineland-Palatinate and NorthRhine-Westphalia – which were already veryhighly indebted on average – but also localgovernments in Schleswig-Holstein, Hesseand Lower Saxony recorded high per capitagrowth in cash advances. Viewed as a whole,despite the significant improvement in theoverall economic situation and signs of stabil-isation with regard to tax revenue (as is alsothe case for state government), the outlookfor local government budgets remains bleak.The deficit is likely to reach a record high in
2010 and, as yet, there are no signs of amajor decline in 2011 either. Although totalrevenue from taxes and from state govern-ment general grants that are linked to thelevel of tax revenue is forecast to increaseagain, from today’s perspective, this will be atleast virtually offset by the expected con-tinued growth in expenditure, particularly inthe areas of social benefits, other operatingexpenditure and personnel expenditure.Local government fiscal

10Securities markets
Bond market
In August 2010, the issue volume in the Ger-
man bond market stood at 397.9 billion in
gross terms (compared with 3105.3 billion in
the previous month). After deducting re-
demptions and taking account of changes
in issuers’ holdings of their own bonds, the
volume of outstanding domestic bonds in-
creased by 314.3 billion, compared with a
reduction of 333.6 billion in July. Foreign debt
securities on the German bond market worth
32.1 billion were sold; euro-denominated debt
securities accounted for the majority of these
sales. Therefore, the total outstanding vol-
ume of bonds in Germany rose by 316.4 bil-
lion.
In August, the public sector raised 312.4 bil-
lion in the capital market. This was attribut-
able almost exclusively to central govern-
ment. On balance, it issued mainly two-year
Federal Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze) worth 36.7
billion and ten-year Federal bonds (Bunds)
for34.8 billion. To a lesser extent, Federal
Treasury discount paper (Bubills: 30.7 billion),
30-year Federal bonds ( 30.3 billion) and five-
year Federal notes (Bobls: 30.2 billion) were
also sold. By contrast, Federal savings notes
worth 30.2 billion net were redeemed. In the
month under review, the German L/C228nder only
tapped the bond market to a marginal ex-
tent.
German credit institutions increased their
capital market debt by 32.6 billion in August.
On balance, they issued more other bankdebt securities which can be structured par-
ticularly flexibly ( 37.0 billion), and, to a lesser
extent, also mortgage Pfandbriefe ( 30.8 bil-
lion). By contrast, there were net redemptions
of debt securities from specialised credit insti-
tutions and public Pfandbriefe ( 33.2 billion
and32.0 billion respectively).
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises
redeemed bonds totalling 30.7 billion, com-
pared with 31.2 billion in July. These were all
bonds with a maturity of less than one year.
Foreign investors were the sole net pur-
chasers in the German bond market in Au-
gust, adding debt securities with a total value
of319.7 billion to their portfolios. By con-
trast, both domestic credit institutions and
domestic non-banks reduced their holdings
(by31.9 billion and 31.3 billion respectively).
While credit institutions primarily sold foreign
securities in net terms, non-banks only sold
domestic bonds.
Equity market
In the month under review, domestic enter-
prises, most of which were non-listed com-
panies, issued 30.1 billion worth of new
shares in the German equity market. The out-
standing amount of foreign shares in the Ger-
man market also increased by 30.1 billion.
Domestic credit institutions were the only net
buyers of equities ( 32.5 billion), while domes-
tic non-banks and foreign investors sold
shares in net terms ( 31.7 billion and 30.7 bil-
lion respectively).Sales of debt

11Mutual fund shares
Domestic mutual funds sold shares totalling
39.5 billion net in August (July 2010: 36.8 bil-
lion). Of this amount, 38.4 billion in net terms
flowed to specialised funds reserved for insti-
tutional investors. Of the funds open to the
public, especially mixed securities funds ( 30.4
billion) but also mixed funds ( 30.2 billion),
money market funds and share-based funds
(each 30.1 billion) attracted inflows. By con-
trast, bond-based funds and open-end real
estate funds recorded small outflows of 30.1
billion each. During the reporting period, for-
eign funds traded in the German market sold
shares totalling 33.0 billion. Domestic non-
banks were virtually the sole net purchasers,
adding shares worth 312.7 billion to their
portfolios. Domestic credit institutions ac-
quired mutual fund units worth 30.4 billion.
By contrast, foreign investors sold mutual
fund shares ( 30.6 billion net).
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus – in unadjusted terms – of 34.6 billion in
August 2010. The result was thus 34.5 billion
down on the level of the previous month.
This was mainly due to a decrease in the
trade surplus. There was also a slight increase
in the deficit on invisible current transactions,
which comprise services, income and current
transfers.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, in August the foreign
trade surplus was down by 34.5 billion on themonth to 39.0 billion. After adjustment for
seasonal and calendar variations, it decreased
by31.0 billion to 311.7 billion. The value of
exports recorded a marginal fall (-0.4%)
while the value of imports grew slightly
(+0.9%). Nevertheless, seasonally adjusted
nominal exports for July and August com-
bined were 3.0% above the second-quarter
average. During the same period, imports
rose by 3.4%.
In August, the deficit in invisible current
transactions expanded from 33.1 billion to
33.3 billion. The changes recorded in all three
sub-accounts were relatively modest. The def-
icit on services rose by a total of 30.1 billion
to33.1 billion. In this context, increased net
expenditure on foreign travel due to the holi-
day period was offset by countermovementsSales and purchases

12in other categories. The surplus in cross-
border income was down on the month
(from 33.5 billion in July to 33.2 billion in the
reporting month). By contrast, the deficit in
current transfers declined by 30.2 billion to
33.4 billion.
With respect to cross-border portfolio invest-
ment, there were net capital imports of 313.2
billion in August, compared with net capital
outflows of 35.0 billion in July. The main rea-
son for this was that foreign portfolio invest-
ors greatly increased their investments in Ger-
many ( 318.4 billion). On balance, they fo-
cused exclusively on the purchase of German
debt securities ( 319.7 billion), primarily in the
form of public bonds and notes ( 311.3 bil-
lion). Conversely, they sold small quantities of
equities and mutual fund shares. Resident
investors acquired foreign securities in the
amount of 35.2 billion, with mutual fund
shares ( 33.0 billion) and debt securities ( 32.1
billion) accounting for the lion’s share of
these purchases.
As regards direct investment, there were like-
wise net capital inflows ( 34.6 billion) in Au-
gust. On balance, these were solely attribut-
able to transactions by German firms, which
withdrew funds from their foreign affiliates
(34.6 billion). This was largely accomplished
by means of intra-group credit transactions
(38.7 billion). By contrast, they supplied their
foreign subsidiaries with funds through add-
itional equity capital ( 31.2 billion) and re-
invested earnings ( 32.9 billion). At the same
time, on balance, foreign firms made hardly
any changes to the capitalisation of their Ger-
man affiliates.Major items of the balance

18Germany in the financial and economic
crisis
At the onset of the financial crisis in summer
2007, no-one could have foreseen that, little
more than a year later, it would become the
biggest global economic crisis in the post-war
period, placing the euro area under severe
pressure. Conversely, at the height of the tur-
moil in the latter part of 2008 and first part
of 2009, no-one would have expected not
only the global economy but also, and above
all, the German economy, which was particu-
larly hard hit by the worldwide downturn, to
recover as quickly as they have since the
second quarter of 2009. Against this back-
drop, this edition of the Monthly Report takes
a closer look at economic developments in
Germany during the financial and economic
crisis, focusing on the financial system, the
macroeconomic setting – in particular, the
remarkable developments on the labour
market – and, in light of the extensive eco-
nomic policy measures implemented to com-
bat the crisis, public finances.
One of the salient features of a financial crisis
is the dramatic loss of confidence in the func-
tioning of central markets and in the solvency
of the market players. This is illustrated in the
current crisis by the premium that banks de-
mand of each other on the interbank market
for uncollateralised over collateralised debt
(see chart on page 19). The financial crisis
was preceded by a phase of extremely favour-
able financing conditions and a high propen-
sity to take risks. In some countries this fos-
tered an unsustainable asset price increase
that led to high private sector debt and excessdomestic demand. The financial crisis may be
divided accordingly into three crisis phases.
These phases begin in August 2007, Septem-
ber 2008 and May 2010 respectively, and
mark three key events, namely the outbreak
of the subprime crisis in the USA, the collapse
of US investment bank Lehman Brothers and
the escalation of the government debt crisis
in the euro area.
Upturn continued initially, despite
financial crisis
Although the financial crisis was triggered by
the turmoil on the US subprime market, the
banking system, as the direct or indirect hold-
er of structured bond products backed by
subprime mortgages, quickly found itself at
the epicentre of the crisis, worldwide. Con-
siderable gaps and weaknesses in the regula-
tory framework were thereby exposed. Risk
aversion among financial market participants
surged, fuelled by growing uncertainty about
the true extent of liquidity and solvency risks
in the banking sector; as a result, in August
2007, the interbank markets witnessed at
times substantial tensions and a rise in risk
premiums on a broad front. The spillover of
the crisis to Germany can mainly be explained
by the fact that, when the crisis broke out,
isolated German credit institutions affected
had reached the brink of collapse. In the euro
area, the Eurosystem responded with a gen-
erous provision of liquidity and a stronger
focus on longer-term refinancing operations
and so prevented liquidity shortages from
having a destabilising effect on the financial
system as a whole.Three-phase

19As the financial market turmoil spread and
the loss of confidence accelerated in theglobal financial markets, the problems facingthe international banking system were fur-ther aggravated during the course of 2008.Financial market prices fell more and morerapidly, write-downs on structured productsrose and heavy losses were posted in the de-rivatives business, so that attention becameprogressively more focused on insolvencyrisks, particularly as the hitherto robust globaleconomy grew increasingly weak. In manycountries, including Germany, the situation ofmore banks became so critical that they hadto be rescued through government supportmeasures or be taken over by institutionswith sounder balance sheets than their own.
In the euro area, this generous provision of li-
quidity went hand-in-hand, in this phase,with a tightening of the monetary policystance. With that, the Eurosystem respondedto growing price risks as a consequence ofthe, at first, still robust economy and a pro-nounced rise in commodity prices, whichpushed the price of oil above US$140 at itspeak. At this time, the German economy wasin a favourable situation. Following successfulchanges to the production structure in previ-ous years, the German economy benefitedfrom the strong demand for capital goodsand durable consumer goods, notably fromthe rapidly growing emerging market econ-omies. Corporate profits reached recordlevels, capacities were expanded and the la-bour market picked up again noticeably,driven by a combination of strong economicstimuli and previously implemented structuralreforms. Employment reached a new all-timehigh as a result and, for the first time in dec-
ades, unemployment fell below its low pointin the previous upswing. Since domestic eco-nomic growth remained subdued, high cur-rent account surpluses were recorded. In thesecond and third quarters of 2008, therewere growing signs that the upswing in Ger-many would be terminated by the slowdownin global economic activity and rising infla-tionary pressures.

20economic output in the second and third
quarters of 2008 stayed in line with normal
cyclical fluctuations.
The public finance situation in Germany re-
ceived a pronounced boost from the steep in-
crease in output, and from a fiscal policy that
remained geared to consolidation until 2007.
Whereas in 2005, the general government
deficit in relation to GDP was still above the
3% ceiling, a slight surplus was recorded in
both 2007 and 2008.
Into the most severe post-war downturn –
and out again
The Lehman Brothers insolvency and the
near-collapse of the US insurer AIG in Sep-
tember 2008 dramatically heightened the
global financial crisis which, by that point at
the latest, turned into a systemic crisis. Im-
portant markets ground to a halt, stock prices
plummeted, investors fled to the safe haven
of government bonds, and for a while the en-
tire banking system was on the verge of col-
lapse. Around the world, monetary and fiscal
policymakers took extensive and far-reaching
countermeasures to prevent the breakdown
of the international financial system and con-
tain negative feedback effects between the
stricken financial system and the accelerating
global economic downturn.
The Eurosystem responded by significantly
easing the monetary policy stance and intro-
ducing a number of unconventional liquidity
policy measures. The price outlook and the
noticeably declining inflation expectationsjustified repeated key interest rate cuts, refi-
nancing operations were conducted as fixed-
rate tenders with full allotment of all bids, the
average maturity of refinancing operations
was extended by additional longer-term op-
erations, and the range of eligible collateral
was broadened. Moreover, in the second
quarter of 2009, the Eurosystem launched a
covered bond purchase programme which
was limited to one year and to a volume of
360 billion. This programme was for the pur-
chase of covered bonds, which include Ger-
man Pfandbriefe, and sought to revive the
market for such bonds given their importance
for bank funding.
In Germany, the Federal Government and a
banking syndicate provided extensive liquidity
support to Hypo Real Estate, a German mort-
gage bank that was threatened by insolvency,
before the bank was ultimately taken into
public ownership in mid-2009. Additionally,
to prevent a general bank run, the govern-
ment in early October 2008 issued a guaran-
tee in respect of all private savings deposits.
The German Financial Market Stabilisation
Fund (SoFFin), created in mid-October 2008,
played a central role in ensuring that the fi-
nancial system continued to function. This
fund was endowed with a total of 3480 bil-
lion for granting guarantees for bank debt se-
curities, recapitalisation measures and the re-
moval of impaired assets from banks’ balance
sheets.
Furthermore, in late 2008 and early 2009, the

sive fiscal stimulus packages that were de-
signed to boost domestic economic activity... but petered

21by way of tax and social contribution cuts,
higher transfers, additional public investmentand incentives such as the car scrappage pre-mium. To ward off fears of a credit crunch,the government also launched a credit guar-antee scheme or “Germany Fund”.
Such a decisive fiscal policy response was jus-
tified by the severity of the crisis and playedan important part in stabilising the economyand the financial system. However, the pre-cise form and implementation of the fiscalstimulus packages, which, in part, must beviewed critically, also highlighted the prob-lems associated with attempts to macro-manage the economy. The general govern-ment deficit rose to 3.0% of GDP in 2009,while the debt-to-GDP ratio climbed fromroughly 66% in 2008 to 73
1/C252%. In addition,
significant risks were assumed under govern-ment guarantees.
Large-scale monetary and fiscal policy initia-
tives were launched in other countries, too,to stabilise the financial markets and the realeconomy. Moreover, intensive debate wasconducted at the international level, notablyamong the main industrial countries andemerging markets (G20), about the need foreconomic policy harmonisation and the formit should take. Despite the swift counter-measures taken by monetary and fiscal pol-icymakers, global economic activity collapsedin the last quarter of 2008 and the first quar-ter of 2009. The manufacturing sector andworld trade bore the brunt of the impact.Given German industry’s extensive inter-national links, it was hardly surprising that ofthe major, advanced economies, Germanywas hit particularly hard. In the two above-
mentioned quarters, output fell by a total of5
1/C252%. As a result, real GDP in the first three
months of 2009 was a calendar-adjusted6
1/C252% below the previous year’s figure.
The decline in economic output was concen-
trated, above all, on exports and on invest-ment in machinery and equipment. Privateconsumption, on the other hand, proved tobe a stabilising factor. Thus, an abrupt coun-terswing followed on the heels of the preced-ing upturn during which exports had benefit-ed to a particular extent from the strength ofglobal economic growth.
The exceptional resilience of the German la-
bour market played a decisive role in stabilis-ing private consumption. The export-orientedsectors, which were especially hard hit by theglobal slump in demand, experienced an ap-preciable reduction in employment. Yet thedecline proved to be considerably less steepthan the severity of the economic slumpmight have suggested. This relatively benignadjustment was made possible by the exten-sive use, by companies, of in-house agree-ments on flexible working hours and short-time work, collective pay deals geared pri-marily to safeguarding jobs and the accept-ance of sharp rises in unit labour costs. Whatis more, the decline in employment in theexport-dependent sectors was counterbal-anced by a sustained rise in employment indomestically-oriented sectors. Overall, em-ployment declined little and unemploymenthardly rose at all.Fiscal policy

22Once German economic output stabilised at
a low level in the second of quarter of 2009,
economic activity gradually regained its foot-
ing. Besides the robust labour market situ-
ation and the fact that global economic re-
covery had got underway, a further important
factor was that, despite the massive drop in
earnings in the banking system, transitory
fears of a broad-based credit crunch did not
materialise. Enterprises were able for the
most part to continue covering their substan-
tially reduced funding needs through the
banking system or alternative financing chan-
nels. At the beginning of 2010, the pace of
economic growth then picked up and, to-
gether with weather-related special factors,
led to an exceptionally strong rise in output in
the second quarter, when new financial mar-
ket turbulences loomed on the horizon.
Government debt crisis in the euro area
Towards the end of 2009, investors and rat-
ing agencies were increasingly turning their
attention to the financial risks that the gov-
ernment sector worldwide, but particularly in
some euro-area countries, had already in-
curred or was likely to incur. The default risk
of these countries’ government debt secur-
ities, which until then had been considered
safe, was valued anew on a more differenti-
ated basis. As a result, intra-euro-area yield
spreads widened significantly to the detri-
ment, above all, of several countries on the
euro-area periphery. In Greece, which had
previously pursued an irresponsible budgetary
policy and had tried to conceal this, in part,
by statistical window-dressing, the situationescalated dramatically and the country’s abil-
ity to tap the capital markets was very much
endangered. In April 2010, a financial assist-
ance package subject to stringent condition-
ality was subsequently assembled for Greece
with the participation of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), but it did not dispel in-
vestors’ concerns. The erosion of confidence
came to a head on the second May weekend
in 2010, when the markets for government
bonds of countries on the periphery of the
euro area threatened in some cases to dry up.
To stop the situation from escalating further,
extensive stabilisation efforts were embarked
upon. Again with the participation of the IMF,
fiscal policymakers put together a preventive
rescue shield with a volume of up to 3750 bil-
lion, which has not yet been availed of. The
Governing Council of the ECB decided to re-
introduce selected non-standard monetary
policy measures and launch a programme for
the purchase of public and private sector
debt instruments. These measures had the
effect of preventing a crisis situation; never-
theless, tensions in the bond markets of the
euro-area peripheral countries persisted.
In contrast with the previous phase of the fi-
nancial crisis, the renewed turmoil had a rela-
tively small impact on the financial markets
and, above all, on the global economy. Al-
though financial market uncertainty re-
mained high, it was nothing like the situation
in the autumn of 2008. And although growth
dynamics are expected to be more muted
during the remainder of the current year, the
economic recovery both worldwide and in
Germany has remained intact so far and is
likely to continue. The necessary fundamentalRecovery from

23economic adjustments have only just begun
in many countries, and the resulting dampen-
ing effects have been obscured by the expan-
sionary stance of fiscal policy. However, since
endogenous forces of growth are gaining in
momentum, there is no reason to fear a re-
newed downturn. It should be emphasised all
the more strongly that credible fiscal consoli-
dation is now indispensable; a loss in confi-
dence in the sustainability of public finances
would have a much more serious impact than
the potentially short-term dampening effect
of a deficit reduction.
Real GDP in Germany is likely to rise by more
than 3% in 2010 year on year. Even the very
low, crisis-induced trough in employment has
bottomed out in the meantime, and un-
employment is about to drop below pre-crisis
levels. What is more, the importance of do-
mestic demand for economic development is
steadily increasing. The general government
deficit will probably not rise as strongly as ini-
tially feared, and should stay well below the
4% mark for 2010 as a whole, whereas the
debt ratio is expected to rise substantially
owing, above all, to the support measures for
the financial system. In this context, Germany
is benefiting from a very low interest rate
level, which is based on the high level of con-
fidence in the sustainability of the country’s
public finances and probably also in the over-
all economic outlook.
Lessons learned from the crisis
Despite, in some cases, substantial turmoil in
the German banking system, Germany has sofar coped well with the financial and eco-
nomic crisis compared with other countries.
There are two main reasons for this. First,
thanks not least to far-reaching reforms im-
plemented in the preceding years, the Ger-
man economy was in good shape when the
crisis broke out, and was not troubled by ser-
ious imbalances in domestic economic activ-
ities, as other countries were. Second, the
German government was able to play a
major part in stabilising the real economy and
the financial system – not only with regard to
Germany itself but also to the euro area as a
whole, for which Germany proved to be a
stabilising factor; this was possible because
belief in the long-term robustness of Germa-
ny’s public finances remained strong even
though the fiscal balance had worsened rad-
ically.
Against this backdrop, what are the tasks
now facing economic policy? One central
challenge lies in strengthening the resilience
of the financial system to future crises. Al-
though many details still need to be clarified
with regard to this reform agenda, which for
good reason is being internationally coordin-
ated, it is already clear that the German bank-
ing system will have to strengthen its capital
base, and that a fundamental restructuring is
called for in some market segments. Both
these tasks should be tackled resolutely.
During the crisis, previously implemented la-
bour market reforms, in particular, paid off
handsomely. It would therefore be a mistake
to reverse the reforms, which has already
happened in isolated cases. Instead, the suc-
cess achieved so far should act as a spur toReal GDP up by

24continue along the present path and tackle
the problems that remain, for example in the
area of long-term unemployment. Along with
measures designed, for instance, to promote
further liberalisation in various service sectors,
this would give an important boost to domes-
tic economic growth forces. This is all the
more necessary as the more sustainable
global economic growth aimed for is likely to
be less dynamic than before the crisis, and
will drive German output less strongly in
future. Although the German economy is, on
the whole, well positioned to tackle the chal-
lenges associated with its extensive integra-
tion in world trade, and Germany will for the
time being continue to post current account
surpluses, not least given the demographic
burdens it faces, domestic sources of growth
are therefore likely to rise in importance in
future.
In the field of public finances, finally, the fiscal
room for manoeuvre to deal with new chal-
lenges needs to be restored. To this end, it
will be necessary to rapidly reduce the high
structural deficit and quickly rein in the soar-
ing debt ratio and the risks from guarantees
in order to strengthen confidence in public fi-
nances on a lasting basis. Fiscal rules have a
key role to play in this context. At the nation-al level, an ambitious fiscal rule has been cre-
ated in the shape of the debt brake, the bind-
ing nature of which will need to be demon-
strated in the coming years. At the European
level – in the light of the debt crisis – one cen-
tral objective for Germany especially is to
tighten and supplement the existing fiscal
framework in order to place European mon-
etary union on a sounder fiscal footing going
forward.
As long as euro-area countries continue to be
responsible for their own national fiscal pol-
icy, rigorous compliance with the agreed
budgetary rules has to be ensured so as to
obviate the future need for support measures
to ward off the danger of serious repercus-
sions. As a last resort, the restructuring of a
country’s sovereign debt should also be an
option on the basis of a suitable framework
in conjunction with financial market regula-
tion that supports financial market stability. In
addition, wider macroeconomic surveillance
might help to identify severe distortions and
imbalances earlier. Notwithstanding a pos-
sible role for carefully targeted government
intervention in exceptional economic circum-
stances, ongoing macro-management of the
economy is neither promising nor advisable –
both at national and international level.German

25The financial system
In Germany, as elsewhere, the financial crisis initially hit banks hardest, while other parts of the
financial system were not affected until later or were affected only indirectly. Mounting risk aver-sion, the economic slowdown and a more pessimistic view of financial institutions did not, forinstance, cause a massive stock market slump until 2008, whereas the German bond marketbenefited from portfolio shifts out of the worst-hit investments into German government bonds,which are considered safe and liquid. Most recently, this has been the case during the euro sover-eign debt crisis.
The financial and economic crisis has weighed very heavily on the German banking system and
ruthlessly exposed its weaknesses. Nevertheless, the nature and size of its impact differed consid-erably from one bank or category of banks to another and over time: at the beginning of thecrisis, large, international credit institutions with direct exposure to the US real-estate market andto related structured products and those with a large proportion of wholesale funding tended tobe affected. As the financial crisis developed into an economic crisis from the autumn of 2008onwards, other banks with a more domestic focus were increasingly hit as well. Nevertheless, thelosses incurred by the German banking system in 2008 and 2009 can be attributed to a compara-tively small number of larger institutions. The German banking system as a whole proved resili-ent. As the financial crisis lengthened, fears were awakened of negative feedback from the fi-nancial system to the real economy and ultimately a broad-based credit crunch, but they provedunfounded in Germany. The decline in bank lending to non-financial corporations that was ob-served during the financial crisis was mainly cyclical in nature. Moreover, enterprises were able totap alternative sources of external and internal funding even during the crisis.
Economic policy was vital in containing the crisis. Besides the support measures adopted by mon-
etary and fiscal policymakers worldwide, in Germany the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund(SoFFin) was created and a deposit guarantee provided by the government; moreover, the gov-ernment contributed to the aid measures to avert the euro-area government debt crisis. Nowthat the situation has been stabilised, it is important quickly to eliminate the weaknesses in theGerman banking system that were exposed during the crisis. Besides strengthening the capitalbase and implementing the forthcoming regulatory reform, this is likely to require adjustments tothe market structure.

26Capital markets
Stock markets
At the beginning of the financial crisis in the
summer of 2007, the German stock market
was in relatively good shape. Unlike during
the New Economy bubble, there were no ser-
ious excesses in the run-up to the crisis; the
price-earnings ratio was roughly at the aver-
age level of the preceding years. Moreover,
global economic growth was robust, and
German enterprises’ profit expectations were
moving up. Stock market prices in Germany
therefore did not ease much initially in
response to the turmoil on the money and
credit markets and recovered quickly.
At the beginning of 2008, however, the inter-
national equity markets experienced a strong
downward movement, which spread to Ger-
many. This was triggered mainly by concerns
that the economic slowdown in the United
States as a result of the housing and financial
crisis could prove stronger than expected. As
prices fell, market players’ uncertainty over
further price developments rose sharply. This
is evident in the fact that the VDAX-NEW al-
most doubled in the space of a month.1Dur-
ing this phase, rate cuts by the US central
bank helped stabilise the markets. Nonethe-
less, at the beginning of September 2008,
the CDAX was down 23% compared with its
level of mid-2007.
The second serious shockwave to hit the
stock market was triggered by the collapse of
the US investment bank Lehman Brothers.
From mid-September 2008 onwards, stockmarkets all over the world suffered massive
losses within a very short space of time.2The
financial sector was particularly hard hit, with
financials falling much more rapidly than the
overall market, as concerns about the state of
the financial sector spread and market players
were not ruling out more insolvencies of fi-
nancial institutions. In addition, the combin-
ation of the financial crisis and distinctly
gloomier prospects for the real economy
heightened investors’ risk aversion.
Stock market prices in Germany, which was
particularly badly affected by the global eco-
nomic downturn given its many external
trade links, slipped right into the first quarter
of 2009. As government stimulus programmes
and aid for the financial sector as well as cen-
tral bank measures increasingly took effect,
stock market losses were eventually halted.
All in all, German securities (as measured by
the CDAX) fell some 58% between mid-2007
and the low of March 2009; banks, in particu-
lar, suffered disproportionately large losses. In
terms of the CDAX’s market capitalisation,
more than 3800 billion in wealth was des-
troyed in this period. Unlike in the United
States, equity prices in Germany fell less this
time than after the New Economy bubble
burst at the start of the new millennium and
prices plummeted more than 70%.3
1The VDAX-NEW index measures the implied volatility of
options on the DAX and can be interpreted as a measure
for market players’ uncertainty.
2Over the space of 31 trading days, the CDAX lost just
over 32%, which equates to a loss of wealth of 3360 bil-
lion in terms of market capitalisation. The global loss of
wealth over this period, in terms of the global equity
index constructed by Thomson Reuters, works out at
more than 371/C252trillion.

pression in the 1930s saw worse stock price declines

staged a broad-based recovery, which waslargely driven by expectations of an end tothe recession. Nonetheless, market playerswere still concerned that the incipient recov-ery might not prove self-sustaining and was,possibly, only based on the support measurestaken by governments and central banks.German equity prices were driven higher, inparticular, by enterprises’ earnings prospects.Since March 2009, analysts have raised their12-month earnings forecasts for the 30 DAXenterprises by an average of 46% as the eco-nomic outlook has improved.
4The price-
earnings ratio is currently below its five-yearmean – despite a stock market rise by 58%since March 2009. That, like the higher riskpremiums demanded for holding equity, indi-cates that investors are taking a comparative-ly cautious stance.
Comparing stock market developments in
Germany during the financial crisis and otherindustrialised countries yields a largely similarpicture during both the slump and the recov-ery, which underscores the global nature ofthe crisis and the close market integration.The CDAX is currently trading some 32%lower than at the end of June 2007. It hastherefore underperformed the US S&P 500index (-25%), but outperformed the EuroStoxx (-39%) and the Japanese Nikkei (-48%)over the total period under review. Germanstocks are currently benefiting from theglobal recovery and the improved economicoutlook for Germany.

28in all, they have issued 347 billion worth
of shares since mid-2007. Credit institutions,
which were particularly interested in strength-
ening their capital base in response to the
crisis, account for roughly a third of this
total. They also used funds supplied by SoFFin
(361/C252billion). Overall, 39 companies have
been floated since mid-2007.
Bond markets
German government bond yields experienced
volatility but, on balance, fell sharply during
the financial crisis. Various factors were at
work, in particular expectations about future
economic growth and inflation as well as the
movement of funds into investments con-
sidered particularly safe and liquid. Thus,
Bund yields rose in the first halves of both
2007 and 2008, when the outlook for the
real economy was still viewed positively. As
the German economy slid into recession in
the second half of 2008, and particularly
after the collapse of US investment bank Leh-
man Brothers, yields on ten-year bonds out-
standing fell smartly – from more than 41/C252%
to around 3%. The fact that the Eurosystem
lowered key interest rates by 31/C254percentage
points between the fourth quarter of 2008
and the second quarter of 2009 was probably
a major factor.
Inflation expectations for a ten-year horizon
roughly followed the pattern of growth ex-
pectations and therefore also contributed to
the yield moves outlined above. Up until mid-
2008, high capacity utilisation and rising
commodity prices meant they were towards
the top of the Eurosystem’s stability target. Asthe financial crisis intensified and oil prices
fell, they declined in the second half of 2008
and have remained below their 2007 levels
ever since.
Moreover, market players regard German
government bonds as a safe haven invest-
ment, making them particularly popular in
times of crisis. This is reflected in compara-
tively low risk premiums. Price markups for
higher liquidity are another factor in securities
yields. In times when market players are very
unsettled, demand-related changes in liquid-
ity and risk premiums tend, historically, to
contribute to falling Bund yields. This was
also the case during the financial crisis, when
appetite for risk5plummeted and, with finan-
cial markets frozen, liquidity temporarily be-
came the decisive criterion for portfolio invest-
ment. During this period, German govern-
ment paper once again proved a safe haven.
However, it is difficult to put an exact figure
on the effects the various factors have on
Bund yields as the premiums cannot be distin-
guished individually. The significance of vari-
ous factors related to safe haven and liquidity
effects can be estimated using factor analysis,
however (see the box on pages 30 and 31).
When investors and rating agencies at the
end of 2009 turned their sights to the finan-
cial risks assumed by the government sector,
intra-euro-area yield spreads widened sharply.
The crisis of confidence peaked in the second
weekend of May 2010, when it looked as

29though some markets would dry up, and
wide-ranging government stabilisation meas-ures became necessary. Although a collapseof the financial system was averted, the bondmarkets of the euro-area countries affectedremained tense. The resulting “flight” intothe quality and liquidity of German govern-ment bonds sent yields sharply lower again inthe spring and summer of this year. At theend of August, ten-year Bund yields tempor-arily marked a record low of less than 2.1%.Supply-side factors, such as the strong in-crease in Bunds in circulation, had no discern-ible impact on yields.
Issuers of non-government debt encountered
considerable tensions on the German bondmarket during the financial and economic cri-sis. This is true of banks and enterprises alike.At times, placements were virtually impos-sible. The German Pfandbrief market alsosuffered, partly because issuers suspendedmarket making, which considerably reducedPfandbrief liquidity. With the collapse of Leh-man Brothers, interest rate spreads on Pfand-briefe shot up compared to Bunds of thesame maturity.
Besides market players’ declining risk aversion
in 2009, another positive influence on themarket for private bonds was the Eurosys-tem’s Covered Bonds Purchase Programme.Since it was announced at the beginning ofMay 2009, it has helped lower spreads acrossthe entire maturity spectrum. On the second-ary market, the spreads on Pfandbriefe with aremaining time to maturity of three years ver-sus Bunds narrowed from 104 to 68 basispoints between 7 May 2009 and end-Febru-ary 2010. However, as concerns about the
sustainability of some euro-area peripheralcountries’ debt spiked, the covered bondmarkets also suffered a setback – especiallyoutside of Germany. At the end of Septem-ber – ie after the programme expired in thesummer of 2010 – spreads on German Pfand-briefe with three years left to maturity were,on balance, still 16 basis points lower thanbefore the programme was announced lastBond market

30Deuts che Bun desbankYiel ds on Bun ds un der safe haven effe cts
The sharp decline in yiel ds on German government 
bon ds (Bun ds) durin g the ﬁ  nan cial crisis is often asso ci-
ate d with safe haven ﬂ  ows. It is assume d that investors, 
in an environment of hi gh un certainty, in creasin gly sol d 
riskier ﬁ  nan cial se curities su ch as equities while steppin g 
up their deman d for government bon ds. Moreover, it is 
argued that risky government bon ds were su bstitute d 
by government paper entailin g less risk as the govern-
ment debt crisis intensiﬁ  ed. In the former case, share 
pri ce losses shoul d generally be linke d to fallin g bon d 
yiel ds; in the latter case, the developments of yiel ds on 
government bon ds of different credit quality shoul d be 
inversely correlate d. 
Factor model to analyse government bond yields and 
returns on shares
In or der to isolate simultaneous effe cts durin g the 
ﬁ nan cial crisis in an e conometri c stu dy an d to mo del the 
dynami cs in the international ﬁ  nan cial markets, a fa ctor 
mo del is applie d.1 One a dvanta ge of the fa ctor analysis is 
that uno bserve d common fa ctors can be extra cted. The 
factor analysis is base d on a dataset whi ch contains daily 
chan ges in yiel ds on government bon ds with a ten-year 
maturity an d daily returns of benchmark sto ck in dices. 
The analysis looks at the euro-area mem ber states as 
well as Japan, Switzerlan d, the Unite d States an d the 
Unite d Kin gdom. The perio d of o bservation runs from 
January 2003 to the en d of Au gust 2010.2 Durin g this 
perio d the performan ce of bon d yiel ds an d share pri ces 
can be explaine d by three common fa ctors.
Interpretation of the factors and the safe haven effects
A positive relationship exists between the ﬁ  rst fa ctor an d 
both declinin g bon d yiel ds an d share pri ce losses. This is consistent with classi cal portfolio a djustments a gainst 
the backdrop of the general e conomi c situation. For 
instan ce, equities are sol d an d government bon ds are 
bou ght when lar gely ne gative expe ctations with re gard 
to e conomi c developments or hi gh risk aversion pre dom-
inate. The ﬁ  rst fa ctor can therefore be interprete d as the 
global risk fa ctor. It is pro bably also closely relate d to the 
business cycle. Equity pri ce losses an d increasin g yiel ds on 
government bon ds of all countries are positively linke d 
with the se con d fa ctor. Thus, the se con d fa ctor seems 
to reﬂ  ect the (lon ger-term) ﬁ  nan cing con ditions. The 
thir d fa ctor has a greater impa ct on government bon d 
yiel ds than on equity pri ces. It is strikin g, moreover, that 
the thir d fa ctor is positively correlate d with chan ges in 
yiel ds on government bon ds of the euro-area peripheral 
countries, while it is ne gatively correlate d with chan ges 
in yiel ds on government bon ds of countries not dire ctly 
affe cted by the government debt crisis. This su ggests 
that risk aspe cts linke d to the extent of pu blic debt in 
the euro-area peripheral countries play a decisive role. 
Thus, the fa ctor reﬂ  ects a hi gher debt risk emanatin g 
from these countries.
Decomposing Bund yields
The three fa ctors can be use d to explain 94 % of the 
variation of yiel ds on Bun ds.3 67 % of the variation is 
accounte d for by the global risk component alone, a 
further 20 % by ﬁ nan cing con ditions an d 7% by the risk 
of government debt. A bout 6 % can be explaine d by vari-
able-spe ciﬁ c fa ctors. 
The chart on pa ge 31 shows the contri bution that the 
three fa ctors have ma de to Bun d yiel d performan ce sin ce

in both risk fa ctors has the effe ct of lowerin g German 
yiel ds owin g to the un derlyin g safe haven effe cts, an d 
deterioratin g ﬁ nan cing con ditions cause them to rise. 
When the U S su bprime crisis broke out in mi d-2007, 
global risk in crease d, sen ding yiel ds on Bun ds down. This 
development was intensiﬁ  ed by the events of autumn 
2008 (insolven cy of Lehman Brothers, massive cyclical 
downturn). Thus, the sharp rise in per ceive d risk an d in 
risk aversion in the wake of the ﬁ  nan cial crisis, whi ch 
may be en capsulate d in the “ global risk” fa ctor, can be 
seen as the main driver of the decline in Bun d yiel ds in 
this phase. At times, this safe haven effe ct playe d a part 
in Bun d yiel ds fallin g by just short of 2.2 per centa ge 
points. Moreover, at the en d of 2008, the “ government 
debt risk” rose; this pro cess a ccelerate d consi dera bly at 
the turn of the year 2009/2010. Owin g to the “ govern-
ment debt risk” alone, yiel ds in Germany have re ceded 
by almost 0.7 per centa ge point sin ce the beginnin g of 
this year. Compare d with these two fa ctors, the effe ct 
of the “ﬁ  nan cing con ditions” fa ctor on the yiel d on ten-
year Bun ds is currently relatively small. The Bun d yiel d 
was driven hi gher in the course of 2008, when it became 
clear what a vast burden the ﬁ  nan cial an d economi c 
crisis woul d impose on pu blic-se ctor budgets; this in turn 
gave investors cause for con cern. Developments at that 
time are also reﬂ  ected in the yiel d curve, whi ch steep-
ene d noti ceably. Propensity to invest in lon ger- date d 
securities was o bviously lower, relatively speakin g, an d 
preferen ce was generally given to shorter- date d paper. 
With re gard to the performan ce of yiel ds on ten-year 
Bun ds, however, this effe ct is more than compensate d by 
the con comitant ﬂ  ight to safe assets.Another si gniﬁ cant fa ctor whi ch cannot be consi dere d 
separately in the empiri cal mo del is pro bably the espe-

32year. In a European comparison, German
Pfandbrief issuers’ funding costs have thus
developed fairly well overall.
As interest rate spreads fell, primary market
activity on the market for covered bonds
picked up. Overall, 3353 billion worth of
covered bank bonds have been issued in the
euro area since the purchase programme was
announced, including 3110 billion worth of
German Pfandbriefe.
Bonds with a government guarantee repre-
sent a special segment of the bond market.
Ailing credit institutions were able to take
up guarantees from SoFFin, which was created
through the Financial Market Stabilisation Act
(Finanzmarktstabilisierungsgesetz )o f1 8O c t o -
ber 2008. At its peak, the volume of guaran-
teed bonds outstanding totalled 3168 billion.
The majority of these bonds are not traded on
the secondary market, as they are held in the
issuing bank’s own portfolio. Bonds traded on
the secondary market currently have a spread
of roughly 40 basis points over matched ma-
turity German government debt.
While German non-financial corporations
lowered their capital market debt on balance
in the second half of 2007 and the first quar-
ter of 2008 when earnings were strong, they
made heavy use of the bond market in the
subsequent phase of the crisis. From the
second quarter of 2008 to the second quarter
of this year, they issued debt securities worth
3410 billion – mainly abroad. After deducting
redemptions, net issuance worked out at
3118 billion, although some debtors with low
credit ratings experienced extremely highmarket spreads in 2008 and 2009, and it was
virtually impossible to place new issues at
times. Given uncertainty about future eco-
nomic developments and more difficult ac-
cess to bank loans for some large enterprises
in particular, these firms were forced increas-
ingly to tap the capital market for the re-
quired funds. Meanwhile, the interest rate
situation for enterprises with an investment
grade rating has eased noticeably.
German banking system
In addition to the Eurosystem’s extensive sta-
bilisation measures, a number of further crisis
measures to support the banking system
were taken in Germany. In response to the
turmoil caused by the Lehman insolvency, the
German government and a banking consor-
tium provided a German mortgage bank fa-
cing insolvency6with copious liquidity aid. In
addition, the German government extended
a guarantee for all private savings deposits at
the beginning of October 2008 in order to
prevent a general bank run. SoFFin, which
was established mid-October, also had a cen-
tral role in stabilising the banking sector. It
has funds of up to 3480 billion at its disposal,
allowing financial institutions to strengthen
their capital base and bridge liquidity short-
ages. In July 2009, the Financial Market Sta-
bilisation Development Act ( Finanzmarktsta-
bilisierungsfortentwicklungsgesetz ) ruled that
certain risk assets could be spun off into a
bad bank to provide balance-sheet relief. Par-
ticipation in these measures is voluntary and

whole, these measures helped keep the Ger-man financial system operational.
Earnings developments in the German
banking system
Although the financial crisis caused a marked
deterioration in earnings in the Germanbanking sector in 2007, a massive earningsslump did not occur until the international fi-nancial crisis intensified in the wake of theLehman insolvency. The German banking in-dustry reported an immense annual pre-taxloss in the 2008 financial year, the first sincestatistics on earnings have been kept. Thepoorer earnings situation was largely the re-sult of considerable valuation losses in propri-etary trading, higher risk provisions andsharply increased losses in financial invest-ment business. The big banks, special pur-pose banks, the Landesbanken and mortgagebanks were worst hit, as individual banks inthese categories suffered very high losses.However, retail banks, which were largely un-scathed by the crisis in 2007 – as economicmomentum was still very robust in Germanyat that time –, also reported significantly lowerpre-tax incomes in the 2008 financial year, al-though results remained positive overall.
In the 2009 financial year, too, German credit
institutions recorded an aggregate pre-taxloss, although it was significantly lower thana year earlier. The very wide-ranging globalgovernment support measures for the finan-cial sector and the extremely expansionarymonetary policy were positive, while thesevere global recession weighed heavily onearnings. Once again, big banks, Landesban-
ken and mortgage banks reported high pre-tax losses, although in some cases muchlower than a year earlier, with some individualbanks again chiefly responsible for the lossesreported in all these banking categories. Bycontrast, all other banking categories – withthe exception of regional banks – posted insome cases considerably higher net incomesbefore taxes.

While the earnings situation at large inter-national German banking groups improvedsignificantly in the first quarter of 2010, notleast as a result of the favourable financialmarket environment and the brightening realeconomic outlook worldwide, earnings mo-mentum slowed noticeably as the govern-ment debt crisis in the euro area intensified inthe second quarter of 2010. This was largelythe result of income from proprietary trading.For full-year 2010, fairly muted, but positiveearnings developments are expected overall.Although risk provisioning will likely still leavea mark given the global recession a year earl-ier, the currently robust real economic devel-opments in Germany should help counteractthis.

7As at 30 September 2010, the government had pro-
vided stabilisation aid totalling 3203.9 billion, of which
just under 86% represented guarantee lines and the re-
mainder capital measures. To date, two credit institutions
have availed themselves of the option of setting up a bad
bank. Moreover, state governments provided several Lan-
desbanken with large-scale recapitalisation funds and
guarantees to protect portfolios of, in particular, struc-
tured securities.

34German banks’ capital base
Although German banks’ earnings situation
came under tremendous pressure during the
financial crisis, the German banking system
simultaneously experienced a perceptible in-
crease in own funds (see table above).
The increase in the average core capital ratio,
which was probably in part also a reaction to
the anticipated increase in regulatory min-
imum capital requirements, was the result,
first, of sharply higher core capital. This devel-
opment can be attributed, amongst other
things, to SoFFin recapitalisation measures as
well as capital injections by public-sector
shareholders, which, though they affected
only seven institutions, in sum significantly
improved the average core capital ratio of thebanking sector as a whole, namely by around
1.6 percentage points as measured against
the current level of risk-weighted assets
(RWA).
Second, risk-weighted assets fell sharply des-
pite the deterioration in internal ratings as a
result of the crisis. This was driven by the sig-
nificant reduction in RWA in the Landesbank
sector by a total of around 21%, which start-
ed at the beginning of 2009. Besides the re-
lief provided by the guarantees extended by
public-sector shareholders, this decline was
brought about mainly by European restructur-
ing requirements and is likely to continue.
The big banks, too, have lowered their RWA
perceptibly since the beginning of 2009,
namely by 8%. By contrast, savings banks
have held their RWA virtually stable since theThe core capital ratio over time*

Balance-sheet clean-up in the Germanbanking sector
According to banking statistics, commercial
banks, Landesbanken, central institutions ofcredit cooperatives and mortgage banks haveslashed their exposure to domestic and for-eign (in particular UK) banks and sharplylowered other foreign assets since end-2008(see chart above). This deleveraging processcan be explained by adjustments made byLandesbanken to meet European restructur-ing requirements, as well as, in particular, thedrying-up of the money markets, the generalretrenchment of the foreign activities con-ducted via international financial centres,which have been expanded significantly in re-
cent years, and by the, in some cases high,risk associated with these assets.
On balance, German banks’ loan holdings
vis-/C224-vis the German private non-banking sec-tor have declined relatively little. However,this masks very heterogeneous developmentsfor the various borrower categories. Loans tonon-financial corporations fell most sharply(see pages 36 and 37).

36steady increase since the beginning of 2009.
Growth momentum for loans to financial cor-
porations was very strong up until mid-2009,
largely because this sector includes banks’
special purpose vehicles and central counter-
parties for secured money market transac-
tions, whose importance has grown with the
financial crisis. Since then, holdings have re-
mained high overall despite volatile monthly
movements.
The financial crisis has also left a deep mark
on the liabilities side of German bank balance
sheets, especially at institutions whose busi-
ness model means that they rely more on
wholesale funding and less on client deposits.
The flight into safe and liquid assets, particu-
larly after the insolvency of Lehman Brothers,
resulted in a pronounced reluctance on thepart of private investors to buy bank debt
securities, as they are not, unlike deposits,
covered by the deposit guarantee scheme,
and even the German Pfandbrief market was
affected. The large volumes of maturing
bank debt securities additionally weighed on
banks’ refinancing. In this environment, the
Eurosystem’s Covered Bonds Purchase Pro-
gramme passed in May 2009 was positive for
the banking sector as a whole – as was the
possibility of applying to SoFFin for govern-
ment guarantees for new bond issues.
On the risk of a credit crunch in the
non-financial corporations sector
Concerns that negative interaction between
the financial system and the real economy
would worsen the crisis arose in the autumn
of 2008, if not earlier, when annual growth in
lending by German banks to domestic non-
financial corporations lost a great deal of mo-
mentum. Specifically, it was feared that the
German economy could experience a credit
crunch, in other words a situation in which
the supply of bank loans is so limited in quan-
titative terms by bank-side factors that it rep-
resents a significant economic risk.12
Finding a method to empirically identify a
thus-defined credit crunch is very difficult,
as demand and supply-side factors in lending
cannot be clearly differentiated retrospective-
ly. In principle, however, several consider-German banks’ loans to

37ations back up the theory that weak lending
to non-financial corporations in Germanyduring the financial crisis can be explained,first and foremost, by the serious real eco-nomic downturn and the higher risk associ-ated with lending in this situation.
One argument against the presence of a
credit crunch is that, according to economet-ric estimates,
13the downward movement in
the annual growth rate of these loans upuntil the current end of the data can be satis-factorily explained by real economic variables(such as growth in real GDP , the investmentratio and the yield spread between corporateand government bonds). Against the back-drop of weak real economic developments,lending was thus not exceptionally weak dur-ing the crisis by historical standards.
The fact that relatively little use was made
of the German government’s loan and debtguarantee programme (drawdown of justover 12% as at end-August 2010) is anotherargument that German enterprises did notface credit constraints across the board. TheBusiness Fund Germany, which the Germangovernment decided to set up at the begin-ning of 2009 in response to the intensifica-tion of the financial crisis and which has atotal size of 3115 billion, is therefore sched-
uled to be phased out at the end of this year.
Developments in credit standardsSurvey data serve to throw more light onto
the credit environment. The Eurosystem’sBank Lending Survey (BLS) looks directly atbanks’ credit supply. According to this survey,stricter credit standards were applied to en-
terprises following the onset of the financialmarket turmoil, after these standards hadbeen eased considerably in the first half of2007.
14The tightening of credit standards
peaked in the first quarter of 2009. This de-velopment subsequently weakened and final-ly halted in the second quarter of 2010.
While the tighter credit standards at the be-
ginning of the crisis mainly resulted frombank-related factors – such as refinancingcosts and balance-sheet restrictions whichare, in the BLS, broken down into costs relat-ing to the capital position, financing condi-tions on the money or bond market, and li-quidity position –, since the third quarter of2008 institutions’ risk perception, in particu-lar their expectations regarding general eco-nomic activity and industry or firm-specificfactors, has increasingly played a central role.A more detailed analysis of the significance ofbank-side factors shows that during the fi-nancial crisis they temporarily had a signifi-cant impact on credit developments, but thatthis effect was of only limited duration. This,too, indicates that, looking at the financialcrisis as a whole, weak lending was largelythe result of real economic developments.
This picture is basically confirmed by regular
business surveys (eg the ifo credit constraint

38indicator and the survey conducted by the
German Chamber of Industry and Commerce
(DIHK)). They, too, at times identified bottle-
necks in lending to specific groups of enter-
prises and sectors, but no general credit
crunch which would significantly restrict the
real economy.
Large enterprises were much harder hit by
the stricter lending standards according to
the BLS and other surveys especially at
the beginning of the crisis than small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This is
probably partly because savings banks and
credit cooperatives, as typical lenders to
SMEs, were initially less badly affected by the
crisis and did not adjust their credit standards
until the general economic situation deterior-
ated. The results of a business survey con-
ducted by the ECB and the European Com-
mission also indicate that the impact on large
and smaller enterprises differed in the various
phases of the financial crisis. According to
this survey, in the first half of 2009, slightly
more than 40% of large enterprises thought
the availability of bank loans had deterior-
ated, while this figure was just 30% for
SMEs.15In the second half of 2009, the fig-
ures reported for large firms and those of
SMEs in this survey converged. This crisis
therefore differs significantly from earlier
ones, in which SMEs were typically worse
affected than large enterprises.Changes to BLS

for corporate lending in the categories rele-vant to the German banking market tendedto be lower than forecast by models esti-mated based on German banks’ interest-ratepass-through before the crisis argues againsta broad-based credit crunch in Germany.These estimates provide no indication thatbanks were exceptionally slow to pass on toclients their sharply lower refinancing costs asa result of the monetary policy easing.

Alternative forms of corporate finance
When assessing non-financial corporations’
funding situation during the financial crisis, itshould also be borne in mind that bank loansrepresent an important, but by no means thelargest source of funding. According to theBundesbank’s financial accounts statistics,the external financing, which includes bankloans, received by non-financial corporationsin the period 2000 to 2007 made up just25% of overall funding on average; on bal-ance, enterprises funded 75% of their re-quirements internally.
Even during the financial crisis, internal fund-
ing had a special role to play in Germany.Purely mathematically, non-financial corpor-ations would, throughout the financial crisis,have been able to cover all their fixed assetformation using internal funds – partly be-cause such expenditure was cut back sharplyin response to the crisis. Non-financial corpor-ations were therefore, on balance, not relianton funds from other sectors even in the eco-nomically difficult year of 2009; in fact, theywere actually net acquirers of financial assets,which also contradicts the hypothesis of a
credit crunch.
At the same time, the volume of external
funding declined during the financial crisis.While bank loans fell, alternative forms of ex-ternal funding rose (see chart on page 42).Here, financing through loans to group affili-ates, which is mainly used by larger and inter-nationally active enterprises, in particular,exerted a stabilising influence in 2009.
17The
same was periodically also true of tradecredits – although these are less significantin quantitative terms. Non-financial corpor-ations with capital market access had otheralternatives to bank loans. Although the crisishas rendered financing conditions more diffi-cult, they have from 2007 to the present dayalways been able to generate positive contri-butions to financing by issuing fixed-incomesecurities, shares and other equity.
On balance, these developments indicate that
the decline during the financial crisis in thevolume of loans extended to non-financialcorporations in Germany can mainly be at-tributed to the weaker real economic situ-ation. By contrast, supply-side restrictions bybanks are unlikely to have limited credit mo-

In the Eurosystem ’s quarterly Bank Len ding Survey 
(BL S), a sample of German banks is re gularly aske d 
how their stan dards for grantin g loans to non-ﬁ  nan cial 
corporations (in cluding credit lines) have chan ged in 
the pre ceding three months. Furthermore, the reasons 
for the a djustments ma de to the credit stan dards are 
also surveye d.1 The response options cover not only 
the competitive situation but also, in parti cular, the 
surveye d institutions ’ per ception of risk (with re gard to 
the outlook for general e conomi c activity, an d se ctor or 
ﬁ rm-spe ciﬁ c risks) as well as bank-relate d fa ctors su ch 
as wholesale fun ding costs, the liqui dity situation an d 
balan ce sheet constraints. Applyin g econometri c fa ctor 
extra ction te chniques, these qualitative data2 are use d 
to derive an in dicator of the bank-relate d determinants 
and an in dicator of the impa ct of their per ception of 
risk on developments in their credit stan dards. While the ﬁ  rst in dicator reﬂ  ects the supply-si de determinants 
of len ding, the se con d indicator prin cipally describes the 
deman d-side-driven effe cts. In a ddition, the parti cipants 
in the BL S are aske d spe ciﬁ cally a bout enterprises ’ fun-
ding nee ds whi ch they have o bserve d.
Given the “ credit crun ch” debate, the bank-relate d 
determinants are of prime interest. As is to be expe cted, 
this in dicator gains in importan ce with the out break of 
the ﬁ  nan cial market turmoil in the thir d quarter of 2007, 
and it attains its maximum impa ct on credit stan dards 
in the thir d an d fourth quarters of 2008, ie with the 
insolven cy of U S investment bank Lehman Brothers. 
Subsequently, however, the bank-relate d determinants 
qui ckly re cede in importan ce a gain – evi dently a gainst 
the backdrop of the Eurosystem ’s rapi d monetary an d 
liqui dity poli cy response an d the intro duction of govern-
mental support measures.
The explanatory power of these two fa ctors for the 
len ding of banks in the BL S sample to non-ﬁ  nan cial 
corporations was veriﬁ  ed with the ai d of a panel esti-
mation. This was base d on a balan ced panel consistin g 
of 14 banks an d 31 quarters (2002 Q4 to 2010 Q2). The

growth rate of deﬂ ate d insolven cy claims, the capital 
ratio of bank i, as well as the differen ce between the 
interest rates for debt ﬁ nan cing an d the returns of 
alternative sour ces of ﬁ  nan cing for the enterprises). The 
results show that, in a ddition to the other in corporate d 
varia bles, the in dicator of the bank-relate d supply fa c-
tors makes a si gniﬁ cant contri bution to explainin g the 
negative dynami cs of len ding in the years of the crisis. 
As, a ccording to the estimate, the dampenin g impa ct of 
the bank-relate d fa ctors ﬁ  rst appears with a time la g of 
four quarters, these fa ctors did not exert their maximum 
restri ctive effe ct until the thir d an d fourth quarters 
of 2009. Subsequently, this explanatory fa ctor qui ckly 
becomes less important an d even reverses into positive 
territory at the en d of the perio d un der consi deration.4 
The time la g in the impa ct of the bank-relate d fa ctors 
is consistent with the sequential delevera ging of the 
banks. A ccordingly, the in crease in capital ratios on the 
asset si de of their balan ce sheets ne cessitate d by the 
escalation of the ﬁ  nan cial crisis was carrie d out by banks 
not throu gh loans to the private se ctor but throu gh other 
asset items (external assets, inter bank claims, equities 
and other varia ble-rate se curities). Enterprises drawin g 
on ne gotiate d credit lines may also have contri bute d to 
the la gged impa ct.
On balan ce, the estimate su ggests that bank-relate d res-
trictions in the crisis also playe d a part in the weakenin g 
credit growth. Even in the perio d when the impa ct of 
bank-relate d fa ctors was at its stron gest, the explana-
tory power of the other determinants expli citly in corpo-
rate d into the estimate were, in sum, more si gniﬁ cant. 
Furthermore, the inﬂ  uen ce of the bank-relate d fa ctors 
was of no more than limite d duration owin g to the rapi d 
and clear response of the Eurosystem an d to the govern-
mental support measures. The s cale an d duration of the restri ctin g impa ct of the bank-si de fa ctors therefore do 
not su ggest a broa d-base d credit crun ch. What shoul d 
also be taken into consi deration is that the results are 
base d on a sample with a disproportionately hi gh per-
centa ge of lar ger credit institutions. As su ch institutions

therefore, no evidence to date of a broad-
based and self-reinforcing credit crunch that
is triggered by bank-side factors.
On the risk of a credit crunch in the
cyclical recovery phase
This year, the downward trend in bank lend-
ing momentum in Germany appears to have
been broken, as German banks’ holdings of
loans to domestic non-financial corporations
have largely stagnated since the beginning of
the year. However, a turnaround and re-
newed rise in loan holdings is not on the hori-
zon yet. If demand for bank loans mirrors the
accelerating economic recovery over the next
few months and enterprises’ capital require-
ments for working capital and investmentsrise, the possibility still cannot be completely
ruled out that an inadequate supply of fi-
nance by banks might dampen overall eco-
nomic activity. That is a fairly unlikely risk
scenario, however. For one, access to alterna-
tive external and internal sources of funding
is likely to become increasingly easier with
the economic recovery and the gradual stabil-
isation on the financial markets.
Moreover, the likelihood of an imminent
credit crunch is also likely to remain limited
for bank-related reasons. Since the beginningNon-financial corporations’ external financing according to financial

43of 2010, lending to the German economy has
improved steadily, as evidenced by the resultsof business and bank surveys. According tothe special survey the Bundesbank conductedagain in July 2010,
19German banks even an-
ticipate rising loan volume over the next12 months given the favourable economicenvironment. Moreover, the pressure to re-duce balance-sheet assets within the Germanbanking system in order to deleverage, whichwas triggered by the financial crisis, is cur-rently easing overall. Given macroeconomicdevelopments, it currently looks as thoughGerman banks’ profitability will be muted,but positive in full-year 2010 despite non-negligible financial market risks (see page 33).The gradual normalisation of the interbankmarket in the euro area is also encouraging.
However, when determining whether a credit
crunch might occur in future, it is importantto consider whether banks will raise capital inanticipation of expected higher regulatorycapital requirements, either on their own ac-count or because of market pressures. Thedecisions that the Basel Committee on Bank-ing Supervision has taken to date concerningfuture capital requirements,
20which the G20
Heads of State or Government should finallypass at their meeting in early November inSeoul, indicate that German banks will re-quire considerably more capital going for-ward. Large changes in lending behaviour as
a result of regulatory changes are nonethelessunlikely in the near future – not least becauselong transitional periods are in place. More-over, the restructuring of bank balance sheetsduring the crisis has shown that when creditinstitutions in Germany restructured theirasset portfolios, this was only partially doneat the expense of client exposures. The im-pact of regulatory adjustments on average-risk loans should therefore initially be limited;it is more likely that access to riskier loans willbecome more difficult.
Higher capital requirements strengthen the
banking system’s resilience. This on its ownshould reduce the risk premiums banks payfor equity and debt. Provided financial mar-kets continue to stabilise worldwide and theGerman banking system’s balance-sheet ad-justment process has peaked, the financialcrisis is likely to have a limited negative im-pact on the real economy and a broad-basedcredit crunch will remain just a risk scenario.

45Economic activity
In the wake of the global financial and economic crisis, the German economy suffered its sharp-
est decline in overall economic activity since the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany.Even though the crisis did not originate there, the German industry’s pattern of specialisationmeant that the global demand shock in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009hit domestic activity particularly hard. This led to a significant decline in exports. Domestic finaldemand proved to be comparatively robust, however. This is especially true of private consump-tion, which was given a significant boost by the stable labour market. This discrepancy betweenexternal and domestic economic developments distinguishes Germany from other countries,which were characterised by major structural distortions. The earlier cyclically induced excessivesurplus on Germany’s current account declined perceptibly. Germany therefore built up a bufferfor global demand during this period.
Conversely, the German economy is benefiting to a large extent from the strong recovery in the
global economy which began in the second quarter of 2009. From a cyclical perspective, thepace of recovery is therefore faster than in most other industrial countries. This, together withthe fact that domestic demand was hardly affected during the crisis, supports the assessmentthat a considerable part of the decline in output in Germany was due to cyclical factors. Never-theless, it is unlikely that the German economy will return in the foreseeable future to its growthpath immediately prior to the crisis.
The resilience of the German economy during the crisis was due, not least, to the restructuring
measures in the corporate sector and to structural reforms over the past decade. This is why Ger-many is now also in a better starting position than it was in earlier periods of economic recovery.Even so, there is still scope for strengthening the resilience and the flexibility of the German econ-omy even further. The broadening of the basis for growth, which is now under way, is takingplace through market-based processes. These processes need to be backed up by further eco-nomic policy reforms, but not at the cost of restricting the competitiveness of German industry.Doing so would squander potentials for growth and wealth, not just in Germany.

46Macroeconomic developments during
the crisis
In the wake of the global financial and eco-
nomic crisis, the German economy suffered
its sharpest decline in overall economic activ-
ity since the founding of the Federal Republic
of Germany. Nevertheless, the first phase of
the tensions in the financial and real estate
markets of a number of countries did not
have any noticeable impact on economic
activity in Germany. Output was in full swing
up to the first quarter of 2008, and the cool-
ing tendencies as the year went on also ini-
tially remained within the bounds of normal
cyclical fluctuations. It was not until the
second half of 2008 that a dramatic deterior-
ation in sentiment took hold. This, together
with the further escalation of the financial
crisis following the Lehman insolvency and
the subsequent sharp slump in world trade,
especially in durable consumer and capital
goods, led to a marked decline in economic
activity in Germany in the final quarter of
2008 and the first quarter of 2009. This
deterioration was much more pronounced
than in many other industrial countries.
Nevertheless, owing to the extensive world-
wide support measures for the financial sys-
tem as well as significant economic stimuli
from monetary and fiscal policy measures,
world trade and global output stabilised from
the second quarter of 2009 onwards, albeit
at a clearly depressed level. This was also true
of the German economy. The gradual restor-
ation of confidence was initially accompanied
by a subdued cyclical recovery, which then
strengthened significantly on the back of theextremely buoyant pick-up in global trade.
There are signs that economic output in
Germany will rise by over 3% in 2010, after
declining by 4.7% last year.
Only minor impact on the economy
at first
The financial and economic crisis hit the Ger-
man economy during a period of exceptional
growth. Manufacturing enterprises, in par-
ticular, were working at near to full capacity
in 2007 to meet strong export demand and,
increasingly, demand on the domestic side.
The difficult structural adjustment processes
of earlier years had restored the German
economy’s profitability. Corporate profits
then reached new record highs in the wake

ments were made against the backdrop ofstill quite optimistic expectations. The im-proved situation in the German economy wasalso revealed by the marked recovery of thelabour market. Some sectors experiencedincreasing difficulties in filling vacancies.
Although it was evident in 2008 that the
rapid pace of growth of earlier years couldnot be maintained, there were initially nosigns of a massive downturn. Enterprises’ in-vestment and staffing decisions were alsobased on the expectation that economicactivity would not be impaired by major dis-locations. Business expectations in industrygradually deteriorated from a very high leveland the volume of new orders failed tomatch the buoyant growth of 2006 and2007. With regard to the current businesssituation, positive assessments still predomin-ated during this period, however. This wastrue, above all, of manufacturing, where theconsiderable volume of orders on handappeared to ensure a high degree of capacityutilisation for a certain amount of time. Des-pite this, overall economic activity began todecline as early as the second quarter of2008. One contributory factor in this was theexceptionally strong growth in the construc-tion sector in the previous quarter, which wasdue, in part, to weather-related special fac-tors. The decline in the third quarter remainedwithin the bounds of normal cyclical weak-ness.Sharp recession in the final quarter of

Sentiment and then the business situation,
too, deteriorated dramatically in the last fewmonths of 2008. Even before the LehmanBrothers insolvency, firms had revised theirexpectations sharply downwards, and de-mand for German industrial products de-clined considerably. This downward tendencybecame stronger in the following months asa result of the escalating financial crisis andrapidly growing uncertainty. Many enterprisesworldwide stepped up their efforts to in-crease their available resources by reducingtheir inventories as far as possible, haltingtheir investment projects, abstaining fromplacing new orders and even cancellingorders in some cases.

48their demand for high-quality durable con-
sumer goods. This all had the direct effect of
exacerbating the crisis, and there was the risk
of a downward spiral.
Germany was hit particularly hard by this
global demand shock, even though the crisis
did not originate there. The sharp decline in
economic activity in the German economy
was due, above all, to the very major import-
ance of foreign trade for the size of the econ-
omy and its specialisation in the manufacture
of high-quality intermediate and capital
goods, which are particularly sensitive to cyc-
lical influences.1While data from the Dutch
Centraal Planbureau indicate that the volume
of global trade in goods fell by 181/C252% be-
tween the second quarter of 2008 and the
first quarter of 2009, Germany’s exports of
goods declined by 221/C252% owing to the spe-
cific range of its products. Germany’s real
gross domestic product (GDP) decreased by
6% during this period, compared with 43/C254%
in the OECD area as a whole.
The impact of the sharp contraction in world
trade went far beyond the immediate effects
on output. It is noteworthy, however, that the
indirect effects were much less intense than
might have been expected given the severity
of the downturn. Enterprises abruptly cut
back their investment budgets, which was
due not only to the increasing underutilisa-
tion of production capacities, but also to
growing uncertainty about future economic
growth. In the first quarter of 2009, pur-Selected expenditure

49chases of new machinery and equipment
were down by one-fifth on the quarter in sea-sonally adjusted terms. By contrast, there wasinitially hardly any reduction in expenditureon commercial buildings, which have a longerplanning horizon than investment in machin-ery and equipment. Much the same appliesto staff planning (for more details, seepages 55 to 69). As a result, private consump-tion proved to be comparatively robust withthe result that domestic final demand fellmuch less sharply than value added.
In sectoral terms, manufacturing was directly
affected. Value added in this sector contract-ed by almost one-fifth in the final quarter of2008 and the first quarter of 2009. Knock-oneffects stemming from the closely integratednature of economic activity led to the shockspreading to other sectors of the economy,such as wholesale and foreign trade, thetransport sector and numerous business-related service providers. The constructionsector, retail trade and public and householdservices remained largely unaffected, how-ever. This discrepancy between external anddomestic developments distinguishes Ger-many from those countries where the crisisoriginated, which are characterised by majorstructural distortions.
Owing to the comparatively moderate reaction
of domestic demand, imports declined muchless sharply than exports in the fourth quarterof 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. The sur-plus on Germany’s current account decreasedfrom 7
1/C252% of nominal GDP in 2007 to 5% in
2009. Germany therefore built up a buffer forglobal demand during this period.Stabilisation of the activity in the second

50fiscal policy measures were implemented in a
large number of countries. In Germany, fol-
lowing an initial, smaller package of measures
in November 2008, a second economic
stimulus package was approved in January
2009. This essentially made provision for a
funding volume of around 350 billion, or 2%
of GDP , to be spread over a period of two
years (for further details, see pages 71 to 85).
In addition to extensive public investment,the package also contained cuts in income
tax, reductions in social security contribu-
tions, increased social security benefits, busi-
ness guarantee programmes and an environ-
mental premium for replacing old privately
used cars with new vehicles, the volume of
which was increased shortly afterwards from
31.5 billion to 35 billion.
Unlike the scheduled public-sector invest-
ment under the economic stimulus pro-
gramme, the implementation of which oc-
curred with a considerable time lag in some
cases owing to lengthy planning and approval
procedures, the environmental premium had
a rapid impact. Household demand shot up
– especially in the small and medium car seg-
ment – and largely offset the shortfall in com-
mercial orders that affected other market
segments. As a result, output in the motor
vehicle industry, which had previously de-
clined by almost two-fifths, began to recover.
Foreign motor vehicle manufacturers and
foreign subsidiaries of German automotive
groups also benefited to a large extent from
these stimuli. For example, imports of motor
vehicles between the second and fourth
quarters of 2009 were up by an average of
51/C254% on the start of the year. In 2009, the
total number of new car registrations by
households showed a year-on-year increase
of 1.1 million to 2.4 million.
As an instrument to stabilise the economy,
the impact of the environmental premium
was undoubtedly target-oriented, timely and
of limited duration. Seen in that light, it met
three major requirements of an effective pub-
lic spending programme. For the automotiveIndicators of the motor

51industry as a whole, it effectively bridged the
period between the broad-based slump indemand and the revival of, initially, foreigndemand and then of demand from domesticbusinesses, which had previously largely de-ferred replacement purchases. It was not onlymotor vehicle manufacturers themselves thatbenefited from this, but also the suppliers ofthis sector.
2Even so, the large-scale scrapping
of old, but still roadworthy vehicles meantthe destruction of valuable tangible assets.
Initially subdued, then sharp economic
recovery
In the second quarter of 2009, the initial
impetus for the economic recovery cameprimarily from the government economicstimulus packages, which were reflected ingrowing private and public consumer de-mand. There was also an expansion in de-mand from China and South-East Asia again.Exports started to pick up again on a broadfront as early as the third quarter. In addition,public construction investment was steppedup substantially. The cyclical pace of recoveryweakened temporarily in the fourth quarterof 2009 owing, in part, to a reversal of thepositive stimuli generated by the environmen-tal premium, which had previously benefitedprivate consumption. Added to this was thefact that enterprises were still cautious withregard to investment in machinery and equip-ment in view of the continuing severecapacity underutilisation at the time. At thebeginning of 2010, the underlying pace ofrecovery picked up significantly; this was stillnot fully reflected in GDP as the exceptionallycold and snowy winter weather had an ad-verse effect on construction output in par-
ticular and to a lesser, yet still perceptible, ex-tent in other economic sectors.
There was an extremely sharp 2.2% quarter-
on-quarter rise in economic output in 2010Q2, not least as a result of the associatedcatching-up effects. The pick-up in worldtrade was reflected, above all, in a sharp risein German exports, however. This was alreadyindicated by the substantial increase in thevolume of export orders for the Germaneconomy in the first quarter of 2010. The as-sociated massive improvement in sentiment islikely to have been a key reason for the pick-up in investment. With increasing optimismthat the global economic crisis could be over-come more quickly than previously thought,there was a decline in the reluctance tomake consumption decisions. On the finan-cing side, supply constraints continued onlyin sub-segments, and so the fear of a broad-based credit crunch did not materialise (seepages 36 to 43).
Despite the clear economic upturn, overall
economic activity has not yet matched thelevel of the most recent cyclical peak. To date,around three-fifths of the crisis-induced de-cline in output has been recovered. In themanufacturing sector, which was hit particu-larly strongly by the fall in demand, the figureis only two-fifths. Economic output in theretail and transport sectors – in contrast tobusiness-related services, including financing

52and leasing – was likewise still down on its
pre-crisis level.
Outlook and challenges for the German
economy
While the German economy was particularly
hard hit by the massive decline in global
demand in the wake of the financial and eco-
nomic crisis – owing to its pattern of special-
isation which is accompanied by a high de-
gree of international economic integration –
it benefited to a very large extent from the
quite strong recovery of the global economy
beginning in the second quarter of 2009.
From a cyclical perspective, the pace of recov-
ery is therefore faster than in most other in-
dustrial countries. Together with the fact that
domestic final demand was remarkably
robust during the crisis, this supports the
assessment that the decline in output in Ger-
many was, to a considerable extent, a cyclical
phenomenon. As things stand, however, it is
unlikely that the German economy will return
in the foreseeable future to its growth path
immediately prior to the crisis.
One reason for this is that the last global up-
swing, at least in its final phase, was charac-
terised by a non-sustainable pace of growth.
This was due primarily to international misal-
locations of resources as well as the build-up
of macroeconomic imbalances and exagger-
ations.3In many countries, the necessary
restructuring process will require some time.
Thus, there is much to suggest that growth in
the world economy will become more sub-
dued after the rapid recovery especially in thefirst half of 2010. This has direct implications
for the German economy, which is closely
integrated with the global market.
On balance, economic crises also generally
trigger self-contained effects that minimise
potential. The fact that corporate insolvencies
have so far increased no more than is usual in
times of recession, and the recent sharp rise
in demand for German products indicate that
the market adjustments initiated in Germany
during the financial and economic crisis will
not be exceptionally large. Therefore, the
direct losses of capital stock, which are con-
nected with firms’ exit from the market or
the economic obsolescence of existing fixed
assets, are likely to be limited. Nevertheless,
industrial investment is still being dampened
by the continuing underutilisation of plant
capacity in many parts of the economy. By
contrast, given the anticipated slower pace of
growth in global demand, product range ad-
justments and process innovations with the
aim of retaining and/or increasing market
shares are likely to gain in importance. Over-
all, potential growth may have decreased by
around1/C252percentage point since the begin-
ning of the crisis. Given the marked cyclical
fluctuations, such estimates are fraught with
considerable uncertainty, however.4
Given the anticipated sharp rise in aggregate
economic activity this year by over 3%, the
overall output gap will decrease significantly.

53There is still likely to be spare capacity, above
all, in industry and the closely related tradeand the transport sectors as well as in busi-ness-related services. According to the Ifoinstitute surveys, for example, manufacturingcapacity utilisation in July was just under2 percentage points down on its longer-termaverage, although there is still a considerablebacklog, particularly in the capital goods sec-tor. This is especially true considering that thecyclical fluctuations in output are reflectedonly to a limited extent in the Ifo indicators ofcapacity utilisation. Working hours in industryhave not yet returned to normal, either.
As things stand, the corridor of normal utilisa-
tion could be reached in 2011, despite theexpected slower pace of economic activity.Given the still intact, yet moderate momen-tum of the global economy, the external im-pulses for the Germany economy are less pro-nounced. Furthermore, growth-dampeningeffects could be generated in the short termby the consolidation of public finances. Therestructuring measures initiated in a largenumber of countries should, however, help torestore confidence in the sustainability ofpublic finances and thus even trigger positiveeffects for economic growth.
As a result of the efforts made over the past
decade, Germany is, despite the exceptionallysharp economic downturn, in a better struc-tural starting position than in earlier periodsof recovery. The relative competitive positionof German enterprises did not change signifi-cantly during the crisis and their financial situ-ation did not suffer excessively either. Unlikein a number of other developed economies,which are struggling with the after-effects of
a property market bubble, the financial situ-ation of households is not giving any causefor concern either. Furthermore, there are noindications of an increase in structural un-employment during the crisis. Therefore, theneed for structural adjustments in the privatesector is likely to be limited. In contrast to thesituation after the previous cyclical downturn,no severe strains for the economy are to beexpected on this front.
Nevertheless, there is potential for broaden-
ing the German economy’s basis for growthand for strengthening its resilience to crises aswell as its flexibility. Even so, this cannot be amatter of restricting German industry’s com-petitiveness. Not only in Germany, this wouldsquander potentials for growth and wealthand fail to make adequate use of (and thusdevalue) competitive production structuresand highly specialised human capital. Needfor reform in Germany exists, above all, in theservices sector where lower barriers to marketentry and less bureaucracy could help tomake greater use of existing opportunitiesand to create new ones.
An improvement in the underlying economic
conditions would enhance the attractivenessof Germany as a production location andcould also enhance potential growth andreduce structural unemployment. Even ifstronger stimuli are likely to be generated bydomestic activity in the future, there is muchto suggest that the strong export orientationof German industry will continue. This willhelp to further increase wealth and prosperityin Germany. At the same time, its depend-

55Labour market
The German labour market came through the massive slump in output during the financial and
economic crisis without any substantial rise in unemployment. This was not only without prece-dent during earlier economic downturns in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany; it isstriking in comparison with other countries, too. The finding may be explained by enterprisesseeing the decline in demand primarily as a cyclical phenomenon and by the fact that only a rela-tively limited need for structural adjustment had built up in the German economy. The additionalcosts associated with the temporary hoarding of labour were reduced by employers and employ-ees making use of the extended scope for reducing actual working hours that is available undercollective pay agreements, even if this involved a perceptible loss in wages. These efforts wereflanked by government measures providing improved opportunities for the use of short-timework. Furthermore, many firms were in a favourable financial position before the outbreak of thecrisis.
During the crisis there was nevertheless a marked fall in employment in manufacturing, the
transportation and storage sector and, above all, temporary employment. This did not have asignificant impact at the aggregate level, however, as there were either no perceptible negativeemployment effects in sectors geared to domestic activity or even – as in the healthcare and edu-cation sectors – increases in staffing levels. From the fourth quarter of 2008, there was a rise inunemployment for a short time, but this has now receded again. This is all the more remarkablegiven that the trend growth in labour market participation continued notwithstanding the crisisand that the pace of structural change towards the tertiary sector picked up again.
The reform steps taken in collective pay agreements and in labour market policy in the first half
of the past decade not only laid the foundation for enhancing the activation of unemployed per-sons and for improved labour market matching. Along with years of wage moderation, this re-sulted in the costs and risks of staff planning being lower. The fact that the response of tempor-ary employment was very marked compared with that of core staffing levels is nevertheless anindication of the continuing segmentation of the labour market. Potential for reform exists in thisrespect, as there does with regard to the still excessively high number of unemployed who cur-rently have little prospect of gaining a job in the non-assisted labour market.

56Remarkable cyclical resilience of the
German labour market
The German labour market has not only
coped well with the slump in output caused
by the financial and economic crisis, its stabil-
ity has also played a substantial part in rapidly
overcoming the severe recession. In the his-
tory of the Federal Republic of Germany,
there was no previous cyclical downturn in
which the labour market appeared in similarly
robust shape. In comparison with other coun-
tries, too, the mild response of employment
and unemployment is striking, even though
the German economy suffered very heavily
from the global slowdown in demand. For ex-
ample, between the cyclical low in the first
quarter of 2008 and the third quarter of
2010, the standardised unemployment rate
went up by a total of almost 3 percentage
points to 10% in the euro area as a whole
and by 43/C254percentage points to 91/C252% in the
United States. By contrast, there was an over-
all decline in Germany during the same
period of3/C254percentage point to 63/C254%, even
though there had since been a slight rise, too.
(For more detailed information on differences
between developments in the German and
US labour markets, see pages 58 and 59).
One key factor in this was that many enter-
prises in the particularly affected sectors of
the economy continued to gear their core
staffing levels more to the labour require-
ments they saw as appropriate to normal
economic circumstances. This was based on
the expectation that the considerable fall in
demand during the crisis would be largely
temporary in nature and that the medium-term outlook for sales would therefore be far
less affected. The structural need for adjust-
ment was, by contrast, evidently regarded as
low. The fact that many firms encountered
difficulties in recruiting sufficient skilled
labour towards the end of the previous up-
swing undoubtedly played a role in this con-
text, too.
Labour hoarding was made easier by the fact
that contractual pay settlements in the pre-
ceding years had created scope through in-
house agreements for adjusting working
hours and remuneration to changing eco-
nomic circumstances.1At the same time,
early retirement for older employees – an im-
portant and cost-effective adjustment strat-
egy for enterprises in earlier recessionary
periods – had been made unattractive by
changes in the conditions for drawing pen-
sions and unemployment benefit. Moreover,
economic policy assisted employers’ and em-
ployees’ efforts to safeguard employment
through the extension of short-time work.
Even so, there was a notable decline in hourly
productivity and a considerable rise in unit
labour costs. Notwithstanding these cost-
cutting measures, firms were able to hold on
to workers only because balance sheet
resilience had been substantially improved in
earlier good years and owing to the fact that
economic activity began to pick up again be-
fore financial reserves had been exhausted by
the crisis-induced losses.

57From the outset, the labour market’s cyclical
robustness prevented the underlying reces-
sionary trend from spreading – through inter-
action between the labour market and do-
mestic demand – to those sectors of the
economy geared primarily to the home mar-
ket and thus becoming entrenched. Besides
measures to stabilise the economy, it also
helped that the Federal government had earl-
ier created the underlying statutory and fi-
nancial conditions for the increased provision
of healthcare and education services, which
led to an expansion of employment in this
sector throughout the crisis.2
Employment stable overall with sectoral
differences and reduced working hours
The most striking finding with regard to the
labour market is that there was no significant
fall in aggregate employment during the fi-
nancial and economic crisis. Employment in
Germany fell by no more than 0.4% year on
year in the 12 months starting from October
2008. This followed a seasonally adjusted rise
of 4% up to that point solely in the employ-
ment-intensive phase of the preceding up-
swing since the start of 2006. In employment
subject to social security contributions, the de-
cline was somewhat larger at 0.8%; neverthe-
less, the prior increase in this case was as high
as 6%. Very soon after economic activity had
bottomed out, not only were there identi-
fiable stabilisation tendencies in the labour
market; in the current year, in fact, there has
even been a growth in employment. Employ-
ment at the current end exceeds the cyclical
peak of the final quarter of 2008. The numberof jobs subject to social security contributions
has been higher than the fourth-quarter level
of 2008 since the second quarter of this year.
Owing to marked sectoral discrepancies and
the widespread use of working hours as an
adjustment parameter, aggregate employ-
ment gives no more than an incomplete pic-
ture of the quite visible imprint which the
financial and economic crisis has left on the
labour market. In the sectors primarily affect-
ed by the demand shock, there were percep-
tible job losses and it is only in the past few
months that these appear to have run their
course. Between the fourth quarter of 2008
and the first quarter of 2010, for example, a
seasonally adjusted 41/C252% of jobs subject to
social security contributions were lost in
manufacturing. In the transportation and
storage sector, which was likewise hit hard
cyclically, the corresponding figure at its peak
was 21/C254%. Furthermore, between the second
quarter of 2008 and the second quarter of
2009, the temporary employment sector
– which probably hired out a large part of its
personnel resources to industry during the
prior upswing – shed around one-quarter of
its jobs that are subject to social security con-
tributions. By contrast, notwithstanding the
crisis, there was a continued expansion of
employment in the health and social work
sector (+81/C254% since the first quarter of 2008)
2In the health and social work sector, the 2008 nursing
care reform with expansions of benefits and the acceler-
ation of benefit claims is likely to have had the effect of
boosting demand. The same is true of the health reform
steps of the past few years. Relevant factors in the educa-
tion sector were the agreement between the Federal and
state government on tertiary education and the pro-
grammes for expanding all-day schools as well as other
day care options for children with regard to legal entitle-
ment from 2013.No additional

58Deutsche BundesbankThe labour market response in Germany in comparison with the USA
By international comparison, the German labour market proved 
to be exceptionally robust in the crisis. To pinpoint the speciﬁ  c 
nature of the German labour market‘s response and its possible 
causes, a comparison is made here with developments in the 
United States. The USA is a country that is particularly suited as 
a reference, above all owing to its economic signiﬁ  cance and 
its role as the starting point for the global slowdown.
The standardised unemployment rate virtually doubled in the 
USA over the course of the recent recession, which the National 
Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) estimates as lasting from 
the end of 2007 to mid-2009. By contrast, the corresponding 
rate in Germany even fell slightly between the ﬁ  rst quarter 
of 2008 and the ﬁ  rst quarter of 2009, which can be regarded 
as the last cyclical highs and lows in Germany. However, to 
a greater extent than US enterprises, German enterprises 
reduced the number of hours worked per employee in order 
to retain staff. Therefore, the total number of hours worked 
is better for modelling developments in labour input than the 
number of employed or unemployed. Nevertheless, Germany’s 
performance is comparatively favourable in this respect, too. 
With a decline of 4½%, the number of hours worked by 
employees in German enterprises during the recession was cut 
back only about half as much as it was in the US private sec-tor.1, 2 This is all the more remarkable, as real GDP in Germany 
contracted signiﬁ  cantly more sharply (–6½%) than it did in the 
USA (–4%). Accordingly, hourly productivity, ie the ratio of 
output to labour input, developed very differently in the two 
economies. This becomes even clearer in a sectoral analysis.
The shock to conﬁ  dence triggered by the collapse of Lehman 
brothers in the late summer of 2008 resulted in a slump in 
global demand, particularly for durable consumer and capital 
goods. The strongly export-oriented manufacturing sector 
in Germany could not escape from the downward slide and, 
like in the USA, there was an exceptionally sharp cutback in 
the total number of hours worked. The inﬂ  uence of global 
factors is likewise evident in the generally similar productiv-
ity developments in this economic sector. Enterprises in the 
manufacturing sector usually endeavour not to adjust their 
stafﬁ ng levels proportionately in line with cyclical ﬂ  uctuations 
in output, which are especially marked in this sector. A clear 
indication of labour hoarding in the recession is that hourly 
productivity fell perceptibly in the USA during 2008, even 
though it declined much more sharply in Germany. When sales 
picked up, a strong recovery in hourly manufacturing output 
also began in both countries in the second quarter of 2009. One 
key difference, however, can be seen for the winter months of 
2009, when – in contrast to the USA – output per hour worked 
by all persons in the German manufacturing sector fell sharply. 
German enterprises, which had largely shut down production 
at that time, were evidently willing to accept a considerably 
lower utilisation of their staff, at least temporarily.
At the same time, the enterprises outside the manufacturing 
sector, too, took widely differing decisions. While enterprises 
in Germany adjusted the total number of hours worked only 
to the lower output, considerably greater cuts were made in 
the USA. Consequently, hourly productivity there rose sharply,4 
while in the German business sector, not including the manu-
facturing sector, it remained more or less unchanged. There-
fore, in Germany, the manufacturing sector played a crucial 
role in the development of productivity in the business sector 
as a whole, whereas, in the USA, this role was played by the 
other ﬁ  rms, as becomes clear from calculating the contribu-
tions of these subsegments to aggregate productivity growth.
One plausible explanation for the observed diverging responses 
of Germany and the USA are differences in the interpretation 
of the fall in aggregate demand by enterprises in the two

59countries.5 In Germany, there was probably mainly a percep-
tion of a slump in export demand that would be conﬁ  ned to 
the manufacturing sector. Insofar as the drop in demand in Germany was essentially seen as only temporary, there was a strong incentive for enterprises to hold on to their staff, with ﬂ  exible collective wage agreements, company-based 
agreements and short-time working arrangements cushioning the burden for them. The relatively weak response of labour input in the German manufacturing sector is, in turn, likely to have led to the external shock having hardly any impact on domestically-oriented sectors through the labour market 
channel, either.
By contrast, in the USA, the fall in aggregate demand was 
possibly regarded more as a domestic, structural and persist-ent problem. As early as the start of 2006, a steep decline in housing construction had begun and, in the second half of 2008, households considerably reined in their consumption expenditure, which, in earlier years, had been a signiﬁ  cant 
driving force behind the upward trend in the economy as a 
whole. The expectation of a long-drawn-out adjustment pro-cess, or even just heightened uncertainty about the outlook for the US economy, might have prompted enterprises on a broad front to minimise their labour input and exhaust productivity reserves. While, in Germany, the robustness of both the labour market and domestic demand meant that they supported each other, these interconnected factors are likely, if anything, to have reinforced the downturn in the USA. Domestic ﬁ  nal 
demand is therefore likely to be a closer reference variable for 
enterprises’ labour demand in the recession than aggregate output. Domestic ﬁ  nal demand fell by 4½% in the United 
States during the downturn, while it declined by no more than 2% in Germany.
In actual fact, much of the slump in the demand for goods in 
the manufacturing sector has already proven to be temporary, 
and hourly productivity in this sector has picked up sharply as 
a result. However, the gap in productivity between Germany and the USA has also begun to close again because the ratio of the total number of hours worked to output in the US business sector excluding manufacturing has recently shown a percep-tible increase. The productivity reserves are now likely to have been largely exhausted and thus – in contrast, for example, to the “jobless recovery” at the start of the new millennium – the continuation of the overall economic upturn is likely to lead to 
a marked expansion in labour input.
and the dramatic decline in labour input in the construction industry. 
However, this went hand in hand with a massive decline in construc-tion activity. Furthermore, in many service sectors, the total number of hours worked was cut back and probably also strong productivity gains 
were achieved. — 5 See Deutsche Bundesbank, “Labour markets in the

tration increased its employment by 13/C254% be-
tween the second quarter of 2008 and the
third quarter of 2009, compared with no in-
crease in the preceding (and, so far, the ensu-
ing) period.
Enterprises had to cut back their output dras-
tically owing to the massive weakening of de-
mand. The fact that they were able to reduce
the actual working hours of their core work-
ers helped to stabilise employment. In the ini-
tial phase of the downturn, this was done not
only by cutting back overtime but also by re-
ducing the sometimes considerable surplus
accumulated on the employees’ working
time accounts. The scale of the slump in pro-
duction made it additionally necessary formany firms to cut regular working hours
under the provisions of collective pay agree-
ments or declare short-time work. According
to the IBA’s calculation of working hours, the
number of hours worked in the period from
the fourth quarter of 2008 to the third
quarter of 2009 was 21/C252% down on the
12-month period prior to the crisis.3As much
as 30% of this was due to the reduction of
positive balances on working time accounts.
The reduction of agreed or standard weekly
working hours accounted for just over 25%,
while short-time work and cutting back over-
time each made up roughly 20%. From a cyc-
lical perspective, however, employees haveSectoral profile of employment subject to social security contributions

61been working longer again in seasonally ad-
justed terms since the low in the first quarterof 2009. Relative to the 12-month periodfrom the third quarter of 2009 to the secondquarter of 2010, hours worked were still1
1/C252% below the pre-crisis level. Besides the
reduction in short-time work, the (partially)rapidly advancing recovery has led in someenterprises to working time accounts beingstocked up again and more overtime beingworked as well as longer regular workinghours.
The temporary hoarding of labour, especially
in manufacturing, had an economic rationale.Given the prevailing expectation in this sectorthat the slowdown in demand might belargely cyclical in nature, great weight wasattached to the potential loss of firm-specifichuman capital involved in laying-off coreworkers. Above all, the acute shortage ofsuitably skilled workers in the final phase ofthe preceding upswing had evidently leftfirms with the impression that recruitingqualified staff would soon become time-consuming and expensive once activity intheir sector picked up again. By contrast, thecost of safeguarding jobs was seen as lowerthan in earlier economic downturns sinceonly partial or no compensatory pay had tobe granted for reductions in working hoursagreed with works councils under the moreflexible pay agreements of the past few years.Additional factors which curbed costs werethat the period of entitlement to short-timeworking benefits for economic reasons wasextended in two stages to 24 months andthat a greater share of the social contribu-tions to be paid by employers during periodsof short-time work was borne by the labour
agencies.
There was indeed a massive increase in short-
time work during the period of strongest re-cessionary pressure in the final quarter of2008 and the first quarter of 2009, althoughthe expansion was confined to the export-oriented industries. In May 2009, 1.44 millionpersons were officially registered as short-time workers for economic reasons, whichwas the peak figure during the crisis. In rela-tion to the severity of the decline in output,this was by no means exceptionally high inhistorical terms, nor was the average loss ofworking hours per employee of just over25% extremely large. One reason for the re-strained use of short-time work is likely tohave been the options for adjusting working

62hours and pay contained in the collective pay
settlements. The fact that roughly four out of
every five short-time workers was employed
in the manufacturing sector is evidence of
such options being used for their economic
policy “bridging” purpose.
More than its scale or sectoral profile, how-
ever, the duration of short-time work is an indi-
cation of whether it is being misused to defer
necessary structural adjustments, especially
as the favourable conditions for granting
benefits have been extended – with little re-
striction – to March 2012. According to initial
estimates by the Federal Employment Agency,
288,000 employees were still affected by
short-time work for economic reasons in July
2010. This corresponds to a decline of four-
fifths compared with the peak figure. The re-duction in the level has so far been taking
place – in terms of employment equivalents –
essentially without a perceptible time lag in
step with the pace of economic recovery.
Since this finding can be verified for all major
industrial branches despite considerable dif-
ferences in terms of the progress achieved in
the recovery process, there are no indications
to date of short-time work becoming en-
trenched in the core sectors of the economy.
Short-time work has helped to safeguard em-
ployment in the crisis, even though – in con-
trast to the public perception – it has by no
means played an outstanding part. This in-
strument, however, needs to be assessed by
also taking into account the enormous fiscal
strains and the induced distortion of incen-
tives. Short-time work predominantly benefit-
ed those industries which had profited to
a particular extent from the preceding up-
swing. The use of short-time work is predi-
cated on the non-availability of other meas-
ures to reduce working hours. This is de-
signed to avoid free-rider behaviour, but, in
this context, it is generally also worth con-
sidering the goal of strengthening the
independent responsibility of the wage-
bargainers to cushion cyclical setbacks using
their own resources. Not least with regard to
the employment record of older employees,
the crisis has revealed that suitable incentive
structures are highly effective and that it is
therefore possible to achieve economic policy
aims with fewer financial resources than
through government spending programmes.

63as the large-scale deregulation of temporary
employment have extended the range of in-
struments with which labour input at firm
level can be adapted to the current business
situation. The response of temporary employ-
ment, which at present covers no more than
21/C252% of jobs subject to social security contri-
butions, was strongly procyclical but fluctu-
ations in core employment were substantially
reduced. In the crisis, this had the advantage
that, for the vast majority of employees, there
was no more than a comparatively small in-
crease in the risk of unemployment. Even so,
the very unequally spread employment
opportunities for core staff and temporary
workers, especially in periods of an economic
downturn, demonstrate the continuing
strong segmentation of the labour market.
This not only jeopardises the acceptance of
flexible forms of employment, it can also dis-
tort the mix between permanent, fixed-term
employment and temporary employment.
Procyclical hourly productivity and slower
growth in wage costs
The many different measures taken by enter-
prises to manage the deployment of labour in
line with the necessary cutback in production
could not prevent a massive decline in hourly
productivity in the wake of the financial and
economic crisis. Taking the first quarter of
2008 as a point of reference, hourly product-
ivity fell by an aggregate seasonally average
of almost 4%4within the ensuing 12-month
period; in the corporate sector the figure was
as high as 5%. Declines on such a scale had
not been witnessed for decades. This couldbe due to the fact that the working hours of
staff working in firms’ administration, sales
and development departments were cut back
much less than those of employees directly
engaged in the production of goods. For ex-
ample, the Ifo Investment Survey shows that,
during the crisis, many enterprises made ef-
forts to maintain sales markets and develop
new customer bases, not least by means of
product innovations. By contrast, there was
a less marked closure of entire production
sites – which would have affected not only
production itself but also associated services.
This is also suggested by the fact that, unlike
in earlier economic downturns, corporate in-
vestment decisions were not focused on the
rationalisation motive.
There was a marked increase in unit labour
costs owing to the fact that labour costs did
not decline as much as hourly productivity. In
the whole economy, the increase peaked at a
seasonally adjusted 31/C254% and was signifi-
cantly higher in the industrial sector at 4%.
This was due not only to the costs incurred by
employers as a result of partial compensatory
pay in the case of reductions in weekly work-
ing hours and short-time working. Working
time accounts also played a part in this: with
a fixed labour income geared, say, to stand-
ard weekly working hours, flexible working
arrangements along with a buoyant orders
tend to result in more hours being worked
than remunerated. In a cyclical downturn, thisLess volatility

64situation is reversed. The resulting changes in
unit labour costs are temporary and automat-
ically associated with additional or lower rev-
enues for the employer, possibly subject to
phase shifts. This does not affect enterprises’
profitability per se in the medium term as
long as the resulting fluctuations in liquidity
can be absorbed on the financing side, espe-
cially during downturns (see pages 36 to 43).Overall hourly productivity began to pick up
slowly from the second quarter of 2009, but
has been increasing quite sharply of late.
Even so, no more than just over 60% of the
earlier downturn has been recovered. The up-
turn nevertheless had a perceptibly dampen-
ing impact on unit labour costs, especially as
there has been a significant slowing of the
growth in hourly earnings. The 2010 pay
round focused on the objective of safeguard-
ing employment. For the first time since the
Second World War, the unions in a number of
major manufacturing sectors, such as the
metal-working and electrical engineering
sector and in the chemicals industry, entered
negotiations without any specific wage de-
mands. In these sectors, like in the private
and public banking sectors, no regular in-
creases in pay rates were agreed for the cur-
rent year. Instead, only one-off payments
were arranged, which, in some cases, can be
staggered according to firms’ performance
and profitability. At the time these settle-
ments were concluded, there was an excep-
tionally high level of uncertainty about the
future outlook for the economy. The social
partners in the individual sectors countered
this in different ways. The very short duration
of the agreement in the chemicals industry
makes no commitment for the coming year.
By contrast, both parties in the metal-
working and electrical engineering industry
agreed a quite considerable increase in in-
come in percentage terms. In the agreements
concluded during the crisis, regular increases
in pay rates were very moderate overall. The

65negotiated wages, therefore fell quite steadily
from 3.0% in the first quarter of 2008 to
1.4% in August 2010. In manufacturing,
they were no more than 0.6% up on the year
at the current end, compared with 3.1% one
year earlier.
The financial and economic crisis has brought
about a huge change in the relationships be-
tween output, labour input and labour costs
within a relatively short space of time. Econo-
metric studies using a vector error correction
model suggest that, despite substantial cor-
rections since the second quarter of 2009,
there is still a considerable deviation from the
long-term relationships at the current end
(for further information, see pages 66 and 67).
The recovery in hourly productivity will prob-
ably persist for a time for purely cyclical rea-
sons, while safeguarding the successes in em-
ployment in the longer term will depend, in
particular, on whether the social partners
continue acting with sound judgement.
Labour market matching in the context of
accelerated structural change again and
increasing labour market participation
In downturns, the labour market is usually
not only usually placed under cyclical strain,
there are also often structural shifts. The abil-
ity of the labour market to function smoothly
then has to be demonstrated by matching,
with as little friction as possible, the potential
workforce to the enterprises’ demand for la-
bour, which may also be characterised by
changes in required skills. This matching func-
tion was undoubtedly strengthened by theresolute policy of reform adopted in the first
half of the past decade. Nevertheless, an alle-
viating factor in the prior upswing was a tem-
porary slowdown in the pace of structural
change in favour of the tertiary sector.5
Owing to the financial and economic crisis,
this process has picked up speed again. So
far, the effects of these gradual shifts can be
identified only in outline. It does seem, how-
ever, that labour market matching has not
suffered significantly thus far. Given flexible
forms of employment and improved job
placement mechanisms, workers released in
those sectors of the economy that were se-
verely affected by the crisis generally have
good prospects of being re-employed given a
setting where these sectors are experiencing
a rapid cyclical recovery. A considerable part
of the increase in employment in the services
sectors derived from the reservoir of persons
who had previously been inactive.
During the financial and economic crisis,
there was a noticeable rise in unemployment
only in the period from the final quarter of
2008 up to the final quarter of 2009 based
on the Federal Employment Agency’s extend-
ed definition of underemployment, which
was not subject to any methodological
change in measurement in the period under
consideration. The increase amounted to no
more than around 450,000 in seasonally ad-
justed terms, which was significantly lower
than in earlier recessionary periods. Roughly
three-quarters of the increase in registered
unemployment was due to persons receiving

66Deutsche BundesbankDoes the relatively moderate adjustment of hours worked during the crisis indicate a change in 
enterprises’ demand for labour?
In the wake of the slump in demand in the fourth quarter 
of 2008 and the ﬁ  rst quarter of 2009, German ﬁ  rms made a 
massive cutback in production. Given the extremely subdued 
adjustment of employment, not even the perceptible reduc-
tion in weekly hours worked by the employees was able to 
prevent a considerable decline in hourly productivity. At the 
same time, a further consequence of the crisis was an increase 
in hourly wage costs. Indeed, the cost-earnings ratio of a 
working hour deteriorated substantially within a few months. 
It is of particular interest in this context to ask why enterprises 
evidently departed from their earlier patterns of behaviour 
and did not respond in the short term with stronger adjust-
ments to labour input.
Apart from short-term control mechanisms like temporary 
work and operating leasing, the allocation of the factors of 
production is planned in the medium to long term under 
uncertainty. The differences between actual demand and 
sales planning is a key factor with regard to the volatility of 
a ﬁ rm’s operating surplus because the future orders situation 
is generally less easy to predict than goods and factor prices. 
For instance, prior to the slump in earnings following the eco-
nomic downturn, several sectors posted record results owing 
to unexpectedly high demand. Therefore, the relationship 
between output, labour input and wage costs should not be 
regarded as a “snapshot” but be examined, in a longer-term 
context, using a suitable criterion.
An established reference point of this kind is the labour 
demand function derived from a cost-minimisation approach 
which makes the plausible assumption that enterprises 
are in a position to determine the factor input required to 
produce a speciﬁ  c output at given goods and factor prices. 
Assuming further a production function with the time-invari-
ant elasticity of substitution σ between the primary factors, 
labour and capital, as well as constant returns to scale and 
labour-augmenting technological progress, which grows at 
the unchanged rate θ per time unit, then the ﬁ  rst-order condi-
tions result in the following equation for determining labour 
input L, measured in hours worked during the period t
ln Lt = ln Lo – σ ln Wt + ln Yt – (1 – σ) θt ,
where W denotes the real hourly wage and Y the output of 
goods.In this context, the macroeconomic variables are regarded 
as endogenous and non-stationary. For the empirical study, 
which is based on the time series of hours worked, value 
added (at basic prices) and real compensation per hours 
worked – all series refer to the whole economy – it is therefore 
advisable to specify a vector error correction model, provided 
cointegration can be established. Statistical tests in the sam-
ple from the ﬁ  rst quarter of 1970 up to the second quarter of 
2010 support the hypothesis that there is precisely one linear 
combination between the time series, taking into account a 
linear trend and the step dummy variable s91,1 from which 
stationary residuals result. The estimation of the cointegrat-
ing relation yields 2

 (0.08) (0.0005) (0.016) (0.19)
The long-run equilibrium relationship between the variables 
can thus be identiﬁ  ed as the labour demand function derived 
from economic theory.
The positive long-term residuals ε since the beginning of the 
crisis may be interpreted as indicating that actual labour input 
was greater than the number of hours worked that should

long-run equilibrium in a scenario where output would have been

67be needed to produce in terms of cost efﬁ  ciency the demand 
for goods with the given production structures, especially the ﬁ xed capital stock, and real wages. At its cyclical low in the ﬁ  rst 
quarter of 2009, hours worked exceeded this reference by 5% and the overhang of 3% at the current end is extremely high compared with the deviations observed prior to the crisis. The extent of labour hoarding in the past two years can therefore be described as exceptional. However, the residual analysis also illustrates markedly negative deviations from the long-run equilibrium at the end of the preceding upswing. This was due mainly to the fact that hours worked expanded so rapidly that it was not possible to adjust the capital stock suf-ﬁ ciently, which per se  dampened the marginal productivity of 
labour.
3 Taking the two observations together, it follows that 
around one-third of the rapid shift in the cost-earnings ratio in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the ﬁ  rst quarter of 2009 is 
to be seen as a return to the long-term normal position.
In purely statistical terms, the concentration of exception-
ally high residual values at the end of the sample suggests 
that a structural break may have occurred in the long-run equilibrium relationship as a result of the crisis.
4 It would, 
however, be premature to draw this conclusion insofar as the 
adjustment processes, which naturally take longer following a shock on this scale, are not yet over. To assess whether hours 
worked and wage costs are adjusting in a signiﬁ  cantly differ-
ent manner than hitherto, hypothetical response paths are simulated from the model structure for both variables start-
ing at the beginning of the recovery in the second quarter 
of 2009. The results are conditioned on the observed time proﬁ le of output, meaning that the simulated path of both 
labour market variables is inﬂ  uenced not only by the decline 
in demand in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the ﬁ  rst quarter 
of 2009 but also by the cyclical recovery which followed.
5
The study clearly illustrates that hours worked in the crisis were not adjusted downwards to the extent that would have 
been expected according to the response pattern determined using the (conditional) vector error correction model. The 
difference, which – even if statistical uncertainties are taken 
into account – is different from zero, increased throughout 2009 and in the ﬁ  rst half of 2010 accounted for 3½% of 
hours worked. By contrast, with respect to real hourly wage 
compensation there has so far been no signiﬁ  cant divergence 
between actual developments and the simulated path.The analysis suggests that enterprises showed a relatively 
strong demand for labour in the crisis, not just from a cyclical perspective but also structurally. This may be due in part, ﬁ  rst, 
to the greater scope afforded to ﬁ  rms as a result of making 
the labour market more ﬂ  exible over the past decade, which 
is therefore incorporated only to some extent in the response 
pattern of the model, which is derived from developments 
over the past forty years. As a result, this additional room for 
manoeuvre has the effect of reducing staff planning costs, including the associated risks. Second, expectation effects are 
also likely to have played a part. Since the medium-term out-
look for sales was evidently regarded as not severely affected, ﬁ rms undertook little rationalisation. Moreover, the prospect 
of an increasing likelihood of shortages in the labour supply 
may have affected the demand for labour in advance.

made therein that the economic recovery and the crisis-induced slump in output were not affected in advance by developments in the labour market can be justiﬁ  ed by the fact that the pronounced ﬂ  uctuations in

in this short time-frame the interaction between output and employ-ment (not considered here), which generally only becomes apparent with a certain time lag, is probably of very limited importance.Adjustment of hours worke d and wage

68unemployment benefits under the statutory
insurance scheme and has now largely gone
back down again, which suggests a largely
cyclical effect. Furthermore, the number of
unemployed persons receiving the basic al-
lowance has shown comparatively little
movement in the past two years. Even as
things stand at present, the situation with
regard to aggregate underemployment is
more or less as favourable as in the thirdquarter of 2008, even though only around
three-fifths of the crisis-induced decline in
output has been recovered so far.
This finding is also notable in view of the fact
that the supply of labour increased through-
out the crisis, with higher labour market par-
ticipation being the key factor. There has
been an observable trend rise in labour mar-
ket participation for a long time, although
cyclical downturns typically slow down this
process temporarily. The unusual response of
participation in this downturn is not inconsist-
ent with the standard transmission channels;
it is, in fact, a further consequence of the spe-
cific adjustment pattern in the labour market.
The marginal rise in unemployment largely re-
moved the basis for the “discouraged work-
er” effect, which is expected to be substantial
under normal circumstances. Moreover, early
retirement has become financially less attract-
ive than it used to be. It was only in the final
quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009
that inflows into unemployment among the
group of 55 to 64-year olds were slightly
higher than the corresponding outflows.
While the net inflow rate of workers aged be-
tween 25 and 54 was in positive territory only
for a little longer, young members of the la-
bour force, in particular, were again affected
by unemployment during the crisis.
The growing demand for labour in the
healthcare and education sectors benefited
mostly women, which is also indicated by the
rise in part-time employment, part of which
was (re)activated from the latent labour
force. There were opposing trends in male
and female unemployment. The quite percep-Indicators of unemployment

69tible loss of jobs in industry led to a seasonally
adjusted rise in the male unemployment rateof more than 1 percentage point in theperiod from the fourth quarter of 2008 up tothe fourth quarter of 2009. The correspond-ing female unemployment rate has been on atrend decline for years. In the first half of2009, this process was interrupted for a shorttime. Even though more men have found em-ployment again in the wake of the economicrecovery, the unemployment rate amongwomen is still lower than that of men.
It is due, above all, to the increased cyclical re-
silience of the labour market that unemploy-ment is currently much lower than a fewyears ago, even though the economic slumphas not yet been entirely overcome. It is alsonotable that the sectoral reallocation pro-
cesses have evidently not increased structuralunemployment and are, furthermore, encour-aging labour market participation. Even so,the number of persons in the labour force notobtaining a job in the non-assisted labourmarket is still too high. It therefore still re-mains a major economic policy task to adaptthe general conditions so that additionalemployment opportunities are created byenterprises and incentives to take up employ-ment are strengthened. This mainly concernsthe low-skilled and long-term unemployed. Agovernment guarantee of high sector-specificminimum wages is not a strategy that prom-ises success. It runs counter to the desiredrecovery in the tertiary sector that is underway.

71Fiscal policy
The financial and economic crisis brought with it extreme levels of uncertainty and the risk of
severe macroeconomic disturbance and damage. In this environment, public finances have madea major contribution to stabilisation in Germany. This was chiefly due to the fact that althoughpublic finances themselves deteriorated dramatically, the confidence in their long-term sustain-ability did not. The automatic stabilisers played a timely part in supporting overall economicmomentum. This effect was supplemented by cuts in tax and social contribution rates and higherspending. In order to safeguard the stability of the financial markets, extensive schemes werelaunched to support financial institutions, as was also the case in other countries. In connectionwith the sovereign debt crisis in some euro-area countries, Greece was granted a loan, and po-tential refinancing problems in other euro-area countries were forestalled by issuing implicit guar-antees of EU aid as well as explicit guarantees of a temporary European rescue mechanism.
Given the potential dangers, decisive fiscal policy responses were appropriate. However, the way
in which some of these policies have been implemented is to be viewed critically, and the funda-mental problems associated with actively managing the economy again became apparent. Thefinal assessment of fiscal policy during the crisis will ultimately depend on whether it is possibleto reduce the high structural deficit and quickly rein in both the soaring debt ratio and risksemanating from guarantees.
Compliance with the new national debt brake is essential in this situation. In the European con-
text, the key lesson to be learnt from the crisis is the need to improve rules to safeguard soundpublic finances at European level. The existing fiscal framework failed to prevent the emergenceof critical financial developments in some countries. Moreover, the crisis stretched the fiscalframework to breaking point, exposing its shortcomings and revealing the need for reform. Aslong as the euro-area countries continue to be responsible for their own national fiscal policy,rigorous compliance with the agreed budgetary rules has to be ensured so as to obviate the needfor support measures to ward off the danger of serious repercussions. As a last resort, the restruc-turing of a country’s sovereign debt should also be an option, although a suitable frameworkshould be established for this to ensure that financial stability is not jeopardised. In addition,wider macroeconomic surveillance might help to identify severe distortions and imbalances earl-ier. However, ongoing macro-management of the economy is neither promising nor advisable –both at national and international level.

72The effects of the crisis on German public
finances
Dramatic worsening of public finances
since crisis broke out
In the years prior to the financial and eco-
nomic crisis, the public finance situation in
Germany improved perceptibly. Although the
debt ratio, at around 65%, breached the
reference value specified in the common
European regulations, the general govern-
ment budget was all in all balanced in 2007
and 2008. The slump in macroeconomic
activity that began in the second half of 2008
did not impinge on the 2008 budgets and,
for the year as a whole, the overall economic
environment was in fact still very favourable
for public finances.1In 2009, however, the
deficit ratio jumped to 3%. Based on current
assessments, this figure is set to go up again
in 2010 although, thanks to the brightening
macroeconomic setting, the deficit ratio
could remain well below the 4% mark. The
wide financing gap is likely to be primarily
structural. The debt ratio has soared and last
year already reached 731/C252%. A further sharp
rise is likely in 2010. In addition, there are
extensive risks, in particular due to govern-
ment support measures for the financial
markets, the bulk of which took the form of
guarantees. On the whole, the situation of
public finances is now much worse than it
was before the crisis.
Automatic stabilisers
The automatic stabilisers, ie rising govern-
ment spending on the labour market in thewake of the downturn and concomitant
shortfalls in revenue from taxes and social
contributions, made a major contribution to
the deterioration of the fiscal balance in
2009.2The size of the impact was consider-
ably dampened, though, because the vari-
ables that are particularly relevant for public
finances – unemployment, gross wages and
salaries, and private consumption – de-
veloped more steadily than GDP , which con-
tracted sharply (see the chart on page 73).3
By contrast, revenue from profit-related taxes
plummeted after having recorded extremely
sharp growth up to and including 2008.
Overall, approximately 340 billion, or 11/C252%o f
GDP , of the deterioration in the fiscal balance
in 2009 is likely to be attributable to the
effects of the automatic stabilisers. In add-
ition, there were shortfalls in profit-related
taxes in the order of1/C252% of GDP , which can
be interpreted as a correction of excessive
revenue growth in the previous upturn.4
1The cyclical component of the fiscal balance is calcu-
lated here using the disaggregated framework which is
employed in the ESCB, see Deutsche Bundesbank, A dis-
aggregated framework for analysing public finances:
Germany’s fiscal track record between 2000 and 2005,
Monthly Report, March 2006, pp 61-76.
2For the purposes of this article, the fiscal impact of the
automatic stabilisers is equated to the change in the cyc-
lical component of the general government deficit ratio.
3This has been taken into account here by applying a
disaggregated cyclical adjustment method rather than an
aggregated approach based solely on GDP .
4As revisions to macroeconomic forecasts also lead to a
reassessment of the respective shares of the cyclical and
trend components of economic growth, the above-
mentioned estimates regarding the automatic stabilisers
are provisional. For an analysis of the development of
revenue from profit-related taxes, see Deutsche Bundes-
bank, Development of tax revenue in Germany and
current tax policy issues, Monthly Report, October 2008,
pp 33-57, as well as R Morris et al (2009), Explaining

73The counterswing in profit-related taxes
might well run its course in 2010, while theeconomic recovery is likely to perceptibly im-prove the budget position via the automaticstabilisers (just under
1/C252% of GDP). Mirroring
last year’s divergent development, the strongeconomic recovery will, however, not improvethe deficit to the same extent as the sharpGDP growth suggests.
Expansionary fiscal measuresIn addition to the automatic stabilisers, fiscal
policymakers in Germany – and in a numberof other countries – responded proactively tothe economic slump with comprehensive sta-bilisation measures. However, initiatives expli-citly taken to support economic momentumcannot be unambiguously distinguished fromother fiscal measures and, in any case, sucha distinction would not be appropriate forevaluating fiscal policy. The following analysisis therefore based on an estimate of the over-all impact that fiscal policy measures have onthe deficit.
5Of particular importance was the
fiscal loosening announced in October 2008followed by the two economic stimulus pack-ages, one in November 2008 and one inJanuary 2009
6, and a smaller package of
measures in mid-2009. At the end of 2009,further relief measures were implemented(see the table on page 74).
Overall, the fiscal measures pushed up the
deficit by 1
1/C252% of GDP in 2009 and by a fur-
ther 1% of GDP in 2010. In terms of the fi-nancial volume, tax cuts, which are predom-inantly of a permanent nature, are particularlyrelevant on the revenue side. They are supple-mented on the expenditure side by govern-
ment investment, increases in child benefit,the car scrappage scheme and measures tosupport the labour market ( inter alia more
generous arrangements for short-time work-ing benefits, see pages 61 to 63). All in all,less than half of the impact on the deficit is ofa temporary nature, and a number of thosemeasures that are temporary will only bephased out slowly.GDP, private consumption

75Special measures to stabilise financial
institutions and euro-area member states
In addition to the above-mentioned fiscal
measures, extensive support measures for fi-nancial institutions were taken in order to dir-ectly limit the consequences of the crisis onfinancial markets. For instance, Industriekredit-bank (IKB) received support from the KfWbanking group and the German governmentas early as 2007 and 2008 and was later sold.Following the insolvency of Lehman Brothersand the ensuing escalation of liquidity andsolvency problems in the financial sector, aspecial Federal fund – the Financial MarketStabilisation Fund ( Sonderfonds Finanzmarkt-
stabilisierung, SoFFin)
7– was set up in Octo-
ber 2008 to prevent serious repercussions forthe real economy resulting from the possiblecollapse of further systemically importantfinancial institutions in the wake of the crisis.SoFFin is assigned to the general governmentsector and its purpose is to stabilise domesticfinancial institutions by means of guarantees(up to a maximum of 3400 billion), recapitali-
sations and risk assumptions (up to the limitsof the maximum credit facility of 380 billion).
In July 2009, “bad bank” and consolidationmodels were adopted under which financialassets subject to a severe impairment risk aswell as (in the consolidation model) risk pos-itions and individual business units can behived off to government-backed special pur-pose entities. In addition, a number of Federalstates notably gave assistance to state-ownedfinancial institutions (WestLB, BayernLB, HSHNordbank, LBBW, SachsenLB, NordLB) bymeans of capital injections or guarantees forsecuring or hiving off risk assets and for issu-
ing bank debt securities.
In a number of euro-area member states,
public finances deteriorated – not wholly butpartly due to the crisis – to such an extentthat doubts arose as to their solvency. The re-sulting risks came to a dramatic head. As aresult, in May 2010 the euro-area financeministers and the IMF decided to support thenecessary consolidation process in Greece,which faced an acute risk of insolvency, bygranting a loan based on strict conditionality.The aim was to prevent contagion effectsfrom jeopardising the stability of the entireeuro-area financial system. Even before theeuro-area finance ministers could finalise thepackage, the situation on the capital marketsescalated. They therefore agreed on a Euro-pean Stabilisation Mechanism comprisingtwo modules which can be used to grantloans subject to various conditions, especiallyconsolidation requirements. In the first mod-ule, the European Financial StabilisationMechanism (EFSM), which has an unlimitedduration, is provided with an EU credit lineequivalent to 360 billion.

76Deutsche BundesbankEffects of the interventions to support financial institutions and euro-area countries
on the Maastricht deficit and debt level
The Maastricht deficit and the Maastricht debt level play a
pivotal role in the European fiscal framework. They are
essentially calculated on the basis of the rules established by
the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 95), which stipu-
late that transactions should be recorded in such a way as to
reflect the economic reality behind them. In individual cases,
this can mean, for example, that entities or transactions that
are not recorded directly in government budgets are attrib-
uted to general government in the national accounts. Re-
sponsibility for providing a concrete interpretation of the
ESA rules – the need for which has become apparent in some
cases – and for monitoring their application lies with Euro-
stat. However, in view of the high complexity of the under-
lying transactions, the difficulties sometimes experienced
when categorising transactions within the elaborate system
of rules, existing alternative booking and accounting options
and occasional information deficiencies, it cannot be ruled
out that interventions of a similar economic substance may
ultimately be recorded differently. It is therefore crucial for
the EU budget rules in particular that statistical recording is
transparent and free from political influence.
The Maastricht deficit and gross debt level are intended to
function as indicators which, as far as possible, measure the
fiscal situation in a way that is precise, allows comparability
over time and across countries and enables a prompt imple-
mentation of budgetary surveillance. The Maastricht deficit
reflects the change in general government net financial
assets/liabilities caused by transactions. The Maastricht debt
level records general government gross debt (at nominal
values).1Of course, this indebtedness represents only part of
the government’s overall fiscal position and takes no account
of existing financial or non-financial assets. For example,
debt-financed acquisitions of financial assets increase gross
debt, whereas the change in the net asset position depends
on the underlying value of the financial assets acquired.
Valuation issues are particularly complicated in the context
of public interventions during financial market crises.
Interventions to support financial institutions2
The aim of public interventions providing direct support to
financial institutions can be to improve solvency, such as
through recapitalisations or assistance in the area of risk
positions. However, they can also be targeted at improving
the liquidity situation, often through guarantees for bank
debt securities.
From the onset of the financial market crisis until the end of
the first half of 2010, government recapitalisations amount-ing to a total of 5471/C252billion were conducted in Germany
(see table on p 78). In the statistics, such recapitalisations are
usually only recorded in full as financial asset acquisitions if
the government is acting in a similar way to a private invest-
or, with corresponding expectations of a return on the in-
vestment. Then, the deficit is not affected, although the
gross debt level increases if the transaction is debt-financed.
To facilitate statistical recording in times of crisis, when un-
certainty is high, a Eurostat decision announced in July 2009
stipulates that recapitalisations are, as a general rule, to be
recorded as having no impact on the deficit if the EU State
Aid rules on rates of return are complied with. By contrast,
deficit-increasing capital transfers are booked if capital re-
serves are increased at banks which have been recording
losses for several periods and if no additional ownership
rights or other entitlements to return are acquired (such as in
the case of HRE). A deficit is likewise recorded if a recapital-
isation exceeds the sales proceeds achieved through a timely
privatisation (as in the case of IKB). In total, 571/C252billion of
the capital measures in Germany were recorded in the
deficit.
The offloading of financial institutions’ risk positions to
external entities often occurs at above-market prices. These
entities thus take on market value losses and the risks associ-
ated with future performance, which – in the case of settle-
ment via special purpose entities backed and controlled by
general government – is a key reason for them being classi-
fied in the general government sector.3The government
backing can take the form of guarantees, capital or a com-
bination of the two. This generally leads to a reduction in
the balance sheet of the institution receiving the support,
while the general government balance sheet is extended and
the gross debt level (ie without deduction of the assets ac-
quired) rises. The direct impact on the deficit corresponds to
the difference between the purchase price4and the market
price. By contrast, subsequent (unrealised or realised) de-
creases in value have no further impact on the deficit (as
they are booked as revaluations)5, although they would
curtail the reduction in gross indebtedness resulting from
realisation. Owing to valuation problems during the finan-
cial crisis, the Eurostat decision of July 2009 allows for alter-
native approaches to approximating market prices, although
in most cases – contrary to the usual procedure – subsequent
(realised) asset losses are to be booked as having an impact
on the deficit. As things stand, a total of 565 billion from the
First Winding-up Agency ( Erste Abwicklungsanstalt ), includ-
ing Phoenix (WestLB) and the special purpose entity Sealink-
Funding (SachsenLB) set up in 2008, is included in Germany’s
debt level. On the basis of the available valuations, the effect

include implicit liabilities, such as those arising from a pay-as-you-go
pension system, or potential liabilities, such as those resulting from
guarantees. — 2In July 2009, a special Eurostat decision was pub-

77on the deficit was confined to just under 521/C252billion. Pursu-
ant to the Eurostat decision, further deficits could arise in
the future wherever market prices were not taken as the
basis for calculations. According to the Federal Ministry of
Finance, the potential impact on the debt level arising from
the transfer of assets to the HRE resolution agency at the end
of the third quarter could reach 81/C252% of GDP.
Government guarantees are contingent liabilities and are
usually only recorded once they have been called. The guar-
antees provided in the context of the financial market sup-
port measures amounted to around 51821/C252billion in mid-
2010. This figure does not include guarantees for entities
which are already classified in the general government sector
or – as in the case of the LBBW entity – are collateralised by a
debt-financed deposit and are thus already reflected in the
debt level. Most of the 51821/C252billion was accounted for by
guarantees from the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund
(Sonderfonds Finanzmarktstabilisierung orSoFFin ) on debt
securities issued by financial institutions that should general-
ly have an adequate capital base, meaning that the probabil-
ity of a call on the guarantees is likely to remain low. How-
ever, guarantees of just under 515 billion were also provided
for risky bank assets (BayernLB, HSH Nordbank); the likeli-
hood of a call on these guarantees could well be consider-
ably higher, leading in some cases to corresponding commit-
ment appropriations in the budgets.
As a basic principle, ESA provides for transactions to be
classified according to the economic reality that they reflect.
Eurostat initially decided that the KfW banking group’s inter-
vention to support IKB in 2007 should be recorded in the
central government budget even though KfW itself belongs
to the financial corporations sector. In Eurostat’s view, it was
clear that KfW had not acted in its own business interests
but, ultimately, on behalf of the Federal Government in
order to safeguard financial market stability in Germany.
However, Eurostat reversed this assessment in its decision of
July 2009, stipulating that written or other irrefutable evi-
dence that the institution was acting on government instruc-
tions was a precondition for such a reclassification. The losses
recorded by KfW in the course of the IKB rescue (almost 581/C252
billion) now have only an indirect effect on government ac-
counts through a devaluation of its shareholding in KfW,
which is recorded as having no impact on the deficit.
Interventions to support euro-area countriesFor the loans to Greece – provided, in Germany’s case, via
KfW by means of an official assignment backed by a guaran-tee from the Federal Government – there is irrefutable evi-
dence that KfW is acting on government instructions.
6The
associated exposures incurred by KfW are attributed to
general government in the national accounts, ie as a loan
from the Federal Government of Germany to Greece
financed through notional borrowing from KfW. Up to the
end of the first half of 2010, 541/C252billion (of a total of 5221/C252
billion planned for the period up to 2013) was booked for
the first tranche as increasing the debt level.
If the EFSF were to grant loans to euro-area countries in diffi-
culty, it would likewise seem appropriate to record this as
increasing the debt level in the accounts of the member
states providing the guarantee. In accordance with the Euro-
group agreements reached at the beginning of June 2010,
loans are to be provided as required via a special purpose
vehicle established under Luxembourgish law. The euro-area
member states guarantee its funding in accordance with
their share in the paid-up capital of the ECB.7All key deci-
sions regarding the granting of lending facilities or the dis-
bursement of funds must be taken unanimously by the coun-
tries providing the guarantee. The special purpose vehicle
itself does not take any decisions on whether to disburse
loans; ultimately, it merely implements support measures on
behalf and at the risk of the euro-area countries. While the
guarantee undertakings themselves are not initially booked
in the national accounts, if the special purpose vehicle were
to take up or grant loans on the instruction of the countries
providing the guarantee, this would – like Germany’s lending
to Greece via KfW – need to be recorded as having an impact
on the debt level of the guarantor states. The gross debt
level and the stock of financial assets would rise accordingly.
By contrast, the deficit would probably only be affected in
the event of defaults in the form of debt cancellations.
Although a final decision regarding the statistical recording
of such transactions has yet to be reached, at the most recent
meeting of the Committee on Monetary, Financial and
Balance of Payments Statistics (CMFB) in July 2010, Eurostat
expressed its support for booking them in such a way that
the debt level increases. This would seem appropriate given
the orientation towards reflecting the economic reality be-
hind transactions. Furthermore, the alternative of establish-
ing “off-balance-sheet” mechanisms, which could be used to
implement fiscal policy measures above and beyond the
existing borrowing limits, would run counter to the reform
objective, namely the strengthening of fiscal discipline and
statistical rigour, and could potentially create new leeway
for bypassing budgetary rules.
control if the expected losses are small in comparison with their liabil-
ities resulting from these activities. — 4When calculating the pur-
chase price, account would have to be taken of any nominal capitalamount contributed to the government resolution agency by thetransferring institution. Naturally, this does not alter the fact that theESA balance sheet of such a government special purpose entity wouldusually be likely to show negative capital on the basis of marketvalues. — 5However, this is not true of debt cancellations, whichconstitute transactions and must, in all cases, be booked as a capital
transfer. — 6The basis for this is the Monetary Union Financial Stabil-
ity Act (W/C228hrungsunion-Finanzstabilit/C228tsgesetz) passed on 7 May2010. — 7In Germany, the guarantee provision is based on the Act
Assuming Guarantees in Connection with a European StabilisationMechanism (Gesetz zur /C220bernahme von Gew/C228hrleistungen im Rah-men eines europ/C228ischen Stabilisierungsmechanismus) of 22 May2010.

aged that the Facility will generally operate in
tandem with the IMF, as was the case with
the aid granted to Greece. Ultimately, the
risks arising from potential loans under the
two modules are borne by the member coun-

The measures to support financial institutions
and euro-area countries facing imminent
solvency problems entail large burdens and
risks for public finances in Germany. How-
ever, these are only partly reflected in the
Maastricht ratios on which public attention is
usually focused. In particular, underwriting
guarantees appear in the ratios as contingent
liabilities as a rule only once they have beentaken up (see also the box on pages 76
and 77).
On balance, the support measures for finan-
cial institutions in Germany increased the def-
icit by 0.1% of GDP in both 2008 and 2009
and the debt level by a total of 4% of GDP by
the end of 2009.10The government guaran-
tees for financial institutions granted on ac-

level by a further 1% of GDP .12Additional
debt amounting to 1% of GDP is expected to

79tioned gross debt is statistically offset by a
corresponding formation of assets (eg in the
form of a credit claim), the government may
remain saddled with asset losses after its cur-
rent intervention expires. Reliably quantifying
the extent to which the guarantees assumed
to date will eventually turn into financial bur-
dens is currently just as difficult as assessing
the risks from other fiscal and monetary sta-
bilisation measures. Furthermore, SoFFin’s fa-
cilities can still be applied for until the end of
the year.13Moreover, other member states
could take up loans from either module of
the European Stabilisation Mechanism. Lastly,
Germany bears financial risks as a shareholder
of the IMF and, to the extent of its paid-up
capital share in the ECB, owing to the exten-
sion of the Eurosystem’s eligible collateral
framework and the bond purchase pro-
gramme which the Eurosystem launched in
May 2010.
Assessing the fiscal stabilisation impact
After the sharp slump in economic activity in
the latter part of 2008 and the first part of
2009, the German economy began to stabil-
ise in the second quarter of 2009 and is now
growing again at a considerable pace. Al-
though uncertainty persists, the financial
markets are also currently in much better
shape than they were at the peaks of the vari-
ous phases of the crisis. It is extremely diffi-
cult, however, to gauge the extent to which
this is attributable to the fiscal measures
taken. It is particularly hard to assess the ef-
fects of measures to stabilise the financial
markets and possible alternative courses ofaction. All in all, had no measures been taken
to support the financial markets, the econ-
omy would have run the danger of plunging
into an even more dramatic downturn, so
that the impact of the stabilisation measures,
albeit not quantifiable, may be assessed as
being very large.
It appears more feasible to quantify the im-
pact of other fiscal measures and of the auto-
matic stabilisers. Yet it must be pointed out
that the results vary from model to model
and that it is especially difficult to model the
peculiarities of the financial and economic cri-
sis. On the one hand, given the extremely
high level of uncertainty and the significant
deterioration in public finances, the fiscal
measures adopted to boost macroeconomic
demand may have been counteracted to a
greater degree than usual by increased pre-
cautionary saving and efforts to partially com-
pensate for asset losses sustained. Further-
more, the fact that many German enterprises
were in a positive financial position when the
crisis hit is likely to have helped them survive
without government aid. On the other hand,
capacities were seriously underutilised, the
capital markets appeared to consider the
long-term sustainability of German public fi-
nances not to be severely impaired, and gov-
ernment action to combat the crisis may have
boosted confidence in its ability to overcome
it. Finally, models are generally not designed
to consider the extent to which the economy
might have nosedived into a spiralling macro-

80economic downturn with mutually reinfor-
cing feedback effects between the real econ-
omy and the financial system.
According to a simulation using the Bundes-
bank’s macroeconomic model, the decline in
real GDP in 2009 would have been around
1 percentage point stronger before factoring
in the deficit-increasing measures amounting
to 11/C252% of GDP . This was chiefly attributable
to the car scrappage scheme which triggered
considerable frontloading effects.14The auto-
matic stabilisers additionally curbed the de-
cline in GDP by a similar magnitude. By con-
trast, the model suggests that the exceptional
development of profit-related taxes men-
tioned above is likely to have generated only
a small stabilising effect. Overall, the model
simulation shows that discretionary measures
and the automatic stabilisers had a positive
effect of roughly 2% on GDP in 2009.
Fiscal measures will raise the deficit ratio fur-
ther in 2010 by approximately 1 percentage
point. Yet the net growth effect will amount
to little more than1/C252percentage point, not
least owing to the sharp curbing of demand
following the ending of the car scrappage
scheme. By contrast, the automatic stabilisers
will tend to trim the deficit thanks to the posi-
tive overall economic momentum, although
the fact that the macroeconomic growth
structure (unlike in 2009) is now less favour-
able for public finances will dampen this ef-
fect (see chart on page 73).Assessing fiscal policy during the crisis
In principle, fiscal policy can play an im-
portant role in stabilising financial markets
and macroeconomic development. However,
a crucial requirement for this is sound public
finances. Developments in a number of EU
countries during the crisis have shown that
rising general government deficits and debt
can actually have a destabilising effect if con-
fidence in the long-term sustainability of pub-
lic finances dwindles.
In the exceptional situation of the financial
and economic crisis, it was appropriate for
the German government to stabilise domestic
financial institutions as well as – as the crisis
progressed – other EU states. There was a
danger of even greater disruptions to the fi-
nancial markets with severe implications for
the real economy. However, the aim for the
future should be to reform the regulation and
supervision of financial markets with a view
to more reliably underpinning financial stabil-
ity and generally enhancing the individual re-
sponsibility of market players so as to nip dis-
tortionary developments in the bud, wherever
possible without necessitating government
aid. The rules for public finances stipulated at
European level require a complete overhaul,
14Whereas the car scrappage scheme caused a net rise
of around1/C254% in GDP in 2009, its discontinuation is hav-
ing an even greater reverse impact in 2010 as not only
the additional demand generated in 2009 but also the
consumption that was brought forward has now
dropped out. Furthermore, the calculations also take ac-
count of the fact that the automatic stabilisers would
have had a greater impact had there been no discretion-
ary measures, thus curbing the decline in GDP to a larger
extent. By contrast, the effects of measures that do not
affect the deficit, such as guarantees and support meas-
ures for the financial sector, on economic development
are generally disregarded.Decline in GDP

81not least with these aims in mind (see
pages 83 to 84).
In the recent crisis, the automatic stabilisers
likewise made a timely and perceptible contri-bution to stabilisation and significantly miti-gated the economic slump. The automaticstabilisers are particularly suited to smoothingcyclical fluctuations through the vehicle ofpublic finances as they are not reliant on pro-tracted discussion and decision-making pro-cesses and operate symmetrically over thebusiness cycle.
Recent experience confirms that using fiscal
policy to actively stimulate the economyshould be viewed sceptically. However, in theexceptional situation of the crisis it was justifi-able and useful to provide an expansionaryfiscal stimulus, even if this has once againhighlighted the concrete problems that areassociated with such an interventionist policy.
The fundamental objective of a fiscal stimulus
is to boost economic activity by temporarilyincreasing aggregate demand during a phasein which supply-side output capacities are notbeing utilised to their full potential. An ex-pansionary stimulus during a downturn mustbe counterbalanced by restrictive measures ingood times, however, if a permanent increasein indebtedness is to be avoided. Economicstimulus packages should therefore have atimely impact and be of limited duration. It isalso advantageous if they are narrowly target-ed and thus have a high multiplier effect, andif they do not hamper other fiscal policy goalsby generating misallocation or distortions.However, past experience has shown that,
due to the delays in identifying a downturn,in deciding and implementing the fiscalmeasures and in the time it takes for them totake effect, measures aimed at kick-startingthe economy often do not begin to have animpact until the economy is already on thepath to recovery. In addition, it is often diffi-cult to promptly decide whether the causesof a downturn are cyclical, and thereforetemporary, or structural. In the latter case,economic stimulus programmes actually slowdown the economy’s necessary adjustmentprocess. In many cases, the stimulus measuresare not of limited duration and, in the follow-ing upswing, the necessary consolidationsteps are often not taken for reasons of polit-ical expedience. Furthermore, there is a temp-tation to misuse fiscal policy for short-termimpulses, especially ahead of elections.
When macroeconomic risks are as exception-
ally high as they were at the turn of 2008-2009, it is nonetheless appropriate in prin-ciple to resort inter alia to fiscal stimulus
measures to try and mitigate abrupt andsteep slumps. However, the measures takenonly partially met the aforementioned re-quirements. The two economic stimuluspackages of November 2008 and January2009 were adopted promptly at a time whenthe full brunt of the recession was onlyjust emerging (see the chart on page 83). Yet– leaving aside the non-quantifiable confi-dence-boosting effects of the announce-ments – these packages mainly did not beginto take effect until the second quarter of2009, and a significant part of the active fis-cal expansion is taking place now in 2010,

82that is in a phase in which the economy
would very probably have continued to re-
cover even without additional stimuli.15It
would have been better to focus the second
economic stimulus package more on 2009.
The Act to Accelerate Growth ( Wachstums-
beschleunigungsgesetz ) adopted at the end
of 2009, which extended the scope of the
measures to 2010, was superfluous even at
the time of its adoption. Its superfluity has
been further highlighted by the fact that
growth in 2010 is now expected to be very
sharp. Furthermore, over half of the measures
taken will put a permanent strain on public fi-
nances; it would have been preferable to re-
strict the duration of these measures. The car
scrappage scheme is one example of a meas-
ure that was relatively effective in terms of
stimulating economic activity in the short
term, but overall was somewhat problematic
(see page 50).
A key criterion for assessing the fiscal policy
track record during the crisis is the extent to
which public confidence in the sustainability
of public finances remained intact. Credible
budgetary rules can play a crucial role in
achieving this. Not only can they lower the
risk premiums on interest payable, they also
prevent an additional unsettling of consumers
and investors. This in turn makes it possible
for monetary policymakers to maintain price
stability at low interest rates. At national
level, it was thus of particular significance
and especially welcome that the expansionary
fiscal measures in Germany were linked to
the adoption of new constitutional budgetary
rules which will significantly restrict the future
scope for borrowing and will mean that therules are not as easy to circumvent as they
were in the past by invoking loosely defined
exemption clauses and exploiting other
loopholes. A transitional arrangement has
mapped out a sound consolidation path.
Thus central government’s structural new
borrowing is to be cut in equal stages from
the level reached in 2010 to a maximum of
0.35% of GDP by 2016, while state govern-
ments must have eliminated their deficits en-
tirely by 2020 at the latest.
There is as yet no comparable tightening of
budgetary rules at European level. The cur-
rent regulations and their implementation by
the responsible institutions have proven insuf-
ficient. In a number of EU member states, se-
vere fiscal distortions could not be prevented
and, in some cases, this resulted in a loss of
confidence in the sustainability of public fi-
nances.
In addition, the foundations of monetary
union, one of which is the member states’
national autonomy for their own fiscal policy,
were stretched to breaking point by the sup-
port package for Greece, which was agreed
at the beginning of May 2010, and then
again only a week later by the decision to set
up the European Stabilisation Mechanism.
However, given the short-term risks for the
stability of the financial markets and Euro-
pean monetary union, intervention in this
particular situation was justifiable in spite of
fundamental concerns. The reform of the
European fiscal framework that is currently

83being debated thus needs to focus on stabilis-
ing and reinforcing the weakened founda-tions of monetary union.
In order to prevent future crises, the statistical
basis of the budgetary surveillance procedurehas to be improved so as to ensure that theinformation available for analysing govern-ment budgetary developments is reliable. Inaddition, the Stability and Growth Pact mustbe made more stringent. The crisis has under-lined the particular relevance of the debt cri-terion which, so far, has not been given suffi-cient importance. Rules should be laid downfor debt ratios in excess of 60% spelling out atimetable for their reduction and the sanc-tions for non-compliance. It is also essentialto improve the often inadequate implementa-tion of the rules, for example by making theimposition of sanctions more rule-bound andless subject to political bargaining. The Euro-pean Commission’s proposals on reformingthe Stability and Growth Pact put forward atthe end of September 2010 are a step in theright direction.
As a complement to the fiscal framework, a
greater measure of macroeconomic surveil-lance at European level may also contributeto the timelier detection of serious distortionsand imbalances. However, the independenceof monetary policy and autonomous respon-sibility for national fiscal policies, which per-sists at the present stage of EU integration, aswell as the subsidiarity principle must be up-held. Nor may this lead to centralised fiscaland economic policy fine-tuning. The crisisagain exposed the limits of such centralmacro-management at supranational level inEurope when the EU bodies combined their
call for deficit-increasing measures as part ofthe European Economic Recovery Plan withthe prospect of a generous interpretation ofthe fiscal rules. This further eroded confi-dence in the sustainability of public financesin a number of countries.

84can offer no promise that euro-area countries
will not experience financing problems in the
future. For this eventuality an orderly restruc-
turing of the affected country’s sovereign
debt should be considered so that creditors,
too, are involved in resolving the crisis, not
least with a view to underpinning the no-bail-
out clause anchored in the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union. Together
with better regulation and supervision of the
financial markets, this can help limit risks to
financial stability. This would, in sum, accord
with the principle of national fiscal responsi-
bility, and higher interest rates for countries
pursuing unsound fiscal policy as compensa-
tion for the risk of partial defaults could exert
a disciplinary effect from the outset via mar-
ket mechanisms. If, during systemic crises,
the option of financial support is nevertheless
chosen as a last resort in order to avoid jeop-
ardising financial stability in the euro area,
the resulting moral hazard can be contained
by charging appropriate interest rate pre-
miums on loans granted and by attaching
strict conditionality. If this conditionality is in-
fringed, then tough sanctions must definitely
be imposed.
Exiting expansionary fiscal policy in
Germany
Now that the German economy has turned
the corner and is expanding at a rapid pace
again, it is essential to swiftly correct the dra-
matic deterioration of the public finance situ-
ation that arose during the crisis. The deficits
have to be reduced rapidly and the rise in the
debt ratio has to be stopped, then reversed.16In the current excessive deficit procedure
against Germany, the Ecofin Council has
stipulated steps to correct the excessive def-
icit by 2013 at the latest as a minimum re-
quirement at European level. This deadline
was already rather unambitious when it was
set and, as things currently stand, Germany
should push its deficit back below the 3%
ceiling next year already. Once this has been
achieved, the next objective is to implement
measures to achieve a structurally balanced
budget.
At national level, the new debt brake speci-
fies minimum consolidation requirements for
central and state government. In its draft
budget for 2011 and medium-term financial
plan up to 2014, central government has
clearly bound itself to the new borrowing
limit. In particular, it has not yielded to the
temptation to backload the necessary con-
solidation process by artificially inflating the
starting deficit in 2010 used as the baseline
structural borrowing limit for the transitional
period from 2011. In keeping with this logic,
the starting point has to be adjusted again to
take account of most recent developments
when the 2011 budget receives final parlia-
mentary approval in November. It would also
be advisable to plan in a safety margin for un-
foreseen budgetary burdens in order to avoid
having to make readjustments at short no-
tice. However, according to current plans for
2011 and the medium term, the deficit will
regularly come close to reaching the ceiling.
Furthermore, some consolidation measuresCreditors

85that have been included in the planning are
yet to be spelled out in detail.
The crisis has driven home the need for
sound public finances. In view of high generalgovernment deficits and debt, considerableadditional risks – in particular from underwrit-ing guarantees – and, not least, foreseeabledemographic burdens, any better-than-ex-pected development, for example of tax rev-enue, labour market-related expenditure orinterest payments, should be used to reducethe deficit faster and not as an excuse to in-
crease spending or cut taxes. This would alsobe in line with the fundamental intent ofboth the national and European fiscal frame-works. Politically it is doubtless harder to con-solidate public finances than to implementexpansionary measures.
