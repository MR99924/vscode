Underlying trends
In the second quarter of 2009, there was a
marked slowdown in the underlying reces-
sionary trend, which had taken on a very
rapid pace in the fourth quarter of 2008 and
the first quarter of 2009. According to the
available indicators, overall economic output
in the second quarter is likely to have declined
only slightly on the quarter in seasonally and
working-day adjusted terms. Even though the
external retarding effects have eased notice-
ably and the impact of the massive worldwide
shock to confidence is gradually easing, Ger-
man export business has suffered a further
setback. Nevertheless, foreign trade could
have made a positive contribution to overall
economic growth in nominal terms for the
first time since the escalation of the financial
crisis. The reason for this is that, as far as it is
possible to tell at present, imports of goods
and services have been cut back even more
sharply this time. By contrast, given the ex-
ceptionally low level of capacity utilisation, in-
dustrial investment remained on a downward
course. Furthermore, as in the previous quar-
ter, enterprises’ inventories are likely to have
been adjusted downwards. Construction in-
vestment, too, was in positive territory in the
second quarter owing to weather-related
catching-up effects and public sector infra-
structure projects, even though the financial
resources earmarked for this investment in
the economic stimulus packages have had
only a minor impact on demand so far. By
contrast, the effects of the tax relief measures

6of the fiscal stabilisation programmes are al-
ready being reflected to a large extent in the
disposable income of households. Together
with the continued strong demand for the
environmental premium granted by the Fed-
eral Government for the scrapping of old cars
and the favourable price climate, this is likely
to have given a further stimulus to private
consumption.
Industry
Following the rapid decline in industrial out-
put in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first
quarter of 2009, the situation improved sig-
nificantly in the second quarter. Industrial
output in May, at 5.1%, was up quite sharply
on the month in seasonally adjusted terms. It
should be borne in mind, however, that out-
put in April was comparatively low owing to
extended plant shutdowns during the Easter
holidays. On an average of April and May,
output almost matched the level of the pre-
ceding two-month period. There was still a
11/C252% decline on the first quarter as a whole,
however. Producers of intermediate goods
managed to keep their production at virtually
the same level as in the first quarter, while
manufacturers of capital goods again re-
duced their output by a significant amount
(21/C252%). The mechanical engineering sector,
which recorded a decline of 91/C252%, was hit
particularly hard, whereas production of
motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts ex-
panded by 81/C252%. Manufacturers of consumer
goods recoded a 11/C254% decline, and the pro-
duction of industrial goods in May fell by al-
most one-fifth in total on the year.Economic conditions in Germany*

7On an average of April and May, industrial
sales declined again slightly on the firstquarter. While domestic sales remained un-changed, industrial exports were again some-what weaker. The value of exports of goodsin May offset the sharp decline in April onlyto a minor extent. On an average of thesetwo months, exports were more than 5%down on the quarter in nominal terms. Im-ports went down by as much as 8
1/C252% for the
same reference period. The foreign trade sur-plus went up to 310.3 billion in May, com-
pared with 39.0 billion in April.
At a seasonally adjusted 4.4%, new orders
in May were up very sharply on the month,after the volume of new orders in April hadheld up at the higher level recorded in March.New orders in April and May were up by anaverage of 3
3/C254% on the quarter. There was
an increase in the flow of orders from coun-tries outside the euro area, in particular. Do-mestic orders – taken in isolation – alsopicked up relatively clearly (2
1/C254%), however.
Intermediate goods were in particular de-mand in the second quarter, and there wasalso a perceptible rise in orders of consumergoods. Orders of capital goods went up by2%. This, however, was due solely to thegreater demand for cars, the statistics forwhich are recorded in this sector.
ConstructionSeasonally adjusted construction output in
May was down significantly on the higherlevel recorded in March and April. On anaverage of April and May, however, construc-tion output was 2.9% up on the first quarterof 2009. This was due, in particular, to a large
number of projects in the public sector. Con-struction demand in April – more recent dataare unavailable at present – went up sharplyon the month. Seasonally adjusted orderswere 6.0% up on the weak result for the firstquarter. The main reason for this was a fur-ther sharp rise in new orders from the publicsector, particularly road construction projects,and the pick-up in demand for housing con-struction. By contrast, there was a furtherdecline in industrial construction orders.
Labour marketThe low level of output is having an increas-
ingly detrimental impact on the labour mar-ket. According to estimates by the FederalEmployment Agency, the number of un-employed persons in June – calculated on abasis comparable to the definition used up toApril – went up by a seasonally adjusted50,000, compared with an increase of around30,000 in May and 60,000 in April. The rela-tively moderate decline in labour marketdemand can be attributed to the fact thatthe usual recovery at this time of year wasconcentrated on this month. The official un-employment figure, which, since May, hasbeen calculated excluding the number of per-sons newly registering with private employ-ment agencies, went up in June by a season-ally adjusted 31,000 to 3.49 million. The un-employment rate rose by 0.1 percentagepoint to 8.3%. As in the previous fewmonths, those persons out of work who arecovered by the statutory insurance schemewere affected more severely than those re-ceiving the basic allowance.

8As a reflection of the slight rise in unemploy-
ment, employment declined only marginally
in May in seasonally adjusted terms following
a marked fall in April. On an average of April
and May, employment fell by 36,000. This is
equivalent to an annualised decline of 1.1%.
The actual year-on-year figure was just
-0.4%, however. The moderate decline in
employment – compared with the decline in
value added in the economy as a whole –
should also be seen in connection with the
greater recourse to cyclically induced short-
time working. According to estimates by the
Federal Employment Agency, the number of
short-time workers is likely to have increased
to between 1.3 million and 1.4 million by
May, compared with 1.1 million in March.
Although the number of registrations for
short-time work went down perceptibly in
the second quarter, it was still well above the
level of the past few years. Firms’ demand for
labour showed a further decline in June. The
BA-X index indicates a further deterioration
and, despite a slight rise, the Ifo employment
barometer is still in contractionary territory.
Prices
Crude oil prices went up again at the begin-
ning of June before levelling off again over
the course of the month. At US$691/C252on a
monthly average, the spot price for a barrel
of Brent North Sea oil was 19% higher than
in May. The prices were responding to signs
of a recovery in the Chinese economy and an
easing of the US recession. Data on the US
economic situation published around the
middle of the year remained below market
expectations. Following this, the spot priceinitially fell significantly before going up
again, over the last few days of the reporting
period, to US$631/C252. In the futures markets,
Brent crude oil prices were still being quoted
with marked premiums; US$4 for six-month
deliveries and US$91/C252for 18-month deliver-
ies.
The cost of imported goods went down by a
seasonally adjusted 0.3% in May. The price
decrease was particularly marked in the case
of industrial goods, at 0.5%, whereas energy
prices rose by 0.9%. Overall import prices de-
clined by 10.4% on the year. Producer prices
of industrial products in domestic sales re-
mained unchanged in May. This represents a
year-on-year decline of 3.6%.
Following a slight decline in May, consumer
prices rose quite sharply in June by a season-
ally adjusted 0.4%. There was a considerable
rise, above all, in the cost of fuel and heating
oil. There was also a surge in the price of to-
bacco and highly seasonal food products.
Price developments among the other cat-
egories of goods were subdued. The year-on-
year rise in consumer prices stood at just
0.1% – owing to a baseline effect – and the
HICP inflation rate remained unchanged.Employment

Local government finances
According to preliminary (partly estimated)
cash statistics data from the Federal Statistical
Office, local government posted a deficit of
33 billion in the first quarter of 2009 com-
pared with a close-to-balance budget in the
same period last year. For the first time in five
years revenue was down on the year, falling
significantly by 4% ( 311/C252billion). The sharp
decline in tax revenue (-61/C252% or almost 31
billion) was instrumental in this. The strong
downward trend in revenue from local busi-
ness tax observed at the end of 2008 appears
to have continued. Following a steady in-
crease over the past few years, the categories
of grants from state government which are
largely linked to the level of tax revenue like-
wise decreased somewhat (-21/C252%o r- 31/C254bil-
lion). However, this was mainly due to the
one-off effect of a backpayment of 31/C252billion
at the start of 2008 ordered by the state con-
stitutional court in North Rhine-Westphalia.
State government investment grants dropped
more steeply by 16% (- 31/C254billion) and
receipts from fees continued to stagnate.
Total expenditure was significantly up on the
year by 4% ( 311/C252billion). Personnel expenses
(+9% or 31 billion) and other operating
expenditure (+6% or 31/C252billion) recorded
considerable growth. The former was boost-
ed by both stages of the latest collective
wage agreement, which were paid out retro-
actively in the second quarter of 2008 and at
the beginning of 2009, and by a one-off pay-
ment in January. By contrast, there was virtu-ally no change in social benefit payments,
and investment in fixed assets plunged (-6%).
It seems that the perceptible deterioration in
the financial situation has started to squeeze
investments levels, whereas the central and
state government-assisted investment pro-
gramme as part of the second economic
stimulus package has not yet begun to have a
noticeable impact on expenditure. Despite
the deficit, local governments managed to
repay close to 31 billion net of loans in the
credit market. In order to meet the resulting
budget shortfall, they ran down their reservesLocal government fiscal

1In the short report on public finances which regularly
appears in the Monthly Report, the emphasis is on recent
outturns. The quarterly editions of the Monthly Reports
(published in February, May, August and November), by
contrast, contain a detailed description of general gov-
ernment budget trends during the preceding quarter. For

10and also distinctly raised the volume of cash
advances, which are actually intended to be
only a short-term stopgap, by 311/C252billion to
3311/C252billion.
After achieving large surpluses in the last
three years, local government is likely to post
a significant deficit for 2009 as a whole.
Although revenue from categories of grants
from state government largely linked to the
level of tax revenue is likely to decline mark-
edly only with a time-lag, the tax estimate
from May 2009 projects that local business
tax alone will see its net revenue plummet
by341/C252billion, while local government’s
share of income tax revenue is expected to
yield 321/C252billion less as a result of the per-
sistent weakness in economic activity and
the tax-based stimulus measures adopted in
response. Spending strains will ensue pre-
dominantly from the second stage of the
collective wage agreement, growing other
operating expenditure and an increase in so-
cial benefit payments following an expected
rise in the number of recipients of basic al-
lowances. Further financial risks could arise
from the cross-border leasing transactions
which have been entered into by numerous
municipalities. By contrast, from the third
quarter, the extensive upcoming investments
as part of the second stimulus package are
likely to trigger only a small increase in the
deficits as, in many cases, state government
will assume part of local government’s co-
financing share. Furthermore, to some extent,
assurances have been given to pre-finance
local government’s remaining funding share.When publishing its cash office statistics for
local government, the Federal Statistical
Office regularly highlights the fact that the
government financial statistics for both rev-
enue and expenditure as well as debt can, in
part, only be estimated and a year-on-year
comparison is severely impaired by the intro-
duction of commercial double-entry book-
keeping in some federal states.2This change-
over is likely to advance over the next few
years and could significantly delay an im-
provement in the data situation. To obtain a
more precise picture of local government’s
financial situation and, in particular, to meet
the requirements of the European budgetary
surveillance procedure, it is, however, essen-
tial to have accurate cash office statistics, also
on a quarterly basis. To obtain the required
financial statistics, both increased efforts on
the part of those local governments affected
by the changeover to double-entry book-
keeping and appropriate statutory provisions
at state government level with regard to
accounting guidelines for local government
are highly desirable.

In May 2009, the issue volume in the German
bond market was down on the month, gross-

11bonds, net sales of domestic debt securities
amounted to 338.0 billion, compared with
33.8 billion in April. Sales of foreign debt se-
curities, which were denominated exclusivelyin euro, amounted to 314.8 billion net. All in
all, debt securities in circulation in Germanyincreased by 352.8 billion in the reporting
month and thus reached their highest valuesince January 2007.
Among domestic borrowers, the public sector
tapped the bond market for the greatestamount in May ( 329.1 billion). Central gov-
ernment was the primary issuer, with netsales of 329.6 billion. As in previous months,
it mainly issued shorter-dated paper. Treasurydiscount paper (Bubills) and two-year FederalTreasury notes (Sch/C228tze) were issued at a netvolume of 311.7 billion and 37.1 billion, re-
spectively. Moreover, central government soldten-year Federal bonds (Bunds) worth 36.4
billion net and five-year Federal notes (Bobls)worth 35.1 billion net. By contrast, the out-
standing volume of 30-year Bunds decreasedby30.5 billion. The federal states redeemed
debt securities on balance ( 30.5 billion) in the
reporting month. However, this contrastedwith net issues amounting to as much as35.9 billion in April.
For the first time in half a year, domestic
credit institutions issued more bonds in theGerman capital market than they redeemed(37.7 billion). This was mainly in the form of
debt securities issued by specialised credit in-stitutions ( 38.5 billion). Mortgage Pfandbriefe
were sold to the tune of 30.9 billion. The vol-
ume of other bank debt securities and publicPfandbriefe outstanding went down by 31.3
billion and 30.4 billion respectively.
In the reporting month, German enterprises
tapped the bond market for 31.1 billion, sig-
nificantly less than in the previous month(34.5 billion). In net terms, these were all
bonds with original maturities of more thanone year.
Foreign investors were the main purchasers
of debt securities in May. They invested 334.8
billion in the German bond market, predom-inantly in public debt instruments ( 325.4 bil-
lion). Domestic non-banks invested 310.7 bil-
lion, on balance solely in foreign bonds(314.3 billion). Domestic credit institutions
added a net 37.4 billion worth of debt secur-

Equity market
In May, domestic enterprises issued new
shares for 30.1 billion in the German equity
market. The outstanding amount of foreign
equities in the German market increased by
33.3 billion. Equities were purchased almost
exclusively by foreign investors ( 311.2 billion).
Moreover, resident non-banks purchased
31.7 billion worth of shares, while German
credit institutions reduced their equity hold-
ings by 39.5 billion. In this case, both domes-
tic groups of investors sold German equities.
Mutual fund shares
In the reporting month, German mutual
funds recorded an inflow of 31.0 billion net
(April: 32.0 billion). On balance, the addition-
al capital was channelled solely into mutual
funds open to the general public ( 32.5 bil-
lion). By contrast, specialised funds reserved
for institutional investors once again recorded
outflows ( 31.5 billion). In the case of the mu-
tual funds open to the general public, equity
funds recorded an inflow of 31.8 billion in
May on the heels of rebounding share prices.
Open-end real estate funds ( 30.7 billion),
bond funds ( 30.2 billion) and mixed securities
funds ( 30.1 billion) also sold share certificates.
By contrast, money market funds recorded
slight outflows of funds ( 30.4 billion). Foreign
funds traded on the German market were
able to sell 30.1 billion worth of mutual fund
shares in May, following outflows of funds in
the previous months.German credit institutions were the principal
investors in mutual funds, buying shares
worth 33.0 billion. By contrast, net sales of
mutual fund certificates by German non-
banks and foreign investors amounted to
31.5 billion and 30.4 billion respectively.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus – in unadjusted terms – of 33.7 billion in
May 2009. The result was thus 31.8 billion
down on the level of the previous month.
This was due in the main to a larger deficit on
invisible current transactions, which comprise
services, income and current transfers. By
contrast, the trade surplus increased slightly.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, in May the foreign
trade surplus was up by 30.2 billion on the
month to 39.6 billion. After adjustment for
seasonal and calendar effects, it rose from
39.0 billion to 310.3 billion. The value of ex-
ports rose slightly by 0.3%, while the value of
imports declined by 2.1%. If April and May
are taken together, seasonally adjusted nom-
inal exports were 5.1% below the average
for the first quarter of 2009. Of this, 0.6 per-
centage point can be attributed to export
prices. Imports were down as much as 8.4%,
with 1.7 percentage points due to market
prices.
The deficit on invisible current transactions
grew from 33.3 billion in April to 34.8 billion
in May. This is owing to larger deficits in the

13on cross-border income (primarily due to
higher dividend payments to non-residents)expanded by 32.7 billion to 33.0 billion, and
the deficit in services grew by 30.2 billion to
30.9 billion. The deficit on current transfers,
however, declined to 30.9 billion, down from
32.3 billion in the previous month.
Cross-border portfolio investment led to net
capital imports in May ( 329.0 billion), com-
pared with outflows of 317.6 billion in April.
This reversal was due to the fact that foreigninvestors purchased German securities ( 345.7
billion) after selling domestic paper in the pre-ceding month. They invested mainly in bondsand notes ( 318.7 billion) and money market
papers ( 316.1 billion). In addition, as is usual
around dividend payment dates, foreign in-vestors bought German shares ( 311.3 billion)
that they had sold in April. In May, Germaninvestors purchased 316.7 billion worth of
foreign securities. While they bought bondsand notes ( 317.3 billion) and shares ( 31.8 bil-
lion) from abroad, they sold money marketpapers ( 32.5 billion).
In the area of direct investment, net capital
exports in May totalled 32.2 billion, which
was down on the level of the previousmonths, however. The main reason for thecontraction was that foreign proprietorsinvested more heavily in Germany thanpreviously. They provided 37.3 billion to their
German affiliates during the reportingmonth, almost completely in the form ofintra-group loans. Domestic enterprises sup-plied their foreign affiliates with 39.5 billion
of funds. These funds were primarily chan-nelled through intra-group credit transactionsMajor items of the balance

15Corporate earnings
and share pricesOver the past two decades, share prices
in Germany – against the backdrop of
a positive trend – have been subject
to considerable fluctuations. The earn-
ings of German public limited com-
panies have followed a similar growth
pattern. This supports theoretical rea-
soning, which sees in (discounted fu-
ture) corporate earnings an important
fundamental determinant of share
prices. Looking back, however, the re-
current massive deviations between
share price movements and corporate
earnings growth is also striking. Par-
ticularly remarkable in this respect is
the New Economy boom at around the
turn of the millennium. Misjudge-
ments with regard to expected earn-
ings due to herd behaviour, informa-
tion asymmetry or investors’ overreac-
tions to changes in earnings expect-
ations forecasts may help explain such
share price movements. The following
article will examine the relationships
between corporate earnings and share
prices and look at commonly used in-
dicators for the valuation level on the
stock market. Earnings estimates by
stock market analysts play an import-
ant role in determining these indica-
tors. However, these estimates prove to
be relatively slow to adapt and system-
atically biased, an aspect that has to be
borne in mind when interpreting
them.

16Development of share prices, corporate
earnings and dividend payments since
1991
As measured by Germany’s DAX index, Ger-
man share prices rose almost 2.5 times be-
tween the beginning of 1991 and mid-
2009.1Yet this was not a continuous devel-
opment. A steep rise, particularly at the end
of the 1990s, driven by the New Economy
boom to a high of more than 8,000 index
points in March 2000 was followed by a se-
vere slump. By the second quarter of 2003
the DAX had lost more than 70% of its value.
With the recovery of global, and subsequent-
ly German, economic activity, share prices
picked up again to reach a new all-time high
in the third quarter of 2007. The financial
market crisis emanating from the US real es-
tate market, and attendant fears over the
soundness of a number of financial institu-
tions and the volume of required write-
downs, resulted in a renewed bout of heavy
share price losses. In March 2009, these
losses peaked at around 55% of 2007 Q3
levels, after signs became apparent that the
financial market crisis would increasingly spill
over into the real economy and bring with it a
pronounced cooling of global economic activ-
ity. Given the recent stabilisation in the finan-
cial sector and positive earnings reports by in-
dividual financial institutions, prices have
since recovered slightly.
Apart from a brief phase in the mid-1990s,
the corporate earnings of the DAX companies
generally followed a similar line of develop-
ment to share prices, although they did not
keep pace with the rise in prices during theNew Economy boom.2On the whole, they
also fluctuated far less markedly. The pattern
of dividends, which was also relatively con-
stant, reflects a policy of dividend continuity
aimed clearly at avoiding dividend cuts and,
thus, at adjusting the payout only to perman-
ent changes in earnings wherever possible.3
This was visible in the mid-1990s and very re-
cently, when dividends largely remained stable
or fell only slightly as earnings declined. In
addition, after 2003, payouts did not keepShare prices,

18pace with earnings; companies were obvious-
ly at first taking advantage of the rise in earn-
ings above all to raise profit retention and
“clean up” their balance sheets (for informa-
tion on earnings from a macroeconomic per-
spective, see also the box on page 17).
Despite these differences in the details, actual
earnings per share and current dividends
grew at rates similar to share prices in the
period under review. All in all, the average an-
nual growth rates have ranged between 6%
and 7% since 1991. This is consistent with
theoretical reasoning on the relationship be-
tween the variables mentioned above.
Relationship between earnings and share
prices: theoretical reasoning
In a perfect market, the price of a rationally
valued share should be equivalent to the
present value of the expected future divi-
dends, with the discount factor being made
up of the risk-free interest rate and a risk pre-
mium which investors demand as compensa-
tion for uncertainties surrounding the divi-
dend streams. However, experience shows
that share prices are sometimes found, at
least in retrospect, to be at odds with a ra-
tional valuation. Such cases include asset
price bubbles, which deviate strongly from a
fundamentally justified valuation. Occurrences
such as herd behaviour, an asymmetric distri-
bution of information among investors or
overreaction to changes in earnings expect-
ations can help asset price bubbles to form.
Other psychologically driven patterns of in-
vestor behaviour, the effect of which is stud-ied in the field of behavioural finance, can
likewise help explain share price movements
that are not justified by fundamentals.
When applying the dividend discount model,
corporate earnings are of importance in as-
sessing fundamentally justified equity valu-
ation levels. Other simple measures for as-
sessing equity price levels are the price-
earnings (P/E) ratio and the dividend yield,
which represent the current or expected earn-
ings and the dividend in relation to the share
price respectively. A related indicator is the
Fed model, which is equivalent to the differ-
ence between the inverse P/E ratio – the earn-
ings yield – and a risk-free interest rate, and
can be interpreted as a risk premium over a
safe investment.
Whereas problems are seen in comparing
such indicators across different market seg-
ments or national stock markets due to differ-
ences in the risk premiums, accounting and
real interest rates, it is common practice to in-
terpret them in comparison with an average
that is deemed to be fundamentally justified.
On the basis of deviations from this average,
conclusions are drawn with regard to the ap-
propriateness of the valuation. If, for example,
the current P/E ratio overshoots (undershoots)
its long-term average, the shares appear – in
terms of the actual or expected earnings –
overpriced (underpriced). The advantage of
this procedure is that it reduces complexity
while also being empirically justifiable (see
page 24). One drawback of the commonly
used valuation method is that only the earn-
ings or the dividend of one period are used as
the basis for valuation and are considered toShare prices not

19be representative of the entire future. When
average values are used, the effect the sur-
pluses or distributions in the more immediate
future have on the present value is neglected.
Dividend discount models avoid these draw-
backs in that they involve discounting all future
dividends with the expected real stock yield –
ie the total of risk-free interest and an equity
risk premium – as the discount factor. In the
simple version, the future dividend payments
are determined by taking the current dividend
as the basis and assuming a constant dividend
growth rate. With the three-stage dividend dis-
count model, which the Bundesbank also uses,
a distinction is made between three phases of
dividend growth. Whereas in the first phase a
constant dividend growth is assumed, the
growth rate in the second phase, in line with
the assumption, linearly approaches its long-
term equilibrium, which is then reached in the
third phase.4In practice, the model is often
solved for the equity risk premium; comparing
it with a long-term average enables an assess-
ment of the valuation level. A high equity risk
premium indicates a comparatively strong re-
luctance to invest and, therefore, a relatively
low share price valuation.
With the dividend discount model, changes in
dividend growth rates have an especially
strong impact on the price level when the as-
sumed long-term dividend growth rate is close
to the expected stock yield.5It is therefore cru-
cial for the informativeness and the interpret-
ation of the model that the assumed dividend
growth rates correctly reflect the actual ex-
pectations of the investors and represent ac-
curate estimates of actual dividend growth.Analysts’ estimates as indicators of
expected corporate earnings
Data sources
Analysts’ estimates are one commonly used
measure of expected corporate earnings. The
source of data most often referred to in con-
nection with studies on analysts’ forecasts is
the I/B/E/S (Institutional Brokers Estimate Sys-
tem) database.6This database contains esti-
mates of the balance sheet profit over differ-
ent time horizons ranging from twelve
months to five years. Most market partici-
pants focus on the next 12 months, for which
reason the majority of forecasts refer to the
current and the next business year. Since
1991, an average of almost 30 forecasts per
company have been available for the 12-
month outlook for the DAX companies. This
relatively high forecast density shows that

the real dividend growth rate based on analysts’ esti-

and second dividend growth phase in years. The assumed
long-term dividend growth rate ghas a strong influence
on the present value. The closer gis to the expected
stock yield (equity risk premium ERP tplus real interest
ratert) and the lower the denominator of the fraction
therefore is, the greater the influence on the price level
of changes in the variables used. The model is unsolvable
ifgis equal to or greater than the expected stock yield.
6These are forecasts by sell-side analysts, whose reports
are not aimed primarily at the analysts’ own employer
but at external target groups. By contrast, buy-side ana-
lysts usually work for institutional investors. Their job is to
provide their own managers with sound input for deci-
sions on purchasing securities. This information is not
published, however. The two groups are often covered
separately in the literature because of this difference in
orientation, which also implies different target functions.Dividend

20analysts concentrate their activities primarily
on large firms.7For the observed firms, great-
er analyst coverage means an improved infor-
mation environment that ultimately ought to
lead to a more reliable consensus forecast.8
The analysts’ average firm-level forecast is
weighted according to the market capitalisa-
tion of the respective company. These figures
are then added together to form an aggre-
gate figure for the index. However, analysts
do not as a rule update their forecasts at
monthly intervals. For the DAX companies, it
may be seen that since 1991 only roughly
every fourth estimate was revised monthly.9
Although this ratio has risen since 2000 to
just under one-third (32%), this still means
that the majority of the forecasts included in
the overall index are the same as for the pre-
vious month. As is explained in more detail
below, the result of this is, among other
things, that the (average) earnings forecasts
are slow to adjust to sudden change.
Analysing earnings developments
Since 1991, with very few exceptions, ana-
lysts have consistently expected (positive)
growth in German corporate earnings. The
12-month-ahead earnings forecast has al-
most always been higher than the actual
earnings in the previous 12 months (see chart
on page 21). Although earnings expectations
have plummeted in the current financial mar-
ket crisis, analysts are again expecting earn-
ings to rise in the next 12 months (+15%).
With regard to earnings developments, there
are visible differences between the stock mar-ket boom at the end of the 1990s and the
current financial market crisis. For example,
while the hi-tech bubble was forming, the
prices of the 30 top German shares rose
markedly more strongly than expected earn-
ings, and the subsequent slump in share
prices was likewise considerably more pro-
nounced than the revision of expected earn-
ings. On the other hand, both the subsequent
rise in share prices until 2007 and the share
price crash that followed were largely in line
with earnings expectations. These differences
in development are borne out by a more thor-
ough examination of analysts’ revisions of
earnings expectations. During the boom at
around the turn of the millennium, the num-
ber of earnings estimates that were revised
downwards had already exceeded the num-
ber of upward revisions by the beginning of
1999. Thus, at this comparatively early point
in time, the majority of analysts surveyed
with regard to the DAX companies were al-
ready sceptical as to whether the earnings ex-
pected up to that point would actually be
realised. Consequently, the share price in-
crease which continued into the year 2000
resulted in prices becoming increasingly de-
coupled form expected earnings. In the up-
swing which preceded the current crisis, and
which had a substantially broader sectoral
base than the New Economy boom, the num-
ber of earnings estimates that were revised
7By comparison, since the broad based Dow Jones Euro-
Stoxx was launched in 1999, only just under 18 analyst
forecasts on average have been issued per company and

21downwards did not exceed the number of
upward revisions until October 2007 – whichis to say after the stock market had peaked.Clearly, the crisis took stock market analystsby surprise, all the more as the real economicforecasts at that time had shown no indica-tion of an abrupt economic slump.
The feedback effect, observed in 2007, of
share prices on earnings estimates can gener-ally be proven. Analysts include past pricemovements of the share of the companyunder review in their estimate. Using a Gran-ger causality test, the hypothesis that pastshare prices have no influence on earningsexpectations can be rejected at the 1% levelin the 1991 to 2009 period.
10This empirical
finding suggests a cautious use of presentvalue models, as they assume that earningsforecasts are estimated independently of pastprice developments. To back up this interpret-ation, however, analysts’ individual estimatesand their adjustment over time need to beexamined more closely, as so far account hasnot been taken of when the individual esti-mates included in the consensus forecastwere made (see box on pages 22-23). As asecond result, the Granger causality testbased on a monthly frequency does not re-veal any market-relevant influence of earn-ings estimates on future share prices. Yet thisdoes not necessarily contradict the dividenddiscount model, as one would expect shareprices to react much earlier to changes inearnings expectations in information-efficientmarkets. The impulse response functions gen-erated by the VAR model confirm a corres-ponding direct reaction by stock yields tochanges in earnings expectations.Indicators based on analysts’ estimates
The relationship between share prices and
earnings expectations is also the basis forother commonly used stock market valuationmeasures.

often form the basis for determining P/Eratios, dividend yields or equity risk premiumsfrom dividend discount models. As explainedabove, to assess the fundamentally justifiedShare prices,

10There is no evidence of any economic equilibrium rela-

the econometric analysis, the two variables are therefore
examined in their first (logarithmic) differences using a
vector autoregressive (VAR) model with which conclu-
sions may be drawn regarding the dynamic relationship
between the modelled endogenous variables. This is the
objective of, above all, the Granger causality concept,
which tests for a possible influence of the lagged values
of one variable on the current value of the other variable.

22Deutsche BundesbankWhat factors determine the quality of securities analysts’ earnings estimates?
Securities analysts act, to a degree, as a link between the
companies they cover and potential investors or market
observers. They can therefore be regarded as information
intermediaries. Their task is to collect and evaluate a
wide range of information of varying quality and – in the
case of an earnings estimate – condense it into a single
figure. The result of their analysis is generally published
prominently, but not any information on the preceding
decision-making process. However, the quality and ra-
tionality of the forecasts can be properly assessed only if
the factors influencing the decision are known. In the fol-
lowing, we will analyse various determinants that could
have an impact on securities analysts’ decision-making
process and the quality of their forecasts. We will study,
first, what influence the individual environment has on
forecast quality and, second, to what extent publicly
available information is reflected in forecasts.1
Irrespectively of the determinants to be examined, any
empirical study on forecast quality must control for the
forecast horizon, which is defined as the period (general-
ly measured in months) between the time the forecast is
produced and the end of the business year for which the
forecast is made. As expected, there is a negative correl-
ation: forecast accuracy diminishes as the forecast hori-
zon grows longer. The business year in question can also
exert a specific influence, which has to be taken into ac-
count in any analysis.
Analyst-specific and broker-specific factors
Differences in individual analysts’ forecast quality can, in
part, be explained by the individual environment or spe-
cific analyst characteristics.2For instance, various studies
show that long professional experience has a significant
positive impact on forecast quality. One explanation is
the “learning by doing” effect: the longer someone
works as an analyst, the greater his experience in the
field, which in turn leads to better forecast results. In
addition, Hong and Kubik (2003) state that, for analystsworking in the United States, continued employment in
the industry is closely linked to forecast accuracy.3In
other words, analysts with comparatively many years of
experience have undergone a selection process in which
they were able to prevail over their rivals. However, the
positive correlation between professional experience and
forecast accuracy proved weak or even inexistent espe-
cially for European analysts, which is explained, inter
alia, by differences in the incentive structure.4The litera-
ture therefore makes a further distinction between gen-
eral and company-specific professional experience. The
latter relates exclusively to the period over which an indi-
vidual analyst has covered a specific company. The posi-
tive correlation generally proves robust in empirical an-
alysis; one possible reason is that communications be-
tween the analyst and the management of the covered
company improve with years on the job.
A further analyst-specific determinant whose potential
impact is investigated in empirical studies is the number
of forecasts that an analyst makes for a firm in a business
year. If a large number of revisions are necessary, this
points to difficulties in establishing an adequate assess-
ment, which results in a negative correlation between
this variable and forecast accuracy, particularly at the be-
ginning of the business year. Conversely, at the end of
the business year, the number of revisions should have
ensured that the necessary adjustments have been made,
which would mean a statistically significant difference
can no longer be found.
Broker-specific factors include the size of the portfolio an
individual analyst covers. Here, a negative correlation is
assumed in theory: the more enterprises or sectors an
analyst covers, the less time he has to analyse a specific
company, which is reflected in a significantly greater
forecast error.
Various studies also show that the size of an analyst’s em-
ployer is statistically significant. US studies in particular

23demonstrate that analysts employed by larger brokerage
houses make better forecasts than their peers at smallerhouses. One possible explanation is that analysts with im-portant brokerage houses have better access to com-panies’ management. Similarly, they could have better re-sources at their disposal. Larger brokerage houses are re-garded as the more attractive employers, partly for thereasons outlined above, potentially leading to them em-ploying the better analysts. However, this argument doesnot necessarily apply to the European market, as broker-age houses do not hire staff based as exclusively on pastforecast accuracy as in the United States.

Although the above-mentioned variables are used to tryto explain, as much as possible, the differences in forecastquality based on analyst-specific and broker-specific be-haviour, a large part remains unexplained. As a result,prior analyst-specific forecast quality generally proveshighly significant in addition to the above-mentioneddeterminants. For instance, Brown (2001) shows that asimple model containing only analysts’ individual priorforecast quality as an explanatory variable performs justas well as a model that contains the analyst characteris-tics described above.

Processing publicly available information
As mentioned above, a financial analyst’s real achieve-
ment is to collect, weight and compress existing informa-tion. An important source of information is doubtless thecurrent consensus forecast among other analysts, whichis the subject of intense debate in the literature. The indi-vidual analyst starts out in the same situation as other un-involved market players. While he is familiar with the re-sult of the consensus estimate, he does not know whatfactors may have played a role in his peers’ decision-mak-ing process. Unlike other market players, however, theanalyst’s own forecast gives him an idea of how the con-sensus estimate could change.According to Banerjee’s definition (1992), individual ana-
lysts’ behaviour is classified as non-rational herd behav-iour if they base their forecast exclusively on other ana-lysts’ consensus estimate and neglect their own informa-tion.
7Such behaviour is, however, difficult to prove em-
pirically. As different analysts usually respond to similarinformation signals, they will likely arrive at similar rec-ommendations. In this case, it is therefore not clearwhether synchronised analysts’ earnings revisions aredue to herd behaviour or merely to the fact that theybase their decisions on the same information. Clement,Hales and Xue (2007) demonstrate for the United Statesthat the consensus forecast is used in a rational manner.They find that analysts are more likely to incorporate in-formation from the consensus forecast into their ownforecast the greater the number of analysts involved inthe consensus forecast.
8In this case – if analysts use the
consensus forecast as one of several sources of informa-tion – their own forecast accuracy may improve.
9It would
therefore be premature to describe proof that the con-sensus forecast has an influence on analyst decisions as ir-rational behaviour. For Germany, Naujoks et al (2009)even show that analysts systematically go against theconsensus forecast in order to raise their profile (anti-herding).
10
Past stock market performance is similar to the consensusforecast. Even though this is publicly known and avail-able information, taking share prices into account maywell help improve the quality of earnings forecasts.
11
Another source of information for which one would ex-pect similar analyst behaviour is the macroeconomic out-look. Unexpected changes in and increased uncertaintyabout future macroeconomic developments are bothlikely to impact analyst-specific earnings forecasts.

24valuation level, these are compared with their
long-term average. This is based on the as-
sumption that the earnings estimates are rep-
resentative of the future development of
earnings and dividends, and that the historic-
al average of the figures is similar to an equi-
librium value from which the current values
deviate only temporarily – eg when price de-
velopments are temporarily dominated by
non-fundamentals – but to which they re-
turn, however, in the long run (mean rever-
sion). This would appear plausible in the case
of the P/E ratio, and can be empirically con-
firmed by the appropriate econometric tests
(unit root tests).
However, the average P/E ratio, calculated ex
post, over the entire period under review can
differ significantly from averages calculatedat earlier points in time, thus subjecting the
“equilibrium value” to uncertainty. Moreover,
the time intervals between two points at
which the P/E ratio intersects its average vary
greatly in length, ranging from one month (in
2001) to almost seven years.
The development of the P/E ratio, dividend
yield and equity risk premium emphasises the
differences mentioned between the New
Economy bubble and the financial market cri-
sis. Around the turn of the millennium, the
P/E ratio reached its all-time high of 30 in the
period under review. At the same time, the
dividend yield and equity risk premium (at
1.6% each) were at their lowest level since
1991. This reflects investors’ particularly pro-
nounced willingness at that time to invest in
shares, despite expectations of relatively low
earnings and dividends, and thus indicates a
decoupling of the stock market from the fun-
damentals. By contrast, the respective figures
were closer to their long-term averages when
the financial market crisis broke out in mid-
2007. After the P/E ratio, following severe
stock market losses, bottomed out (and the
dividend yield and equity risk premium
peaked) at the turn of the year 2008-09, all
these indicators appear to have returned to
some semblance of normality in recent
months on the back of rising prices and
downward revisions of earnings estimates.
Nevertheless, they are still significantly re-
moved from their long-term averages.
For the P/E ratio, the tendency to return to an
equilibrium value means that there is at least
one driving factor which causes the ratio to
return to its long-term average. GenerallyValuation indicators

25speaking, this adjustment can be driven by
share prices (the numerator), earnings (thedenominator) or both. This means, for ex-ample, that a higher-than-average P/E ratioshould result in either an increase in earnings,falling share prices or both.
12In economic
terms, one explanation for these adjustmentsmay be that a relatively high P/E ratio is likelyto make investors shy away from a stock mar-ket investment, as – given the assumed earn-ings expectations – they cannot expect to re-ceive the usual return. Another is that invest-ors’ earnings expectations might also bemore optimistic than analysts’ expectationsbecause, for example, they possess more ac-curate or more recent information. In thiscase, the observed rise in share prices antici-pates the analysts’ earnings revisions. Thiscould also explain the empirical finding thatpast price movements have their own in-formative value in respect of analysts’ earn-ings estimates. The adjacent chart supportsboth hypotheses.
13The linear trend lines
show that over a prolonged period (fouryears), both the share prices and the expectedearnings play a part in the return of the P/Eratio to the long-term average.
A regression analysis confirms the, at first,
only visual impression (see table on page 26).The P/E ratio proves statistically significantwith regard both to the future four-year stockyield and to the change in four-year-aheadearnings expectations. However, for each ofthese cases its explanatory power is relativelylimited. 9% of the variation of future stockreturns and 11% of the change in expectedearnings can be explained via the current P/Eratio. Evidently, a number of other factorsalso influence the stock yield and corporate
earnings, triggering primarily short-term ad-justments, as it is noticeable that the explana-tory power of the estimates decreases signifi-Price-earnings (P/E) ratio

Forecast accuracy of earnings
expectations
Deviations of the P/E ratio from its long-term
average can be consistent with a fundamen-
tally justified share price level if – as men-
tioned above – investors do not consider ana-
lysts’ short-term earnings expectations to be
representative of the future. For use of ana-
lyst estimates to be meaningful, therefore, it
is essential that they correlate closely with ac-
tual earnings. Forecast error is considered a
decisive criterion in assessing the quality of
analyst estimates. Because the deviation of
each individual analyst’s forecast from the ac-
tual value is measured, it is not the quality ofthe forecast models used or of the informa-
tion entered into them that is assessed, but
solely – and, naturally, ex post – the accuracy
of the result.15

14For the stock yield, the P/E ratio only proves statistical-
ly significant with regard to the future twelve-month or
longer stock yield. For expected earnings, by contrast,
the one-month forecast using the P/E ratio is already stat-
istically significant even if, given an adjusted R2of 3%, it
displays less explanatory power than with the longer hori-
zons. See also J Y Campbell, A W Lo and A C MacKinlay
(1997), The Econometrics of Financial Markets, Princeton
University Press, p 267 ff, in which the authors study the
explanatory power of the dividend yield for the US mar-
ket. They, too, find that, the longer the forecast horizon,
the greater the coefficient of determination.

27ings expected 12 months ago (see adja-
cent chart).16As an average for the almost
20 years under review, analysts expected an-nual earnings growth of 21%. In fact, how-ever, the average increase was only 11%.
17
Thus, the forecast error is significantly biasedupwards, which indicates over-optimism onthe analysts’ part. Furthermore, in the periodunder review it is striking that, in phases ofplummeting share prices, the average earn-ings expectation systematically deviates morestrongly from the actual values than in com-parable upward stock market trends. Duringthe three post-1990 economic downturns
18
and the attendant severe declines in shareprices, the cumulative forecast error in analystestimates surpassed 50%. By contrast, inphases of sharply rising share prices the fore-cast error was markedly lower and often evennegative.
One reason for the deviations might be found
in a certain inertia of the estimates. Sinceanalysts do not issue a new earnings forecastevery month for the companies they observe,many of the individual values included inthe consensus estimate date back to earlierpoints in time. This only explains earnings ex-pectations lagging prices to some extent, butnot asymmetry. Research literature cites apossible conflict of interests as an explanationfor the considerably greater deviations indownturn periods, arguing that some ana-lysts consciously sought to avoid issuingnegative earnings forecasts in order not tojeopardise good business relations with com-panies.
19It should be noted when interpreting theforecast error that it is the sum of positiveand negative deviations from the actualvalue. To assess forecast quality more precise-ly, therefore, it is necessary to analyse add-Forecast error in analyst

28itional indicators which take the dispersion of
the estimates into consideration. One such in-
dicator is the coefficient of variation, which
models the standard deviation of the analyst
forecasts in relation to the expected earnings.
In the period under review, the dispersion of
analysts estimates increases – as does the
forecast error – particularly in phases of fall-
ing stock market prices (see above chart).
A greater dispersion of analyst estimates is
associated with a greater absolute forecast
error. Hence, the correlation between both
measures is more than 0.8. This would sug-gest interpreting the estimates with greater
prudence as dispersion of the forecasts in-
creases.
Conclusion
In looking at the DAX companies, it can be
empirically proven for Germany that the
long-run relationship between corporate
earnings and share prices that one would ex-
pect in theory does exist. The P/E ratio is
shown to display mean-reverting behaviour –
in other words, it always returns to its “equi-
librium value” over a sufficiently long-run
period. Using the P/E ratio as an indicator for
assessing an “appropriate” valuation level on
the stock market, however, requires reliable
earnings forecasts. As a rule, these are based
on analyst forecasts that are prone to a cer-
tain degree of forecast error. For the 30 DAX
companies, it has been shown that, even if all
analyst estimates are averaged, these esti-
mates deviate systematically from the actual
value. In downturn phases in particular, esti-
mates have an upward bias. This must be
borne in mind when interpreting relevant in-
dicators. Especially in downturn periods, it is
therefore advisable not to rely solely on the
aggregate earnings estimate but also, for ex-
ample, to include the ratio of upward and
downward revisions and the dispersion of the
analyst estimates in the analysis.Uncertainty in analyst

29Demographic change
and the long-term
sustainability of public
finances in GermanyGermany is facing major fiscal chal-
lenges owing to demographic change.
Without further reforms or changes in
behaviour, it is foreseeable that the fis-
cal financing base will grow signifi-
cantly more slowly than age-related
spending. According to recent calcula-
tions for the EU member states, the
ratio of such expenditure to GDP could
increase by around 5 percentage points
by 2060 in Germany. This would re-
quire inter alia a rise in social contribu-
tion rates from just under 40% at
present to almost 50% overall.
In future, public finances will be placed
under strain both by the effects of
the current dramatic increase in debt
and by demographic change. There is
therefore an ongoing need for adjust-
ment; any backtracking on reforms al-
ready adopted in this area would ex-
acerbate these problems. Increasing
and lengthening labour market partici-
pation among older persons is a key
need in this respect. Furthermore, the
danger of sharply increasing burdens
on future generations can be miti-
gated by initiating adjustments in the
near future. These relate notably to
the need to swiftly consolidate public
finances as soon as the macroeconomic
situation has stabilised.

30Demographics and public finances
If the retirement age remains unchanged, the
economically active population and its relative
size vis-/C224-vis those no longer working will
shrink significantly as a result of foreseeable
demographic shifts. Per capita value added
will consequently grow far more slowly
than value added per employed person, and
growth in wealth as measured by per capita
gross domestic product (GDP) will be damp-
ened perceptibly. As persons of working age
bear the brunt of the government’s financing
burden through taxes and social contributions
and those of retirement age tend to be net
recipients of government benefit payments,
public finances will come under increasing
strain and, in the absence of adjustments, are
not sustainable.
Public finances are considered sustainable if
future expenditure (including interest pay-
ments) is covered by revenue. This does not
preclude the incurrence of government debt
as long as the associated debt servicing is as-
sured in the long term. However, financing
future expenditure through current revenue
or debt incurrence – without any compen-
sation in the private sphere – particularly af-
fects the intergenerational redistribution of
burdens. Sustainability gaps serve as useful
gauges of sustainability, showing the number
of percentage points by which the tax and so-
cial contributions ratio would need to be dir-
ectly and permanently increased or by which
the expenditure ratio would need to be per-
manently reduced in relation to the baseline
in order to offset expected rising future bur-
dens. However, these computations generallydisregard the macroeconomic repercussions.
Such projections spanning long periods of
time are therefore always particularly condi-
tioned by the assumptions upon which they
are based, which impairs their information
value.1Although in addition to the option of
reducing expenditure the government can, in
principle, close funding gaps by increasing
taxes and social contributions, the economic
repercussions of doing so, not least, must be
borne in mind. A growing burden of tax and
social contributions would have an increas-
ingly detrimental effect on economic activity
and, given rising international mobility, there
is a danger that both capital and workers
might migrate.
Development of age-related public
spending in the Ageing Working Group’s
projections
In 2001, the European Council (Stockholm)
emphasised the need to regularly examine
the long-term outlook for public finances,
focusing in particular on the strains caused
by demographic developments. The Ageing
Working Group (AWG), which comprises
staff from international institutions and repre-
sentatives of the national ministries of finance
and social affairs, among others, was set up
to perform this function. In April 2009, the
AWG published new projections on age-
related government expenditure growth in

32the EU member states up until 2060; these
will be discussed in the following sections
(see also table on page 31).2Of the five ex-
penditure areas examined, a disproportion-
ately large expansion in spending on old-age
provision, healthcare and long-term care in-
surance in relation to GDP growth was pre-
dicted. This is expected to be offset to some
degree by reduced expenditure on education
and the labour market.The effects of an ageing population on gov-
ernment revenue are not explicitly taken into
account in the AWG’s projections. Conse-
quently, if the revenue ratio is assumed to re-
main constant, the long-term funding prob-
lem appears to reside entirely in the rising ex-
penditure ratio. For example, no account was
taken of additional government revenue in
the form of taxes and social contributions
payable on government transfer payments or
of revenue shortfalls owing to the recent sig-
nificant raising of income tax allowances for
insurance contributions in Germany.
The AWG’s projections assume that, in Ger-
many, the elderly dependency ratio (here,
the ratio of persons above 64 years of age
to those considered to be of working age
(15 to 64)) will double to just under 60% by
20603. Rising labour market participation,
particularly among women and older per-
sons, and falling unemployment are antici-
pated during the observation period. It is thus
assumed that the number of persons of
working age will decrease by 281/C252% (-151/C252
million) by 2060, while the decline in the la-
bour force and the number of employed per-
sons, at just under 251/C252% (-101/C252million) andAge-related expenditure in

was used as the basis for population development. For
Germany, it envisages an increase in the further life ex-
pectancy of 65-year-old women from 20.2 years today
to 25.1 years in 2060. For men, it posits a rise from
16.9 years to 22.0 years. On average, this further life ex-
pectancy is predicted to increase by just over one month
per year – with a slightly weakening tendency. The results
tally to a large extent with the medium scenario (1-W2)

33231/C252% (-9 million) respectively, is not expect-
ed to be as sharp.
Age-related expenditure in Germany – as on
an EU average – is forecast to grow by almost5 percentage points to 28
1/C252% of GDP by
2060. In the absence of political counter-measures, the overall contribution rate to thestatutory social security schemes would grad-ually increase from just under 40% at presentto nearly 50% by 2060 – over and above taxhikes to finance the various Federal grants. Inorder to prevent this additional age-relatedburden – assuming that the expenditure ratiowill remain stable after reaching its 2060 level– an immediate and permanent reduction ofjust over 3 percentage points in the primarydeficit ratio would be required.

As forecasts spanning such an extendedperiod of time are subject to great uncer-tainty, various scenarios for expenditure de-velopment were simulated. However, growthin the expenditure ratio was only slightlyweaker (+4
1/C252percentage points) in the best-
case scenario than in the reference scenario,whereas in the worst-case scenario, in whichthere was no net immigration,
5it was signifi-
cantly stronger (+81/C252percentage points).
Old-age provisionGovernment old-age provision in Germany in-
cludes the general statutory pension insur-ance scheme and the civil servants’ pensionscheme. In the starting year (2007), 10
1/C252%
of GDP was spent on these two pensionschemes, and a rise of 2
1/C252percentage points
by 2060 was forecast in the AWG’s referencescenario.6Under the legislative status quo ,
this would require an increase in the contribu-tion rate to the statutory pension insurancescheme from 19.9% at present to around24% in 2060. Expenditure on civil servantpensions will also rise, but the projections arebased on the legislative status quo and conse-
quently do not take account of plans for thesustainability factor in the statutory pensioninsurance scheme to be adopted with thesame effect into civil servant pension provi-sions. This has yet to be incorporated intocivil servants’ pension legislation.
The driving force behind the growth in the
expenditure ratio throughout the entire ob-servation period is the increase in the ratio ofpersons aged over 65 to the working-agepopulation. The rising retirement age, the fallin the average pension relative to the averagesalary and growing labour market participa-tion, by contrast, are predicted to have adampening effect. The gradual increase inthe statutory retirement age from 65 to 67and the pension adjustment rules, which aim
4An immediate reduction of 3 percentage points in the
primary deficit ratio would initially lead to savings, which,
taking account of the compound interest effect, would
be sufficient to permanently offset the rise of eventually
5 percentage points in the expenditure ratio.
5On an average of the years from 1998 to 2007, net im-
migration to Germany came to 128,000 persons per year.
For the projection, average net immigration of around
160,000 persons per year was generally assumed. In the
German Federal Government’s most recent Sustainability
Report (2008), two scenarios with annual net immigra-
tion of 100,000 and 200,000 persons, respectively, were
simulated. In the Federal Government’ s most recent re-
port on the statutory pension insurance scheme (2008),
annual immigration of 200,000 was assumed until the
final year of the projection (2022).
6However, the calculations imply a temporary slight de-
cline in the expenditure ratio in the next few years due to
a temporary comparatively favourable demographic de-
velopment and the assumption that the moderating fac-
tors within the pension adjustment formula will take full
effect.Sharp rise in

The me dium-s cenario proje ctions of the A gein g Workin g Group 
(AW G) show an in crease in a ge-relate d government expen diture 
as a per centa ge of GDP of just over 4½ per centa ge points (pp) for 
the EU up to 20 60. A rise of just over 5 pp is fore cast for the euro 
area. However, at just over 8 pp, the unwei ghte d avera ge of the 
euro-area countries is consi dera bly lar ger because hi gh growth 
is pre dicted, parti cularly for many smaller mem ber states. With 
an in crease of just un der 5 pp, Germany o ccupies a lower-or der

Demo graphi cs
Demo graphi c chan ges are a crucial fa ctor in the in creasin g burden

many an d on a euro-area avera ge. There woul d then only be 17 
persons of workin g age (as oppose d to currently 33) to 10 persons 
of retirement a ge. The most drasti c chan ges are likely to o ccur 
in Slovakia, where the el derly depen dency ratio is expe cted to

to its hi gher birth rate of just un der 2 children per woman. Ger-
many’s birth rate is just un der 1.4 an d is expe cted to rise to just 
over 1.5 by 20 60. The avera ge euro-area birth rate is fore cast to 
increase from just over 1.5 at present to just over 1. 6 by 20 60. A 
continuous, almost linear in crease in life expe ctan cy is assume d, 
alon g with the expe ctation that countries with lower initial val-
ues will gradually draw level with the other countries. With a 
further life expe ctan cy for 65 year-ol ds of 22 years (men) or 25.1 
years (women), the assume d values for Germany for 20 60 are only 
slightly a bove the euro-area avera ge. With re gard to euro-area

avera ge growth in Germany’s la bour market parti cipation rate. 
However, this has to be seen a gainst the backdrop of the hi gh

The value for Germany is sli ghtly a bove the euro-area avera ge. 
Overall, the ratio of persons a ged over 64 who are a ctually ina ctive 
to those a ged 15 to 64 years who are a ctually a ctive is expe cted to 
rise at a slower pa ce than the el derly depen dency ratio. This ratio 
is expe cted to go up by 34 pp to 73 % in the euro area. In Germany 
the in crease is somewhat smaller ( by 32 pp to 73 %).
Labour pro ductivity
With re gard to la bour pro ductivity, it is assume d that la bour pro-
ductivity growth both in the euro area an d in the EU as a whole 
will conver ge to a uniform 1.7 % by 20 60. Germany is expe cted to 
see a sli ght rise from its startin g value of 1.5 % by 2020. Parti cu-
larly the new mem ber states are expe cted to en gage in an e co-
nomi c catchin g-up pro cess an d to post si gniﬁ cantly hi gher growth 
rates in the next two decades.
Proje cted ﬁ gures in detail
Spen ding on ol d-age provision will exert the stron gest ﬁ scal pres-
sure on euro-area expen diture. Pension expen diture a ccounts for 
an in crease in the ratio of just un der 3 pp an d, on balan ce, it is responsi ble for more than half of future a dditional ﬁ  scal burdens. 
Expen diture ratios for spen ding on health care an d lon g-term 
care will both in crease by just un der 1½ pp by 20 60. Savin gs in 
the e ducation se ctor an d unemployment insuran ce payments are 
expe cted to remain very limite d.
The results vary wi dely a cross countries. While Gree ce’s expen di-
ture ratio is fore cast to rise to 1 6 pp an d Luxem bour g’s to as mu ch 
as 18 pp, the AW G envisa ges that Italy’s expen diture ratio will 
remain below 2 pp an d Fran ce‘s below 3 pp. Whereas Fran ce will 
be a ble to keep the ﬁ  nan cial base of its so cial se curity systems 
comparatively sta ble due to its hi gh birth rate, the strain on Ita-
ly’s ratio will be ease d by the expe cted sharp rise in its la bour 
market parti cipation rate an d the fa ct that its statutory pension 
insuran ce s cheme is to chan ge over to one in whi ch beneﬁ ts are 
base d on the previous contri butions pai d, takin g life expe ctan cy 
into a ccount. In Germany, too, the implementation of the pension 
reforms a dopte d in re cent years will curb the in crease in expen di-
ture.
When comparin g various s cenarios, the lowest rise in the expen di-
ture ratio is a chieve d either where pro ductivity re cords stron ger 
growth or where employment is at a more elevate d level. The 
least favoura ble s cenarios are those with no net immi gration. In 
these s cenarios, severe a dditional strains are re corded whi ch are 
lowest in those countries that expe ct a comparatively low level of 
net immi gration from the outset (su ch as the Netherlan ds, Slova-
kia an d Fran ce).

36to ensure that pensions rise more slowly than
salaries through the “Riester reform steps”
and the sustainability factor, play a role in this
respect. The narrow dispersion of the results
for alternative scenarios indicates that the cal-
culations are very robust. However, without
net immigration, for example, the expend-
iture ratio would increase by just over 4 per-
centage points instead of by 21/C252percentage
points.
Healthcare provision
Projections for government healthcare provi-
sion (and also for long-term care costs) de-
pend on many more determinants than old-
age provision. In addition to age structure
and labour market participation, other factors
include health developments, the scope of
the healthcare services to be financed (taking
account of any patient co-payments), actual
recourse to these services and price develop-
ments in this sector. The range of conceiv-
able scenarios is therefore correspondingly
broader.
The age structure and state of health of the
potential recipients of government healthcare
are among the key determinants. The likely
impact of each of these different and some-
times countervailing factors is still largely un-
known. The fact that there will be an (at least
relative) continuous decrease in the number
of younger people and a steady increase in
the number of older people and that the lat-
ter incur greater costs to the healthcare sys-
tem will, in itself, drive up expenditure. How-
ever, this will be countered by the fact that
the age profile for healthcare expenditure isunlikely to remain constant. For example, the
average 65-year-old is likely to have fewer
health problems today than the average
65-year-old fifty years ago.7On the other
hand, rising incomes tend to push up de-
mand for healthcare services, thus increasing
expenditure. What implications this will have
for government healthcare spending is ultim-
ately a political decision. Government health-
care spending likewise depends both on the
adoption of innovations in medical technol-
ogy into the range of benefits and on possible
measures to regulate the healthcare market –
and thus also largely on future political deci-
sions.8
In order to take due account of this great un-
certainty, the AWG simulated a number of
scenarios. In the reference scenario, govern-
ment healthcare expenditure in Germany in-
creases from 71/C252% of GDP today to just over
9% by 2060. This would correspond to a rise
in the contribution rate to the statutory
health insurance scheme from around 15%
at present to around 18%. This scenario as-
sumes, first, that average healthcare expend-
iture will initially rise faster than incomes9
and, second, that half of the years gained as
a result of longer life expectancy will be spent

37in good health. A steeper expenditure rise to
just over 10% of GDP would be expected ifspending increased not in relation to per
capita GDP but to the significantly faster
growing measure GDP per employed person.This scenario might be realistic in the sensethat the healthcare sector is comparativelylabour-intensive and cost-saving efficiencygains will not be easy to achieve. Even less fa-vourable scenarios would arise if, additionally,cost-driving advances in medical technologywere to be assumed.
10In the best-case scen-
ario, all years gained as a result of longer lifeexpectancy would be spent in good health.However, even then the expenditure ratiowould still rise to nearly 8
1/C252%.
Long-term care servicesSpending on long-term care services is con-
centrated even more on higher age groupsthan healthcare expenditure. The age-specificdemand for long-term nursing care is of keyimportance in this respect. If it were to re-main constant, long-term care expenditurewould feel the full impact of the demograph-ic shift; however, if the need for long-termcare were to arise only at an increasingly ad-vanced age, growth in spending would besignificantly slower. Further key factors arethe extent to which long-term care will beprovided in future by family members or innursing homes – which incur higher costs tothe statutory social security scheme. The ex-pected change in family structures and theassumed higher labour market participationrate could push down the proportion of long-term care provided by family members. Thereference scenario for Germany
11foresees arise in government long-term care spending
from an initial figure of just under 1% of GDPto 2
1/C252%. This equates to an increase in the
contribution rate from just under 2% atpresent to around 4
1/C252% (excluding the spe-
cial contribution to be paid by the childless).
The calculations for long-term care expend-
iture react particularly sensitively to variationsin the adjustment of long-term care benefitrates. If these are not adjusted in line with per
capita GDP or GDP per employed person but
– in accordance with current legislation inGermany – generally at most in line with in-flation, there would be a near constant ex-penditure ratio in the AWG’s calculations.However, this would mean that real wage in-creases in this particularly labour-intensivesector could only be financed if considerablerationalisation were to occur. Otherwise, aless sharp increase in the expenditure ratiowould mean that long-term care benefit rateswould grow more slowly than wages, thuslosing value in real terms. An increasing pro-portion of the long-term care costs wouldtherefore need to be covered privately orthrough the means-tested basic allowance,which is not taken into account here.

11In the reference scenario, it is assumed that around
half of the years gained through longer life expectancy
will be spent in good health, ie without the need for
long-term care. For the financial benefits, a rise in line
with per capita GDP is applied; for non-financial benefits,
by contrast, a steeper rise in line with GDP per employed
person is assumed.Concentration

the teacher-pupil ratio by 2020 were calcu-
lated. This is relevant in the sense that falling
pupil numbers do not automatically lead to
a corresponding reduction in education ex-
penditure, especially as improved supervision
may be politically desirable. This scenario il-
lustrates, however, that a rising teacher-pupil
ratio causes a rather sharp increase of1/C252per-
centage point in spending on education.
Unemployment
Based on the assumptions regarding labour
market developments, which also form the
basis for calculations in the other areas, the
AWG also provides projections for labour
market-related expenditure relating to the
statutory unemployment insurance scheme
(“unemployment benefit I”). It is assumed
that the quotient of benefits per recipient to
GDP per employed person will remain con-
stant and that the ratio of other labour mar-
ket expenditure to GDP will fall in parallel
with the presumed decline in the unemploy-
ment rate (from around 9% to just over 6%).
On balance, a reduction of around one-third
(from just under 1% to just over1/C252%) in the
ratio of labour market-related expenditure to
GDP is projected. The lower unemployment
rate and the corresponding easing in expend-
iture burdens should come into play by as
early as 2020. Should the assumptions re-garding the development of the structural
unemployment rate prove too optimistic, ex-
penditure would be correspondingly higher in
the absence of further labour market reforms.
Demographic developments and the
long-term sustainability of government
budgets
The long-term sustainability of public finances
hinges on whether future government rev-
enue – without further policy changes – is
sufficient to cover expected expenditure (in-
cluding interest). If it is assumed that govern-
ment revenue and non-age-related spending
will develop proportionately to GDP , the gov-
ernment deficit ratio will be driven solely by
the expenditure increase predicted by the
AWG and by interest payments. The entire
additional fiscal burden would thus be credit-
financed. Based on a straightforward ex-
trapolation, this would result in a government
deficit ratio of almost 6% and a debt ratio of
just under 85% in Germany in 2040.12How-
ever, the starting point for these calculations
is the comparatively favourable public finance
situation in 2008, with a structural deficit
ratio of 1.2% and a debt ratio of 65.9%.13By
contrast, if today’s much less favourable
budgetary outlook were taken as the starting
point, thus taking account of the expected
12As in the AWG’s report, a decline in real GDP growth
from 1.9% to 1.0% and a nominal interest rate of 5%
were applied. It is assumed that the development of the
nominal debt level is influenced solely by the deficits to
be financed. Under the partial analysis approach used
here, the macroeconomic repercussions are generally dis-
regarded.

39dramatic deterioration in the structural
budgetary position, the projected future def-icit and debt ratios would be substantiallyhigher.
To take account of the slowdown in growth
caused by the financial and economic crisis,the AWG carried out further model calcula-tions (see the box opposite). Owing to therelatively strict wage indexation of statutorypensions and the great importance of wagecosts for services in the healthcare, long-termcare and education sectors, the ratio of age-related expenditure is projected to be onlymarginally higher in Germany as a result ofthe crisis. A greater effect would only arise ifweaker growth were to be accompanied by apermanently lower employment level.
Despite the uncertainty associated with such
long-term and schematic calculations, theydo illustrate the need for substantial consoli-dation measures in order to sustainably stabil-ise public finances. The required scale ofthese measures can be estimated using sus-tainability indicators. The “S2 indicator” isboth theoretically substantiated and com-monly used in a European context.

economic crisis on long-term fiscalsustainability
The macroeconomic downturn, which has been
accelerated by the current financial and eco-nomic crisis, has significantly worsened the basefor projections. The AWG’s detailed projectionsregarding age-related expenditure could nottake account of this factor. To assess theseeffects, three scenarios were additionally consid-ered. In the best-case scenario, the currenteconomic contraction is fully offset extremelyrapidly by temporary economic expansion whichexceeds the potential to a matching degree, sothat GDP rebounds to the level of the referencescenario where no crisis has taken place as earlyas the start of the 2020s (rebound scenario). In amedium scenario, the GDP growth originallyassumed is reached again some time after 2022but the growth losses sustained in the meantimeare not made good (lost-decade scenario). Thelevel of GDP would, therefore, be permanentlylower. In the worst-case scenario, potentialgrowth is permanently lower and the deviationfrom the reference path widens continuously(permanent-shock scenario).
For the euro area under the worst-case scenario
of a permanent slowdown in growth, the AWGhas calculated that the expenditure ratio willincrease by almost 2 percentage points. In the EUas a whole, the ratio would be over 1
1/C252percent-
age points higher by 2060. However, the expen-diture ratio for Germany would rise by barely
1/C252percentage point. This reflects, in particular,
the comparatively tight pegging of Germanretirement pensions and other transfers to thedevelopment of wages and salaries as well as– given a virtually constant wage ratio – of GDP.Therefore, in Germany, recipients of governmenttransfers feel the effects of a slower increase inincome – and, conversely, of a more favourabledevelopment – more directly than in many otherEU states. Furthermore, people employed in thefields of healthcare, long-term care and educa-tion will likewise be affected by lower incomes.The overall impact of a slowdown in growth onthe expenditure ratio will be limited by these fac-tors, unless a lower growth path also leads topermanently lower employment levels.

European Commission (see European Commission, Public
finances in EMU – 2008, European Economy (and earlier

ment of around 3% of GDP for Germany.
Although the structural budgetary position in
2008 would be sufficient to reduce the debt
ratio without the age-related rise in spending,
it is not sufficient to cover the demographic-
ally induced burdens. If, instead of the 2008
values, the structural deficit and debt ratios
forecast for 2010 by the European Commis-
sion are taken as the starting point, the con-
solidation requirement would be around
twice as large.
Possible courses of action
Among other things, the publication of me-
dium and long-term projections over the past
two decades has drawn greater public atten-
tion to the fact that foreseeable demographic
changes require a fiscal policy response, and
a number of reforms have already been
adopted. In order to confront these ongoing
challenges, there are three potential ap-
proaches: directly restricting age-related ex-
penditure, improving growth and employ-
ment prospects, and undertaking a forward-
looking and prompt consolidation of public
finances.
Restricting the increase in age-related
expenditure
The burden on future tax and contribu-
tion payers can be reduced directly if the in-
crease in age-related spending is successfully
slowed. This was the aim, in particular, of the
most recent reforms to government old-ageprovision. The modifications to the pension ad-
justment formula are intended to ensure that
pensions grow more slowly than earnings sub-
ject to contributions, thus reducing the relative
pension level. Furthermore, the statutory re-
tirement age is being raised in stages. Both
measures are also intended to restrict growth
in expenditure on civil servants’ pensions.
Despite the continuing financial pressure re-
sulting from demographic developments, at-
tempts are currently being made to reverse
the benefit cuts that have been adopted.
Thus the dampening effect of the “Riester re-
form steps” has been postponed for two
years and, most recently, the extension of the
safeguard clause has ruled out pension cuts
even if contribution payers’ average salaries
fall. If this deferral of the dampening meas-
ures is not made good – as stipulated by law –
this will lead to ongoing additional expend-
iture which is not taken into account in the
AWG’s projections.
Given the increase in life expectancy, raising
the statutory retirement age is a suitable
measure to prevent the retirement phase
from being steadily prolonged in relation to
the working phase. Otherwise, this alone
would automatically lead to a continuous
expansion in expenditure and contribution
rates – even before taking low birth rates into
account. An increase in the statutory retire-
ment age to 67 by 2029 has been stipu-
lated.15Although the current population

be raised by one month each year and from 2024 by two
months each year. Hence those born after 1963 will only

41forecasts predict a near constant annual rise
of just over one month in life expectancy alsoafter 2029, there are no plans as yet to in-crease the retirement age further. If the rela-tive length of the retirement phase to theworking phase is to be kept approximatelyconstant, the AWG’s demographic assump-tions imply the need for a further rise in thestatutory retirement age to 69 by 2060.
16In-
dexing the retirement age to life expectancy(as in Denmark, for example) could be an ap-propriate way of dealing with this expecteddevelopment and of providing a more reliablelonger-term outlook for all concerned.
A key need in the field of healthcare provision
is to exploit efficiency reserves. This relatesboth to the number of health service pro-viders and to the level of recourse to health-care services.
17For the public long-term care
insurance scheme, indexation to inflationmeans that the foundations for a subduedrise in long-term care benefit rates have al-ready been laid. As in the past, a key issue isto identify the benefits that can and shouldbe funded by insurees (and possibly addition-ally by taxpayers).
In principle, private provision can compensate
for the benefit cuts which may arise as a re-sult of spending curbs imposed in the socialsecurity systems. This encompasses both pri-vate and company pension schemes and anexpansion of patient co-payments, either dir-ectly or via supplementary insurance policies,in the healthcare and long-term care sectors.However, lower public spending would thenbe accompanied by higher expenditure onmeans-tested benefits. Although weakeroverall growth in age-related expenditure
would then be mirrored in a lower burden interms of taxes and social contributions, thismight be partly counteracted by higherspending at an individual level. Nevertheless,this would provide an opportunity to identifyand eliminate misdirected provision of bene-fits.
Raising the growth and employment
potential
A lower ratio of employed persons to the
total population means, in itself, that the bur-den of financing existing transfer paymentswill be spread among fewer people, thus in-creasing the individual level of taxes and so-cial contributions. For Germany, a significant-ly sharper drop in the share of persons ofworking age by 2060 is expected (around-30%) than on average in the euro area (ap-proximately -15%). Different demographicdevelopments can be explained, among otherthings, by varying birth rates and migrationlevels. The institutional framework in this re-spect, which is partly shaped by policy deci-sions (eg regarding the structure of the tax
16See Deutsche Bundesbank, Outlook for Germany’s
statutory pension insurance scheme, Monthly Report,

17Although international comparisons should be inter-
preted with caution, various measures point to a relatively
high level of provision in Germany. In 2004, for example,
the number of hospital beds per 100,000 inhabitants in
Germany stood at 858. The corresponding average of
the 25 EU member states (as of 1 May 2004) was only
590. In Germany, the number of visits per inhabitant to
general practitioners and specialist doctors stood at 4.3
and 4.8, respectively, in 2004. The average figures of the
15 pre-enlargement EU member states were 3.8 and 2.6,
respectively. See M Schneider et al, Indikatoren der OMK

42and transfer system or conditions for immi-
gration), therefore also has a bearing on the
future course of population developments.
For a given demographic change there are a
number of approaches to cushioning a fall in
the potential labour force. One option is to
extend the phase of employment. In addition
to raising the retirement age as discussed
above, shortening the duration of education
and training could also play a role in this re-
spect. However, it should be borne in mind
that shortening the period of education and
training could have unwelcome repercussions
for productivity. Moreover, the burden on the
statutory pension insurance scheme would
not be eased in the long term owing to the
resulting increase in benefit claims.
Another way to expand the labour force
would be to increase the labour market par-
ticipation rate, which currently stands at 76%
in Germany.18In particular, a higher labour
market participation rate among persons
aged between 55 and 64 could cushion the
fall in the potential labour force. However,
the AWG’s report already assumes an increase
in Germany for this age group of 16 percent-
age points to 74% by 2060. Germany would
thus be among the EU countries with the
highest labour market participation rate
among older persons (after Sweden and on a
par with Spain). Another crucial requirement
is to effectively curb long-term unemploy-
ment and generally increase employment in-
centives in the tax, social security and transfer
systems. Early retirement schemes pose a
clear obstacle to efforts to bolster potential
output.Higher labour productivity can likewise help
to ease demographically induced burdens. In
the AWG’s report, average annual growth of
1.7% in labour productivity until 2060 was
assumed for Germany (as for the euro area as
a whole), two-thirds of which is attributed to
improved increased total factor productivity
and one-third to capital deepening. Recent
history suggests that this is rather optimistic,
and economic and fiscal policy reforms would
probably be required in order to achieve such
a clear increase. Above all, appropriate under-
lying conditions – including effective competi-
tion legislation and a less distorting tax, social
security and transfer system – may contribute
to growth in physical and human capital. An
efficient education system is likewise of key
importance, which should also embrace per-
sons with immigrant backgrounds. Overall,
however, the broad wage indexation of statu-
tory pensions limits the alleviating effects of
higher labour productivity on the expenditure
ratio.
Prompt consolidation of public finances
Relatively rapid and comprehensive budget-
ary consolidation could reduce the debt ratio,
and interest payments relative to GDP would
then tend to fall. The budgetary leeway
gained as a result could then offset part of
the demographically induced expenditure
growth. In principle, this aspect is also taken
into consideration in the European Stability
and Growth Pact. Thus, the medium-term
budgetary objectives are intended, among
other things, to ensure long-term sustainabil-

43ity of public finances. As part of the update
of the stability and convergence programmes,the member states are to take explicit ac-count of the costs of an ageing populationfor the first time when setting their medium-term budgetary objectives at the end of2009. How exactly this will be implemented isstill subject to debate, however. It is import-ant that the member states do not merelyfactor in a small part of the demographicallyinduced expenditure growth, as the newmedium-term objectives would then be hard-ly more ambitious than the present ones andthe ensuing changes in the targets wouldlead to little progress.
On a national level, new debt rules were re-
cently included in the German constitutionwhich, following a transitional period, willnot permit any structural deficits for the fed-eral states and only allow a very restrictedstructural deficit for central government. If,as these rules stipulate, Germany were toachieve a balanced budget by the middle ofthe next decade, the debt ratio would fallsteadily in the following years. Assuming therevenue ratio and the other expenditureratios remain constant, the resulting interestsavings would suffice until around 2025 tocompensate for the expected increase in age-related expenditure by 1 percentage pointvis-/C224-vis 2016.
19However, even then there
would be no funding concept for the muchlarger rise in age-related expenditure after2025. If no reforms are adopted to further re-Reports on the long-term development
of public finances
In addition to the AWG’s reports, the European
Commission’s Sustainability Reports and occa-sional analyses based on generational account-ing, the Federal Ministry of Finance, for example,also publishes its own report on the sustainabilityof public finances once every legislative period.The timeframe for these calculations currentlyextends until 2050. Furthermore, the FederalGovernment compiles a Civil Servant Pension Re-port once every four years based on projectionsregarding the burden placed on public budgetsby the pensions payable to public-sector employ-ees for the period up to 2050. However, theFourth Civil Servant Pension Report, which wasissued in April 2009, considers only civil servantsemployed by central government. The particu-larly pressing future budgetary problems facingthe federal states are consequently disregarded.
The Federal Government also publishes an Old-
age Provision Report once every legislativeperiod outlining the current and future incomesituation in retirement and the importance ofthe various old-age provision schemes. The pro-jections, which cover existing and new retireesup to and including 2030, include both benefitsunder the statutory pension insurance scheme aswell as government-assisted supplementary pri-vate pension schemes.
The Federal Government’s Old-age Provision Re-
port is updated once a year. This report containsdetailed projections for the statutory pensioninsurance scheme, though for a period of only15 years. The 2008 Old-age Provision Reportcovers the period up until 2022 and thus notablyincludes the year 2020, before which the contri-bution rate is not supposed to exceed 20% andthe relative pension level before tax but afterdeducting social contributions is not supposed tofall below 46%. As taking timely countermeas-ures can make an important contribution toovercoming long-term financing problems, itwould make sense to extend the projection hori-zon – with due regard to the associated greateruncertainty – beyond the 2030 milestone usedin the draft legislation for the latest pensionreforms.

and rising employment, significant structural
surpluses in the German general government
budget would be needed to avoid further ad-
justments in future. This applies at least to
those years in which the demographically in-
duced burdens will still be relatively small. The
earlier the consolidation process starts, the
lower the surpluses will need to be, as inter-
est savings will then be made over a longer
time frame. In addition, prompt fiscal consoli-
dation would also tend to lead to a more
equal intergenerational burden-sharing.20
Concluding remarks
Public finances are currently under consider-
able strain owing to the exceptional financial
and economic crisis. The severity of the reces-
sion will lead – to some extent automatically –
to considerably higher government deficits.
The deterioration – also in structural terms –
in the budgetary position, which is reflected,
not least, in a sharp rise in debt, will restrict
future budgetary leeway. Moreover, it is fore-seeable that demographic developments will
place additional strains on public finances.
Current calculations predict a substantial in-
crease in age-related government spending
even if the reforms already adopted are im-
plemented. Against this backdrop, the cur-
rent deterioration in the structural position of
public finances considerably hampers the task
of achieving a sound initial fiscal position be-
fore the demographically induced burdens
start to have an increasing impact on the gen-
eral government budget. A key need for less-
ening the burden on future generations is to
achieve significant and lasting consolidation
progress as soon as the economy stabilises.
The coming years, which will still see a rela-
tively favourable demographic trend, offer
the chance to implement and, looking further
ahead, extend the reforms initiated in the sys-
tem of old-age provision. Particular attention
will also need to be paid to the healthcare
sector.

45Recent developments
in German
and European
retail paymentsEurope is on the road to a single mar-
ket in cashless payments. The EU Direct-
ive on Payment Services in the internal
market must be transposed into na-
tional legislation by all member states
by 1 November 2009. This will establish
a harmonised legal basis for payments
in Europe. The Directive puts in place
the legal framework for a European
direct debit scheme. Payment institu-
tions will create a new category of pay-
ment service providers which is subject
to less regulation than banks and is de-
signed to improve competition in Euro-
pean payments. Furthermore, work is
also being undertaken on the creation
of a Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).
SEPA credit transfers were introduced
in the market as early as January 2008.
From the beginning of November 2009,
the European banking industry will
also offer the SEPA direct debit. The
aim is that SEPA products will replace
all national payment procedures. Prod-
uct innovations are likely to bring
about further major changes in the
European retail payment market. These
initiatives discussed under the heading
of “eSEPA” could, among other things,
considerably improve the efficiency of
payments via the internet and at trad-
itional retail outlets.

46now. The payments processed in the retail
payments segment have a low priority and
usually involve small amounts. Until the be-
ginning of this decade, the European Com-
mission’s regulatory concerns in this sector
concentrated mainly on improving cross-
border payments in Europe, which were char-
acterised by low transparency and high
prices. Since then, the emphasis has been on
creating a smoothly functioning internal mar-
ket for payment services with the aim of over-
coming the prevailing national segmentation
by means of further harmonisation.1The key
to tackling this is a uniform legal framework,
which was established by the Payment Ser-
vices Directive (2007/64/EC). The Payment
Services Directive (PSD) contains both regula-
tory provisions and other civil law regulations
for the various payment service providers
(such as credit institutions, e-money institu-
tions, payment institutions) and the payment
services they provide (for example, credit
transfers, direct debits, card payments). In
Germany, the transposition of the European
Directive into national law, which, according
to EU provisions, must be completed by 1 No-
vember 2009, has led to a significant expan-
sion of existing provisions regarding pay-
ments. The regulatory aspects of the Directive
are implemented in the Payment Services
Oversight Act ( Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsge-
setz or ZAG), while the civil law provisions
have been incorporated into the Civil Code
(B/C252rgerliches Gesetzbuch ) and its Introduc-
tory Act ( Einf/C252hrungsgesetz zum B/C252rgerlichen
Gesetzbuch or EGBGB).2
At present, payment services can be provided
in the German market only by credit institu-tions which are permitted to conduct giro
business pursuant to section 1 (1) No 9 of the
German Banking Act ( Gesetz /C252ber das Kredit-
wesen or KWG). This means that there are –
amongst others – strict requirements govern-
ing the capital resources of these institutions.
When the Payment Services Oversight Act
comes into force on 1 November 2009, a
new category of providers, known as “pay-
ment institutions”, will be able to provide
payment services. In Germany, the Federal
Financial Supervisory Authority ( Bundes-
anstalt f/C252r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht )i s
responsible for granting a licence to conduct
such business, which is also regulated in the
Payment Services Oversight Act. Payment in-
stitutions are subject to lower capital require-
ments than credit institutions; their business
operations are, however, subject to certain re-
strictions. They may, for example, hold pay-
ment accounts for their customers, but are
allowed to use them exclusively for payment
transactions, while the funds on these
accounts shall not constitute deposits. The
funds on payment accounts must also be col-
lateralised as a matter of principle, for ex-Harmonised

of change in retail payments in the following articles pub-
lished in its Monthly Reports: “The Road to the Single

cent developments in payment cards and innovative elec-
tronic payment procedures”, December 2006, pp 89-

diensteumsetzungsgesetz ) implements the regulatory
provisions of the Payment Services Directive (Title II of the
Directive) as a new Payment Services Oversight Act and
amendments to other laws affected thereby (including
the German Banking Act ( Kreditwesengesetz )). The civil
law regulations consist of information requirements (Title
III of the Directive, to be implemented in Article 248 of
the Introductory Act of the Civil Code) and in business
practice provisions (Title IV of the Directive, to be imple-
mented in sections 675 and 676 of the Civil Code).New cashless

47ample, through insurance or an escrow ac-
count investment at banks. Furthermore,such institutions are not allowed to pay inter-est on customer funds on payment accounts.Moreover, they may only grant credits fromtheir own funds and only in conjunction withpayment services such as card payments.The maximum duration of these credits is12 months.
Initially, the new competition from payment
institutions is unlikely to make much of animpact on the banking industry in Germany.Although market entry for payment institu-tions will be simplified owing to less stringentregulatory conditions, the range of productsthey can provide is strictly limited to paymentproducts. In particular, payment institutionscannot offer their customers the usual com-bination of payments and the safekeeping ofmoney at a low rate of interest, as is possiblewith giro accounts. With this in mind, it islikely that the companies registering as pay-ment institutions in Germany will be mainlythose whose current services will, in future,be classified as payment services. This in-cludes, for example, companies which, incard business, are responsible for the clearingand collection of payments for the retailer(acquiring) or which carry out money trans-mission services. In the medium term, how-
ever, it is possible that non-banks with abroad customer base and/or advanced tech-nological capability – possibly in cooperationwith banks – will also enter the market forpayment services. It should be noted in this
context that payment institutions approved inone EU country can also offer their services inall other EU countries.The PSD also necessitates changes to business
practice in payments. These include addition-al information requirements for providers ofpayment services, which are obligatory in theprivate customer segment, but can be waivedin the business customer segment. The regu-lations concerning execution times, charges,value dating, availability and liability will alsobe revised.
For example, the maximum execution time
(between receipt at the instructed bank andcrediting to the account of the payee) fornon-paper-based payments will be reducedfrom up to three business days at present toone business day in the future. For a transi-tional period until 1 January 2012, paymentproviders can still agree with their customersa period of no longer than three businessdays. Moreover, the execution of paymenttransactions using solely the customer identi-fication (eg IBAN – International BankAccount Number) will be possible in thefuture. It will be left to the discretion of therelevant credit institutions whether they con-tinue to cross-check the account numbersand names of their customers. With regard tothe calculation of charges, payment amountsmust, without exception, be passed on with-out deduction in future.
The legal provisions for value dating and
availability have also led to the further tight-ening of the regulations for the processing oftransactions. Accordingly, credit transfershave to be placed at the payee’s disposal im-
mediately. In future, the value date for credittransfers will therefore be the day on whichthe amount is credited to the payee’s pay-

are met.3For non-authorised payments, the
period in which the payer can raise an objec-
tion is limited to 13 months after the debit
date. Another new aspect is the introduction
of strict liability of the payer in the event of
theft or loss, for example, of his/her payment
card. This liability is limited to 3150, however.
It ceases to apply as soon as the loss has been
reported to the credit institution. This will
encourage the customer to treat the payment
card carefully and responsibly.
The civil law provisions of the PSD impose
stricter obligations on credit institutions, for
example, through stricter liability regulations.
The implementation of these provisions also
incurs greater expense. The shortening of
execution periods and the considerable cut-
back in float profits will have a negative effect
on income. This means that credit institutions
will have to review their existing business
models and turn to other options in order to
reduce handling costs. This could result in
greater efforts in cooperation between banks
in payments.Provision of new payment instruments
Since 2004, the European banking industry
has been working on harmonised European
payment instruments and technical standards
as part of the initiative to create a Single Euro
Payments Area (SEPA). First results are already
available in the form of the SEPA credit trans-
fer and the SEPA direct debit. The European
banking industry also agreed on basic rules
regarding SEPA for cards.
SEPA credit transfers
The SEPA credit transfer, which was de-
veloped by the European Payments Council
(EPC) and largely corresponds to national pro-
cedures, has been offered by almost 4,500
credit institutions in Europe since 28 January
2008. So far, it has not proved particularly
popular, however. In May 2009, SEPA trans-
fers accounted for just 3.9% of all credit
transfers processed via clearing houses in the
euro area. The SEPA credit transfer is currently
being used primarily for cross-border pay-
ments. This also explains the somewhat high-
er percentage of SEPA credit transfers in
other – mainly smaller – European countries.
Since many corporates and public administra-
tions in Germany have announced a single-
step changeover in their payments together
with the SEPA direct debit, a significant
increase may be expected only from 2010
onwards.
3This rule will not affect the German collection author-
isation procedure, however, as, in this case, the customer
subsequently approves the direct debit within six weeks

50SEPA direct debits
With the SEPA direct debit, it is now possible
for the first time to use a direct debit compre-
hensively for cross-border payments in
31 European countries. This requires a uni-
form legal framework. Until now, direct
debits have usually been possible only within
a single country, since the relevant national
procedures have a differing legal basis. This is
due to the liability and refund issues associ-
ated with the direct debit procedure, which
are regulated under civil law in many coun-
tries. The introduction of the SEPA direct
debit therefore requires a harmonised legal
framework to enter into force and is thus
dependent on the transposition of the PSD
into national law in each of the member
states.The EPC started the adherence process for
the new SEPA direct debit in May 2009. The
relevant banks must participate in the proced-
ure to be able to offer the SEPA direct debit.
The only way to ensure the success of the
SEPA direct debit, however, is to ensure
access to this payment method for as many
bank customers as possible, ie if the SEPA dir-
ect debit is supported by the banks which
hold their accounts. If creditors (eg insurance
companies, utilities companies) expect that
SEPA direct debits cannot be processed for a
large number of their customers, they will ini-
tially avoid using them. All providers of pay-
ment services in the euro area which are cur-
rently able to receive national direct debits
will therefore be obliged to accept SEPA dir-
ect debits from November 2010. This is set
forth in the revised Regulation of the Euro-
pean Parliament and Council on Cross-Border
Payments in the Community, which is sched-
uled to enter into force on 1 November 2009.
Two different direct debit procedures are
offered in SEPA: a “core direct debit” and a
procedure intended solely for business cus-
tomer transactions (“business-to-business dir-
ect debit” (B2B)). Both versions differ from
the national procedures used in Germany in
that they use the international codes to iden-
tify accounts (IBAN) and the relevant payment
service providers (BIC: Bank Identifier Code).
The SEPA direct debit is based on a mandate
issued by the debtor to the creditor. The man-
date includes an unambiguous reference and
the data it contains – unlike for the existing
collection authorisation – are forwarded to
the debtor’s bank. On this basis, payment ser-
vice providers can offer additional services,SEPA credit transfers as a 
percentage of all credit 
transfers in the euro area

51such as automated mandate handling for the
payer. In future, creditors will be assigned aunique creditor identifier, which will be issuedin Germany by the Bundesbank.
Another special feature of the new SEPA dir-
ect debit are the envisaged lead times in thesettlement process. These increase processingsecurity and, for example, enable the debtorto be informed in advance of an imminentdirect debit. A SEPA direct debit should gen-
erally be sent to the debtor bank several daysbefore the due date. For the core direct debit,this period is five days for first or one-off dir-ect debits and two days for subsequent directdebits, whereas it is only one day for B2B dir-
ect debits. The system currently used in Ger-many, which involves the redemption of dir-ect debits upon presentation and the associ-ated faster payment of debits for the creditor
could be incorporated into the SEPA directdebit, for example, by establishing an add-itional national service.
To begin with, the SEPA direct debit will prob-
ably find only limited use in Germany. Unlikein many other European countries, the collec-tion authorisations issued for the nationalprocedure cannot be used as the law standsat present for the collection of SEPA direct
debits. The existing direct debit mandateauthorises only collection by the creditor anddoes not allow the debtor’s payment serviceprovider to debit the debtor’s account. Ittherefore does not meet the legal require-
ments for a SEPA mandate. The initiation ofSEPA direct debits in Germany would there-fore necessitate the issuing of new SEPAComparison of SEPA direct debit (core) and the collection authorisation procedure

52mandates, which is complex for the user. This
may diminish the acceptance of the new pro-
cedure considerably. To avoid this and
increase the use of SEPA direct debits from
the outset, the German banking industry and
the Bundesbank have submitted a proposal
for the migration of direct debit mandates to
SEPA mandates. In line with this proposal,
debtors are to be informed by the creditor
that their direct debit authorisation mandate
has been migrated to a SEPA direct debit
mandate and to be granted a period of two
months in which to raise any objections. This
solution, however, requires the mandate mi-
gration to be legally supported, which is not
yet the case. If such a solution for migration
to SEPA mandates failed to be adopted in
Germany, several hundred million mandates
for national direct debits would have to be re-
placed in a laborious process. As a result, the
SEPA migration in Germany, the country with
the most direct debits in Europe, would thus
be delayed for years. This, in turn, could have
a negative impact on the entire SEPA project
– which is also a political project – since, for
reasons of efficiency, many companies are
planning to migrate to SEPA credit transfers
and SEPA direct debits in a single step. Ger-
many’s reputation as a financial centre could
also suffer a setback. Not only might Ger-
many be accused of cutting itself off inter-
nationally, German providers would scarcely
be able to offer SEPA direct debits at competi-
tive rates in Europe owing to the low uptake.
Furthermore, the hesitance of public adminis-
trations is an impediment to the widespread
use of the SEPA procedure in Germany. Public
administrations are reluctant to convert theirpayments to SEPA and thus provide an
example of migration to the new instru-
ments. In Germany, government social and
salary payments account for more than 30%
of GDP . The migration of these payment
flows could lead to a significant increase in
SEPA payments in Germany. However, this
would require a higher prioritisation of the
SEPA project at all levels of public administra-
tion. Another impediment to SEPA migration
in Germany is the high degree of flexibility of
the German direct debit procedure, which is
reflected in the development of pragmatic so-
lutions for specific transactions (for example,
mandates for collection authorisation are no
longer required in written form). It should be
noted, however, that these proceedings do
not comply with regulations in the strict
sense. The resulting risks are usually borne by
the bank concerned (in most cases, the cred-
itor’s bank).
Not least, the various business models for dir-
ect debits pose problems for the introduction
of the SEPA direct debit. While, in many
countries, the participating credit institutions
have to cover the costs they incur themselves,
transaction-related interchange fees are
agreed multilaterally in some countries. In
such cases, the creditor’s bank has to pay a
certain amount of money per transaction to
the debtor’s bank as a reimbursement of
expenses. Germany therefore has a special
status since interchange fee are incurred only
in the case of return direct debits. The cred-
itor’s bank thus compensates the debtor’s
bank for the increased efforts incurred in pro-
cessing return direct debits. The European
Commission recently signalled that, onSupport from

53grounds of competition law and owing to a
lack of immediate economic necessity, it willnot permit multilateral transaction-relatedinterchange fees in the direct debit procedurein the longer-term. It has, however, allowed athree-year transitional period in which thebusiness models used for legacy direct debitsin the country concerned can also be appliedfor national SEPA direct debits. For cross-border SEPA direct debits, interchange fees ofa maximum of 8.8 cents per transaction canbe charged during this period. This rulingaims to facilitate migration and prevent theSEPA direct debit from being placed at a dis-advantage in comparison with legacy instru-ments. This should allay the fears of manyusers – in Germany, too – that the introduc-tion of the SEPA direct debit could lead to anincrease in the cost of payments.
SEPA for card paymentsThe market for payment cards in Europe
(credit and debit cards) has been highly frag-mented until now. Credit cards are normallyissued by banks in return for a fee on behalfof the major international card companies(such as MasterCard or VISA). By contrast,the debit card segment is dominated by na-tional schemes. Debit cards – as in the giro-card system developed by the German bank-
ing industry
4– are usually issued in conjunc-
tion with a giro account by the bank which
holds the account. These national debit cards
can, for example, be used for cashless pay-
ments and to withdraw money from ATMs,but are basically restricted to domestic use. In
order to enable cross-border usage of nation-al debit cards in the context of co-badging,the infrastructures of international schemes
are generally used to process cross-bordertransactions. The national debit card schemesin most European countries are based on dif-ferent business models and technical stand-ards, which has led to the strong fragmenta-tion of the European cards market.
The aim established in the EPC’s 2006 SEPA
Cards Framework (SCF) is that no cardscheme intended exclusively for national usewill be in operation from 2011. With SEPA forcards, the fundamental preconditions shouldbe realised in order to use any card at any ter-minal. This is intended to put in place a singlemarket for card payments in Europe. A keycomponent of this is the creation of effectivecompetition at all levels of a card transaction:issuing, acquiring, acceptance, and process-ing. Besides eliminating national legal andbusiness policy practices, this necessitates thecreation of a single technical standard (inter-
operability). As a common security standard,for example, the SCF requires all paymentcards, card terminals and ATMs in SEPA to beequipped with EMV standard chip technol-ogy. This standard has already largely been
adopted for payment cards and ATMs in Ger-many, whereas only a very small percentageof retail card terminals are equipped with
EMV technology. Moreover, although the EPCapproved a framework for standardisation ofcard payments in December 2008, this can-not be implemented as a standard owing to a

54lack of technical and functional specifica-
tions.
Generally, the rules for SEPA card payments in
the SCF are not as clearly defined as the very
detailed procedural descriptions for SEPA
credit transfers and SEPA direct debits. Fur-
ther efforts will therefore be required on the
part of the European banking industry – espe-
cially with regard to the development and
implementation of standards, for example,
for the authorisation and processing of card
payments – if the SEPA compliance of pay-
ment systems is not to become a mere matter
of form.
The SCF provides for a number of options in
achieving a single European area for card pay-
ments. These include replacing national card
schemes with existing international schemes,
cooperating with international card schemes,
and interconnecting or expanding national
schemes on a Europe-wide basis. The devel-
opment of at least one additional European
card scheme would, in any case, be a desir-
able way of improving competition and effi-
ciency in the card market. Otherwise, there is
either the risk of the two international card
schemes, which promote their strong brand,
worldwide acceptance and, supposedly,
greater profitability, dominating the market
or a continuation of the status quo with
many exclusively national schemes.
In the meantime, some market initiatives in
this area have emerged. The Euro Alliance of
Payment Schemes (EAPS), for example, is
working on interlinking existing national
debit card schemes. Thus far, schemes fromGermany (girocard), Italy, Spain, Portugal and
the United Kingdom as well as the European
ATM network EUFISERV have been inter-
linked. However, since major markets such as
France are not yet connected, this initiative
currently lacks reach.
Furthermore, a number of large German and
French credit institutions plan to establish a
European alternative in the card market with
their “MONNET” initiative. Their aim is to cre-
ate a new card payment scheme based on an
attractive, future-oriented business model.
This approach is still in the planning stage,
however. A third initiative, called “PayFair”,
involves the development of a card scheme
which enables account-related payment cards
to be issued by both credit institutions and
retailers. This project is currently in the pilot
phase and is scheduled to be launched in
Belgium in autumn this year. Although the
design and structure of European alternatives
is essentially to be left to the market, it
remains crucial that full use is made of the
efficiency level of European integration and a
sufficiently high level of acceptance is
achieved in the euro area as a whole.
In order to further develop the European card
market, costing certainty has to be ensured
with regard to the long-term business model
and, in particular, the application of multilat-
eral interchange fees. In this regard, the Euro-
pean Commission has generally approved an
interchange fee for cross-border MasterCard
transactions, but only in conjunction with a
considerable reduction – compared with pre-
vious rates – to 0.2% (for debit cards) and
0.3% (for credit cards). Even if the EuropeanOptions for

55Commission takes a case-by-case approach
and demands proof of the benefits of aninterchange fee using an economic model,this decision is likely to be taken as a signalfor other card schemes. In the longer term, itcould also become a yardstick for the relevantnational competition authorities.
Development of demand:
payment behaviour
Card payments increased sharply in EU coun-
tries between 2000 (12 billion transactions)and 2007 (27 billion transactions).
5Nonethe-
less, payment behaviour in Europe still varies
greatly owing to the diverse historical devel-
opments. For example, in Germany the direct
debit is the most used cashless payment in-strument (48%). Basically, the direct debit
offers payment recipients the major advan-tage of being able to manage their ownliquidity, while payers benefit from its greatconvenience. Moreover, the German directdebit procedure is simple and flexible; one-off
payments, in particular, can be dealt withquickly and smoothly. By contrast, card pay-ments play a major role for example in Scan-dinavian countries and the United Kingdom,while, in contrast with most other Europeancountries, cheques are still very popular inFrance and Ireland.
Around 30% of the German retail sales are
transacted using debit cards. On the onehand, these are “genuine” debit card pay-ments based on the German “electroniccash” system which are made using a PINand constitute a guarantee for the retailer.On the other hand, electronic direct debittransactions (ELV) are also included in this fig-
ure. Here, a collection authorisation order(without payment guarantee) to be signed by
the customer is generated based on the datastored on the debit card. The ratio betweenthese two types of transactions has shiftedsignificantly in favour of electronic cash inrecent years. In addition to the higher level ofsecurity, the fact that the banking industryhas made the use of this procedure moreattractive, especially for retailers accepting alarge number of card payments, plays a keyrole in this respect.Use of cashless payment

56The popularity of the electronic cash proced-
ure is revealed by its wide market coverage.
There are currently 95 million debit cards in
circulation in Germany. According to a Bun-
desbank study,6around 90% of those sur-
veyed possess at least one debit card. One
major factor in determining its use in the
retail trade is the amount to be paid. The
majority of payments made using debit cards
are between 350 and 3100. Furthermore,
there are considerable differences in the place
and purpose of payment. Overall, there con-
tinues to be considerable potential for expan-
sion in debit card payments in Germany. This
is suggested by the fact that less than half of
the debit card holders interviewed used their
card at least once a week on average. Add-
itionally, given an annual average of around
25 card payments per capita , the availablefigures indicate that Germany is well below
the European average (around 55 card pay-
ments per capita ).
With a share of around 5% in retail sales,
credit cards play only a secondary role in Ger-
many. Owing to the wide availability of over-
draft facilities in Germany, credit cards in the
true sense (ie with an actual credit function)
have not managed to penetrate the market.
Credit card ownership in Germany – around
14 million in 2007 – is highly dependent on
gender, age, educational background and
household income. Moreover, retailers and
restaurants are somewhat reluctant to accept
credit cards owing to the high fees charged in
some cases. It remains to be seen how far theUse of payment instruments by place/purpose of payment

57recent European Commission decisions on
card business, which led to a reduction ininterchange fees, will lead to greater accept-ance and, thus, greater use of credit cards.
Expectations regarding the Geldkarte have
not been fulfilled. The chip embedded in the
card, which is used for this purpose can, forinstance, be loaded at ATMs and used atvending machines to buy cigarettes, parkingtickets and tickets for public transport. Theamendments to the Law for the Protection ofChildren and Youth ( Jugendschutzgesetz ),
and the proof of age, which is a function alsostored on the chip, were expected to increasethe use of the Geldkarte . Nonetheless, only
50 million payments or thereabouts weretransacted in this way in 2008. As well aslimited opportunities for use, this may be dueto the lack of awareness about the existenceof this function on the chip: although theGeldkarte chip can be found on around 80%
of all girocards, only one-fifth of those inter-viewed for the Bundesbank study claimed tohave one.
Innovative payment proceduresThe term “innovative payment procedures”
encompasses payments which, with the sup-port of modern information and communica-
tion technology, initiate payments which arethen processed mostly on the basis of estab-lished bank procedures (credit transfer, directdebit, card payment).
7
More than anything, the sharp rise in internet
trading in Europe, particularly in Germany,could lead to perceptible changes in cashlesspayments. Although traditional payment pro-
cedures still predominate in this area, theBundesbank study showed that 10% ofonline purchases were settled using specialinternet payment procedures. These includecollection procedures (eg Click & Buy), server-based e-money systems, for example PayPal,as well as the German giropay procedure. Thelatter is an online credit transfer procedure inwhich the customer is directed straight fromthe pay window of the internet retailer to itsbank’s online portal. The retailer receives pay-ment confirmation immediately after the pay-ment has been executed. The immensegrowth potential of such procedures is illus-trated by their growth elsewhere in Europewhere, for example, the Dutch iDEAL systemhas attracted a market share of 40% ofonline retailing within just a few years.
Expectations are also high with regard to con-
tactless payment procedures based on NFCtechnology (NFC: Near Field Communica-tion). Here, payment is initiated using either acard equipped for the purpose or with a chipintegrated into a mobile phone. The paymentitself is then processed using prepaid credit or
as a debit or credit card transaction or as adirect debit. This technology is particularly at-tractive for public transport as it also allowsthe ticket to be stored (paperless ticket). InGermany, for example, Deutsche Bahn (Touch
& Travel) and the public transport networkRhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund are in the pro-cess of introducing contactless payment pro-
cedures. International card companies are

58also trying to use this technology to penetrate
the low-value payment segment, which, to
date, has been dominated by cash. According
to the Bundesbank study, almost 95% of all
payments of up to 320 are still made in cash
in Germany.
Users are relatively hesitant to change their
payment behaviour. It is therefore essential
that innovative payment procedures meet
customer needs, such as comfort and safety,
to the largest possible extent. Moreover, po-
tential users must be familiarised quickly with
the handling of innovative products and their
associated instruments. Particular attention
should be paid to safeguarding privacy and
protecting data from unauthorised use.
Preferences for using payment instruments
depend heavily on their acceptance. An in-
novative instrument is not received well by
consumers if it is accepted only by a relatively
small number of (internet) retailers or restrict-
ed to regional use. It is therefore also neces-
sary for retailers to benefit from the new pro-
cedures through fast as well as, compared
with cash, cheaper payment processing and,
where possible, through better customer re-
tention. Since the coexistence of various tech-
nologies can hamper market penetration,
interoperability between various providers
plays a major role.
Furthermore, open models based on cooper-
ation between various market partners are
far superior to smaller, insular solutions
which, for instance, require the use of a cer-
tain mobile telephone network or particular
handset. In France, for example, the “PayezMobile” project, which is currently in the pilot
phase, is a cooperative venture between
banks, mobile telephone providers, inter-
national card schemes and terminal manufac-
turers. It is scheduled to be introduced
throughout France in 2010.
In the eyes of the European Commission and
the Eurosystem, innovative forms of payment
also play a major role with regard to SEPA.
The Eurosystem sums these up under the
term eSEPA. As shown by a European Com-
mission study in 2008, comprehensive use of
electronic billing, for example, would give a
further significant boost to the efficiency
gains of a single market in cashless pay-
ments.8In order to speed up this develop-
ment, the European Commission and the
Eurosystem are supporting the EPC in the
development of new initiatives for eSEPA.
The EPC is itself currently working on de-
veloping frameworks for the initiation of
SEPA payments in electronic form or via mo-
bile channels. The linking-up of existing, na-
tional internet payment procedures is intend-
ed to make them usable throughout Europe.
In addition, by the end of 2010, guidelines
are to be drafted regarding the initiation and
receipt of SEPA credit transfers and SEPA card
payments by mobile phone. These are de-
signed to serve as a basis for further cooper-
ation and standardisation in Europe. A gen-
eral framework, such as that applicable in the
card sector, would be of little use here.
Instead, a precise set of rules defining com-

59mon procedures and standards for all the par-
ties involved will be essential.
Outlook
SEPA and the implementation of the PSD will
make it easier for payment services providers
to enter the national markets of other Euro-
pean countries. Competition in the European
market for payment services will therefore
intensify. In the medium term, the prices of
payment services can thus be expected to
converge at a low level throughout Europe as
a result of greater transparency and a larger
selection of providers. Individual providers
may also try to differ from each other by of-
fering customer-specific value-added services.
However, this would require all providers to
gear their strategies comprehensively to
SEPA. Minimum investments which only
allow a small volume of transactions to be
processed in the SEPA segment would not be
helpful in achieving the overall aim. Equally
unsustainable is a proposal which has been
reintroduced into the discussion by some
users; this focuses on retaining the German
payment procedures whilst incorporating the
technical SEPA standards, but not the other
SEPA standards. Moreover, it would be neces-
sary for the banking industry to offer the
SEPA direct debit as soon as possible, ie by
November this year.
A single European payments market ultimate-
ly requires the general use of SEPA instru-
ments. This would also form the basis for fur-
ther innovations in European payments.
When the SEPA process was conceived, thebanking industry assumed that increasing
market demand for the new products would,
for business management reasons, lead more
or less automatically to the phasing out of
existing national instruments. However, this is
unlikely to be the case. Although business
customers have shown some interest in SEPA
owing to the new quality of its cross-border
aspect, the necessary investment will not be
made on a sufficient scale until the develop-
ment path is certain. Furthermore, short-term
adjustment costs often play a bigger role in
the relevant decisions than long-term eco-
nomic advantages. Another factor is that the
concept of SEPA is not yet anchored on a
broader base. The national procedure is
offered as standard both at the counter and
online by almost all credit institutions in Ger-
many. The IBAN and BIC are quoted on the
bills of only a small number of public adminis-
trations and private firms. These international
codes are only reluctantly printed on bank
customer cards and payment forms, too.
Bank statements are the only documents to
contain the IBAN and BIC, as prescribed.
If SEPA is actually to overcome the fragmen-
tation of the European payment services mar-
ket, an end-date for the SEPA migration has
to be set. Owing to the differing interests
within the European banking industry, how-
ever, there are doubts as to whether the mar-
ket alone can agree on a deadline for phasing
out the national legacy instruments. Regula-
tory measures, such as an ECB or EU regula-
tion, must therefore be considered.
In order to increase acceptance of the SEPA
instruments among users, it is equally import-SEPA and PSD
will intensify

60ant to ensure an adequate involvement of
stakeholders other than the banking industry
in the further SEPA process. To guarantee
that all participants are involved in an appro-
priate and timely manner, a forum to discuss
strategic topics relating to European retailpayments might be found to be helpful. This
forum should be based on the European
organisational structures of the banking in-
dustry which were created with SEPA and
have proven successful notwithstanding
some difficulties.European
