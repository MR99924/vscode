5CommentariesEconomic conditions
IndustryIn spring, industrial business activity remained
at the higher level of the preceding months.Although output in May was somewhatlower than in April in seasonally and working-day adjusted terms, it was slightly higher onan average of April and May than the com-parable figure for the first quarter. There wasa year-on-year increase of 2
1/C254% compared
with 33/C254% on an average of the first three
months of the year.
In May, the volume of orders received by in-
dustry was noticeably up on the rather lowlevel of the preceding month after seasonaland working-day adjustment. Nevertheless,on an average of the last two months (Apriland May), the intake of orders fell somewhatshort of that in the first quarter. All in all, thevolume of new orders received by German in-dustry only matched the intake in the sameperiod of 2004 following a significant in-crease in the first three months of the year.
Foreign demand for German industrial goods
slackened in particular. Although there was aperceptible improvement in May, not least inconnection with several large orders in thearea of manufacturing of other transportequipment, the combined figures for Apriland May show a decline. At the same time,domestic business activity remained largely atthe quite low level where it has already beenfor some while.Output

6Construction
The situation in the construction sector re-
mained unfavourable throughout the report-ing period. Although output in May was mar-ginally higher – after adjustment for seasonaland working-day variations – than in April,when construction activity had returned tonormal after the winter hold-ups, the levelwas still clearly down on the year (-6
1/C254%).
In April, seasonally adjusted demand for con-
struction work was well down on March.However, it was slightly up on the averagelevel of the first quarter, which had probablyalso been adversely affected by the unfavour-able weather conditions. The year-on-yeardecline was again in double figures.
Overall economic outputThe available data, in particular on develop-
ments in industry, construction, trade and theexternal sector, suggest that overall economicoutput in the second quarter of 2005 more orless matched that of the first quarter, inwhich there had been a sharp increase. Do-mestic demand is likely to have had a bolster-ing effect. For example, real fixed capital for-mation may have grown, unlike in the firstquarter, and private consumption expenditurewas probably just as high as in the precedingquarter. There was also a sharp build-up ofinventories in the period under review. Thisdevelopment should also be seen in connec-tion with the rise in imports. Net exports,therefore – in contrast to the early part of theyear – appear to have made a negative contri-bution to GDP growth.Economic conditions in Germany*

7Labour market
Throughout the period under review, the
labour market was primarily marked by theeffects of labour market policy measures,which are obscuring cyclical developments.For example, while employment was stillshowing a slight rise in seasonally adjustedterms in May, this increase was essentiallybrought about by an expansion of auxiliarytypes of employment, ie one-euro jobs orsecond jobs. In the periods prior to this, mini-jobs and self-employment promoted by busi-ness start-up grants had been a factor. Ac-cording to Federal Statistical Office data, theseasonally adjusted total number of personsin work went up to 38.99 million in May. Asin April, this was about 135,000 persons, or0.4%, more than in 2004.
Unemployment was also affected by the in-
crease in auxiliary jobs as persons who workmore than 15 hours per week are no longercounted as unemployed. The seasonally ad-justed number of persons officially registeredas unemployed fell to 4.86 million in June.The year-on-year increase went down to470,000 from almost 515,000 in May. Thisrepresents an unemployment rate of 11.7%,compared with 11.8% in May.
The number of unemployed calculated by the
Federal Statistical Office in accordance withthe ILO standard on the basis of a telephonesurvey fell to a seasonally adjusted 3.97 mil-lion in May (more recent statistics are unavail-able at present). The corresponding joblessrate fell from 9.6% in April to 9.3% inMay. The delayed seasonal upturn on thelabour market may have played a part in
this.
PricesUp to the end of the period under review,
price developments were being noticeably af-fected by the sharp fluctuations in spot mar-ket prices on the international oil markets.New record highs of more than US$60 werereached in the last weeks. Prior to this, therising trend in oil prices, which began inDecember following a preceding low, hadbeen interrupted for a time, with prices fall-ing below US$49 for a barrel of Brent NorthSea oil. As the euro was tending to depreciateon the foreign exchange markets, price in-creases in the euro area were even sharper.
German import prices (for which data are cur-
rently available up to May) fell somewhat inseasonally adjusted terms given the moderateeasing of oil prices in that month. The year-on-year rate of increase, which had been asmuch as 3.3% in April, went down to 2.2%.In the case of industrial producer prices, theprice rise which had been apparent in season-ally adjusted terms since the end of 2004halted in May. The year-on-year increase,which had been 4.6% in April, went down to4.1%.
The year-on-year consumer inflation rate in-
creased from 1.7% in May to 1.8% in June.Prices remained unchanged in seasonally ad-justed terms. Industrial goods played a keyrole in this. There were even falls in foodprices and the volatile prices of package holi-days. This was offset by fairly sharp rises in

8the prices of refined petroleum products,
however. There was actually a double-digitincrease in the price of light heating oil.
Public finances
General government debtAs defined in the Maastricht Treaty, the con-
solidated debt of general government (cen-tral, state and local government, and socialsecurity funds) amounted to 31.464 trillion at
the end of the first quarter. This represents anincrease of around 327 billion compared with
the end of 2004. Vis-/C224-vis the same periodlast year, the consolidated debt went up by352 billion.
Indebtedness of central, state and
local government
The indebtedness of central, state and local
government (as defined in the government’sfinancial statistics) declined by 33.6 billion in
May. The largest reduction ( 32.9 billion) was
made by central government although it con-currently reduced its money market depositsby34.8 billion. Whereas its liabilities on the
money market went up by 34.7 billion, its
capital market debt declined by 37.7 billion.
In particular, the volume of Federal bonds(Bunds) in circulation decreased by 34.6 bil-
lion. The scheduled redemption of a securityfrom 1995 ( 310.2 billion), which carried a
6.875% coupon, and the repurchases under-taken for market management purposes(31.1 billion) were partly offset by the issue of
a ten-year Bund with a volume of 36.7 billion.Offering an issue yield of 3.35%, central gov-
ernment was able to refinance much morecheaply. The outstanding volume of five-yearFederal notes (Bobls) went down by 32.8 bil-
lion on balance. State government loweredits liabilities marginally by 30.6 billion. Where-
as state government reduced its outstandingvolume of treasury notes by 32.2 billion, it
raised its direct borrowing from banks by31.6 billion. The ERP special funds redeemed
bank loans in the amount of 30.4 billion. By
contrast, there is likely to have been a furthermoderate increase in local government in-debtedness.

tral government repaid 31.6 billion of net li-Net borrowing in the market

9abilities. This was mainly attributable to the
redemption of money market loans amoutingto33.6 billion. By contrast, capital market
debt grew by 32 billion on balance. The
volume of outstanding Bobls went up by34.3 billion. The second topping-up of series
146 issued in April yielded around 34 billion.
Compared with the previous month, the issueyield was down by a further 26 basis pointsto 2.48%. With a coupon of 3.25%, the pre-mium was 3.44%. The outstanding volumeof Bunds increased by 33.8 billion. The first
issue of a five-year US dollar Bund with anominal value of US$5 billion and a couponof 3.875% raised the equivalent of almost34 billion. According to the Federal Ministry
of Finance, the issue, which had not beendefinitively included in the annual issuancecalendar for 2005, was hedged fully againstcurrency risks. For this purpose, the 2005Budget Act contains an authorised volumefor corresponding hedging transactions. Thepreamble to the Act states that foreign cur-rency liabilities should only be incurred whenthey provide an advantage because of inter-est rate spreads on the market. The outstand-ing volume of two-year Federal Treasurynotes (Sch/C228tze) was reduced by 35.1 billion
on balance. Bank loans worth 31 billion were
redeemed.
In the first half of 2005 central government
borrowed 323.2 billion. Around half of the
debt increase was covered by the issue ofBunds, the respective share of which in theoverall debt marginally declined (to just under57%). Owing to the strong recourse to themoney market, the percentage of short-termloans in total debt rose to over 5%. Whereascentral government resorted increasingly to
Sch/C228tze, as was the case in the last few years,loans against borrowers’ notes continued tolose significance. The relative weight of Boblsalso declined marginally after their risingtrend in the last few years.

10by36.1 billion. In the previous month, it had
risen by 337.8 billion. A net 34.7 billion
worth of foreign paper was sold in Germany.
The main factors behind the net redemptions
of German bonds and notes were the lowlevel of new sales by the credit institutionsand large public sector redemption commit-ments. In net terms, bank debt securitieswere issued to the value of a mere 31.2 bil-
lion, compared with 320.8 billion in April. At
32.0 billion, net sales of other bank bonds
were significantly lower than in the previousmonth ( 313.4 billion). Sales of securities of
mortgage banks and specialised credit institu-tions amounted to 30.8 billion and 30.6 bil-
lion respectively, and the volume of publicPfandbriefe outstanding declined by 32.1 bil-
lion.Federal and state governments reduced their
capital market debt in May by 39.6 billion
net. The volume of ten-year Federal bonds(Bunds) and five-year Federal notes (Bobls)fell by 36.3 billion and 32.8 billion respective-
ly while state governments redeemed theirown debt securities in the amount of 30.5 bil-
lion net. On balance, the only sales were oftwo-year Federal Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze)(30.5 billion) and Federal savings notes
(30.1 billion). The volume of 30-year bonds
outstanding remained virtually unchanged.
Borrowing in the German bond market by
non-financial corporations was concentratedin the longer-term segment, with issues oflonger-term corporate bonds amounting to32.1 billion.
The large net redemptions of public sector
bonds led to a substantial shift in emphasis ininvestors’ bond portfolios. Thus, while foreigninvestors invested 36.3 billion in private sec-
tor bonds, they reduced their holdings ofpublic sector paper by 35.7 billion overall. Do-
mestic non-banks increased their stocks offoreign bonds and reduced their holdings ofGerman debt securities by the same amount(35.8 billion). By contrast, the credit institu-
tions’ holdings of fixed-interest securitieswere less strongly affected by structuralshifts. Overall, their bond holdings declinedby32 billion, which was due primarily to the
redemptions of public sector paper.

11of30.2 billion. By contrast, there were con-
siderable equity purchases by foreign invest-ors ( 336.7 billion). At the same time, domes-
tic credit institutions and non-banks sold Ger-man equities in the amount of 320.4 billion
and 316.1 billion respectively. This partly en-
tailed the unwinding of transactions in theprevious month in which the foreign invest-ment funds had replaced dividend paymentswith price gains for tax reasons.
Mutual fund sharesIn May, domestic mutual funds experienced
inflows of 31.3 billion, which was down
again by half on the previous month. Institu-tional investors placed 31.2 billion in special-
ised funds. Among the investment fundsopen to the general public, only the bond-based funds recorded inflows of funds, whichamounted to 31.1 billion. The German share-
based and money market funds each had toredeem shares to the value of 30.5 billion.
Moreover, resident investors purchased acomparatively large amount of foreign fundshares ( 32.2 billion).
Balance of payments
The German current account closed with a
surplus of 35.2 billion in May, 32.0 billion
below the previous month’s figure. This wascaused by both a decrease in the trade sur-plus and a rise in the deficit on invisible cur-rent transactions, which comprise services,income and current transfers.According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the foreign trade sur-plus fell by 30.7 billion in May to 312.0 bil-
lion. In seasonally adjusted terms, too, thetrade balance stood at 312 billion, down
3
1/C252billion on the month. This can be attrib-
uted to the fact that a sharp rise in the ex-ports of goods (4% seasonally adjusted, com-pared with April) was exceeded by a rise ofjust under 6% in the imports of goods. In athree-month comparison (March to May,compared with December to February), ex-ports rose by 2
1/C252%. In the same period, im-
ports rose by 3%, although this was some-what lower in real terms.
There was a month-on-month increase in the
deficit on invisible current transactions of31.4 billion to 35.9 billion. This meant that
the slight decrease in the deficit on income(of30.8 billion to 31.2 billion) was eclipsed by
the increase in the deficit on services (of 31.6
billion to 32.6 billion) and on current transfers
(of30.6 billion to 32.0 billion).
Cross-border portfolio investment resulted in
net capitaI imports of 326.9 billion in May,
following substantial net capital exports inthe preceding months. This turnaround wasgreatly influenced by large transactionsby foreign investors involving substantialamounts of German shares which they hadtemporarily placed on the German market inApril and some of which they bought backagain in the month under review. Total pur-chases by foreign investors in May amountedto336.6 billion. By contrast, they cut back

12in April) and sold a net amount of money
market paper ( 33.3 billion). German residents
invested less heavily in terms of value in for-eign capital markets in May than in the previ-ous month ( 310.2 billion, compared with
320.3 billion in April). They acquired bonds
and notes ( 37.1 billion), shares ( 33.3 billion)
and mutual fund shares ( 32.2 billion) but sold
a net amount of money market paper ( 32.4
billion).
Direct investment was in balance in May, with
both German parent companies withdrawingcapital from their branches abroad and for-eign groups withdrawing capital from theiraffiliated companies in Germany. There werevery few transactions, however.
Non-securitised credit transactions with non-
banks led to net capital imports of 33.6 billion
in May. These can be attributed mainly to fi-nancial transactions by general government,which – primarily as a result of a reduction inshort-term claims – imported funds fromabroad ( 35.1 billion). Enterprises and indiv-
duals accounted for outflows of funds ( 31.6
billion). The same was true of the credit trans-actions of the banking system, through whichthere were net outflows of 318.1 billion.
Almost all of these can be attributed to theincrease in claims at the Bundesbank, primar-ily balances within the large-value paymentsystem TARGET ( 316.7 billion).

13Rapid change in
paid employmentPaid employment in Germany is under-
going a radical transformation. Trad-itional or “normal” contracts of em-ployment in the form of dependentfull-time employment for an unlimitedperiod are becoming less and lessprevalent. This is a widespread trendand is now apparent, albeit to a vary-ing extent, in nearly all sectors ofthe economy. While the increase inpart-time jobs often accommodateswomen’s wishes for paid employment,the expansion of other forms of em-ployment is being driven, to a majorextent, by corporate demand for la-bour.
This finding is not just a reflection of
the substantial needs for adjustment inenterprises. It also reflects changes inthe underlying conditions in terms oflabour market policy and of taxes andsocial security contributions, which areto be seen as a response by economicpolicymakers over the past few yearsto the persistent major imbalances onthe labour market. If the existing vari-ation in arrangements concerningworking hours is taken into consider-ation along with the present broadrange of forms of employment, manydifferent options are now available forworking patterns at the firm level,which signifies a considerable increasein the flexibility of labour deploymentin the economy.

14Structural shifts in forms of employment
According to the figures of the Federal Statis-
tical Office, almost 39 million persons are ingainful employment in seasonally adjustedterms. That is almost exactly as many as atthe beginning of the 1990s. The fact that theaggregated stock figures are largely constantdoes, however, conceal marked structuralshifts in the status of the employed. For ex-ample, the statistics of the German Institutefor Employment Research (IAB) show that thelevel of persons in full-time employment de-clined by one-fifth between 1991 and 2004.On balance, nearly 6 million persons have de-parted from this core segment of the labourmarket, resulting in its overall size decreasingfrom what used to be 29
1/C252million to no more
than 233/C254million at the end of the period
under review.
The crucial counterweight to this is formed
by the group of persons in part-time jobs,among which, in this context, those work-ing exclusively on a part-time low-incomebasis are also counted. As defined by the Fed-eral Employment Agency, part-time work isdeemed to be employment in which, by con-tractual agreement, a person does not workfull-time but on a regular basis for part ofwhat are, normally, standard or negotiatedworking hours. Over one-quarter of all em-ployed persons now belong to this category.At just under 11 million, their number has al-most doubled since the early 1990s (1991:5
1/C252million). Self-employment has also be-
come more important. Including members offamilies who assist in family-run businessesand who are usually assigned to this group inthe statistics, 4
1/C254million, or 11% of all per-
sons in gainful employment, were self-employed at the end of the period underreview. At the beginning of the 1990s, thefigure had been 9%.
Part-time employment subject to social
security contributions
Part-time work is especially prevalent among
employees subject to social security contribu-tions.
1Of the total of just under 27 million
persons working in this category, ie aroundtwo-thirds of all employed persons, some-what over 16%, or 4
1/C254million, were working
limited working hours in 2004. One decadebefore, the rate had been little more thanone-tenth. The increase in the number of per-sons working part-time by more than 1 mil-lion, or 37%, between 1993 and 2004 is allthe more striking in the light of the fact thatthere was a simultaneous decline in the num-ber of full-time employed of 3
1/C254million, ie
almost 13%.2
Part-time employment has traditionally beena female domain. Even though the number ofmen working limited hours has more thandoubled in the past decade and was signifi-cantly over
1/C252million at the end of the period
under review, at just over 31/C252million, women
still accounted for a share of around 85%. At
1Self-employed persons are also increasingly working
part-time, however. According to the figures of the 2004
microcensus, the part-time ratio among self-employed
persons is 14%.

15the end of the period under review, not quite
one-third of the nearly 12 million women injobs subject to social security contributionswere working part-time, compared with lessthan one-quarter in 1993. The persistently in-creasing participation of women in the labourforce has thus led in many cases to part-timeemployment, while the number of womenworking full-time – as in the case of men –has fallen.
There has been a comparatively sharp expan-
sion of part-time work in eastern Germanywith a nearly 60% increase over the past11 years. More than
1/C252million women are
now working in part-time jobs. Nevertheless,at one-quarter, their share among all femaleemployees subject to social security contribu-tions was still appreciably lower than in west-ern Germany, where the rate in 2004 was justunder 33%. This may be partly connectedwith the fact that, traditionally, part-timework has been less popular in eastern Ger-many. In the 2004 microcensus, more thanhalf of all dependently employed womenstated that the only reason they were work-ing part-time was that they were unable tofind full-time employment. In western Ger-many, by contrast, part-time work is primarilya matter of preference. Only 6
1/C252% of women
would prefer to work longer hours. In linewith these differing preferences or con-straints, the number of hours worked perweek by women in part-time jobs in easternGermany was clearly higher than in westernGermany. Whereas around one-half of thewomen in western Germany stated that theyworked fewer than 20 hours, the relevant fig-ure in eastern Germany was mostly between
20 and 30 hours.
At the end of the period under review, a par-
ticularly large number of part-time jobs wasbeing offered in the health and social worksector as well as in the wholesale and retailtrade. These sectors employed 1

16ing in part-time jobs subject to social security
contributions. In many cases, the number ofoperating hours to be filled in the two citedsectors are probably too small for the deploy-ment of persons working on a full-time basis.Without the readiness to work reducedhours, many jobs would undoubtedly not becreated. With a total of roughly 800,000part-time jobs, the public sector and the edu-cation sector were also well represented. Fur-thermore, both the commercial service pro-viders and real estate activities (includingbusiness services) are heavily staffed withpart-time labour. Together, these sectors ac-count for around
1/C252million employees. In in-
dustry, the food and drink industry as well asconstruction play a prominent role, althoughthe 125,000 part-time jobs provided by thesesectors are notably fewer than those in the
services sector.
Low-paid part-time jobsAnother major form of part-time work is in
jobs classified as low-paid part-time work(Geringf/C252gige Besch/C228ftigungsverh/C228ltnisse ),
which differs from part-time work which issubject to social security contributions in thatthere is a monthly upper income limit of 3400
and that the employee is exempt from theobligation to pay taxes and social securitycontributions. The reduced contributions tohealth insurance (11%), pension insurance(12%) as well as the flat-rate wage tax (2%)are paid solely by the employer. The policy in-tention behind establishing job opportunitiesof this kind was to create jobs in the low-paysector, integrate the unemployed and to cutback on illicit working in the field of house-hold services.
Low-paid part-time work is evidently very
popular. According to the official figures,which have been available since 1999,around 4
3/C254million employed persons worked
exclusively in jobs of this kind in mid-2004.3
This was, in fact, even larger than the numberof part-time employees subject to social se-curity contributions. Since 1999, there hasbeen an increase in low-paid part-time jobs1991 = 100, log scale

17of just over 1 million, or more than 30%. Esti-
mates by the IAB show a figure of just under2
1/C252million persons in low-paid part-time
work for 1991. That means almost a doublingsince the early 1990s. There has thereforebeen a markedly higher-than-average in-crease.
Low-paid part-time jobs are likely to be seen
as especially appealing by employers as suchjobs allow a large degree of flexibility withregard to working hours along with a lowcost burden. Furthermore, the administrativeinput for registering and transferring the con-tributions and tax is comparatively limited.The jobs offered, however, are generally notvery demanding as the working hours areusually quite short. Assuming, say, an hourlywage of 310, fully exploiting the incomescope of 3400 a month would leave no more
than ten hours per week or so. This makes itpossible to cope with operational peak work-ing times or to fill in times that are notcovered by a normal job.

The restricted duration of working time is un-doubtedly one of the reasons why a consider-able part of low-paid part-time work is per-formed by persons in fairly old and fairlyyoung age groups. According to the data ofthe Federal Employment Agency, roughlyone-fifth were more than 60 years of age andaround one-fifth younger than 25.

18among the older age group as are school,
college and university students among theyounger persons. Whereas most persons inthese two groups have probably made a vol-untary decision to work in a low-paid part-time job, in the case of other persons workingon a 3400 basis it is much less possible to rule
out that they would prefer a regular job. Thefact that two-thirds of those working in low-paid part-time jobs are women does suggestthat bringing up children and other familycommitments often run counter to a heavierinvolvement in the labour market. Never-theless, a significant percentage of personsworking in “mini-jobs” might prefer an em-ployment subject to social security contribu-tions.
The sectors that have a particularly large
number of low-paid part-time employeeslargely correspond to those sectors wherepart-time work subject to social security con-tributions occurs frequently. The wholesaleand retail trade takes the lead; at around1 million, “normal” part-time employees are,in fact, exceeded by almost one-third. Fur-thermore, the increase in “mini-jobs” in thepast five years was nearly four times as great.Low-paid part-time work is also very import-ant in the case of commercial service pro-viders, with the cleaning of buildings and ve-hicles being a focal point. Such jobs are alsowidespread in hotels and restaurants and inthe health and social work sector. In the hoteland restaurant sector, low-paid part-time em-ployment far exceeded traditional part-timejobs. In industry, there is a high level of suchnon-standard working arrangements in themanufacture of food products as well as inpaper manufacture, publishing and printing.
The distribution of newspapers and maga-zines is likely to be an important factor in thisarea. There has also been a notable increasein the deployment of low-paid part-timework in the construction sector.
Part-time work versus full-time work?Even though the decline in full-time work and
the simultaneous sharp increase in part-timejobs would, at first sight, seem to point tostrong substitution processes, such a substitu-tion is unlikely to have been the primary aimof firms’ personnel policy. This is suggested,firstly, by the fact that the decline in the num-ber of payroll employees in the past decadehas very largely affected male workers, whilethe increase in part-time work has mainlybenefited women. Secondly, the reductions instaffing levels were concentrated, above all,on industry and construction. By contrast,there were employment gains especially inthe tertiary sector, namely in the wholesaleand retail trade and in hotel and restaurantservices. Both longer opening hours andmarked peaks in demand at certain times ofthe day often call for flexible but not-full timeworking. The situation is similar with regardto the cleaning of buildings and vehicles (es-pecially public transport). In these sectors ofthe economy, it cannot be ruled out thatpart-time work subject to social security con-tributions has been displaced owing to thefact that low-paid part-time jobs are easy toadministrate and offer a large degree of flexi-bility in working hours and pay. In the publicsector as well as in education, on account ofthe tight financial situation, the possibility of

increased use of part-time labour.
Limited-term employment and
subcontracted working
Limited-term employment contracts and sub-
contracted work (temporary hiring from anagency) are further forms of employmentbeyond the traditional pattern. According tothe data from the 2004 microcensus, around2
1/C252million persons in gainful employment, or
8% of dependently employed persons (ex-cluding trainees and those doing communityor military service) were employed exclusivelyon a limited or fixed-term basis. This meansthat the quantitative significance of tradition-al “normal” work contracts is even less thanis indicated by the percentage of full-timeemployees among the gainfully employed.The limited-term rate has increased by morethan 1 percentage point compared with1991. However, this slight overall growthconceals the fact that there is a clear increasein the case of younger employees. In 2004,at over 22%, twice as many dependentlyemployed persons aged between 15 and29 years were working on limited-term con-tracts than in 1991. This suggests that enter-prises are offering fewer and fewer unlimitedcontracts, especially to those starting out ontheir work career. Furthermore, a professionalqualification appears to increase the likeli-hood of obtaining an unlimited contract. At14%, the limited-term rate in the case of em-ployees who have not completed any voca-tional training is significantly higher than forthe dependently employed as a whole. Bycontrast, labour market policy assistance forlimited-term contracts for older workers has
met with little success.
According to Federal Employment Agency
figures, the number of subcontracted work-ers in June 2004 was about 400,000. Thepersonnel service agencies set up as part ofactive labour market policy play no more thana minor role in this context with around25,000 employees. With an overall shareamong employees subject to social securitycontributions of only 1.5%, the quantitativesignificance of subcontracted work is com-paratively slight. Even so, the temporary la-bour sector is growing extremely rapidly, withthe easing of some restrictive regulations un-doubtedly having played a part in this. In thepast ten years, the number of subcontractingfirms has doubled to around 15,000, andthere were three times as many subcontract-ed employees as in 1991. Furthermore, thereis evidently still no saturation of demand forsubcontracted workers. Even though therewas a decline in 2002 and 2003 associatedwith the slackening of economic activity, thesharp rise of more than 70,000 in the numberof casual employees last year points to a con-tinuing upward trend. The principle that sub-contracted workers should enjoy the samepay and working conditions as core staff,
5
which was enshrined with effect from 1 Jan-uary 2004 in the Act on Labour Leasing(Arbeitnehmer/C252berlassungsgesetz ), gave rise
to fears of a resulting decline in temporarywork. So far, this does not appear to be case.

20This is likely to be connected to the fact that
wage differentials are less of a major consid-eration in deploying temporary labour thanthe associated increase in operational flexibil-ity. For example, order peaks or a temporaryloss of working hours as a result of businessdisruptions or illness can be offset more easilyby means of subcontracted work. The tem-porary labour sector is, however, not onlyvery flexible with regard to firms leasing la-bour from it but also in terms of its own com-plement of staff, as is shown by its very highstaff turnover. Only 40% of the concludedwork contracts ran for longer than threemonths, with 14%, in fact, being for only upto one week.
One reason for this quite short period of em-
ployment is that roughly one-third of subcon-tracted workers succeed in making a seam-less transition into jobs outside the firm hiringout labour.
6Accordingly, the temporary work
agencies have, to a certain extent, assumed ajob placement capacity. They recruit on alarge scale from among the unemployed andnon-employed. Nearly 70% of the workerswere not previously employed, of which 8%had never been employed and 11% not inthe preceding 12 months. Low-skilled per-sons, whose position in the economy is be-coming increasingly difficult as a whole, havegained additional shares of employment inthe temporary labour sector.
Self-employmentThe changing profile of gainful employment
is also apparent in the growing importance ofself-employment. Including family memberswho assist in family-run businesses, who are
usually counted towards this category, theirnumber rose between 1991 and 2004, asmentioned above, by one-fifth to 4
1/C254million
at the end of the period under review. Thiswas due mainly to a sharp increase in self-employed single-person-operated businesses.According to the data from the microcensus,since 2000 there have been more businessproprietors working alone than self-employedpersons with dependent employees. This isalso likely to be connected with governmentassistance for unemployed persons to startup their own businesses, which has becomevery much more prevalent in the past fewyears. According to the calculations of the In-stitute for SME Research (IfM), Bonn, thetotal number of business start-ups reached anew peak in 2004, at around 570,000. Theamendment of the regulations governing thecraft trades, which entered into force at thestart of 2004, has also played a considerablepart in this, leading to a start-up boom incraft trades that no longer require authorisa-tion.
Such assisted start-ups now account for near-
ly two-thirds of self-employed businesses.The number of firms established with the aidof bridging payments ( /C220berbr/C252ckungsgeld )
in Germany increased from 5,600 cases in1986, the year in which they were intro-duced, to around 185,000 in 2004. Since theintroduction of business start-up grants ( Exis-
tenzgr/C252ndungszuschuss ), which are also fi-
nanced by the labour exchanges, start-ups bypersons who were formally unemployed have

21gained additional momentum. As early as in
the first year of 2003, almost 93,000 one-person businesses were promoted through-out Germany. Taking bridging payments andbusiness start-up grants together, 355,000persons establishing a new business madeuse of the labour market policy programmeslast year. Nevertheless, it is not possible atpresent to assess whether the instrumentof the subsidised one-person business willensure sustained self-employment.
7The ac-
companying research on bridging paymentsshowed that, three years after starting up abusiness, more than 70% of those given as-sistance were still self-employed. This roughlycorresponds to the survival rate of non-assisted business start-ups and shows thattemporary unemployment does not necessar-ily pose an obstacle to operating a successfulbusiness.
8
The largest growth in self-employment in thepast five years, at around one-fifth, was inthe case of commercial service providers.Along with the wholesale and retail trade,around 1
1/C254million were employed in this sec-
tor, which corresponds to nearly one-third ofthe total number. Hotel and restaurant ser-vices as well as the health and social worksector are heavily represented with almost400,000 self-employed persons in each case.The services sector as a whole now accountsfor nearly three-quarters of all self-employedpersons and persons assisting in family-runbusinesses. In industry, the construction sec-tor plays a prominent role with around450,000 persons at the end of the periodunder review. The importance of self-employment in the construction sector hasundoubtedly also increased markedly under
the pressure of circumstances.
Reasons for the transformation
of employment
In explaining the structural shifts described
above, reference is often made to sectoralchange. It is true that the shift of importancein the forms of employment is being especial-ly intensified by the advance of the servicessector. But the percentage of full-time em-ployees is clearly declining in the productionsector, too, including, in particular, construc-tion. A further factor behind the changes isundoubtedly (west German) women’s in-creasing participation in the labour force. Thismay have caused a rise in demand for part-time jobs, although it does not explain thedecline in full-time employment.
The underlying institutional conditions on the
labour market are of crucial importance. Highand increasing taxes and social security con-tributions have wedged themselves betweenlabour costs and net incomes. In terms of thedemand for labour, the increase in the cost ofthe factor labour leads not only to labourbeing substituted by capital but also to de-mand for labour moving to the alternative
7Initial studies show that, two years after its introduc-
tion, one-sixth of the persons assisted had ceased to be
self-employed. Of those who had already ceased to be
self-employed after one year, more than half were un-

22forms of employment which involve only low
or no contributions to the social security sys-tems. This is often the only way to preventfurther jobs from migrating to other coun-tries. Likewise, in terms of the supply of la-bour, employment subject to social securitycontributions is becoming less attractive thanalternative forms of employment such as self-employment and low-paid part-time work.
Furthermore, the regulation of the labour
market and/or the regulatory burden have aconsiderable influence on the demand forlabour. The more highly regulated “normal”work contracts are, the more likely is theresponse of moving to less protected alterna-tive forms of employment. According to aninternational comparative study undertakenby the OECD, German employment protec-tion regulations are to be rated as restrictive.
The established indicator shows Germanyoccupying 19th place among 28 countries.With regard to compulsory redundancies anddismissals for individual reasons, only six andfive countries respectively had poorer marksthan Germany.
9
It is true that a number of regulations havebeen relaxed over the past few years. How-ever, this did not affect “normal” jobs somuch as, first and foremost, “atypical” workcontracts, where, according to the OECD,there has been more-than-average deregula-tion in the past decade. This has created add-itional options and incentives for enterprisesto use alternative forms of employment. Thefact that many employees see these as ap-pealing, too, is revealed by the Act on part-time work adopted in 2001, which enshrinesthe fundamental legal right to part-timework. According to the Institute for Employ-ment Research, between 2001 and 2003,working hours were reduced on request for atotal of around 250,000 full-time employ-ees.
10
Growing requirements of flexibility are amajor cause of the transformation in paidemployment. Increasing regional as well asinternational integration and division of la-bour inside and between enterprises alongwith greater customer-orientation make itnecessary to adjust the deployment of labour– not least on considerations of cost – towhat is often a fluctuating orders situation.1991 = 100, log scale

24Employees’ working hours are being de-
ployed with greater variability and greater useis being made of flexible forms of employ-ment. Longer-term staff retention, which in-volves ties that are often difficult to adaptowing to statutory regulations or negotiatedworking arrangements, is becoming lesscompetitive.
Implications of the new employment
structures
Given the outlined trends, it is becoming less
and less possible to measure the amount ofwork performed on the basis of the numberof employed persons. The key determinant,owing to the changes in the forms of employ-ment, is the total number of hours worked.According to the calculations of the Institutefor Employment, the annual total number ofhours worked has gone down by roughly6%, or 3
1/C252billion, from just under 60 billion
in the early 1990s. Given that the number ofpersons in work has remained largely con-stant, this implies a corresponding decline inthe average number of hours worked. Thecrucial factor here is not so much the trendtowards generally shorter working hours butrather the increase in part-time employment.Between 1991 and 2004, hours worked on apart-time basis increased from 3
1/C252billion to
61/C252billion hours and their share of total
working hours doubled to around 12%, com-pared with 28% when measured by the num-ber of persons. By contrast, the number ofhours worked by full-time employees fell byone-sixth.The changes in the employment structures
are being reflected more and more in thetraditional productivity ratios as well. While,in the period under review, productivitygrowth per employee, at an average annualrate of just under 1
1/C252%, roughly corresponded
to the trend rate of real GDP , productivitygrowth on an hourly basis – owing to the fall-ing total number of hours worked – wasnoticeably higher at an average annual rateof about 2%.
The transformation in paid employment also
has obvious implications for the importanceof labour income for securing a livelihood. Inthe 1991 microcensus, no fewer than 95% ofemployed persons stated that their own la-bour income was the main source for secur-ing their livelihood, whereas only 91% did soin 2004. Although some persons earning onlya small amount are supported by the familyincome, supplementary social transfers tocover living costs are likely to become increas-ingly important, not least given the growingnumber of one-person households.
The advancing transformation of paid em-
ployment is leading to serious problems in thefinancing of the social security funds. Insofaras the social security contributions have nodirect relation to the claim for benefits andare therefore perceived as taxes, decouplingthem from the level of employee compensa-tion is called for. Additionally, traditional workcontracts need to be framed in such a waythat engaging new staff is made easier ratherthan more difficult. Furthermore, greater con-Total number of

The German labour market is currently in atransitional phase. A lot has now changed. Atthe microeconomic level, this is undoubtedlyoften associated with hardships and frictions.More and more often, however, adhering tothe status quo is proving to hold out no pro-spects; long-term unemployment remains byfar the most important reason for incomepoverty in Germany. In macroeconomic
terms, it is important not to impede structuralchange on the labour market and to accom-pany processes of adjustment with systems oftax and social security, transfers and pay ratesthat are compatible with incentives and theavailability of resources.

and interest rate
differentials:
recent developments
since the introduction
of the euroThe euro’s exchange rate has fluctu-
ated considerably since the beginningof monetary union. Against the US dol-lar, in particular, the euro recoveredstrongly after losing ground in 1999and 2000. At the end of 2004 it peakedat US$1.36. Since then, however, it hasonce again lost some of its value; itslevel is currently somewhat higherthan when monetary union waslaunched in 1999. The ups and downsof the exchange rate have coincidedwith varying interest rate differentialsbetween investments in euro and inUS dollars. These are considered in an-alyses as often being key determinantsof exchange rate movements.
This article studies the theoretical and
empirical connections between ex-change rates and interest rate differen-tials. It discusses both covered interestparity and uncovered interest parity aswell as various hypotheses which claimto explain deviations from uncoveredinterest parity. It is based on the periodsince the introduction of the euro. Thisarticle also explains the importance ofcurrency carry trades for exchange ratedynamics.

in terms of exports, amounted to “only”around US$9 trillion for all of 2004, accordingto IMF information. These figures, despite notbeing directly comparable, illustrate the vastscale that international financial transactionshave taken on in recent times. The exploit-ation of international interest rate differen-tials is often cited as a motive for such cross-border activity.
Movements in money market rates are largely
a reflection of the impact of monetary policymeasures. Accordingly, US money marketfunds had a yield spread of up to 3 per-centage points over the euro area in thefirst two years of monetary union. The eco-nomic upturn at the end of the 1990s had re-sulted in US monetary policy being relativelyrestrictive. The slowdown in US economic
growth during 2001, however, led the Fed-eral Reserve to rapidly ease its monetary pol-icy, whereas key interest rates in the euroarea, starting at a lower level, were cut onlylater and – given the persistent inflationaryrisks – to a lesser extent. The interest rate dif-ferential consequently shifted to the euroarea’s advantage. The renewed tightening ofmonetary policy in the United States causedits interest rate to rise continuously in thepast year, overtaking the euro-area interestrate in late 2004. Long-term interest ratestend to follow a similar, if more stable, pat-tern to short-term rates. This is also a reflec-tion of long-term growth and inflation ex-pectations.
Covered interest parity and exchange
rates to the euro
A foreign interest rate advantage, such as is
currently enjoyed by investments in the USAover the euro area at both the short and longend, can act as a stimulus to invest abroad.However, the yield spread between a foreigncurrency investment and a domestic invest-ment is determined not just by internationalinterest rate differentials but also by fluctu-ations in the exchange rate. An appreciatingUS dollar would amplify the return on an in-vestment in the US financial market for in-vestors in the euro area, while a depreciatingdollar would reduce the gain or even turn it

29Covered and uncovered interest rate parity
With the free international movement of cap-
ital, a domestic investor has the option of invest-ing in the euro area or elsewhere, for examplein the USA. If he chooses the USA, he must firstchange the investment amount Ginto US dollars
at the current spot exchange rate w
0– defined
as the price of one euro in units of US dollars.Let us assume that the resulting US dollaramount is then invested at an interest rate i
/C3in
twelve-month funds on the US money market.1
After one year, the amount invested will havegrown to G/C1w
0/C1ð1þi/C3ÞUS dollars and will
then be reconverted to euro at the prevailingspot rate w
1. Differences between the future
and current euro-dollar exchange rate affectthe final value in the domestic currency(G/C1ð1þi
/C3Þ/C1w0=w 1). Were the euro to weaken
against the dollar, this would amplify the returnin euro on a US investment; conversely, the re-turn would be reduced, or even outweighed, bya stronger euro.
Forward exchange markets allow investors to
eliminate the exchange rate risk of an invest-ment in a foreign currency through an appro-priate hedge. This means that an investor isable to exchange the final US dollar valueG/C1w
0/C1ð1þi/C3Þof his investment due on
a future date at today’s forward exchangerate f
0;1. It is then guaranteed to be worth
G/C1ð1þi/C3Þ/C1w0=f0;1in the domestic currency
after one year.
Alternatively, the investor could have invested
on the domestic money market at an interestrate iand generated an equally secure
2final
value of G/C1ð1þiÞ. Since the final value is
known in advance under both investment strat-egies, differing returns offer potential arbitrageopportunities. The investment offering thegreater return – be it domestic or international –would generally be favoured. This would resultin exchange and interest rate adjustments whichwould tend to equalise the returns (disregardingtransaction costs). Covered interest rate paritytherefore applies

The correlation can also be expressed in the fol-
lowing form

Thus, the swap rate (the relative difference be-
tween the forward rate and the current spotrate) broadly corresponds to the interest ratedifferential.
If the investor decides not to hedge the ex-
change rate risk through a forward transaction,a decision on which investment to choose willdepend on how he expects exchange rates tomove. The secure final value of G/C1ð1þiÞfor a
domestic investment contrasts with an expectedfinal value of G/C1ð1þi

Uncovered interest parity implies that an expect-
ed euro depreciation is virtually matched by acorrespondingly higher rate of interest on an in-vestment in the euro area compared to an in-vestment in the USA. While deviations from un-covered interest parity offer profit-making op-portunities, they are not risk-free – in contrast tocovered interest rate parity.

30into a loss. It is true that the domestic investor
can hedge against this exchange rate risk by,for instance, converting the future paymentamount disbursed on his US dollar-denominated investment into euro in ad-vance. The theorem of covered interest paritystates, however, that the ratio between theforward and spot rates of the euro-US dollarexchange rate must equal that between theinterest factors of investments in the two cur-rencies (see box on page 29). The respectivereturns on a domestic investment and a for-eign investment hedged by a forward trans-action are accordingly equal because other-wise they would be vulnerable to arbitrage –ie exploiting the interest rate differentials fora risk-free profit.Some support for covered interest parity is
provided by comparing, for each trading day,the relationship between forward and spoteuro-US dollar exchange rates to the interestrate factors for three-month money marketfunds between the USA and the euro area.Since the differences between the interestfactors on either side of the Atlantic have notbeen all that great since the beginning ofmonetary union, the observed ratios are closeto unity. The two-time change in signs in theinterest rate differential during the reportingperiod is due to the fact that some values arehigher than unity, while others are lower. If apoint in the chart is on the 45/C30 line, coveredinterest parity between the euro and the USdollar is said to hold at this time. Deviationsfrom covered interest parity have, in fact, re-mained small. The picture is quite similar forother currency pairs.
The connection can be tested econometrically
by regressing the exchange rate ratio on theratio of interest factors. For the euro’s ex-change rate against the US dollar and thepound sterling, the validity of covered interestparity – at least for estimations without a con-stant – cannot be rejected (see table onpage 31 and box on page 29). For other cur-rency pairs involving the euro, too, the esti-mated coefficients are numerically very closeto their hypothetical value of unity, as is im-plied by covered interest parity. However, inthese cases the hypothesis of covered interestparity is rejected at the standard levels of sig-nificance owing to extremely small standarddeviations.

32Deutsche BundesbankEmpirical validation of interest parity theories
Covered interest rate parity states that the relation
between the foreign and domestic interest factor (dis-regarding transaction costs) corresponds to that be-tween the forward and spot exchange rate (see boxon page 29). This theory can be tested by regressingthe exchange rate ratio ( f
t;tþk=wt) on the relationship
between the interest factors ( ð1þi/C3
tÞ=ð1þitÞ) and a
constant ( /C11):

where utdenotes the error term. The index kdenotes
the investment period for the interest-earning instru-ments. Confirmation of the joint hypothesis that theestimated value for the constant ( /C11) is 0 and that the
regression coefficient for the interest factor ( /C12)i s1
would therefore be an indication that covered inter-est parity holds.
This null hypothesis can be checked using the Wald
test for coefficient constraints. When applying such atest to different exchange rates against the euro, thehypothesis is always rejected for the usual error prob-abilities of 1% and 5%, although the estimated coeffi-cients are extremely close numerically to their hypo-thetical values of 0 and 1. The small standard devi-ations are the main reason for this. As both the ex-change rate ratio and interest factor are always closeto 1 for the currency pairs being studied, a weaknessin the regression might lie in the way influence is as-signed between the constant and the interest factor.If (disregarding the constant term) the exchange rateratio is only regressed on the interest factor, the esti-mated coefficients indeed differ from unity only afterthree decimal places, as shown in the upper half ofthe table on page 31. Nevertheless, the null hypoth-esis of a regression coefficient of 1 is generally reject-ed because of standard deviations that, here too, arevery small; the hypothesis cannot be rejected in thecase of the US dollar and the pound sterling. The testresults are much the same if dollar exchange rates are
used.
Much of the literature argues that regression analyses
are unable to confirm covered interest parity becauseof the existence of transaction costs.
1,2However, re-
gressions can only be used to test whether interestparity holds on average. Yet arbitrage, on whichcovered interest parity is based, hinges on conditionsat a given point in time. The quality of the data usedin the empirical application is also a key factor. Inter-est rates have to be selected for investments which– apart from the currency in which they are denomin-ated – are comparable in every respect, particularlymaturity, the default risk and the regulatory regime.That is why interest rates on investments on the eurocurrency market are usually used. Care should also betaken to ensure that interest rates and exchange ratesare determined simultaneously, because even smalldifferences in the timing render it impossible to testfor arbitrage opportunities and hence might causethe hypothesis of covered interest parity to be reject-ed.

In addition, overlaps in the time horizons for the for-ward rates and interest rates with the data frequencyprovide a source for autocorrelating the error terms.As part of the regressions undertaken here, themoney market interest rates and forward interestrates were observed for a three-month time horizonbased on monthly data (month-end data). This givesthree monthly observations within the three-monthperiod. Therefore, the Newey and West variance/co-variance estimator is used, taking into account theautocorrelation of the residuals up to the third lag.
Finally, regressions using the least squares method are
only appropriate if the time series used are stationary.However, the standard tests to check for the existenceof a unit root or stationarity suffer from low statistical

33power in the case of near-unit roots. Because of the
combination of low variance and long memory in thedata, the null hypothesis is rarely rejected. Based onthese data, neither the Dickey-Fuller test nor thePhillips-Perron test are able to reject the null hypoth-esis of a unit root as regards the correlation betweenthe forward and spot rate or the interest factor. Con-versely, the null hypothesis of stationarity is not usual-ly rejected by the KPSS test either. Given the divergingtest results, the regressions described assume statio-narity.
Uncovered interest parity requires the expected ex-
change rate change to approximately match the inter-est rate differential. Assuming rational expectations,then for it to be valid a regression in the form
lnwtþk/C0lnwt¼/C11þ/C12ði/C3
t/C0itÞþ utþk
should produce values for /C11and /C12that do not deviate
significantly from 0 or 1.4The difference between the
logarithmic spot rates is used to approximate the per-centage change in the exchange rate.
5The estimated
coefficients for some euro exchange rates are shownin the middle of the table on page 31. The estimatedvalues for /C12are generally negative and are often well
below -1. Even so, at a significance level of 1% thenull hypothesis that uncovered interest parity holds isonly rejected in a Wald test in the case of the US dol-lar; at a significance level of 5%, it is also rejected forthe relationship between the euro and the Canadiandollar and the Swiss franc. The fact that a similar nullhypothesis cannot be rejected for the other currencypairs is attributable, however, to the comparativelyhigh standard deviations which, in turn, permit a verywide range of possible coefficient values, thereby sub-stantially reducing the statistical power of the test.This is demonstrated particularly clearly when the twointerest parity theories are compared. Ignoring statis-tical significance, it turns out that the deviations fromcovered interest parity in comparison to those from
uncovered interest parity are negligible in absoluteterms (see also the chart on page 36).
The conclusions do not alter substantially if, assuming
that covered interest parity holds, the change in theexchange rate is regressed on the swap rate. Usinglogarithms, the regression equation is
lnwtþk/C0lnwt¼/C11þ/C12ðlnft;tþk/C0lnwtÞþutþk.
As the interest rate differential has been replaced by
the swap rate, such that the constraint on the congru-ence between interest rates and exchange rates is re-placed by the requirement for congruent spot andforward rates, this approach allows us to analyse abroader range of currency pairs. The additional cur-rency pairs – which mainly encompass exchange ratesbetween the euro and currencies from certain emer-ging markets – confirm the impression that the regres-sion coefficient is generally negative, as shown in thebottom half of the table on page 31. This is consistentwith the academic literature, which holds that thesetypes of regressions do indeed often produce esti-mated coefficients closer to -1 than to +1.
6In the case
of a negative coefficient, which is clearly of particularempirical relevance, the currency with the higherinterest rate appreciates. Therefore, an investmentdenominated in this currency will on average, in add-ition to the higher interest, also gain from the ex-change rate change. The estimated coefficients, whichoften exceed 1 in absolute value, in fact indicate thatthis exchange rate gain was frequently appreciablylarger than the interest gain during the test periodsince the start of EMU. However, this average viewmasks phases during which an investment denomin-ated in a currency with a higher interest rate ultimate-ly resulted in a loss because of a countervailing move-ment in the exchange rate.

gel paradox which fundamentally states that – depending on the def-inition of the exchange rate – the appreciation rate of one currencydoes not match the depreciation rate of the other. Unit root and sta-
tionarity tests regularly show that the difference between the loga-rithms is stationary. — 6See K A Froot and R H Thaler (1990), “Anom-

34It should be noted when interpreting these
results that such a regression-based test canat most check whether covered interest parityholds on average. However, the underlyingtheory postulates that international interestarbitraging cannot be profitable at any pointin time. Moreover, the real question is notwhether observed deviations from coveredinterest parity are statistically significant butinstead whether they represent the opportun-ity of a risk-free profit. Yet covered interestarbitrage is profitable only if its guaranteedreturn exceeds the attendant transactioncosts. Accordingly, observed deviations fromcovered interest parity which are smaller thanthe transaction costs associated with arbi-trage trading cannot refute this hypothesis.Transaction costs are determined, in particu-lar, by the bid-offer spread. Since this articleuses interest rates and exchange rates takenas the mean from bid-offer spreads, no allow-ance has been made for transaction costs.
2
Moreover, the use of such middle rates mayalso entail approximations that distort the re-sults. Finally, the data used here are not ne-cessarily prices at which trades were actuallytransacted. The observed deviations frominterest parity – after taking transaction costsinto account – are more likely to indicate im-perfect data than market inefficiencies.
3On
the whole, therefore, covered interest parityshould be assumed to hold.

However, an investor may still seek to make a
profit from international interest rate differ-entials by, for instance, choosing not to
hedge a transaction on the forward market.In this case, the investor’s profit (or loss)hinges decisively on future changes in thespot exchange rate. A domestic investor willearn more on a US investment than on acomparable euro-area investment as long asa US interest rate advantage is not neutralisedby a depreciation of the US dollar against theeuro.
4If he bases his investment decisions on
this approach, he will, under these circum-stances, weight his portfolio more heavily infavour of US debt instruments. If a majorityof investors follows this line of thinking, theresult will be a significant capital export tothe United States. This will tend to have twoconsequences: falling interest rates in theUnited States, reflecting a rise in the price ofthe relevant debt instruments, as well as anappreciation of the US dollar, which, as longas the fundamentals remain unchanged, willengender expectations that the US dollar willdepreciate. Both developments will reducethe attractiveness of US bonds and cause it toconverge with the popularity of comparableeuro-area investments. Uncovered interestparity therefore claims that, in the mediumterm, a state of equilibrium will be reached,in which the expected returns on an un-hedged investment in foreign currency (butcalculated in domestic currency) shouldmatch those of a comparable investment in

Thus, an interest rate advantage of US finan-cial investments over investments in the Euro-pean market would have to be associatedwith an expected appreciation of the euroagainst the US dollar. Assuming rational ex-pectations among market participants andforeign exchange market efficiency, more-over, the expected exchange rate movementscorrespond, on average, to subsequent actualmovements; deviations are likely to be ran-dom.
However, the euro-US dollar exchange rate
has, if anything, tended to run counter to theinterest rate differential: thus an interest rateadvantage of US investments over euro-areainvestments was often followed by an appre-ciation of the US dollar. The exchange ratemovement was, moreover, far larger than theinterest spread on average. The contrast tocovered interest parity could therefore hardlybe more striking (see chart on page 36)
The impression gained from a simple com-
parison of time series can only partly be con-firmed through a systematic analysis, how-ever. If, for instance, the exchange ratechange is regressed on the interest rate differ-ential and a constant, the hypothesis ofuncovered interest parity can often not berejected owing to the high variance of thevalues at the usual levels of significance, eventhough the estimated regression coefficientsvary strongly from the theoretical values.What remains, however, is the empirical find-ing that, on average, the higher-interest cur-rency will tend to appreciate. Similar resultsare reached by – assuming that covered inter-est parity holds – testing alternatively for
uncovered interest parity by regressing theexchange rate change on the swap rate, ieon the relative deviation of the forward ex-change rate from the spot exchange rate,and on a constant. It becomes apparent thatthe swap rate, due to the negative correlationwith the interest rate differential, is not cap-able of correctly anticipating the direction ofthe exchange rate change.

Potential causes of deviationfrom uncovered interest parity
The academic literature lists time-varying risk
premia and forecasting errors concerning ra-tional expectations and heterogeneous ex-pectations as causes of the low empirical sup-port for the uncovered interest parity the-orem. These causes are considered below.If risk awareness is factored into economic
agents’ investment decisions, the compos-ition of the portfolio will be shaped not onlyby expected returns but also by the risk struc-ture of international investments. For foreigninvestments, not only default risk but also,and in particular, exchange rate risks are im-portant. They are the factors prompting risk-averse investors to demand a risk premium.Therefore, realistically, a risk premium has tobe added to uncovered interest parity, whichmeans that, on average, a given interest rateadvantage of foreign investments (and, ifcovered interest parity holds, the swap rate,too) exceeds the expected rate of appreci-ation of the domestic currency by the amountof the risk premium. The empirical findingson uncovered interest parity could then beexplained by a quantitatively significant, time-varying risk premium.
However, to avoid the tautology of interpret-
ing all deviations from uncovered interest par-ity as risk premia, an empirical test of the riskpremium approach must be able to distin-guish between the existence of a risk pre-mium and the alternative explanatory ap-proaches explained below, which focus onforecast errors of market participants.

37authors have therefore begun to approximate
expected exchange rate changes by usingsurvey data in order to isolate the influence ofrisk premia on the swap rate.
7The resulting
estimation results indicate that, although for-ward exchange rates contain risk premia,these premia do not completely explain thefluctuations in the swap rate.
8If, in the light
of this empirical finding, the risk premium ap-proach cannot be regarded as the sole deter-minant of the mixed results concerning un-covered interest parity, further explanatoryapproaches have to focus on systematic fore-casting errors.
A common explanation for the lack of empir-
ical support for uncovered interest parity,which nonetheless permits the assumption ofrational expectations to be retained, is the hy-pothesis of “rational speculative bubbles”.They are defined as exponentially increasingdeviations of the spot exchange rate from itsfundamental level, which is determined bymacroeconomic variables. Once a bubble hasformed, for example, in the foreign exchangemarket, the currency initially continues to ap-preciate because market participants, at leastfor some time, expect a continuing increasein exchange rates and thus also in profit op-portunities. For that reason, market partici-pants carry on investing in the currency des-pite being aware that this is not consistentwith the fundamentals. According to this the-ory, bubbles burst in the end, with the spotexchange rate collapsing to its fundamentallevel. The general discussion of the bubblephenomenon spilled over to the foreign ex-change market following the considerable– albeit temporary – appreciation of the USdollar in the first half of the 1980s. As early
as 1982, most economists had come toregard the US dollar as being substantiallyovervalued in terms of its fundamental value.Yet market participants apparently persistedin believing in an – at least temporary – con-tinuation of the upward trend, and so theyignored this publicly available assessment andkept investing in dollar-denominated instru-ments. The fact that expecting further appre-ciation up to the beginning of 1985 provedto be rational is regarded as evidence of arational speculative bubble.
Because speculative bubbles are not easily
distinguishable from other phenomena, thereis a danger that speculative bubbles may beseen as the cause of all exchange rate move-ments that cannot be explained by stand-ard fundamental variables. An evaluation ofeconometric studies shows that no empiricaltest so far has been able to conclusively provethe existence of rational speculative bubbles.
9
A further approach to explaining forecastingerrors which ex post appear systematic, such
as may occur in the empirical findings on un-covered interest parity, was introduced to theliterature as the “peso problem”. This termwas coined in the mid-1970s when the Mex-ican peso, despite its peg to the US dollar and

38an economic policy that looked sustainable,
was consistently traded at a discount on theforward exchange market. The explanationgiven for this phenomenon is that marketparticipants did not completely rule out areturn to an expansionary monetary and fiscalpolicy, ie an economic policy that could onlybe associated with a depreciation of the Mex-ican peso. Since then, the term “peso prob-lem” has been used to describe situations inwhich market participants see the possibilityof a discretionary change in one or more fun-damentals in the future. The influence ofsuch potential regime shifts usually makes it-self felt in the average expected future ex-change rate, which, as long as the regimeshift does not occur, seems to be decoupledfrom the actual exchange rate for the abovereason, in some cases over long stretches oftime. The greater the expected regime shift,and the greater the likelihood of it occurring,the larger the forecasting error will be. Oncethe regime shift actually occurs, the pesoeffect disappears again, provided no newshocks to the fundamentals are expected.
When a peso problem exists, systematic fore-
casting errors are, accordingly, not an expres-sion of irrational expectations but instead re-flect the rational way of taking into accountpossible future events. A comparison withspeculative bubbles shows that both explana-tory approaches are based on a distinctionbetween several potential future exchangerate paths. However, the peso effect is affect-ed by the dynamics of fundamentals whereasspeculative bubbles are maintained by self-fulfilling expectations. The empirical workundertaken to date, however, fails to indicatethat the peso effect can make a decisive con-
tribution to explaining the observed deviationfrom uncovered interest parity. Such devi-ations are generally too large to support thetheory of the peso effect being a predomin-ant phenomenon.
10
In contrast to the peso problem, the “learn-ing” approach
11in exchange rate theory hy-
pothesises that agents cannot exactly gaugethe extent of change from the fundamentalsor that they are not sure whether a suspectedchange has actually taken place. Announcedchanges in economic policy may serve as anexample of such “shocks”. In a state of un-certainty about the time path of fundamen-tals, market participants only “learn” the trueextent of the changes by carefully interpret-ing the current observations. Thus, in their ex-pectations concerning the future exchangerate, they take into account both the possibil-ity – to stay within the example – that the re-gime change has taken place and the possi-bility that this change has not (yet) takenplace. The expected exchange rate will theninclude both (weighted) economic policy al-ternatives. However, in the next period, newinformation about the current state of thefundamentals will be available, which meansthat the actual exchange rate will be muchcloser to the level now considered more likelythan the initially expected exchange rate was.

39This means that the actual exchange rate
may deviate from the expected rate duringthe time in which learning is taking place. Inthis case, systematic forecasting errors arenot due to irrational behaviour but are asymptom of imperfect information which, de-pending on the type, could impact on ex-change rate movements with varying degreesof permanence.
In some respects, the similarities between the
peso effect and the impact of learning on ex-change rate movements are strong. In the lat-ter case, the deviation of the actual exchangerate from the expected exchange rate is elim-inated gradually, and not abruptly as in thecase of the peso effect. However, it seems dif-ficult to distinguish between these two alter-natives using traditional econometric tech-niques. In addition, there are some concep-tual problems. For instance, events that cantrigger learning processes cannot be directlyread off the data. Moreover, it stands to rea-son that, owing to the numerous fundamen-tal variables which affect the exchange rate,several learning processes will be in progressat the same time. Testing the empirical rele-vance of learning approaches is thereforeconfined to cases of significant monetary andreal disruptions.
Whereas the approaches described in the
foregoing maintain the assumption of ration-al expectations at least in the long run, amore recent branch of exchange rate theoryseeks to explain deviations from uncoveredinterest parity by the heterogeneity of ex-change rate expectations. Prompted by weakempirical support for structural exchange ratemodels, this school of thought holds that
market participants, in real life, cannot be as-sumed to have complete knowledge of thetrue relationship between exchange rates andits fundamentals. Current foreign exchangemarket developments may therefore be inter-preted in a variety of ways by market partici-pants. The hypothesis of heterogeneous ex-pectations has been tested repeatedly usingsurvey data, with the robust finding that mar-ket expectations are based on different fore-cast techniques.
12Whereas many market
participants forecast short-run exchange ratemovements by extrapolating past trends,thereby departing from the theoretical idealof rational expectations, long-run exchangerate movements are forecast almost exclu-sively on the basis of fundamental variables.There appears to be a consensus among mar-ket participants that the exchange rate canbe determined by non-fundamentals in theshort run but that, in the long run, it returnsto its fundamental level. This “term structureof exchange rate expectations” causes themarket expectations aggregated from surveydata, on average, to understate the currentexchange rate trend.
13Where survey data are
actually capable of consistently reflectingagents’ exchange rate expectations, it is pos-sible to make a direct inference concerningthe observed deviations from uncoveredinterest parity. In this theoretical approach– similar to the learning model describedabove – such deviations result because agents

ing the aggregate expected future exchangerate to comprise the weighted sum of theshort-run and long-run forecast value.
Testing the hypothesis of heterogeneous ex-
pectations is difficult because short-run ex-change rate expectations, long-run exchangerate expectations and the weights of bothsets of expectations all have to be specified.This gives these empirical tests an arbitrarycomponent which makes it more difficult tointerpret the findings. Initial work that hasbeen done up to now in this new branch ofempirical research has shown, however, thatthe hypothesis of heterogeneous expect-ations can often not be rejected.

One interim result of the foregoing discussionof exchange rates and interest rate differen-tials is that arbitrage trading on integratedinternational capital markets will generallyensure that covered interest parity holds. Bycontrast, the postulation of uncovered inter-est parity as a condition of equilibrium ininternational capital transactions is mostlycalled into question despite the fact that itoften cannot be rejected using the standardeconometric tests. In practice, this may createsignificant profit-making opportunities onforeign exchange markets. One strategy usedby international investors to make a profitfrom persistent deviations from uncoveredinterest parity is the currency carry trade.Currency carry trade strategies
A currency carry trade involves borrowing
funds in a low-interest currency and investingthem in a high-interest currency. Such tradesare not hedged (on the forward exchangemarket, for instance) because – according tocovered interest parity – this would precludeany chance of a profit whatsoever.
15This
means that the carry trade is speculative,with the profit depending crucially on actualexchange rate movements over the invest-ment period. If the exchange rate does notchange, the yield on the carry trade is equalto the interest rate differential. If uncoveredinterest parity holds, the interest incomewould be offset by a loss caused by the de-preciation of the higher-interest currency, inwhich case a carry trade strategy would notmake any sense. If, however, the higher-interest currency appreciates, the total profitfrom the carry trade will supplement theinterest rate advantage by the margin of thefavourable exchange rate change.
The chart on page 41 shows the annualised
returns of a carry trade investment strategy inthree-month money market funds which aeuro-area investor would have achieved if hisinvestments had been oriented solely to theinterest rate differential between the euroarea and the United States known at the timeof the investment.

Consequently, the carry trade strategy be-tween the euro area and the United Stateswould have achieved an average annualisedreturn of 15% since the start of Europeanmonetary union, several times the interestrate differential. The return is thus largely de-termined by relatively sharp fluctuations inexchange rates. The chart also indicates,however, that the returns vary considerablyfrom month to month. Although peaking at71% in the extreme, the returns can also beclearly negative over a period of up to severalmonths. This highlights the speculative char-acter of carry trades.
An important question, however, is whether
the return calculated for hypothetical carrytrades is perhaps itself partly the result of ac-tual carry trades. Exchange rate movements,
after all, are likely to be affected by financingand investment decisions taken by inter-national investors. Shifting funds borrowed ina low-interest currency into a higher-interestcurrency should tend to cause the latter toappreciate. The carry trade could thus gener-ate an exchange rate movement that ultim-ately helps it to become profitable. In add-ition, the observation that a currency inwhich interest rates were already higher isalso tending to appreciate could encourageinternational investors to initiate additionalcarry trades, which could then lead to a pro-tracted exchange rate trend.
Conversely, the unwinding of a carry trade

42turn on outstanding carry trades. If the ex-
change rate change that then emerges isviewed as a trend reversal, more investorsmight feel the need to unwind their carrytrades, thereby accelerating the depreciationprocess: the more carry trades are unwound,the larger the depreciation, and the less sus-tainable the positions of those investors whoare still holding on to their carry trades. Ac-cordingly, one agent’s investment behaviourhas an externality on other agents’ strategies,ie the agents’ strategies are interdependent.If this leads to general selling pressure, then,according to theoretical models, bottlenecksand exaggerated exchange rate reactionscould occur even on relatively liquid mar-kets.
16
On foreign exchange markets, exchange ratedynamics are repeatedly attributed to theexecution or reversal of carry trades. How-ever, it is nearly impossible to quantify the im-pact of carry trades on the exchange rate. Itwould be particularly interesting to find outthe link between exchange rate movementsand the portfolio allocations of hedge funds,which are often named as actors that pursuecarry trading strategies. However, the requis-ite data are not available. Moreover, carrytrades can be carried out with a variety of in-struments, which is why they are difficult toidentify among international financial trans-actions – such as are recorded, for instance,in the balance of payments.
17Conclusion
In practice, the links between exchange rate
movements and interest rate differentials aremuch more complex than is usually assumedin simple models. Deviation from (uncovered)interest parity seems to be the rule ratherthan the exception. As this article has shown,this also applies to the period since the intro-duction of the euro. To date, the hypothesesdiscussed in the literature have been incap-able of providing a satisfactory explanationfor this phenomenon. Carry trades are there-fore a possibility – albeit a highly speculativeone – of exploiting deviation from uncoveredinterest parity.
Carry trades can be significant for central
banks in several ways. They can extend the le-verage of interest rate policy measures tocover the exchange rate channel, thus mak-ing it more effective. However, they can alsoamplify exchange rate swings in a potentiallyundesirable manner. They therefore representa particular challenge to monetary policymakers, to market agents’ risk managementpractices and to financial market and bankingregulators and supervisors.
