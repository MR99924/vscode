6OverviewGerman economy in the throes
of the global economic downturn
The downward slide of the global economy
accelerated markedly in the fourth quarter of2008. The underlying recessionary tendenciesin the industrialised countries hardened inthe wake of the escalating crisis in theinternational financial markets in the finalmonths of the year and its negative knock-oneffects on confidence and wealth. As theemerging market economies and developingcountries could not avoid these negativeinfluences either, the global economy as awhole cooled appreciably in the fourthquarter. A feature of the current downturn,which has few historical parallels, is itspronounced synchronicity across regions.The worldwide fall in demand also causedcommodity prices to fall steeply in thefourth quarter. The resulting increase in realpurchasing power in the consumer countriesfailed to compensate for the negative externaleffects, particularly as it was accompanied bymuted economic growth in the commodities-exporting countries. However, the brighterinflation outlook on the back of decliningenergy prices allowed numerous countriesto relax monetary policy significantly. Atthe same time, a number of states launchedsizeable fiscal stimulus programmes.
The negative developments in the financial
markets and the real economy intensified asthe international financial market crisiscame to a head with the insolvency ofthe US investment bank Lehman Brothersin September 2008. Share prices on theinternational stock markets suffered heftyGlobal

7losses. By contrast, demand was high for
safe, liquid securities, especially governmentbonds. This also caused a reassessment ofcredit risk for government bonds whichdiffered among the various euro-areacountries and was evident, inter alia , in the
debtor-specific increases in premiums oncredit default swaps. Not only has the yieldspread between German government bondsand all other euro-area government bondswidened since the end of September, theyield dispersion between the governmentbonds of all member states excludingGermany has also increased perceptibly. Inthe fourth quarter of the year, the dullereconomic outlook led to a furtherdeterioration in financing conditions in theinternational capital markets for privateinvestors. The interest rate premiums onEuropean corporate bonds temporarily markednew highs. In the international foreignexchange markets, the euro appreciatedsignificantly in December, though it ceded alarge part of these gains in the first fewweeks of the new year.
The easing of the monetary policy stance in
the euro area, which was initiated in thefourth quarter, was continued. The GoverningCouncil of the ECB has now cut the mainrefinancing rate for the Eurosystem by a totalof 2
1/C254percentage points to 2% since
October 2008, thereby exploiting the scopefor discretionary action created bysignificantly reduced inflation risks. In cuttingthe rate, the Governing Council was alsoresponding to the much gloomier outlook forthe real economy in the euro area in thewake of the financial market crisis.The looser monetary stance adopted since
October 2008 has resulted in a significantdecline in interest rates on the euro moneymarket. The overnight rate (EONIA) fellsharply; it is now clearly below the mainrefinancing rate – as a consequence of theswitch to full allotment in all Eurosystemrefinancing operations and the widening ofthe gap between the main refinancing rateand the deposit facility rate at the end ofJanuary. By historical standards, however, thetrading volume in interbank lending, onwhich EONIA is based, remained low; whilethis can probably be attributed partly tothe generous provision of liquidity by theEurosystem, it also points to ongoingdistortions in the interbank market. Longer-term euro money market rates have alsodropped appreciably in recent months. Thiswas, moreover, accompanied by a significantnarrowing in the relevant risk premiums. Forinstance, the yield spread between unsecuredthree-month money (three-month Euribor)and its secured counterpart (Eurepo) hasnarrowed distinctly, by around 1 percentagepoint, since October, despite more bad newsfrom the European and US banking sectors.As this report went to press, it stood at justover 0.9 percentage point.
M3 growth slowed perceptibly in the fourth
quarter. In seasonally adjusted, annualisedterms, the broad monetary aggregateexpanded by 6% from October to December2008, having risen at a rate of more than8% in the preceding quarter.

was 7.9%, 1 percentage point lower than inthe preceding quarter and 4 percentagepoints down on the year.
Lending to the euro-area private sector
waned considerably in the period underreview. It actually declined slightly fromOctober to December 2008. This slowdowncan be explained in part by substantialsecuritisation transactions, as a result ofwhich the relevant credits are no longerreported as loans to the private sector. Inparticular, both loans to households andloans to monetary financial institutions (MFIs)declined in non-seasonally adjusted terms,while lending to non-financial corporationsrose marginally in October and November.The Bank Lending Survey indicates a furthermarked tightening in credit standards in theeuro area in the last quarter of 2008.
The German economy slipped into a severe
recession in the fourth quarter of 2008,which will continue in the next few months.According to the Federal Statistical Office’sflash estimate, seasonally and calendar-adjusted real gross domestic product (GDP)fell by 2.1% in the fourth quarter of2008, following a decline of 0.5% in theprevious quarter. The main reason for thesharp economic downturn was that themanufacturing sector, the cyclically sensitivehub of Germany’s economy, responded to themarked fall-off in orders by sharply cuttingoutput towards the end of the year. Theheavy, primarily external, strains spilledover extraordinarily fast into the upstreamproduction sectors and had an almostimmediate knock-on effect on business-
related services, too. In view of the speed atwhich the negative demand shock spread,overall capacity utilisation also droppedbelow the corridor of normal utilisationwithin just a few months. Production capacitywas therefore probably already considerablyunderutilised at the end of the year.
Given the temporarily very high co-
movement of the downturns in all majorsales markets, exports fell very sharply inthe fourth quarter, after declining onlymoderately in the second and third quarters.Exports to EU partner countries have beenparticularly hard hit of late.
Given spare production capacity, enterprises
have recently refrained from makingnew investments. This may have beencompounded by the fact that, from mid-2008 onwards, the external financingconditions for large enterprises especially,which are typically more dependent on thecapital market, worsened significantly.Overall, however, the corporate sector hasshown remarkable financial resiliencecompared to the last downturn in the earlypart of the current decade, as is also evidentin the latest credit data. For example, loans tonon-financial corporations proved robustoverall, despite declining annual growthrates. The comparatively resilient creditenvironment can also be seen in the currentdata from the Bank Lending Survey forGermany. While the gloomier outlook for thereal economy is likely to have a dampeningimpact on lending in Germany over the next

9few months, there are still no signs of broad-
based supply-side restrictions on borrowing.
Following a slight increase in the third
quarter, the development of privateconsumption at the end of the year wasmarked by contradictory influences. The priceclimate improved considerably as energy andfood prices moved sharply lower, whichmeant that the higher collective wageagreements of 2008 had a perceptibleuplifting impact on real income. However, thesharp deterioration in the overall economicoutlook and reports of increasing use ofshort-time working arrangements and someredundancies dented the propensity toconsume and are likely to remain a drag overthe next few months.
The labour market proved remarkably
resilient up until the fourth quarter of 2008.To date, the sharp drop in output in thefourth quarter of 2008 has had only a verymoderate impact on staffing levels. In themain, the total number of hours worked inthe economy as a whole has been adjustedby reducing the working time per employee.According to preliminary calculations,employment growth has weakened steadilyover the past few months and, in November,ground to a halt. Similarly, unemploymentreached its cyclical bottom in the fourthquarter of 2008, following a long decline.
Germany is therefore currently experiencing
an exceptionally pronounced and abrupteconomic downturn, which is, moreover,being accompanied by a crisis on the financialmarkets. In this exceptional situation and inview of a largely balanced general
government budget, the decision not to relyexclusively on the automatic stabilisers, as ina normal cyclical downturn, but also activelyto take fiscal policy measures aimed atreviving the economy is justifiable. With thisaim in mind, the German governmentadopted two sizeable economic stimuluspackages in November 2008 and January2009, which will probably provide anoticeable boost to the economy as a wholein 2009 and 2010. Nevertheless, this will falla long way short of offsetting the slowdownin growth expected in export business in theshort run. In the current environment,government aid measures to support demandcan only attempt to prevent the downwardpressure emanating from foreign trade fromspreading across the board to domesticdemand and thus to mitigate the impact ofrecessionary influences.
The financial resources within the Federal
Government’s two economic stimuluspackages that are earmarked for public-sector investment in infrastructure will givean impetus to the construction sector, inparticular. In addition, the measures willunderpin the stabilising function of privateconsumption. Besides the positive impact ofthe more favourable price environment andnoticeable increases in wages, households’disposable income will rise by an estimatedtotal of 314 billion this year as the tax cuts
contained in the second economic stimuluspackage, the increase in child benefits, theone-off child bonus and the income taxrefunds as a result of the reintroduction ofthe tax break for commuters take effect. The

10changes to short-time working benefits that
have also been agreed on will make it easierfor enterprises to adjust labour volume inresponse to economic conditions withouthaving to resort to large-scale redundancies.This de facto extends the length of time
over which wage substitutes are paid, asunemployment benefits are, if necessary,granted for the full entitlement period ifemployees are laid off following a spell ofshort-time working. This could hampernecessary structural adjustments. However, inview of the exceptionally high uncertainty, itcurrently appears more important that thismeasure reduces the individual risk of joblosses in the short term and thus mitigates afactor that generally has a negative impacton consumption behaviour.
Overall, however, the problems associated
with the selected fiscal measures mustlikewise be borne in mind. The attempt tosteer economic processes by means of a flurryof government interventions – whetherthrough direct spending, tax benefits orguarantees – is always problematic. Theplanned rapid and sharp increase ingovernment investment will also necessitatemajor efforts to ensure the efficient use ofgovernment funds. Care should be taken thatthese investments – which amount to no lessthan around 50% of the annual governmentinvestment budget – do not merely to inflateprices. In terms of the timing of their impact,it would have been macroeconomically moreeffective to focus the measures more stronglyon the immediately coming quarters. As itstands, some will not develop their fullimpact until the second half of 2009, whileothers do not become fully effective until
next year or even later. Some of the measureswill prove a lasting, rather than merelytemporary, strain on public finances.
Maintaining confidence in the long-term
sustainability of public budgets is a vitalrequirement for a successful discretionaryfiscal policy. When the measures were agreedon, the fiscal situation was comparativelyfavourable, and the general governmentbudget was largely balanced last year. Thisyear, however, the general governmentdeficit will grow considerably, though itshould remain below 3% of GDP as thingsstand. The debt ratio will rise dramaticallyand is likely to reach a new high. One drivingfactor is the very dull cyclical setting. Anotherfactor is that the extensive fiscal stimulusmeasures will significantly swell the deficit. Ifthey are implemented as planned, thestimulus packages of November 2008 andJanuary 2009 are likely to increase the deficitfor 2009 by more than 1% of GDP . At theend of January, the German governmentpresented an update of the stabilityprogramme of December 2008. According tothis, the deficit ratio will rise further toaround 4% in 2010. This indicates thatGermany could exhaust its original fiscalleeway. Past experience suggests that it issimpler to achieve consensus on increasingdebt financing than on subsequentlyconsolidating public finances. In the currentsituation, it is therefore indispensable thatthere be a realistic prospect of bringing theexpected high deficits back down.

11This is also a requirement under European
budgetary rules. They are flexible enoughtemporarily to allow deficits exceeding, butclose to the 3% threshold in exceptionalcircumstances. In some member states, thescope for an expansionary fiscal policy wassignificantly smaller than in Germany, or evennon-existent. It is now important to apply theStability and Growth Pact as it was intended,not least in order to credibly safeguard thesustainability of public finances in the EUmember states. To this end, bindingundertakings should be made to reduce thedeficits rapidly once the economic situationimproves until budgets are virtually balancedin structural terms. Germany has an
important role to play in the Europeancontext. The reform of national budgetaryrules agreed in the Federal ReformCommission II can make an importantcontribution to this, as it anchors theEuropean fiscal commitments more firmlyand more consistently at the national level.However, very long transitional periods areplanned before the new debt rules becomeeffective. Ultimately, the litmus test will bethe extent to which the words proclaimed inthe consolidation promises are followed bydeeds.

12Global and European
settingWorld economic activity
The global economy’s slide accelerated rapid-
ly in the fourth quarter of 2008, and worldtrade is likely to have fallen sharply. One keyreason was that the financial markets wererocked by renewed turmoil triggered by thecollapse of US investment bank LehmanBrothers. Market segments which had hither-to remained largely unscathed were alsoaffected severely. Moreover, emerging marketeconomies and developing countries, particu-larly several central and eastern Europeanstates, were also sucked into the maelstromof the crisis. Stock prices fell sharply world-wide, and spreads on corporate bonds as wellas some government bonds surged. More-over, an increase in capital flight put down-ward pressure on the currencies of severalemerging market economies. The fact thatemerging market economies are being in-creasingly affected, combined with theirgrowing economic importance, have madethe current downturn much more of a globalphenomenon than previous cyclical down-swings. Also worth noting is the high degreeof co-movement of the downward trendamong the various countries.
In the hardest-hit industrial countries – specif-
ically, the United States and the United King-dom – the massive disruptions to the financialsystem were transmitted to the real economyprimarily by the tightening of financing condi-tions for enterprises and households and as aresult of negative wealth effects and lossesin confidence. This was accompanied by astrong levelling-off in import demand. Forthe more export-oriented industrial countries,Global

13such as Japan and Germany, as well as some
emerging market economies, this meant aconsiderable reduction in exports. Oil andcommodity exporting countries in the MiddleEast, Latin America and Africa were also hurtby the significant cyclical price corrections inthese markets.
In the fourth quarter, the retarding elements
in the world economy were so strong thateven the distinct improvement in the priceclimate, which – in and of itself – provideda considerable boost to purchasing power,was incapable of meaningfully lessening theimpact of the global economic slump. How-ever, account must also be taken of the oil ex-porting countries’ lost income, which hasdampened their growth. In the fourth quar-ter, consumer prices in the industrial nationswere up by a seasonally adjusted 1.1% on theperiod. Year-on-year growth fell from 4.3%in September to 1.0% in December. Exclud-ing energy and food, inflation fell during thisperiod by 0.6 percentage point to 1.7%.The moderate inflation rate allowed centralbanks, particularly in the industrialised coun-tries, to slash interest rates. In the meantime,governments have taken extensive measuresto stabilise the financial markets and re-injectcapital into the ailing banking system. More-over, many governments have also adopted(in some cases sizeable) economic stimuluspackages, which are expected to provide per-ceptible positive stimuli over the course ofthis year.

142008. Denominated in US dollars, the price of
crude oil, having already plunged by 343/C254%
from its mid-July peak until the end of Sep-tember, slid faster still in the autumn months.The price of crude oil dropped by no less thanUS$57 to US$37
1/C254per barrel between early
October and the fourth week of December.However, the price has been trending slightlyupwards since then. This is due in part toheightened geopolitical tensions in the Mid-dle East and the perceptible production cut-backs by the OPEC nations. In mid-February,crude oil was being quoted at US$45 or 335
per barrel. Prices for other commoditieslikewise fell visibly in the fourth quarter; inDecember US dollar prices were down byone-quarter on the year. However, they, too,have been rising slightly since the turn of2008-09. One reason is that the expecteddrought-related crop failures in Brazil and
Argentina have led to higher prices for food,beverages and tobacco.
The industrial countries remained at the centre
of the global downturn. Their overall outputshrank by a seasonally adjusted 1
1/C252% from its
level in the third quarter, in which it hadalready fallen by
1/C254%. It was down on the
year for the first time since 1982, by 11/C254%.
On an average for the year, however, it stillgrew by
3/C254%. All major countries and regions
saw a considerable drop in their GDP in thefourth quarter of 2008. The list was headedby Japan, with a fall in GDP of a seasonallyadjusted 3
1/C254%, followed by the United King-
dom and the euro area (each -11/C252%) and the
USA (-1%).
According to the January update of the fore-
cast issued by the International MonetaryFund (IMF), world GDP is expected to growonly
1/C252% in 2009, compared with a rise
of 31/C252% in 2008.1The sharp slowdown in
global growth is attributable, for one thing,to the probable contraction of the industrialcountries’ overall output by 2%. For another,the IMF is expecting growth in the emergingmarket economies and developing countriesto be halved to around 3
1/C254%. Next year,
however, world growth is forecast to rebounddistinctly to 3%. According to the new pro-jection, world trade will shrink by 2

152009 – its greatest decline since 1975 – and
rise relatively moderately (by 31/C254%) in 2010.
Several south and east Asian emerging mar-
ket economies were hit by a massive declinein exports in the fourth quarter of 2008.China, too, saw its exports fall year-on-yearin November-December for the first time inquite a while. Year-on-year GDP growthstood at 6
3/C254% in the fourth quarter, com-
pared with 9% in the third quarter. China’soverall output was likewise up by 9% for2008 as a whole.
2The positive purchasing
power effects of the further decline in the in-flation rate from 6.3% in July 2008 to 1.0%in January 2009, however, were counteractedby negative wealth effects stemming, mostnotably, from plummeting stock prices andgrowing uncertainty caused by mounting lay-offs and business failures. The IMF forecasthas growth in China slowing down to 6
3/C254%
in 2009, while some of the region’s othercountries, particularly Korea, Singapore andTaiwan, are even expected to see a percep-tible decline in real GDP .
Owing mainly to the continued drop in com-
modity prices amidst falling deliveries, theLatin American economies, having intermit-tently posted strong growth rates in the sum-mer months, felt the full impact of the globaleconomic downturn in the fourth quarter. Inaddition, foreign investors withdrew capital;in many cases, this led to a sharp depreciationin these countries’ currencies but also en-tailed a tightening of financing conditions. Inthe fourth quarter, Brazilian industrial outputfell by 9
1/C252% from its third-quarter level after
seasonal adjustment and therefore contract-ed year-on-year for the first time since the
second and third quarters of 2003. Of themajor countries in the region, Mexico wasprobably hit the hardest. This was related notonly to falling oil revenues but also to its highdegree of economic integration with theUnited States. Exports to its northern neigh-bour fell off considerably, and workers’ remit-tances from the United States likewise con-tinued their decline. Owing to currency de-preciation, inflation in Brazil and Mexico rosein the fourth quarter to slightly over 6%.
In the fourth quarter, the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) was hit hard for verysimilar reasons. In Russia, where the roubledepreciated sharply despite extensive inter-vention by the central bank, it was, aboveall, the deterioration of financing conditionswhich put a considerable damper on domes-tic activity, with numerous commercial invest-ment projects being either postponed or can-celled altogether. Households have cut backsubstantially on their purchases of, aboveall, durable goods, especially automobiles. Inaddition, it must also be noted that inflationin January, at 13.5%, was still very high. Ex-port revenues, moreover, fell significantly. Theeconomic situation in Ukraine deterioratedeven further in the fourth quarter. In Novem-ber, the government needed to borrow from
2In mid-January, China’s National Bureau of Statistics re-
vised nominal GDP growth upwards by 3% for 2007,
leading to a correction in the real growth rate by one per-
centage point to 13%. China’s total output, based on
market exchange rates, thus surpassed Germany’s for the
first time, moving the People’s Republic of China up to
the rank of the world’s third largest economy following
the United States and Japan. On the basis of purchasing
power parity, the Chinese economy has already been in
second place behind the United States for quite some

banking system. The Ukraine economy washit particularly hard by the global collapse inthe demand for steel since exports of metalsand metal products had been by far its maingenerator of foreign currency revenue in thepast few years.
As announced in December 2008 by the Busi-
ness Cycle Dating Committee of the US Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research (NBER),the US economy has been in recession sincethe end of 2007. This choice of date is basedmainly on employment trends, which haveclearly pointed downwards throughout 2008.Job cuts have accelerated considerably in thepast few months. In the September 2008 toJanuary 2009 period, non-farm payroll em-ployment fell by over 2 million persons afterseasonal adjustment. Since the end of 2007,as many as 3
1/C252million jobs have been lost.
Three-quarters of a million jobs were axed inconstruction, and manufacturing saw theelimination of a million jobs. In January, theunemployment rate stood at 7.6%, or 3.2percentage points above its cyclical low inMarch 2007. Along with negative wealtheffects, considerable losses in confidence,and a growing credit crunch, the gloomieroutlook on the job market placed severe con-straints on private consumption in the fourthquarter. These effects far outweighed thepositive purchasing power effects of the rapidreduction in consumer price pressures, withUS inflation, owing mainly to lower energyprices, falling from 4.9% in September to0.1% in December. Consumer price inflationexcluding energy and food likewise decreasedover the same period, by 0.7 percentage pointto 1.8%. Growth of the core personal con-
sumption deflator slowed down by 0.6 per-centage point to 1.7%.
US households’ real consumption expenditure
fell by 1% in the fourth quarter, a similar re-duction to that in the third quarter. Reasonsincluded both the decline in nominal dispos-able income and the perceptible rise inhousehold saving, which, at 2.9% of dispos-able income, reached its highest level sincethe beginning of 2002. With a decline of5
1/C252%, gross fixed capital formation fell even
more sharply than private consumption.Housing investment was reduced by 6
1/C252%,
and corporate investment by 51/C254%. The
contraction was slowed down by highergovernment spending and inventory invest-ment. Where inventory growth was the resultof an unexpectedly sharp deterioration insales growth, however, it is to be expectedthat production will be adjusted accordinglyin the following quarters. Looking just atthe figures, foreign trade had no impact onoverall growth in the fourth quarter. Theperiod-on-period decline in exports, at 5
1/C252%,
was somewhat larger than that in imports(-4
1/C254%), yet the volume of exports was con-
siderably lower than that of imports. All in all,real fourth-quarter GDP in the United Stateswas down by 1% on the quarter after season-al adjustment and by
1/C254% on the year. For
2008 as a whole, GDP still managed growthof 1
1/C254%.

plan consists of additional spending, especial-ly on infrastructure and financial assistancefor the states, which are being forced by therecession to make significantly greater socialbenefit payments for the unemployed andthe needy. The remaining one-third has beenearmarked for tax relief for households andfirms. Monetary policy is likewise sharply ex-pansionary; in mid-December the FederalReserve cut the federal funds rate to between0% and 0.25%. In addition, the Federal Re-serve provided support to the mortgage mar-kets through direct purchases.
Real GDP in Japan fell by a seasonally adjust-

cline that was considerably sharper still thanthat of the other major industrial nations.Annual average overall output fell by
3/C254%.
The economic slump in the last quarter of2008 is attributable mainly to the drastic14% fall in real exports (after seasonal adjust-ment) on the quarter. Since imports still roseperceptibly, real foreign trade alone draggedGDP growth downwards by three percentagepoints. This was joined by a negative
1/C254per-
centage point contribution by domestic de-mand. Once again, falls in commercial in-vestment (-5
1/C254%) and private consumption
(-1/C252%) were the main causes. A certain con-
tribution to righting the balance was made byhousing construction (+5
3/C254%) and govern-
ment demand (+1%). Inventory investment,in and of itself, was able to slow down thefall in real GDP by just under
1/C252percentage
point in the fourth quarter. However, this mayhave been due in part to extensive and invol-untary inventory growth, which may well
force firms to make further adjustments toproduction in the current quarter. The con-traction in overall output has thus far led to,above all, a decline in overtime hours worked.In addition, the unemployment rate rose from4.0% in September to 4.4% in December.Consumer prices fell by 0.6% in the fourthquarter after seasonal adjustment. In Decem-ber, the year-on-year figure was only +0.4%.Excluding energy and food, prices remainedunchanged from their end-2007 levels.
In the final quarter of 2008, the UK economy
contracted once again, by 1
1/C252% on the quar-
ter. Overall output contracted by 13/C254%o n
the year. The result for 2008 as a whole, how-ever, at +
3/C254%, remained positive. The sharp
contraction in the fourth quarter was duemainly to a large decline in real value addedin manufacturing (excluding construction),which reached a seasonally adjusted 4%. Thisdecline would have been even greater hadthe pound not depreciated considerably, adevelopment which slowed goods importsand counteracted the negative export trends.Activity in both the construction sector andthe services sector fell by 1%. As a result ofthe severe economic downswing, the (stand-ardised) number of unemployed personswent up by 400,000 since the cyclical troughin the fourth quarter of 2007 to 1.9 million inNovember; the unemployment rate stood at6.2% as this report went to press. Owingto the pound sterling’s depreciation, amongother reasons, consumer price inflation didnot diminish as strongly as in other industrialcountries. It fell to 3.1% year-on-year in De-cember.

for the quarter was 163/C254% lower than a year
earlier.
Economic activity also slowed significantly in
the new EU member states in the fourthquarter of 2008. This particularly affected in-dustrial activity, which was down by 7
1/C252%o n
the quarter and on the year after seasonaladjustment. The Baltic countries were hit thehardest. However, considerable declines werealso felt by most of the other countries in thisgroup, including Slovakia, where the auto-mobile industry has a large share in overalloutput. Given this situation, it comes as nosurprise that unemployment in the new EUmember states has risen somewhat sinceOctober, hitting 6.6% at the close of 2008.As in western Europe, price pressures recededdistinctly in the autumn months; inflation fellfrom 6.3% in September to 4.5% in Decem-ber. In this region, the brunt of the financialmarket problems is being borne by thosecountries which, in the past few years, hadseen overheated property markets, postedhigh current account deficits and consider-able external debt, some of which is denom-inated in foreign currency, and also possessonly a low amount of foreign reserves. All inall, the vulnerability of central and east Euro-pean countries relative to other emergingmarket regions may be regarded as ratherhigh.
Macroeconomic trends in the euro area
Overall euro-area output was down in the
fourth quarter by 1
1/C252% on the period afterseasonal adjustment, its third successive period
of negative growth and its sharpest contrac-tion since the beginning of monetary union inJanuary 1999. Output was 1
1/C254% lower than
in the fourth quarter of 2007. However,thanks to the good start to 2008, the euro-area economy still managed to expand by
3/C254% for the whole year. The contraction of
real GDP is attributable to adverse develop-ments in nearly all euro-area countries, in-cluding its four largest members, for whichinformation is available up to the final quarterof the year. Germany’s economy contractedthe most, followed by Portugal and Italy. OnlyCyprus and Greece saw their economiesgrow. The European Commission’s latest fore-cast predicts that the economic slide will lastuntil mid-2009, followed by a stabilisation ofbusiness activity and a gradual recovery dur-ing the course of 2010. The Commission ex-pects output to fall by 2% in 2009 and to riseby
1/C252% in 2010. In its view, absent the na-
tional economic stimulus programmes thathave been announced to date, real euro-areaGDP would actually be down even further, by
3/C254% this year and by between1/C253%t o1/C252%
next year.
In a sectoral view, the sharp cutback in indus-
trial output – by a seasonally adjusted 5% onthe quarter and 8
1/C252% on the year – was the
main reason for the fourth-quarter contrac-tion of real GDP . The largest individual year-on-year declines were sustained by the manu-facturers of intermediate goods (-13%), con-sumer durables (-11
1/C254%) and capital goods
(-81/C252%). The production of non-durable goods
and energy each fell by 31/C254%. The sharp con-

The business cycleis unlikely to have bottomed out just yetbecause, among other things, new orderscontinued their precipitous drop in October-November, by a seasonally adjusted 12% onthe quarter and by 21% on the year. In add-ition, the industrial confidence indicator fellby no less than 21 points in the September toJanuary period, reaching a new all-time low.One positive signal – the significance ofwhich, however, should not be overstated – isthat the Purchasing Managers Index for themanufacturing sector, which had previouslycome under intense pressure, stabilised inJanuary. Nevertheless, the indicator remainswell within contractionary territory.
On the demand side, exports have been the
main barometer of the economic downturnin the fourth quarter of 2008. In October-November – the most recent period for whichdata are available – euro-area exports to non-euro-area countries were down by a season-ally adjusted 6
3/C254% from their third-quarter
average and by 33/C254% on the year. Imports
were down to a similar extent from theirthird-quarter levels but were still up 1

Moreover,purchases of new machinery and equipmentare also likely to have fallen off considerably;this is what the aforementioned comprehen-sive curtailment of production in this segmentwould seem to suggest. Measured in terms ofproduction data, which in October-Novemberwere 1
1/C252% lower than in the third quarter,
the decline in construction investment re-mained relatively muted. Consumer demandfor retail goods likewise contracted in the
fourth quarter, with real sales (excludingautomobiles) posting a 1% quarter-on-quar-ter decline after seasonal adjustment. Fur-thermore, households also purchased farfewer automobiles.

the year. Consumer confidence diminishedagain slightly at the beginning of the year.
The labour market situation grew perceptibly
gloomier in the second half of 2008. Employ-ment in the euro area fell in the third quarterfor the first time since the beginning of mon-etary union. Even though the number of em-ployed persons was still up by 0.8% on theyear, this margin is likely to have diminishedsignificantly in the fourth quarter, which isevidenced by the accelerated increase ofnearly 600,000 in the number of unemployedpersons from the third quarter to the fourth.The standardised unemployment rate wentup by 0.4 percentage point to 7.9% in thefinal quarter of 2008. Despite the marked
deterioration in the labour market situation,year-on-year labour cost growth acceleratedfrom 2.7% to 4.0% in the third quarter of2008. However, the unadjusted year-on-yearrates overstate the pace of accelerationowing to a calendar effect. The seasonally ad-justed series produce a year-on-year climb of3.6% for the third quarter of 2008 following3.2% in the second. At 5.8%, the rise in la-bour costs was particularly pronounced inSpain, although unemployment there has al-ready been trending upwards distinctly sincemid-2007.
Euro-area consumer prices fell by nearly 1%
after seasonal adjustment over the course ofthe fourth quarter of 2008. Year-on-yearinflation as measured by the HarmonisedIndex of Consumer Prices (HICP) therefore fellfrom 3.6% in September to 1.6% in Decem-ber. Base effects also contributed to thismarked decline. The annual inflation rateaveraged 2.3% in the fourth quarter, follow-ing an average of 3.8% in the third. Theenergy component contributed the most tomuting the inflationary trends. The sharp cor-rections in crude oil prices caused the year-on-year inflation rate for this group of goodsto fall from 15.1% in the third quarter to2.1% in the fourth. Food prices likewise roseat a much slower pace, at 3.8% following5.6% in the third quarter. By contrast, priceinflation for non-energy industrial goods roseslightly to 0.9%. Services price inflation heldsteady at 2.6%. The year-on-year rate ofHICP fell further in January 2009 to 1.1%.

21Monetary policy and
banking businessInterest rate policy and the money market
The Governing Council of the ECB has cut
the main refinancing rate for the Eurosystemby a total of 2
1/C254percentage points since Oc-
tober 2008. By easing the monetary policystance, the supreme decision-making body ofthe Eurosystem has exploited the scope fordiscretionary action created by significantlyreduced inflation risks. At the same time, itwas responding to the much gloomier out-look for the real economy in the euro area inthe wake of the financial market crisis. Since21 January, banks have had to pay an interestrate of 2% for the weekly main refinancingoperations, which are still being conducted asfixed-rate tenders with full allotment for thetime being. The Eurosystem charges 3%interest for recourse to the marginal lendingfacility. The interest rate for credit in connec-tion with the deposit facility amounts to 1%.The Eurosystem has thus returned to theusual interest rate corridor of 200 basis pointsafter a temporary narrowing of the symmetricinterest rate corridor around the main refi-nancing rate to 100 basis points.
The looser monetary stance adopted since
October 2008 has also resulted in a consider-able decline in interest rates on the euromoney market. The overnight rate (EONIA)fell sharply – also as a consequence of theswitch to full allotment in all Eurosystem refi-nancing operations and the widening of thegap between the main refinancing rate andthe deposit facility rate – and it is now clearlybelow the main refinancing rate.

22Deutsche BundesbankMoney market management and liquidity needs
During the three reserve maintenance periods from
8 October 2008 to 20 January 2009, euro-area credit
institutions’ need for central bank money arising from
autonomous liquidity factors increased very sharply
by5132.7 billion in net terms. This was largely attrib-
utable to the very significant rise of 568.8 billion in
the volume of banknotes in circulation in the euro
area. The strong growth in banknotes in circulation
which began in October, shortly after the financial cri-
sis worsened, was particularly noticeable, as was the
usual seasonal increase in the run-up to Christmas. At
the turn of the year, the volume of banknotes in circu-
lation in the euro area reached a new record high of
5766.2 billion. In addition, the remaining autonomous
factors also increased the liquidity need in the period
under review. First, there was an increase of 544.7 bil-
lion in general government deposits with the Eurosys-
tem and, second, if the net foreign reserves and the
other factors are taken together, a move which elim-
inates liquidity-neutral valuation effects, there was an
additional increase in the liquidity needs of 519.2 bil-
lion. In the three periods under review, there was also
an increase in the minimum reserve requirement of
55.5 billion in total. Alongside this regular need, there
was also a sharp, crisis-induced increase in the de-
mand for liquidity.
After the insolvency of US investment bank Lehman
Brothers had led in mid-September to a marked escal-
ation of the tensions on the interbank money market,
on the first day of the October-November reserve
period, the ECB – in coordinated action with other
leading central banks – announced immediate and
massive steps to further stimulate the money market.
Along with a reduction of 50 basis points in the key
interest rate to 3.75%, the ECB also approved the im-
mediate symmetrical narrowing of the corridor of the
standing facilities from 200 basis points to 100 basis
points (limited until 20 January 2009). As a further key
measure, the ECB moved, for a limited period, from a
variable rate tender system to a fixed rate tender sys-
tem with full allotment in its main refinancing oper-
ations. This step was then extended to the longer-
term refinancing operations a few days later. Con-ducting additional long-term tenders, including oper-
ations with a duration of one reserve period, ensured
that there was supplementary liquidity provision in
the maturities of up to six months (see the table on
page 25). Other important measures were additional
US dollar and Swiss franc refinancing operations as
well as an extension of the collateral framework. The
main aim of all of these measures and the related li-
quidity management activities was to ensure that
there was a sufficient supply of central bank liquidity.
The appropriateness of the measures carried out was
confirmed by the heavy demand for liquidity from
credit institutions in the period under review, the
marked increase in the number of bidders in open
market operations and a further shift in the maturity
structure towards longer-term refinancing operations.
In addition, the ECB adhered to its policy of using
fine-tuning operations to absorb excess liquidity on
the last day of each reserve period. On the whole, the
monetary policy framework of the Eurosystem proved
that it was also capable of responding effectively and
flexibly to these special liquidity situations.
The October-November 2008 reserve period began, as
usual, with a main refinancing operation which was
carried out as a variable rate tender with a minimum
bid rate of 4.25%. Although the ECB allotted 5209.5
billion above the benchmark amount, there were very
high allotment rates, which clearly reflected the high
degree of tension on the money market. The extraor-
dinary decision to reduce interest rates on the first
day of the period as well as the announcement of the
aforementioned measures prompted the ECB to im-
plement immediately a liquidity-providing fine-tuning
operation with a duration of six days and at the new
key interest rate of 3.75% in order to carry out at
once the agreed adjustments in the monetary policy
operational framework. As a result of the subsequent
switch from variable to fixed rate tenders with full
allotment, from this point onwards the amount of
liquidity provided was based solely on demand from
credit institutions. This led to large allotment volumes
in the main refinancing operations in this reserve
period, with above-benchmark amounts of up to 5360

23billion. One consequence of such abundantly avail-
able excess liquidity in the market was the very high
degree of recourse to the deposit facility, which aver-
aged 5214 billion in the October-November reserve
period. The simultaneous heavy use of the marginal
lending facility (averaging 512.7 billion) underlined
the existing segmentation in the interbank money
market. Another consequence was that the above-
benchmark surplus in liquidity reduced the EONIA to
well below the fixed interest rate for main refinancing
operations.
In the November-December reserve period, the main
refinancing operations were carried out at the new
fixed rate of 3.25% after the Governing Council of
the ECB had agreed to an interest rate reduction of
50 basis points at its meeting on 6 November. Liquidity
provision continued to be determined by the strong
demand from credit institutions for central bank
money. This was apparent, above all, in the main refi-
nancing operations, which had fairly constant bid vol-
umes (and allotment amounts) of around 5340 billion,
leading to high above-benchmark amounts (up to
5300 billion). Credit institutions showed less interest
in the longer-term refinancing operations, which
were likewise carried out as fixed rate tenders with
full allotment and included, for the first time, the par-
allel allotment of three and six-month tenders. While
high levels of overnight deposits (averaging 5201 bil-
lion) continued to be lodged with the Eurosystem as a
result of the abundant levels of liquidity, recourse to
the marginal lending facility decreased markedly in
this reserve period (on average 52.7 billion). During
this period, the EONIA was always well below the
main refinancing rate, on average by 30 basis points.
Despite being 42 days in length and encompassing
the Christmas and New Year holidays, the December-
January reserve period, from a liquidity management
point of view, changed very little this year compared
with the same period last year. The demand for liquid-
ity from credit institutions remained strong. Very high
above-benchmark amounts were almost invariably re-
corded in the main tenders (up to 5370 billion), andthis continued to result in a high degree of recourse
to the deposit facility of, on average, 5238 billion. The
liquidity shortages feared at Christmas and New Year
did not arise owing to the extremely generous supply
of liquidity. Instead, the abundant supply of liquidity
led to EONIA fixes which, at an average of 28 basis
points, were significantly below the new main refi-
nancing rate of 2.50% which the Governing Council
of the ECB had agreed at its meeting on 4 December.

tributed partly to the generous provision of li-quidity by the Eurosystem, it also points toongoing tensions in the interbank market.
Longer-term euro money market rates have
also dropped appreciably in recent months.This was accompanied by a significant nar-rowing in the relevant risk premiums. For in-stance, the yield spread between unsecuredthree-month interbank deposits (three-month
Euribor) and its secured counterpart (Eurepo)has narrowed distinctly by around 1 percent-age point since the end of October, despitemore bad news from the European and USbanking sectors. As this report went to press,the spread stood at just over 0.9 percentagepoint.
Monetary developments in the euro area
M3 growth slowed perceptibly in the fourth
quarter. In seasonally adjusted and annualisedterms, the broad monetary aggregate ex-panded by 6% from October to December2008, after rising at a rate of more than 8%in the preceding quarter. Monetary momen-tum continued to weaken on a slightlylonger-term view, too.

unsecuritised lending even declined some-what; the seasonally-adjusted and annualisedgrowth rate amounted to -
1/C252% in the report-
ing period following an increase of 61/C252%i n
the third quarter. However, this slowdowncan be explained in part by substantial securi-tisation transactions. As a result of this, therelevant loans are no longer booked as loansto the private sector in the banks’ balancesheets. In particular, both loans to householdsand loans to monetary financial institutions(MFIs) declined in non-seasonally adjustedterms, whereas lending to non-financial cor-porations rose marginally in October and No-vember. At the end of the year, the corres-ponding 12-month growth rates were 1.7%for loans for house purchase (compared with4.1% in September), 2.1% for other loans tohouseholds (compared with 3.3%), and9.4% for non-financial corporations (com-pared with 12.2%).
The net external assets of the MFI sector,
which reflect foreign payment transactions bynon-banks, increased by 391 billion in the
period from October to December followinginflows of 329 billion in the previous quarter.
This probably also reflects the shifts into do-mestic bank balances to which governmentguarantees in various euro-area countries arealso likely to have contributed. Bank loans toeuro-area governments per se also aided
monetary expansion. In seasonally adjustedterms, these loans went up by 3114 billion
from October to December. In the periodunder review, however, the only rise was insecuritised lending to the public sector. Thismost likely also reflects the public sector’sComponents and counterparts

period from October to December, centralgovernments sharply increased their depositswith domestic credit institutions by 3142
1/C252
billion (these are not included in M3).
Monetary capital in the euro area declined
slightly during the period under review; inseasonally adjusted and annualised terms, itfell by just over 2%. Without the hugetopping-up of banks’ capital and reserves,which was largely a result of governmentrescue measures to stabilise the financial sec-tor, the fall in longer-term investment withdomestic banks in the final quarter of 2008would have been much greater (in seasonallyadjusted and annualised terms, just short of6
1/C252%). Given the tension on the markets, the
outstanding volume of long-term bank debtsecurities decreased by 12
1/C252% in seasonally
adjusted and annualised terms. By contrast,investor interest in long-term savings depositsincreased significantly during the reportingperiod; longer-term time deposits (withagreed maturities of over two years) recordedonly marginal growth.
Despite the increase in M3 growth in the final
quarter of 2008, which was driven primarilyby pronounced investor uncertainty particu-larly at the beginning of the period underreview, the underlying rate of monetary ex-pansion – that is the monetary expansion thatis ultimately relevant to inflation – has tendedto weaken. Accordingly, the longer-termthreats to price stability associated with mon-etary growth receded discernibly during thefourth quarter. This can also be seen in themonetary-based inflation forecasts whichrecently came close to the Eurosystem’s defin-
ition of price stability. However, the highdegree of uncertainty which is currentlyinherent in such inflation forecasts should notbe overlooked.
German banks’ deposit and lending
business with domestic customers
Domestic private non-banks’ deposits soared
in the final quarter of 2008. In total, they roseat an annualised rate of almost 14%. This ismost likely due to the guarantee for bank de-posits announced by central government, amove which was reflected, above all, in Octo-ber’s surge in overnight deposits. These de-posits increased at a seasonally adjusted andannualised rate of almost 29% over theLending and deposits of monetary

28fourth quarter as a whole. By contrast, short-
term time deposits, which had experiencedsharp growth in the previous quarters, fellslightly in the fourth quarter in seasonally ad-justed and annualised terms. The Eurosys-tem’s 1
3/C254percentage point cut in interest
rates in the final quarter of 2008 is likely tohave significantly reduced the attractivenessof short-term time deposits which are trad-itionally remunerated close to market rates;their interest rate advantage over other bankdeposits declined noticeably in the periodunder review. Short-term savings deposits (re-deemable at notice of up to three months)thus benefited from this situation; in season-ally adjusted terms, they grew again for thefirst time since mid-2005.The longer-term time deposits (with an
agreed maturity of over two years) expandedat an exceptionally strong rate during theperiod under review. This growth predomin-antly demonstrates German banks’ substan-tial securitisation transactions, which are re-corded in the statistics partly as an increase inthe longer-term time deposits of the securitis-ing special purpose vehicles (SPVs) – whichare not assigned to the banking sector – fortheir parent institution. In this case, the banktakes the securitised paper of its special pur-pose vehicle into its own balance sheet andrecords it against longer-term time deposits.In addition, longer-term savings deposits(redeemable at notice of over three months)also increased sharply in the quarter underreview.
In the final quarter of 2008, total bank loans
to the private sector in Germany continued togrow at a strong pace. In this period, theyrose at a seasonally adjusted and annualisedrate of almost 7%. The most recent rise re-sulted to a great extent from a sharp increasein bank holdings of securities issued by do-mestic entities. The securitisation transactionsmentioned above also contributed to this de-velopment as banks added those securitiesnewly created by their SPVs to their port-folios. At a seasonally adjusted and annual-ised rate of just over 2
1/C252%, loans to domestic
enterprises and households increased at a farslower pace than overall lending. Loans is-sued by German banks to domestic non-financial corporations were 6.4% up on theyear at the end of the period under reviewcompared with 7.5% at the end of the previ-ous quarter.

30monetary financial corporations recorded the
usual large seasonal fall. However, they werestill 25.0% up on the year; this was almostsolely due to the sharp rise in reverse repur-chase agreements. From an economic pointof view, these transactions are interbankloans which do not constitute net lending tothe non-bank sector. Households also re-duced their loans from German banks duringthe period under review. This reflects, in par-ticular, the sustained decline in loans forhouse purchase.
The fact that the Bank Lending Survey (BLS)
results for Germany identified that the tight-ening of credit standards observed in previousquarters had become more widespread mayalso have played a part in this. In the finalquarter of 2008, households, too, were con-fronted with tighter lending conditions frombanks surveyed in the BLS. These were feltmainly in margins for loans for house pur-chase and consumer credit which, on bal-ance, increased considerably, especially forriskier loans. In view of the fact that competi-tive pressure has eased for the first time infive years, the margins for average loans forhouse purchase have also expanded. At thesame time, the institutions surveyed alsostated that they were faced with a further de-cline in demand for loans for house purchaseand a more or less stagnating demand forconsumer credit. In the reporting period, thecredit standards for loans to enterprises werealso tightened considerably. However, as inthe case for loans to households, these ad-justments were smaller than those in the euroarea as a whole.

31costs and balance sheet constraints have
again been playing an important role in thedevelopment of credit standards; yet, thenegative effect of the general assessment ofthe outlook for the economy as well as sectorand firm-specific factors have had a far largerimpact. The survey round in the fourth quar-ter of 2008 also contained a set of ad hoc
questions on the impact of the financial mar-ket crisis on the surveyed institutions’ creditstandards. The responses indicated that theproblems in the wholesale funding of Ger-man BLS banks and also with regard to theircapital position tended to have intensifiedand that this was being reflected more andmore in the lending policy of the banks sur-veyed.By contrast, the development of bank lending
rates for new loans per se is likely to have
supported domestic lending to the privatesector. In the wake of interest rate cuts by theEurosystem, short-term loans to householdsand non-financial corporations, in particular,became much cheaper despite the widermargins mentioned above. However, theinterest rates for longer-term bank loans alsosank in line with developments on the capitalmarkets. At the end of 2008, banks charged5.2% or 4.3% for short-term loans to enter-prises and 5.1% or 4.9% for long-term loansto enterprises depending on volume. Theydemanded 5.4% for loans for house pur-chase with short-term interest fixation and4.7% for loans with interest rate fixation ofmore than ten years.

The international financial market crisis escal-
ated further in the fourth quarter of 2008and increasingly spilled over to the real econ-omy. Conversely, the gloomier economic out-look hurt sentiment in the financial markets.On balance, equities recorded massive losses,since investors withdrew funds from risky in-vestments and moved them into secure andliquid paper. Besides US Treasuries, Federalbonds were the main beneficiaries. Their yieldspread vis-/C224-vis the corresponding debt secur-ities issued by other euro-area countries in-creased significantly. Given more pessimisticassessments of default risk and the clearlyheightened risk aversion, the interest ratepremiums of European corporate bonds alsotemporarily marked new record highs. In theinternational foreign exchange markets, theeuro recorded clear gains in December 2008.However, it relinquished a large part of thesegains in the first few weeks of the new year.
Exchange rates
In November and at the beginning of Decem-
ber 2008, the euro-US dollar exchange raterange-traded in a fairly narrow band betweenUS$1.25 and US$1.30. Following the publica-tion of the surprisingly large drop in the ISMManufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Indexin the USA, the euro rallied somewhat againstthe US dollar at the start of November afterthe previous noticeable depreciation; how-ever, in view of the continually spreading fearof a global recession, it relinquished thesegains again afterwards.

33ground, the Eurosystem’s significant interest
rate cuts in November and December 2008had been generally anticipated in the marketsand had no noticeable effect on exchangerate developments.
In mid-December, however, the euro appreci-
ated abruptly against the US dollar, as thebleak outlook for the US economy was con-firmed by the publication of weak labourmarket figures and the Federal Reserve cut itskey interest rate to almost 0%. Within just sixtrading days, the euro-US dollar exchangerate climbed from US$1.30 to over US$1.46.It thus returned to its end-2007 level, but itwas still just over 8
1/C252% below its record high
of July 2008. However, just a short time later,there was a correction of this exceptionallystrong exchange rate adjustment, and theeuro-US dollar rate lost some of its gains. In2009, too, the euro depreciated furtheragainst the US dollar. This was aided by recur-ring speculation regarding a cut in key inter-est rates by the Eurosystem, which actuallyoccurred in mid-January. In addition, the newUS government’s extensive stimulus packageis likely to have strengthened the dollar. Inthe second half of January, the downgradingof the sovereign rating of various Europeanstates was an additional burden on the euro.As this report went to press, the euro stoodat US$1.26.
Against the yen, the euro experienced further
net losses in the reporting period. The con-tinued strength of the Japanese currency ismainly the result of the unwinding of yen-financed (international) investments (eg carrytrades), whose risk has greatly increased withthe marked rise in exchange rate volatility. In
mid-December, the euro only temporarilyappreciated somewhat against the yen, afterthe Bank of Japan had reported a dramaticdeterioration of the business climate amongJapan’s large manufacturers and had onceagain cut its key interest rate. The prospect offoreign exchange interventions held out bythe Japanese government also weakened theyen in this period. After the turn of the year,Exchange rate of the euro

34however, the euro relinquished these gains.
Market expectations that interest rate differ-entials would continue to narrow, as well asthe renewed increase in euro-yen volatility,put pressure on the euro-yen exchange rate.As this report went to press, the euro stoodat ¥116; however, this was still about 30%above its historic low of October 2000.
The euro exhibited an upward trend against
the pound sterling in the reporting periodand reached a new record high of £0.98shortly before the end of the year. This wasaided by the interest rate cuts of 150 and100 basis points carried out by the Bank ofEngland in November and December respect-ively, which had been unexpectedly large ac-cording to market observers. In addition, con-cerns about the UK economy were fuelled bythe announcement of a marked decline in in-dustrial output. In January, the British poundstabilised, however, and the euro had to giveup some of its gains. The Bank of England’stwo 50 basis point interest rate cuts at the be-ginning of the year, which had been generallyanticipated by the markets, did not changethis. As this report went to press, the euro-pound exchange rate was just under £0.89.
During the period under review, the euro also
rose against other currencies, sometimes sig-nificantly. Compared with the end of Septem-ber, it recorded larger gains especially againstthe Polish zloty (+44%), the Hungarian forint(+26%), the Czech koruna (+20%) and theRomanian leu (+15%). Moreover, the euroappreciated noticeably against some com-modity currencies. This was also reflected inthe index of the effective euro, which record-ed a new record high in mid-December and
was 7% above its level at the start of monet-ary union when this report went to press. Tak-ing into account the accrued inflation differ-entials between the euro area and its majortrading partners, the real effective euro ex-change rate was therefore well above itslong-term average.

Securities markets and portfoliotransactions
Since the fourth quarter, the European bond
market has been characterised by a reassess-ment of credit and liquidity risk. The averageyield of ten-year euro-area governmentbonds slipped by about
1/C252percentage point
compared with the end of September to justunder 4% – in line with a much bleakereconomic outlook, falling inflation rates andlow central bank interest rates. As this reportwent to press, the corresponding Federalbonds (Bunds) were yielding around 3%,which represents a decline by 1 percentagepoint. The interest rate gap between Germanand other euro-area government bonds thuswidened to just over 1 percentage point andtemporarily reached its highest level since theintroduction of the common currency (seechart on page 35).

35able securities (“safe haven”). By contrast, fu-
ture burdens on public budgets stemmingfrom the unfavourable economic develop-ment are likely to have generally reduced theattractiveness of government bonds in theeyes of investors. The various governmentrescue packages for banks, especially the as-sociated risk transfer to the public sector, hadthe same effect. However, this reassessmentof credit risk differs among the euro-areacountries, as is reflected, for example, byissuer-specific rises in the premiums on creditdefault swaps and changed rating agency as-sessments. On balance, not only has Germa-ny’s yield spread compared with all othereuro-area countries widened since the end ofSeptember, the yield dispersion between thegovernment bonds of all member states ex-cluding Germany has also increased.
At the same time, the yield curve has steep-
ened. In the case of Federal securities, the dif-ference between ten and two-year yields hasrisen to just over 2 percentage points; this isthe highest value since the start of monetaryunion. While short-term yields have fallen byaround 1
1/C252percentage point since the end of
September in line with the partly alreadypriced-in Eurosystem key interest rate cuts,the decline in longer-term yields was less pro-nounced – as mentioned above. This probablypartly reflects the prospect of an increasedsupply of government bonds.

since the end of September, declined byaround 1 percentage point across all matur-ities amid sharply falling inflation rates anddeclining central bank interest rates. In linewith the key interest rate set at a corridor
of 0% to
1/C254%, short-term US Treasury bills
are trading at around1/C254%. US government
bonds, even more so than Federal bonds, arebenefiting from their role as a safe and highlyliquid investment opportunity. On balance,however, foreign investors have almost exclu-sively bought money market paper issued bythe US government; the acquisition of long-term government bonds, by contrast, wascomparatively low. In the USA, as in the euroarea, uncertainty regarding future interestrate developments is still high by historicalstandards.

36months. On the one hand, the dramatic share
price losses were a factor. On the other hand,interest rate premiums on the bond marketshave increased significantly. For Europeanbonds of the lowest investment grade cat-egory (BBB) vis-/C224-vis government bonds, theywere 638 basis points as this report went topress. Apparently, given the bleaker economicoutlook, market participants view the defaultrisk of corporate bonds much more pessimis-tically. This is also suggested by the sharp
rise in the iTraxx Europe Crossover Index,which tracks the credit risk premiums of sub-investment grade European enterprises. More-over, the wider bond spreads can probablyalso be explained by the greater uncertaintyin the capital markets, a further increase inrisk aversion and higher liquidity premiums.
The guarantees of the Financial Market Sta-
bilisation Fund – Financial Market Stabilisa-tion Agency (SoFFin) made possible by the Fi-nancial Market Stabilisation Act have beenused for four bonds issued by credit institu-tions, which have a volume of 315 billion and
were brought to the market in January2009.
2In the secondary market, they are
trading at a premium of just over3/C254percent-
age point vis-/C224-vis Federal debt securities withthe same maturity.
3This yield differential is
comparable to the corresponding figures forbonds issued by the KfW and the Renten-bank, which, owing to their tasks, are pro-vided with a Federal government guaranteeor for whom the Federal government ensuressolvency (maintenance obligation). The inter-est rate premium can therefore probably beattributed mainly to the lower liquidity of theindividual issues compared with Federal se-curities.

37historical high. However, redemptions were
also at a record level ( 3432 billion), so that,
on balance, after taking account of changesin issuers’ holdings of their own bonds, 316
billion worth of bonds were sold (net). Bycontrast, domestic investors sold large quan-tities of foreign debt securities in the report-ing period ( 349
1/C252billion), which were mostly
denominated in euro. In total, the amount ofdebt securities in circulation in Germany wastherefore reduced by 333
1/C252billion; this is the
so far greatest decline recorded in any onequarter.
In the final quarter of 2008, the public sector
raised 314
1/C252billion in the capital market. Of
this, 381/C252billion were accounted for by the
Federal government, which had slightly re-duced the volume of outstanding paper inthe third quarter ( 31 billion). In the fourth
quarter, the Federal government mainly is-sued ten-year Federal bonds ( 36 billion) in net
terms, but also raised shorter-term funds viatwo-year Federal Treasury notes and Bubills(32 billion and 31
1/C252billion, respectively) as
well as “day bonds” ( 321/C252billion). By con-
trast, it redeemed five-year Federal notes and30-year Federal bonds in net terms ( 33
1/C252bil-
lion and 31 billion, respectively). For the rest,
the federal states increased their capital mar-ket debt by 36
1/C252billion.
In view of the difficult market conditions,
credit institutions significantly reduced theircapital market debt in the fourth quarter(342
1/C252billion), having issued a small amount
of net new debt in the previous three-monthperiod. They mainly redeemed public Pfand-briefe ( 329 billion), whose outstanding vol-ume has been decreasing for some time.
Moreover, – despite record levels of grossissuance – other bank debt securities wereredeemed in net terms ( 39 billion). This cat-
egory includes bank debt securities (“certifi-cates”) which allow particularly flexible struc-turing. Specialised credit institutions, includ-ing public promotional banks, also reducedthe volume of their debt securities in circu-lation ( 35
1/C252billion). By contrast, mortgage
Pfandbriefe were sold to the tune of 31 bil-
lion.
Entities without a banking licence and not be-
longing to the government sector issued debtsecurities amounting to just over 344 billion
from October to December 2008. About 338

that, enterprises mostly issued longer-termsecurities, while commercial paper was re-deemed on balance.
Domestic credit institutions ultimately ac-
quired debt securities amounting to 310
1/C252bil-
lion in the fourth quarter. In net terms, 337
billion of this represented paper of domesticprivate issuers without a banking licence, in-cluding the securitisations mentioned above.Moreover, they bought paper issued by do-mestic banks amounting to 319
1/C252billion net
as well as government bonds ( 31/C252billion). By
contrast, they sold foreign debt securitiesworth approximately 347 billion. For the most
part, this was money market paper, some ofwhich had been issued by foreign special pur-pose vehicles. Domestic non-banks acquiredGerman public-sector debt securities for
318
1/C252billion, but were also net sellers of
bonds brought to the market by privateissuers ( 328
1/C252billion), which – provided that
they were bank issues – do not benefit fromthe government’s guarantee for bank de-posits.
4In addition, they slightly reduced their
holdings of foreign debt securities ( 33 billion).
In the final analysis, foreign investors sold 331
billion worth of domestic debt securities,mostly paper of private issuers. Some of thisconstituted redemptions of financial productsissued in Germany and sold “ en bloc ”t o
affiliated foreign enterprises (“certificates”and warrants).
On both sides of the Atlantic, the stock mar-
kets recorded massive losses in the reportingperiod. At the start of the fourth quarter, con-cerns about the overall state of the financialsector – which had arisen after the insolvencyof a big US investment bank in September –continued to grow; in addition, the interplaybetween the financial crisis and the sharp de-terioration in the outlook for the real econ-omy increased investors’ risk aversion. As aresult, there were runs on shares at times. Atthe same time, market participants’ uncer-tainty about further share price develop-ments, as measured by the implied volatilityof stock options, temporarily reached new re-cord highs worldwide.

39ally coordinated key rate cuts and the adopt-
ed stimulus packages brought about a certainstabilisation in the stock markets. However,as early as January 2009, reports of highlosses in the banking sector and the need formore government support measures exertedfurther pressure on stock prices. Additionallyburdened by declining earnings expectations,international share prices recorded furtherlosses worldwide, with shares in the USA andin Japan – as measured by broad market in-dices – temporarily falling below their recordlows of the second quarter of 2003. On bal-ance, European shares lost 27% since theend of September 2008, while US and Japan-ese shares were down 29% and 31%, re-spectively, at the end of the period underreview.
Against the backdrop of the share price
losses, issuance activity in the German stockmarket declined in the last quarter of 2008.Domestic enterprises issued 33
1/C252billion
worth of new shares, the vast majority ofwhich were listed equities. By contrast, theoutstanding amount of foreign equities in theGerman market decreased significantly(317

by non-resident investors ( 341/C252billion).5By

balance, the outflows affected only mutualfunds open to the general public ( 311
1/C252bil-
lion), while the specialised funds reserved forinstitutional investors recorded inflows offunds amounting to 3
1/C252billion. Of the mutual
funds open to the general public, mixedfunds, mixed security-based funds and share-based funds were able to sell a small amountof certificates ( 31 billion, 3
1/C252billion and 31/C252
billion, respectively). By contrast, money mar-
ket funds as well as open-end real estatefunds and bond-based funds suffered out-flows of funds ( 36 billion, 35 billion and 33
billion, respectively). Funds were also with-drawn from funds operated by foreign com-panies and traded in the German market(315
1/C252billion). Domestic and foreign mutual
fund shares were sold mainly by resident non-banks ( 315
1/C252billion), which, during the crisis,
shifted large amounts of their funds to gov-ernment-guaranteed bank deposits and pub-lic sector bonds. Net sales of mutual fund cer-tificates by German credit institutions and for-eign investors amounted to 38
1/C252billion and
33 billion, respectively.
Direct investment
The combined total of cross-border securities
transactions in the fourth quarter of 2008shows net capital imports of 3501/C252billion.
By contrast, in the area of direct investment,which is based less on short-term consider-ations, net capital exports amounted to 317
1/C252
billion. This was significantly higher than in
the preceding three-month period ( 310 bil-
lion).
A key factor in this was that German propri-
etors provided their affiliates abroad with sig-nificant amounts of additional funds ( 320
1/C252
billion). This was mainly equity capital ( 313
billion). In addition, there was an outflow offunds abroad in the form of reinvested earn-ings and intra-group loans ( 35
1/C252billion and
321/C252billion, respectively). German investment
abroad was concentrated on the financialand energy sectors. The most importantrecipient countries were the Netherlands,Sweden and the United Kingdom. By con-trast, domestic investors withdrew fundsfrom France, Belgium and Luxembourg.
Foreign firms also supplied their branches and
subsidiaries in Germany with additional cap-ital (33
1/C252billion in the final quarter of 2008,
compared with 311/C252billion in the preceding
quarter). This was done mainly through thegranting of credit ( 32
1/C252billion). In addition,
reinvested earnings led to an increase in thecapital base of branches in Germany.German direct

41Economic conditions
in GermanyMacroeconomic situation
In the fourth quarter, the German economy
was very clearly feeling the effects of thesharp global economic downturn followingthe renewed escalation of the international fi-nancial crisis. According to the Federal Statis-tical Office’s flash estimate, seasonally andcalendar-adjusted real gross domestic prod-uct (GDP) in the final quarter of 2008 fell by2.1% following a 0.5% decline in the previ-ous quarter. The calendar-adjusted figure was1.7% down on the year.
The sharp economic downturn was due
mainly to substantial cutbacks in manufactur-ing output at the end of the year owing to amassive deterioration in the orders situation.Enterprises used the scope available in variousways to bring production into line with chan-ging demand conditions. In addition to theusual fluctuations in staffing levels, the firstmeasure employed was to run down workinghours accounts. Recently, short-time workingarrangements and making temporary work-ers redundant have been playing a greaterrole. Furthermore, factories were shut downtemporarily by extending plant closures overthe Christmas holiday period. The massive,primarily external strains spilled over excep-tionally quickly into the upstream productionsectors and then had an almost immediateknock-on impact on business-related services.Owing to the speed at which the negative de-mand shock was transmitted, overall capacityutilisation exceeded the corridor of normalutilisation within just a few months, whichmeans that there is likely to have been a con-Sharp fall in

42siderable underutilisation of production cap-
acity as early as the end of the year.
The downward pressure on the economy
through the foreign trade channel intensified,firstly, due to the trend economic downturnin the industrialised countries. Secondly, thecentral and east European economies as wellas many emerging market economies werealso no longer immune from the real eco-nomic effects of the international financialcrisis; a number of them suddenly foundthemselves thrown into an economic crisisowing to their comparatively high susceptibil-ity to redirections of international capitalflows. As a result of the high degree of syn-chronicity of the downturns on all major salesmarkets, exports plummeted in the fourthquarter after no more than a moderate de-cline in the second and third quarters. Exports
to the EU suffered very heavily at the end ofthe period under review. Foreign trade activ-ities with Russia and Latin American countrieswere showing clear signs that their currencieshad depreciated – in some cases very sharply –against the euro and that, following the endof the commodity price boom and givengrowing credit constraints, these countrieswere finding it more difficult to finance in-vestment. This meant that what was hithertoa major area of business for German export-ers became less important. In contrast to this,the value of exports to OPEC countries in-creased strongly in October and November.
In actual fact, despite the fall in prices, oil-
exporting countries’ revenues are likely tohave remained at quite a high level in thefourth quarter, not least, as a result of thestrong build-up of oil inventories in the indus-trialised countries at the start of the heatingseason. The seasonally adjusted average vol-ume of energy imported by the Germaneconomy in October and November wasslightly above the high level of the third quar-ter, while other imports showed a sharp fall inline with declining output in Germany. Therewas a very pronounced decrease in importsof intermediate and capital goods.
Given the production capacity that was freed
up, enterprises were restrained in terms ofnew investment. An additional factor mayhave been a further marked deterioration inthe external financing conditions from mid-2008 onwards, which mainly affected largeenterprises which typically operate inter-nationally and are more dependent on the

43capital market. Overall, compared with the
last downturn at the start of the millennium,the corporate sector is showing a notable fi-nancial resilience. This means that it has beenpossible to use own funds to finance processand product-related adjustment measureswhich become urgent especially in times ofslack sales, or that, given the sound balancesheet structures in medium-sized enterprises,”house banks” are still prepared to providethe necessary loans. Although there has beena further perceptible tightening of creditstandards in recent months, the Germaneconomy is yet to be affected by a creditcrunch. A deterioration in the sales situationand a cautious wait-and-see attitude are themain reasons why investment in machineryand equipment is likely to have been signifi-cantly lower in the fourth quarter after al-ready having slowed down in the precedingthree-month period.
Construction investment in the October to
December period is also likely to have de-clined in seasonally adjusted terms. Owing toenterprises’ cyclically-induced reluctance toinvest, no stimulus is to be expected from theindustrial construction sector at present.Owing to the time lags that usually have tobe allowed for planning and project prepar-ation, the public infrastructure measuresadopted in the first economic stimulus pack-age of November last year had not yet hadtime to take effect during the reportingperiod. By contrast, there was probably amoderate upward movement in investmentin residential construction in the fourth quar-ter.

44also likely to have played a part in this devel-
opment.
Following a slight increase in the third quar-
ter, private consumption at the end of theyear was marked by contrasting influences.The price climate improved considerablyowing to a sharp fall in the prices of energyand food, which meant that the higher col-lective pay agreements in 2008 were reflect-ed more clearly in real income. The sharp de-terioration in the economic outlook and re-ports of increasing short-time working and,sometimes, redundancies impaired the pro-pensity to consume per se , however. It is also
likely to have been adversely affected by thesizeable losses and further bad news in the fi-nancial markets. In the fourth quarter, sea-sonally adjusted real retail sales (excluding themotor vehicle trade) fell by
1/C254% on the quar-
ter, which was the same amount as the in-crease in the third quarter. A sharp rise insales of light heating oil was an alleviatingfactor. Seasonally adjusted new car registra-tions by private owners were down by only1
3/C254% in the fourth quarter, mainly as a result
of a strong performance in December whichwas aided by considerable discounts in somecases on purchases of cars.
Sectoral trends
There was a slump in industrial sector produc-
tion in the final quarter of 2008. Seasonallyadjusted industrial output in the reportingperiod fell by 7.5% on the third quarter and,in response to the sharp drop in enterprises’new orders, by 7.8% on the year (after calen-dar adjustment). At the same time, the stock
of orders on hand has probably been more orless completely processed. These orders hadbeen built up during a prolonged period ofextremely favourable sectoral conditions andhad supported industrial output into the thirdquarter of 2008 despite what was already awaning flow of orders. This is indicated bythe fact that the mechanical engineering sec-tor, which was able to use up the reserves oforders for the longest period, and the chem-icals industry are the last two large industrialsectors to be affected by the economic down-turn. The need for adjustment is especiallypronounced in the motor vehicle industry, an-other key pillar of the German economy.Owing to the integration of production atmany different levels, significant effects spillover from the car industry into many other in-dustries (see the explanatory notes onpages 46 to 47).
Within the space of one year, manufacturing –
Germany’s core economic sector – slid from adistinct boom phase into recession. This is evi-dent from a joint analysis of activity and de-mand. According to Ifo Institute data, pro-duction capacity in order-based industry wasconsiderably underutilised in the final quarterof 2008 while, one year earlier, capacityutilisation was only marginally below itsrecord level since reunification. Furthermore,12 months previously, demand for industrialgoods as measured by the order capacityindex, at more than 14% above available pro-duction capacity, reached a record peak forGermany as a whole. At the start of 2008,what was still a comfortable situation of apersistently high intake of orders and a very

45good degree of capacity utilisation degener-
ated extremely rapidly into a situation whereindustrial enterprises, given an already de-pressed level of capacity utilisation, suffered afurther setback in orders. Capacity utilisationand the order capacity index recently fell farbelow the figures they recorded during theperiod of stubborn stagnation at the start ofthe millennium and are, if anything, nowcomparable to the figures in the wake of thereunification boom. However, in contrast tothe situation then, the fact that this is coincid-ing with the cooling of the real economy inother regions of the global economy is nowhaving a severer impact.
The situation in the construction sector re-
mained more relaxed. After falling already inthe summer quarter, the volume of construc-tion output was not quite maintained in the
fourth quarter (-0.2%). The construction sec-tor was still providing no stimulus. Neverthe-less, given almost no change in the level ofutilisation of machinery and equipment, thissector stabilised the overall economic situ-ation in relative terms. The same applies tothe wholesale and retail trade. While retail ac-tivities, including the trade in motor vehiclesand fuel, declined on the quarter in seasonallyadjusted terms, wholesale enterprises’ trans-actions still recorded a slight increase. By con-trast, the business services sector was drawnrelatively quickly into the downward spiralemanating from the industrial sector. Accord-ing to the Ifo Institute, the business situationin key business-related branches of the ter-tiary sector showed a massive deterioration inthe second half of 2008.Cyclical position of industry in the output demand scheme *

interse ctoral inte gration of pro duction
Me dia reports on the real e conomi c impa ct of the ﬁ  nan-
cial crisis are takin g a great deal of interest in the auto-
motive in dustry. The ﬁ  scal stimulus pa ckages of Novem-
ber 2008 an d January 2009 both containe d spe ciﬁ c 
assistan ce measures for this se ctor. Car manufa cturin g is 
extremely important for the e conomy, not least owin g 
to its close inte gration of pro duction at many different 
levels with other se ctors. Moreover, followin g stron g 
growth over the past few years, the slump in deman d in 
the automotive in dustry in re cent months has been par-
ticularly marke d. The volume of or ders re ceive d in the 
second half of 2008 was down by more than one-ﬁ  fth in 
seasonally a djuste d terms on the previous six months.
As a result of the deterioration in sales conditions, the 
automotive in dustry cut back pro duction in the se c-
ond half of the year by just over one-ei ghth in season-
ally a djuste d terms compare d with its overall output 
between January an d June 2008. Takin g account of the 
stan dard time frame for completin g an or der in this se c-
tor, in dustrial output was a djuste d by aroun d two-thir ds 
to the marke dly lower volume of or ders at the en d of 
the perio d un der review.
According to the national a ccounts data, manufa ctur-
ers of motor vehi cles, trailers an d semi-trailers make 
a directly contri bution of just over 3 % to the German 
economy’s total value a dded (value d at basic pri ces). Within the manufa cturin g se ctor, me chani cal en gin-
eerin g, for  e x  a  mple, has an even somewhat greater 
import ance, while the constru ction se ctor an d the retail 
tra de (ex cluding the sale of motor vehi cles an d automo-
tive fuel) both ex ceed the automotive in dustry’s direct 
share of value a dded. The automotive in dustry employs 
aroun d 850,000 persons, whi ch is a bout one-ﬁ  fth lower 
than the num ber of persons workin g in the me chani cal 
engineerin g se ctor. The constru ction se ctor an d, above 
all, the retail tra de are also bigger provi ders of jo bs. 
With an export ratio of 57 % between 2004 an d 200 6, 
the automotive in dustry has an upper mi d-ta ble rank ing 
amon g the se ctors of the manufa cturin g industry.
In cyclical terms, however, due a ccount also has to be 
taken of the automotive in dustry’s interse ctoral inte gra-
tion of pro duction at many different levels. This is all the 
more important as the automotive in dustry is chara c-
terise d by a very small depth of value a dded an d many 
sectors are involve d in car manufa cturin g in Germany. 
Furthermore, a se ctor-spe ciﬁ c sho ck can sprea d very 
qui ckly throu gh relate d bought-in goods an d servi ces 
and thus develop into a ma croe conomi c phenomenon. 
In this context, however, it is important not to overlook 
the fa ct that the spill over effe cts of a se ctoral disruption 
to deman d primarily only take the form of a diffusion 
effe ct whi ch has a co rrespon dingly smaller impa ct on the 
sector that is directly affe cted. Nevertheless, the sum of 
the se ctor al losses in sales can qui ckly rea ch a level that 
is several times hi gher than the ma croe conomi c loss of 
value a dded, whi ch is also likely to have a correspon ding 
negative effe ct on the sentiment in dicators for the se c-
tors concerne d. How lar ge the “sales lever” of a ne ga-
tive ﬁ  nal deman d sho ck is to be assesse d is shown in the 
input-output ta bles of the Fe deral Statisti cal Ofﬁ  ce.
The basic varia bles for the se ctoral effe cts of pro duc-
tion inte gration are the input coefﬁ cients. These may be 
interprete d as a measure of the direct output effe ct in 
a given se ctor arisin g in the manufa cture of a unit of 
ﬁ nal deman d in the same or another se ctor. From this,

47it is possi ble to derive further coefﬁ cients whi ch in dicate 
how many units of interme diate output of one se ctor are 
nee ded in total – ie directly an d in directly – (Leontieff 
multipliers) in or der to pro duce a ﬁ nal unit of deman d in 
another se ctor. From these values, a domesti c cumulative 
output multiplier of 2.2 is pro duced for the ﬁ  nal deman d 
unit “ car”. This means that a decline in ﬁ  nal deman d by 
one unit of value a dded is a ccompanie d by a fall in sales 
that is 2.2 times lar ger, because not only does the value 
added in the automotive in dustry itself have to be cut 
back, but pur chases of inputs from many other se ctors 
(eg castin g of metals, ele ctrical en gineerin g, chemi cals) 
also decline, whi ch, in turn, impa cts on the automotive 
industry.4 Measure d by the output multipliers of other 
goods, car manufa cturin g in Germany o ccupies a lea d-

From the statisti cal data it can be extrapolate d that 
the slump in or ders experien ced by the German auto-
motive in dustry in the se cond half of 2008 re duces the 
volume of sales in the goods cycle with domesti c pro-
ducers throu gh direct an d indirect deliveries by aroun d 
€55 billion. If forei gn inputs are in cluded, the ﬁ  gure is 
as hi gh as €81 billion. After deductin g both the import 
share of goods an d servi ces totallin g just over €2 6 billion 
and inputs of aroun d €39 billion, whi ch have been calcu-
late d usin g se ctor-spe ciﬁ c input ratios, the value-a dded 
(at basic pri ces) of the domesti c se ctors declines by an 
amount of just un der €1 6 billion. The automotive in dus-
try itself a ccounts for just un der half of this amount. 
Business-relate d (mainly commer cial) servi ces whi ch also 
include temporary work, an d the tra de an d frei ght se c-
tor (ex cluding sales to ﬁ  nal consumers), must ea ch shoul-

to be taken into a ccount when determinin g the effe ct

mate d €6 billion are to be in cluded. In nominal terms, 
this means that German GDP is dampene d by some €22 
billion, or by just un der 1 % of overall annual e conomi c output. As the present mo del calculation concerns the 
negative deman d sho ck from the se cond half of 2008, 
the overall impa ct in dynami c terms is likely to have been 
reﬂ ected only to some extent in the decline in output

48Employment and unemployment
So far, the sharp drop in output in the fourth
quarter of 2008 has had only a very subduedimpact on staffing levels. In the main, thetotal number of hours worked has been ad-justed through hours worked. According tothe industrial statistics, average hours workedin the core cyclical sector of manufacturingfell by 2.6% on the year in the reportingperiod after calendar (and seasonal) adjust-
ment. Although overtime was initially cutback and working hours accounts were rundown, extended plant closures during theholidays and government-assisted short-timeworking arrangements are likely to haveplayed a growing role at the end of the year.Precise information on the volume of short-time working for the final quarter of 2008will not be available until the end of February2009. Nevertheless, in the fourth quarter of2008, firms registered short-term working ar-rangements for a total of 626,000 employeesat the Federal Employment Agency.
1In the
same period of 2007, the figure was only156,000, mainly in the construction industryfor seasonal reasons. In the final quarter of2008, however, such registrations camelargely from the manufacturing sector. Theuse of short-time working arrangements wasmade easier by the fact that, from January2009, the period of entitlement was extend-ed to 18 months and that temporary employ-ment agencies were also authorised to makeuse of this facility. Furthermore, as part of thesecond economic stimulus package, the gov-ernment is to pay half of the employers’ socialsecurity contributions for the loss of earningsassociated with the reduced working hours.The prospect of orders from the public sectoris also likely to have helped to ease pressurein the construction sector to lay off staff.
According to the provisional calculations of
the Federal Statistical Office, there was aOutput in industry

growth in seasonally adjusted terms over aperiod of several months, which came to astandstill in November. However, this was stillan increase of 0.1% on the preceding three-month period on a quarterly average. Theyear-on-year increase was 1.0%. Jobs subjectto social security contributions show a similarprofile. The business-related services sectorincluding labour leasing – which was a keysource of employment growth during the lastupswing – was already showing a clear de-cline. The outlook for employment has be-come even gloomier. The Ifo employmentbarometer fell considerably again in the finalquarter of 2008 but matched the low level atthe start of 2009. This means that, especiallyin manufacturing, a reduction in staffinglevels is to be expected in the next fewmonths. The number of vacancies also wentdown again in the fourth quarter; non-government-assisted jobs were affected dis-proportionately.
Unemployment bottomed out in the fourth
quarter of 2008 following a protracted de-cline. Although unemployment fell slightly ona quarterly average by a seasonally adjusted26,000 persons on the quarter and the un-employment rate went down from 7.7% to7.6%, the total number of persons out ofwork increased over the quarter as a whole.This was due mainly to the fact that the de-cline in the number of unemployed personsreceiving the basic welfare allowance was nolonger pronounced enough to offset thegrowing number of job seekers receiving un-employment benefits under the statutory in-surance scheme, which is more susceptible toLabour market

employment was trending upward again. Thenumber of jobless persons receiving basicwelfare allowance also rose considerably forthe first time. In seasonally adjusted terms,this represented a total increase of 56,000.The unemployment rate for such personswent up to 7.8%. The use of short-timeworking arrangements – for which an add-itional 291,000 registrations were received –is likely to have prevented this developmentfrom being even more unfavourable.
Wages and prices
Negotiated rates of pay rose sharply in the
fourth quarter of 2008 owing to the lump-sum payment agreed in the metal-workingand electrical engineering industries in No-vember. According to the Bundesbank’s ne-gotiated wage index,
2negotiated rates of
pay went up on a monthly basis by 3.6% onthe year. Excluding one-off payments, the in-crease amounted to 2.8%. Despite a low vol-ume of one-off payments, the rise in negoti-ated rates of pay in 2008, at 2.8%, was morethan twice as high as in the previous year. Ac-cording to the WSI wage archive, the averageduration of the collective wage agreementswent up slightly to 22.4 months. Accordingto the provisional annual calculation of theFederal Statistical Office, the increase in ac-tual earnings on a monthly basis, at 2.3%,was somewhat slower than that of the nego-tiated rates of pay. The negative wage driftwas also due to the fact that, for cyclical rea-sons, the actual number of hours worked wasbelow the number of working hours underthe collective pay agreements. Despite the
cooling of the real economy, the increase innegotiated rates of pay is unlikely to level offsignificantly in 2009, as a number of agree-ments that have already been concludedprovide for further, albeit – in some cases –smaller increases.
3Nevertheless, a number of
these pay agreements are subject to liberal-isation clauses.
After rising substantially up to mid-2008,
there was a sharp decline in import prices inthe wake of the price adjustments in theinternational energy and commodity markets.On an average of the fourth quarter, importprices were down by a seasonally adjusted7.3% on the quarter. The decline in the case
2The Bundesbank’ s negotiated wage index comprises all
the major wage components laid down in the collective
pay agreements, including regular special payments, such
as holiday pay, Christmas bonuses and one-off lump-sum
payments, which are often concluded as a supplement to
the permanent percentage increases in regular pay. The
negotiated wage index of the Federal Statistical Office
(see M Bick, Tarifverdienste in Deutschland – Was sagt die
Tarifstatistik? Wirtschaft und Statistik, 12/2008, pp 1101-
1106) shows changes in the regular monthly rates of pay
(basic rates of pay and capital formation benefits). It re-
cords only part of the wage agreements relevant to in-
come and costs. According to this definition, employee
remuneration went up by 3.1%, and hourly wages of em-
ployees by 3.0% on an annual average of 2008. In add-
ition to its comprehensive index, the Bundesbank calcu-
lates sub-indices, excluding one-off payments and add-
itional payments. According to these indices, contractual-
ly agreed basic rates of pay went up by 3.1% in 2008 and
thus more or less as sharply as according to the index of
the Federal Statistical Office. These sub-indices serve as
supplementary information and primarily as an aid to in-
terpretation for changes in the annual rates of the overall
index, which can be affected by base effects owing, for
example, to one-off payments. Admittedly, they cannot
be a substitute for the comprehensive index as a macro-
economic indicator of the wage dynamics laid down in
the collective pay agreements.
3In addition, at the beginning of February 2009,
Deutsche Bahn and the trade unions GDBA, GDL and
Transnet reached a new pay agreement with a duration
of 18 months. In line with this agreement, rates of pay
will be increased by 2.5% in February 2009, followed by
a one-off payment of 3500 in December 2009 and a fur-
ther increase of 2.0% in January 2010.Sharp rise in

51of energy prices, at 27.7%, was particularly
pronounced. The cost of intermediate goodsfell by 4.2%. By contrast, the prices of capitalgoods went up by 0.7%. This means that, forthe time being, the almost continuous seven-year decline in prices for this category ofgoods came to an end. The depreciation ofthe euro against other currencies, especiallythe US dollar, is likely to have played a keyrole in this. The rate of price increase forconsumer goods went up from 0.8% in theprevious quarter to 1.2%. While there was amarked price rise in the case of clothing,there was decline in the cost of food. All inall, the cost of imported goods was 1.2%down on the fourth quarter of 2007. How-ever, the cost of exports went up by an aver-age of 1.0% on the year. As a result, theterms of trade improved by 2.2% on the year.
Triggered by lower import prices, German in-
dustry lowered its domestic prices, in total, bya seasonally adjusted 1.0% on the quarter.The sectoral pattern largely matches that ofimported goods. Prices for energy werereduced by 2.6%, and for intermediategoods by 2.2%. The prices of capital goodsrose by 0.6%, while the cost of consumergoods fell by 0.3%. The marked decline inthe cost of agricultural commodities, whichhave a far larger weighting in domestic indus-trial consumer prices than in import prices,played a crucial role in this. Agricultural pro-ducer prices – ie unprocessed food products –were down by as much as 9.6% on the quar-ter in seasonally adjusted terms. Owing to thesharp price rises up until July 2008, industrialproducer prices were still up 5.8% on theyear overall in the fourth quarter of 2008. Ex-cluding energy, the figure was 2.1%. There
was no further quarter-on-quarter rise in con-struction prices for the first time since thesecond quarter of 2005. In the fourth quarterof 2008, however, construction prices wentup by 3.4% on the year.
Seasonally adjusted consumer prices fell sub-
stantially by 0.7% during the final quarter of2008. Owing to base effects – consumerprices went up by no less than 1.2% duringthe same period of 2007 – the year-on-yearincrease in the national consumer price index(CPI) went down from 2.9% in September to1.1% in December. This positive developmentin purchasing power was due very largely tocorrections in the international crude oil mar-kets, where the price for a barrel of Brentcrude oil was 57% lower in December than it

In 2008, the pri ces of newly constru cted housin g rose 
slightly. As can be seen from the real estate pri ce 
indices calculate d by the Bun desbank on the basis of 
 Bulwien Gesa A G data,1 this in crease reﬂ  ects the rise in 
pri ces for owner-o ccupie d apartments, while there has 
been no discerni ble chan ge in the pri ce of new terra ced 
housin g. The pri ces for existin g terra ced housin g an d 
owner-o ccupie d apartments likewise remaine d lar gely 
sta ble. In re gional terms, only minor differen ces are 
apparent. In eastern Germany, ol der housin g became 
cheaper while new property was availa ble at pri ces 
rou ghly the same as in the previous year. In western Germany, the pri ces for resale real estate remaine d 
unchan ged with sli ght in creases in the pri ces for newly 
constru cted housin g.
A similar pi cture is reveale d by the he doni c housin g

in the pri ce of existin g real estate. Avera ged over the

four quarters of the year, ﬂ  uctuations are discerni ble in 
all three cate gor ies. In parti cular, the pri ces for existin g

54had been in September. As a result, consumer
energy prices fell by almost 7% in seasonallyadjusted terms, although, owing to the sharpfall in demand, the decline in the price ofheating oil was not yet being fully passed on.Finally, corrections in the prices of agriculturalproducts were becoming increasingly appar-ent at the consumer level. The overall cost offood was somewhat more than
1/C252% lower
after seasonal adjustment. There were no fur-ther price increases for the other goodswhich had become quite clearly more expen-sive in the third quarter. The steady increasein the case of housing rents continued at amoderate pace. By contrast, there was aslight acceleration in the rise in the prices ofservices. On a quarterly average, consumerprices went down by a seasonally adjusted0.3% overall, compared with an increase of0.7% in the previous quarter. The year-on-year increase in the national consumer priceindex (CPI) went down from 3.1% in the thirdquarter to 1.7% in the fourth quarter. Thecorresponding figures for the HarmonisedIndex of Consumer Prices (HICP) were 1.6%and 3.3% respectively.
Consumer prices in January 2009 showed a
moderate increase of 0.1% on the month inseasonally adjusted terms. This was duemainly to the fact that there were no furtherprice reductions in the case of energy. Thecost of petrol and heating oil, as well as ofgas and electricity, went up rather sharply insome cases. Furthermore, there was a 5.2%increase in radio and television licence fees.This was offset to some extent by the broad-based price reductions in the retail food sec-tor which began in mid-month and whichImport, producer and

55were therefore recorded only to a certain ex-
tent in the price index for January. The pricereductions at the beginning of the winterclearance sales were more or less as sharp asin the previous year and the prices of packageholidays were quite favourable. The year-on-year increase in the national CPI and the HICPfell from 1.1% in December to 0.9% in Janu-ary.
The latest round of price reductions in the re-
tail food sector will also be reflected in theconsumer price index in February. Furtherfood price reductions are likely in the comingmonths. The price of heating oil can also beexpected to show a further decline. For gasand also for electricity, a reversal of the previ-ously upward trend is possible. The price re-ductions at the turn of 2008-09 will, to a cer-tain extent, reverse the comparatively sharprise in prices in 2008, especially in the firsthalf of the year. This makes it more likely thatthe year-on-year rates of the consumer priceindex will be negative for a time in the com-ing months. In other words, this year-on-yeardecline in consumer prices does not indicatea general deflationary trend. Instead, itshould be seen in connection with the correc-tion to a number of previously sharp import-related price rises for certain groups of prod-ucts.
Orders received and outlook
The German economy entered a period of re-
cession in the fourth quarter of 2008, whichis also set to continue in the coming months.The strong external withdrawal effects havedealt a severe blow to the German economy,
the dynamism of which was due largely to itsbuoyant exports in recent years. The persist-ent turmoil in the international financial mar-kets combined with structural weaknessesand imbalances in a number of countries areleaving a distinct mark on the real economyworldwide. There is a very strong cyclicalinterlinkage at present among the industrialcountries and the economic catching-up pro-cess in the emerging market economies hasslowed down or, in some cases, even groundto a halt.
Against this backdrop, sometimes extensive
fiscal measures to stimulate the economyhave been taken in a large number of coun-tries. In addition, wide-scale use has beenmade of interest rate and liquidity policy in-struments. Furthermore, the banking systemsare currently being supported in an unpreced-ented manner and intensity. Given the prob-lematic situation, it is scarcely possible tooveremphasise the importance of the factthat the vast majority of enterprises andhouseholds in Germany are generally on asound economic footing and that relationshipbanking, which plays a greater role in Ger-many than in many other industrialised coun-tries, can now bring its traditional advantagesto bear. This means that a major requirementis in place to enable the fiscal stimulus pack-ages, which were approved by the FederalCabinet in November 2008 and January2009, to take effect. Nevertheless, these im-pulses will fall a long way short of compen-sating for the losses expected in export busi-ness in the short run, even given optimisticassumptions regarding their multiplier effects.

56Government measures to support demand
can therefore only aim to prevent an intensifi-cation of the downward pressure emanatingfrom external trade, thereby affecting domes-tic demand on a broad front and prolongingthe underlying recessionary trend. The crucialfactor for a successful discretionary fiscal pol-icy is ultimately not just the volume of fund-ing provided, but also its impact on the for-mation of enterprises’ and consumers’ ex-pectations with the assessment of the long-term sustainability of government budgetsplaying a key role.
The first quarter of 2009 will be characterised
by further sharp cut-backs in output, how-ever. In industry, it is especially noticeable thata number of those enterprises particularly af-fected by the lull in orders not only extendedtheir usual plant shutdowns over the Christ-mas holiday period well into January, but alsoannounced additional production stoppagesduring the first quarter of 2009. This was duemainly to the fact that demand conditionsworsened significantly during the periodunder review. First, the downward trend innew orders accelerated markedly in thefourth quarter, declining by more than 15%on the quarter (seasonally adjusted) duringthe reporting period, compared with an aver-age of just under 3% in the preceding threequarters. Second, the manufacturing sector’scurrent assessment of its order situation isworse than it has been at any time for15 years. In addition, the surveyed firms re-ported that – measured in terms of produc-tion time – there has been a marked reduc-tion in the volume of orders still to be pro-cessed and that the lack of orders is the main
reason for the hold-ups in production.
It was probably not only the persistently cold
winter weather which adversely affected con-struction at the beginning of the year; theorder situation is also to be regarded as un-favourable at present. Commercial and indus-trial construction is becoming an increasinglydetrimental factor for the construction sector.In October and November – more recent dataare unavailable at present – a seasonally ad-justed 5
1/C252% fewer orders for, say, production
facilities and office buildings were placed onaverage than in the third quarter. While hous-ing construction recorded moderate growthin new orders in October and November,orders placed by public authorities, with a de-cline of more than 10%, were very weak inthis period. The fact that state and local gov-ernment postponed the implementation ofcertain infrastructure projects, with a view toa possible assumption of some of the costs bycentral government as part of the economicstimulus packages, may also have played apart in this.
In line with the economic situation, enter-
prises’ and households’ sentiment was at avery depressed level at the beginning of theyear. According to the survey results of the IfoInstitute, short-term output and export ex-pectations were deteriorating further up tothe end of the reporting period. The surveysconducted among households by the con-sumer research institution Gesellschaft f/C252r
Konsumforschung (GfK) also indicated in-

57improvements apparent in the business ex-
pectations of trade and industry for the com-ing six months and in households’ propensityto purchase, can be seen in connection withthe various government measures to supportthe economy, but do not per se point to the
emergence of an endogenously sustained re-covery. This probably also reflects the fact, forexample, that, owing to the environment pre-mium granted to encourage motorists toscrap old passenger vehicles, private motorvehicle owners are increasingly consideringthe purchase of a new vehicle and that, seenin this light, the short-term outlook for themotor vehicle industry and suppliers is nolonger quite as unfavourable as before.
The funds earmarked for public sector invest-
ment in infrastructure within the federal gov-ernment’s two economic stimulus packageswill provide the construction sector, in par-ticular, with a perceptible boost. The depth ofthe recession will crucially depend on howwell private consumption can perform a sta-bilising function. The higher level of employ-ment and the rather substantial wage gainsover the past few years have significantly im-proved the income situation of households.This, however, has had no dramatic impacton private consumption, as, initially, the sharpincrease in VAT, followed by the sudden risein energy and food prices, severely restrictedthe scope of real earnings. The price climatehas improved substantially since the autumnof last year. In the fourth quarter of 2008, thereduction in the cost of fuel alone providedbudget relief of some 32 billion on the quar-
ter. The alleviating effect in the case of heat-ing costs is not likely to take full effect until aDemand for industrial goods

58later date, as there is usually a time lag before
gas prices are brought into line with thelower prices of crude oil and many persons inrented accommodation will probably have tomake additional payments in the comingmonths for the billing period of 2008. Fur-thermore, owing to major fiscal measuresand effects, households’ disposable incomewill rise by an estimated total of 314 billion
this year. The main factor in this will be thetax cuts agreed as part of the second eco-nomic stimulus package, the increase in childbenefit allowance in 2009, the one-off childbonus and the reintroduction of the originaltax treatment of the commuter allowance.The extension of the maximum period of en-titlement to short-time working benefits, theextension of this arrangement to cover tem-
porary employment agencies, and the halvingof the social security contributions to be paidby the employer in the event of short-timeworking will make it easier for enterprises toadjust labour volume in response to economicconditions without having to resort to large-scale redundancies. This de facto also extends
the length of time benefits are paid, as un-employment benefits can be claimed in theevent of redundancy following short-timeworking. What seems more important atpresent, however, is that this measure re-duces the individual risk of job loss, thus miti-gating one factor that usually has a negativeimpact on private consumption.

59Public financesGeneral government budget
The general government budget position was
largely balanced in 2008. According to provi-sional data from the Federal Statistical Office,the deficit ratio decreased further to 0.1%,after falling to 0.2% in 2007. This marginaldecline was due partly to the buoyant cyclicalmomentum in the first quarter and the econ-omy’s growth profile, which was relatively fa-vourable for public finances. The structuralbalance (ie adjusted for cyclical and tempor-ary effects), like the unadjusted balance, im-proved slightly. Revenue shortfalls owing tocuts in taxes and social contributions wereoffset by a further steep rise in receipts fromprofit-related taxes, which are subject tolarge fluctuations (see the box on pages 60and 61). The Maastricht debt ratio may haveincreased again in 2008 – after falling to65.1% in 2007 – owing to the measurestaken to stabilise the financial sector. How-ever, no official figures are yet available and,notably, it has not yet been decided how indi-vidual support measures for financial institu-tions will be booked.

In 2008, general government revenue amount-ed to just under 44% of gross domestic prod-uct (GDP). The ratio thus hardly fell at all onthe year even though, on balance, the fiscalmeasures taken led to a considerable declinein revenue. This was due mainly to the factthat the revenue development for profit-related taxes remained exceptionally positive.Thus, despite the revenue losses in the wake

60Deutsche BundesbankThe structural development of public finances –
results of the disaggregated framework for 2008
The general government deficit in Germany changed
very little over the past year. According to provisionaldata from the Federal Statistical Office from January2009, a balanced general government budgetary position(as defined in the national accounts) was very nearlyachieved with a deficit of 0.1% of GDP, following a slight-ly higher deficit ratio of 0.2% in 2007. Using the disag-gregated framework for analysing public finances

possible to estimate the role played by cyclical and specif-ic temporary effects. Structural changes in the revenueand expenditure ratios and their major determinants canalso be identified. The main results of this analysis for2008 are presented below.
2
The marginal decline of 0.1 percentage point (pp) in theunadjusted deficit ratio over the past year was favoured
by cyclical developments. Applying the standard adjust-ment procedure used within the European System ofCentral Banks, a positive impact of 0.2 pp resulted fromthe very buoyant economic momentum at the start ofthe year and the growth structure, which was advanta-geous for public finances. However, clearly identifiabletemporary specific effects increased the deficit by 0.2 ppas tax refunds resulting from the Federal ConstitutionalCourt’s ruling reinstating the commuting allowance werealready recorded in the national accounts in 2008, thusreducing revenue. Expenditure associated with the sup-port measures for financial institutions (0.3 pp) is not in-cluded in the temporary specific effects here (and, more-over, also occurred on a similar scale in 2007, meaningthat the year-on-year change was minimal). The struc-tural fiscal balance as defined in the disaggregatedframework – which is adjusted for cyclical and temporaryeffects – improved by 0.1 pp in relation to trend GDP.
While the unadjusted revenue ratio decreased marginal-
ly, structural revenue grew slightly in relation to nominaltrend GDP (0.2 pp). The ratio was boosted slightly by thefact that the (as usual) positive fiscal drag resulting fromthe progressive structure of income tax outweighed thenegative impact in the case of excise taxes, which arelargely volume-based (+0.1 pp overall). The positive struc-tural decoupling of the macroeconomic assessment bases
from the development of GDP had a similar effect (+0.1pp). By contrast, legislative changes caused a reduction inthe ratio. This was due mainly to the further lowering ofthe Federal Employment Agency’s contribution rate by0.9 pp to 3.3% and the loss of revenue associated withthe business tax reform. Legislative changes, including anumber of quantitatively less significant measures, led tonet revenue losses of 0.5% of trend GDP.
Taken together, the three factors mentioned above (fiscal
drag, the structural decoupling of the macroeconomicreference variables from GDP and legislative changes)cause a reduction in the structural revenue ratio. Theoverall increase in this ratio is attributable to the part re-maining unexplained in the standardised procedure (re-sidual), which amounted to 0.4 pp. The residual is largelydue to the fact that, as in previous years, revenue fromprofit-related taxes grew at a faster pace than was to beexpected given the development of entrepreneurial andinvestment income (which serves as the macroeconomicreference variable for these taxes in the disaggregatedframework) and legislative changes. This may be partlyattributable to the fact that large tax prepayments coin-cided with high net backpayments for earlier years.A fundamental problem is also posed by the fact that thereference variable taken from the national accounts doesnot adequately capture fluctuations in the actual taxbase.
The structural expenditure ratio did not change in 2008,
whereas the unadjusted ratio decreased by 0.2 pp. Thiswas due to adjustment for the noticeable cyclicallyinduced reduction in labour market expenditure. Thisbrought to an end the long phase of continually decreas-ing structural expenditure ratios which began in 2001.The interest expenditure ratio remained at the same levelas in 2007. It is not yet possible to conclusively evaluatethe influence of the change in the debt-to-GDP ratio andthe average interest rate as official figures on the debtlevel at the end of 2008 are still to be released. The struc-tural ratio of other expenditure (primary expenditure)

previous years, expenditure on old-age pensions pusheddown the ratio since the annual average increase in pen-sions amounted to less than 1% and the number of pen-sions barely grew. Capital transfers also reduced theratio, caused in no small part by the fact that grants tohomebuyers are gradually being phased out. On theother hand, these were counterbalanced by high growthrates in government healthcare spending, public invest-ment and intermediate consumption which per se tend-
ed to lift the ratio.Overall, it can be seen that in the past year, not only did
the deficit ratio itself remain largely unchanged but alsomost of the individual determinants showed littlechange. The ongoing favourable cyclical influence wascounterbalanced by certain negative temporary factors.With respect to the development of the structural deficitratio, legislative changes which had a negative effect onrevenue were outweighed by other influences, in par-ticular the renewed exceptional positive development inthe case of profit-related taxes.

62of the business tax reform and the tax re-
funds arising from the Federal ConstitutionalCourt’s ruling on the commuting allowance– which was already recorded in the nationalaccounts last year – overall tax receipts in-creased perceptibly. Revenue from social con-tributions also grew, although the cut in thecontribution rate of the Federal EmploymentAgency led to substantial revenue shortfalls,only around half of which were offset by therising contribution rates to the statutory
health and public long-term care insuranceschemes. With a rise of 2
1/C252%, expenditure
grew more robustly than in the precedingyears but in relation to GDP it declined againslightly to 44%. The fall in the expenditureratio was caused, most notably, by lower la-bour market-related spending owing to thefavourable labour market development andmoderate expenditure on old-age pensions.By contrast, government operating expend-iture and spending on investment and health-care increased sharply.
The general government deficit is likely to rise
sharply in 2009, although it should remainbelow 3% of GDP as things currently stand.One driving factor behind this is the markedslowdown in the economy. However, as thepattern of macroeconomic development islikely to be very favourable for public fi-nances, the downturn will have a smallernegative impact on the deficit in 2009 thanwould be expected given the prospective con-traction of nominal GDP . Both gross wagesand salaries – which are particularly relevantfor government revenue – and private con-sumption are expected to be more stablethan the level of GDP . Furthermore, the ex-tensive fiscal policy stimulus measures willpush up the deficit significantly. If they are im-plemented as planned, the stimulus packagesof November 2008 and January 2009 are like-ly to increase the deficit for 2009 by just over1% of GDP (see box on pages 64 and 65).Additional factors include the renewed cut inthe contribution rate of the Federal Employ-ment Agency, the increase in child benefitand the new arrangements for the remuner-General government

Moreover, rev-enue from profit-related taxes may fall sharp-ly after having reached an exceptionally highlevel in 2008. In addition, substantial budget-ary risks exist, particularly regarding the ex-tensive assistance measures for financial insti-tutions. There will be a very clear rise in thedebt ratio, which is likely to reach a newhigh.
At the end of January, the German govern-
ment presented an update to the stabilityprogramme of December 2008 as the eco-nomic outlook had deteriorated significantlyin the intervening period and a second fiscalstimulus package had meanwhile been ap-proved. According to this, the deficit ratio willrise to around 3% in 2009 and around 4% in2010, and is expected to fall back below the3% limit in 2011 and 2012 (see table onpage 66). All projections are currently subjectto particular uncertainty. For example, the ef-fects of the financial market crisis are difficultto gauge and substantial consolidation meas-ures which the Federal Government considersnecessary for the coming years are not yet in-cluded in the stability programme. Accordingto the Stability and Growth Pact, a deficitratio of over 3% can be justified during se-vere economic downturns and does not auto-matically trigger an excessive deficit proced-ure. However, the deficit must be temporaryand remain at least close to the referencevalue. The fact that most of the secondstimulus package will not have an impact on
the general government deficit until 2010 istherefore problematic. The Federal Govern-ment’s forecast predicts that Germany will ex-haust its original fiscal leeway.
Germany is currently experiencing an excep-
tionally pronounced and abrupt economicdownturn which is, moreover, being accom-panied by a crisis on the financial markets. Inthis exceptional situation, the decision not torely solely on the automatic stabilisers, as in anormal cyclical downturn, but also actively totake fiscal policy measures aimed at revivingthe economy is justifiable. With this aim inmind, the German government adopted twoeconomic stimulus packages of a consider-able joint magnitude in November 2008 andJanuary 2009. They could provide a notice-able boost to the economy as a whole in2009 and 2010 and thus mitigate the expect-ed marked economic downturn.
However, the problems associated with the
selected fiscal measures must likewise beborne in mind. For instance, ensuring the effi-cient use of government funds in connectionwith the planned rapid and sharp increasein government investment poses a particularchallenge. While the economic stimulus needsto take prompt effect, there is a danger withinvestments of this scale – which amount tono less than around half of the annual gov-ernment investment budget – that the add-itional expenditure will in part merely inflateprices. Overall, the measures must be select-ed and implemented on the basis of suitablecost-benefit analyses in order to ward off thedanger of wasting government resources.

64Deutsche BundesbankCentral government’s package of measures aimed at stabilising economic growth
The first fiscal stimulus package which was approved
by the Federal Cabinet on 5 November 2008 is likelyto amount to just under 54 billion in the current year
and somewhat more than 57 billion in 2010. In add-
ition to an increase in public investment the imple-mented measures consist, in particular, of a temporaryreintroduction of declining-balance depreciation formovable assets for a period of two years, an extensionof the tax deductions permitted for handicraft ser-vices and temporary exemption from motor vehicletax for new cars.
On 27 January, the Federal Cabinet adopted a further
set of measures to bolster economic growth, largelyspread across two years, which are expected to add astrain of around 550 billion to general government
budgets. According to the corresponding plans, ap-proximately two-fifths of this amount is to be allo-cated to this year’s budget. However, ultimately thiswill very much depend on the speed at which thelarge sums earmarked for infrastructural investmentare drawn down. In total, the measures of these twoeconomic stimulus programmes will cause the generalgovernment deficit to widen by around 1% of GDP inthe course of this year and by almost 1
1/C252% during
2010.1Since not all of these measures are of limited
duration, they will induce a structural deteriorationof the fiscal balance amounting to about
1/C252% of GDP
in the coming years.
Specifically, the second stimulus package comprises
the following measures.
Infrastructural investment
Funding in the total amount of 5171/C252billion has been
earmarked for the purpose of improving infrastruc-ture between now and the end of 2011. Central gov-ernment’s contribution to this comes to 514 billion. Of
this total, 510 billion will take the form of targeted fi-
nancial assistance for local and state government,which the federal states are expected to top up by a
third. While these funds are chiefly designed to helpimprove educational facilities, they will also be allo-cated to other forms of infrastructural investment, forexample in the area of transportation and informa-tion technology. Moreover, there are plans to tempor-arily simplify public procurement legislation in orderto accelerate planned investment activities.
Subsidies and sector-specific measures
One measure under this heading is the loan and guar-
antee programme, which on its own is aimed at mo-bilising an additional volume of guarantees in theamount of 5100 billion. The stimulus package also en-
courages the general support of research and devel-opment focused on small and medium-sized busi-nesses ( 51 billion) and the specific promotion of re-
search work devoted to future-viable means of trans-portation ( 5
1/C252billion). 511/C252billion, in the form of an
“environment bonus”, is to be used to encouragemotorists to scrap vehicles that are at least nine yearsold and buy a new or nearly new car with the aid of agovernment subsidy of 52,500. Complementary to
this, the already long planned reform of motor ve-hicle tax – incorporating a stronger link to CO
2emis-
sions and a complete transfer of the related tax rev-enue to central government in return for financialcompensation for state government – is scheduled tobe implemented from mid-2009. Taken together,these measures are expected to generate fiscal costsof53
1/C252billion this year and a further 52 billion next
year.
Tax policy measures
With a view to providing relief for taxpayers, income
tax rates are to be lowered in two stages, retroactivelyfrom January 2009 and then at the beginning of 2010.It is planned to increase the basic tax allowance (from

Agency as of 2009) and the tax shortfalls resulting from the Federal

58,004 starting in 2010) and to reduce the bottom tax
rate (from 15% to 14% with effect from 2009) as wellas to adjust the taxation schedule by raising the othertax brackets (by 5400 in 2009 and a further 5330 as of
2010). On account of this, central, state and local gov-ernment are likely to experience revenue losses of53 billion during the current year and shortfalls of
56 billion next year.
Cuts in social contributions
With effect from 1 July 2009, the portion of the uni-
form contribution rate of 15.5% to the new health in-surance fund which is financed equally by employerand employee is to be lowered by 0.6%. This is to beoffset by raising the Federal grant (in addition to thealready planned annual increments of 51.5 billion)
during the current year by just over 53 billion and by a
further 56
1/C252billion in 2010, thus making it possible to
reach the aspired maximum tax-financed grant of514 billion as early as 2012 and not in 2016, as original-
ly projected. The contribution rate to the Federal Em-ployment Agency will now be put back up from 2.8%to 3.0% not in mid-2010 but in early 2011 instead. Thiswill result in revenue shortfalls of just under 51 billion
next year. Central government loans are envisaged toprevent the contribution rate from being raised above3.0%. These loans do not have to be repaid until theFederal Employment Agency again posts a surplus.
Expansion of active labour-market policy
Over and above the agreed decision to extend the
maximum period of entitlement to short-time workingbenefits (from 12 to 18 months), the claiming of suchbenefits is to be made more attractive by halving theemployer’s share of social contributions payable dur-ing periods of short-time working both this year andnext year and exempting employers altogether fromtheir obligation to pay contributions if employees are
retrained. Furthermore, new training programmes areto be launched and a total of 5,000 additional jobs areto be created at job centres. Overall, this will burdencentral government and the Federal EmploymentAgency with costs in the region of 52
1/C252billion during
2009 and 53 billion in 2010. At just under 51/C252billion,
the costs of the additional jobs will be permanent.
Family-related measures
In 2009, the sum of 5100 will be paid for every child
that is entitled to child benefit and will reduce tax rev-enue accordingly. Within the framework of the basicallowance for job seekers (and correspondingly for re-cipients of social assistance) the standard child allow-ances for children aged between 6 and 13 are to betemporarily raised from 60% to 70% of the standardunemployment benefit II rate until the end of 2011.Overall, this is likely to lead to fiscal burdens of 52 bil-
lion this year and less than 5
1/C252billion in 2010 and 2011.
The total cost to central government of its expend-
iture on infrastructural investment, the promotion ofresearch and the introduction of an environmentbonus payment for cars is estimated at around 517 bil-
lion and is to be debited to the newly established “In-vestment and Repayment Fund”. The necessary bor-rowing (of 521 billion at most) to finance these meas-
ures (including interest payments) has thus been hivedoff from the central government budget. In order torepay this debt, from 2010 onwards, annual transfersare to be made from the central government budgetcorresponding to part of the revenue from the profitgenerated by the Bundesbank. This underscores boththe temporary nature of these measures and the needto repay the debt incurred. An actual repayment ofdebt will, however, require the Federal budget andeach of its off-budget special funds – and not just theInvestment and Repayment Fund – to achieve an ap-propriate improvement in the fiscal balance.
Constitutional Court’s ruling reinstating the standard travel allow-
ance for commuters are likewise classified as stimulus measures, thenthe financial burden for general government over 2009 and 2010 will
total almost 590 billion.

66Moreover, the follow-up costs must be taken
into consideration, too. Any attempt tosteer economic processes by means of a flurryof discretionary government interventions– whether through direct spending, tax bene-fits or guarantees – is always problematic.Special concessions for individual sectors andenterprises are always accompanied by distor-tions in market processes and can thereforebe justified only in the event of clearly identi-fiable market failure. In terms of the timing oftheir impact, it would have been macroeco-nomically more effective to focus the meas-ures more strongly on the immediately com-ing quarters. As it stands, some will not de-velop their full impact until the second half of2009, while others do not become fullyeffective until next year or even later. For in-stance, two-thirds of the additional centralgovernment expenditure arising from the ex-
tension of the Federal grant to health insur-ance institutions will only become effectiveafter 2010. Some of the measures will ultim-ately prove a lasting, rather than merely tem-porary strain on public finances.
However, past experience suggests that it is
simpler to achieve a consensus on increasingdebt financing than on subsequently consoli-dating public finances. This is attested by thefact that the national debt ratio has followedan expanding trend ever since the FederalRepublic of Germany was founded. In Ger-many, the consolidation of the past few yearshas created a certain amount of fiscal leewayfor increasing deficits – both automaticallyand actively – during the recession. However,there needs to be a realistic prospect of bring-Key data of the Federal Government’s updated stability programme

67ing the expected high deficits back down. In-
deed, maintaining confidence in the long-term sustainability of public budgets is a alsovital requirement for a successful discretion-ary fiscal stimulus policy.
The reform of the budgetary rules agreed by
the Federal Reform Commission II can makean important contribution in this respect, as italso anchors the European fiscal commit-ments more firmly and more consistentlythan before at a national level. A restrictionof the central government structural deficit tono more than 0.35% of GDP from 2016 is tobe enshrined in the German constitution anddeficits for the federal states are to be entirelyprohibited from 2020 onwards. A parliamen-tary decree will then be required for any ex-ceptions, which will be temporarily permittedonly in the event of a natural disaster or a se-vere economic crisis and will be subject to re-payment conditions. To assist the federalstates in achieving the deficit objectives,those with major budgetary difficulties are toreceive annual financial assistance subject tostrict conditions and on a temporary basis.The ongoing surveillance of budgetary pos-itions is to be intensified. Ultimately, it is im-perative – particularly in the case of the Fed-eral budget – to take concrete measures tomeet the foreseeable consolidation require-ments rather than making vague promises forthe distant future. When the economic situ-ation has returned to normal, it will thereforebe necessary to rapidly and substantiallyreduce the structural deficits.
The European budgetary rules are of crucial
importance for the stability of monetaryunion. They, too, require consolidation in the
medium term. However, they are flexibleenough to temporarily allow deficits exceed-ing, but close to, the 3% threshold in excep-tional circumstances. Nevertheless, in somemember states, the scope for an expansion-ary fiscal policy was significantly smaller thanin Germany, or even non-existent. In somecases, the deficits were not sufficiently re-duced in the past and the debt levels aretherefore very high. Some countries alreadyface substantial risk premiums for financinggovernment borrowing on the capital mar-kets. It is now essential to apply the Stabilityand Growth Pact as it was intended, not leastin order to credibly ensure the sustainabilityof public finances in the EU member states.To this end, binding undertakings should bemade to rapidly reduce the deficits oncethe economic situation improves until thebudgets are virtually balanced in structuralterms.

68was based. Year-on-year growth fell from
quarter to quarter, which was largely due tothe effect of various legislative changes oncash receipts. Thus the rise in revenue in thefirst quarter was amplified by the lingeringimpact of the VAT increase at the start of2007 and the perceptible decline in paymentsof grants to homeowners (which are deduct-ed from revenue), while reimbursements ofcorporation tax credits from the time before2001 had a negative impact in the secondhalf of the year.
3The shortfalls resulting from
the business tax reform are likewise likelyto have increasingly squeezed cash receiptsover the course of the year. By contrast, themacroeconomic downturn had only a rela-tively limited effect on revenue developmentduring 2008. Indeed, key tax variables de-veloped more favourably overall than GDP ,and the underlying dynamics of profit-related
taxes remained strong in net terms.
At 7
1/C252%, revenue from income-related taxes4
grew strongly in 2008, with receipts from
wage tax and profit-related taxes rising atsimilar rates. Significant factors in the rise inwage tax revenue were the increase in grosswages and salaries and the effects of tax pro-gression as well as the reduction in childbenefit payments, which are deducted fromcash receipts. Growth in assessed income taxwas particularly strong. In addition to the stillrather buoyant underlying dynamics, the de-clining payments for grants to homeowners(likewise deducted from cash receipts), whichare being phased out, and lower assessed in-come tax refunds to employees made a keycontribution to this development. Investmentincome tax payments (particularly on interestand dividend income) also rose substantially.By contrast, corporation tax revenue fellsharply; its development was weak even afterallowing for the disbursement of corporationtax credits and the (estimated) revenue short-falls resulting from the 2008 business tax re-form.

69tinued to have a positive effect on VAT revenue
due to its delayed impact on cash receipts.
The latest official tax estimate in November
2008 predicted a revenue increase of justunder 2
1/C252% for 2009. However, this estimate
is now outdated. In December, the FederalConstitutional Court ruled that the restric-tions on the standard travel allowance forcommuters that were introduced in 2007 areunconstitutional, so that the previous legalstatus quo now reapplies. As a result, the
Federal Government is expecting revenuelosses of 35
1/C252billion in 2009 ( 321/C252billion in
relation to one assessment year), added toshortfalls of 310
1/C252billion arising from new
legislative changes (primarily, the increase inchild benefit and the fiscal stimulus packages,see the box on pages 64 and 65). Moreover,the economic outlook has deteriorated con-
siderably.
6This is likely to cause a further high
single-digit billion loss, even though the pat-tern of macroeconomic growth is still con-sidered favourable for revenue development.In addition, there is a risk that receipts fromprofit-related taxes will decline sharply fromthe exceptionally high level reached in 2008.All in all, a noticeable fall in tax revenue is tobe expected for 2009.

70driven mainly by privatisation proceeds, the
Federal budget recorded a total deficit of justunder 312 billion for 2008. This was almost
3
1/C252billion below the budget estimate. Al-
though there were unscheduled expendituresamounting to just under 32
1/C252billion arising
from support provided to IKB Bank and a sub-sidy repayment ruling by the European Courtof Justice, as well as unforeseen additionalexpenditure of 31 billion on unemployment
benefit II and payments to parents, theseextra burdens were more than compensatedfor by lower-than-forecast spending, mainlyon interest payments, integration measuresfor the long-term unemployed, the FederalRailways Fund – which was able to finance it-self to a greater extent than foreseen throughasset realisations – and guarantees. Total rev-enue was likewise below the expected level;there were net shortfalls of 34 billion for pri-
vatisations. Nevertheless, this was largely off-set, notably by tax receipts, which – owing tolower transfers to the EU budget – exceededprojections by just under 31
1/C252billion, and by
a stronger inflow of funds from the EU andadministrative revenue amounting to almost31
1/C252billion.
The deficit was thus down by just under 33
billion on 2007. The fundamental progressmade in terms of fiscal consolidation is evengreater when account is taken of various spe-cial factors. For example, the temporary reliefprovided in 2007 by one-off proceeds fromthe securitisation of post office pension fundclaims dropped out of the year-on-year com-parison. In 2008, the Federal Governmenthad to transfer almost 36 billion of additional
resources to the fund and, following the tem-porary financial easing between 2005 and
2007, it will now incur ongoing additional ex-penditure on such transfers. The above-mentioned one-off extraordinary burdens in2008 cost around the same amount as thespecial transfer made to the Child Day-careEnhancement Fund in 2007. By contrast, theone-off proceeds from asset realisations were31 billion higher than in 2007. The overall
reduction in the deficit – adjusted for one-offeffects including asset realisations – came to38 billion. At an absolute level of 317 billion,
however, it was significantly above the un-adjusted figure. Thus, even given favourablemacroeconomic conditions for public finances,central government was still a long way fromachieving its medium-term aim of a virtuallybalanced budget.
The 2009 Federal budget, which the Bundes-
tag approved at the end of November, envis-aged a renewed rise in the deficit to 319 bil-
lion as a result of the slowdown in economicgrowth that was expected at the time, thefirst stimulus measures and lower privatisa-tion proceeds. Given the considerably lessfavourable course of macroeconomic devel-opment now forecast for the rest of this yearand further stabilisation measures, a supple-mentary budget was drawn up which envis-ages a Federal budget deficit of 337 billion.
Combined tax shortfalls of 311 billion will
ensue from new tax relief measures of justover 32 billion, revenue losses of just over
32
1/C252billion arising from the court ruling re-
instating the commuting allowance and justover 36 billion from the less favourable
macroeconomic assumptions. Furthermore, atotal of 37

71was budgeted for, which is required for an
additional grant to the new health insurancefund (just over 33 billion), in connection with
long-term unemployment (just over 32
1/C252bil-
lion) and for the utilisation of guarantees(31
1/C252billion), the appropriation volume of
which is also to be increased considerably.Further stabilisation measures totalling 317
billion, which will impact on expenditure by2011 at the latest, were allocated to thenewly established “Investment and Repay-ment Fund” (see box on pages 64 and 65).The debt accumulated by this fund is to beredeemed out of part of the Bundesbank’sprofit distributions. Despite this spin-off offinancial burdens from the main budget, cen-tral government will now not manage toachieve a balanced budget by 2011, as wasstill its avowed intention in the third quarterof 2008. This is due to the deterioratingmacroeconomic setting and also the stabilisa-tion measures, most of which will place astrain on the Federal budget beyond 2010.
In order to ensure long-term sustainability
and prevent a loss of confidence in the lightof permanently higher burdens, there ap-pears to be a pressing need to achievebudgetary consolidation in the medium term.It should be noted in this context that in2008, too, the Federal budget was still a longway from achieving the underlying objectiveof a close-to-balance structural position, andthat now additional burdens are arising frommeasures taken to stabilise the financial mar-kets and bolster the economy which are notjust temporary but will also make themselvesfelt in the medium and longer term. The Fed-eral Reform Commission II’s recent decision todefine a strict constitutional borrowing limit is
an important step towards safeguarding thekey fiscal policy objective of a consolidatedFederal budget. However, this proclaimedaim must be backed up by concrete actiononce the economy begins to revive.
The deficit of central government’s off-
budget entities is likely to have almost trebledin 2008 to 36 billion. This was chiefly attribut-
able to the Special Fund for Financial MarketStabilisation (SoFFin), which was set up in thefourth quarter of 2008 with a borrowingauthorisation of up to 3100 billion until the
end of 2009. It ran up a deficit of 38 billion as
a result of the first outflows intended to topup banks’ capital. Furthermore, the surpluswhich the Child Day-care Enhancement Fundrecorded in 2007 thanks to the one-off allo-Central government fiscal

72cation of resources in the amount of 32 bil-
lion by central government dropped out ofthe year-on-year comparison. By contrast, thePost Office Pension Fund is likely to haveposted a small surplus in 2008 comparedwith a deficit of 34
1/C252billion in 2007. Once
this subsidiary budget’s reserves stemmingfrom the securitisation of claims had beenused up in 2007 and regular inflows from thepostal services’ successor enterprises were nolonger available to finance payments, it fell tocentral government to provide all pensionbenefits for retired civil servants previouslyemployed by the post office. The RedemptionFund for Inherited Liabilities was able toslightly increase its surplus as a result of theBundesbank’s profit being somewhat higher.
7
The deficit of the subsidiary budgets is ex-pected to balloon in 2009. As a precautionarymeasure, central government has earmarkeda borrowing requirement of 360 billion for
the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund in itsbond issuance calendar. In addition, a deficitis envisaged for the Investment and Repay-ment Fund in connection with measures tosupport the economy which could reach 310
billion if there is a rapid outflow of funds.
State government budgets
8
State government’s budgetary position was
considerably less favourable in the fourthquarter of 2008 than it had been one yearpreviously (- 36
1/C252billion, compared with - 311/C252
billion in 2007). This was mainly due to the
recapitalisation of the Bavarian state bankBayern LB.
9Nevertheless, a small surplus of
just over 31/C252billion was achieved in 2008 as a
whole (compared with 33 billion in 200710).Excluding the one-off effect of Bayern LB, the
fiscal balance improved slightly on the year,and the similarly adjusted deficit target ( 36
1/C252
billion) was likewise clearly undershot. Over-
all, once again half of the federal states didnot record a deficit. However, revenue grewby barely 3% in the wake of the recent dis-tinct fall-off in tax receipts. At just over 3
1/C252%,
expenditure rose somewhat more stronglyowing to the above-mentioned recapitalisa-tion measure. Even so, transfers to local gov-ernment, which are generally linked to thelevel of tax revenue generated by state gov-ernment, apparently also rose substantially,while the key item of personnel expendituregrew only moderately (+1%) despite adjust-ments in negotiated pay rates for salariedstaff and for civil servants’ pay and pensions.
By contrast, a high state government deficit,
in terms of actual cash flow, is forecast for2009. Alongside the recession, another con-tributory factor is expected to be the recapit-alisation of the state banks (Landesbanken),including, in particular, the second trancheof37 billion for Bayern LB. Furthermore, in
addition to its own special investment pro-
7It is likely that at the end of the year the Redemption
Fund for Inherited Liabilities no longer recorded any debt
of its own and can thus be dissolved. However, the bulk
of its debt was not actually repaid in net terms but was
rather merely replaced (refinanced) by (new) central gov-
ernment debt.
8The development of local government finances was
analysed in greater detail in the short articles in the Bun-
desbank Monthly Report of January 2009.
9In December, in its second supplementary budget for
2008, the Free State of Bavaria approved support meas-
ures for Bayern LB. These include, in particular, a capital
injection of 310 billion; the initial tranche in the amount
of33 billion was paid out in 2008.
10The monthly statistics of the government cash offices,
which are used here, are based on the core budgets and
thus notably exclude Berlin’s proceeds of 341/C252billion
from the sale of its Landesbank in 2007.Renewed

73grammes, state government is also taking
part in central government’s recent invest-ment programme of 310 billion with a further
33
1/C252billion. However, probably only a smaller
part of this will come out of the 2009 budget.Further burdens will arise from the two fiscalstimulus packages ( 33 billion in total) – in-
cluding, in particular, the revenue shortfallsassociated with the changes in income tax –as well as the court ruling reinstating thecommuting allowance ( 32
1/C252billion). Should
the high 2008 pay settlement agreed for cen-tral and local government salaried staff belargely adopted by state government with atime-lag and, as in the case of central govern-ment, be applied to civil servants and civil ser-vant pensioners as well, in its entirety, thiswould imply considerable additional burdensof up to 38 billion for state government
budgets. Given only moderate macroeco-nomic growth prospects and further, in partpermanent, burdens resulting from the recentstabilisation measures, it is likely that in 2010the deficits will, at best, decrease moderately,provided that the Landesbanken do not re-ceive any further injections of capital. Theplan to set an effective constitutional borrow-ing limit for state government, too, from2020 could make an important contributionto preventing this budgetary situation frombecoming entrenched and thus to creatinglong-term financial flexibility. From 2011, sub-ject to strict conditions, it is planned to sup-port the heavily indebted federal states ofBerlin, Bremen, Saarland, Saxony-Anhalt andSchleswig-Holstein over a period of nineyears with consolidation assistance totalling30.8 billion per year. However, a shorter tran-
sitional period before the new debt rule com-pletely enters into force would have been de-
sirable for state government, particularly alsogiven the foreseeable sharp rise in the civilservant pension burden.

Statutory pension insurance scheme
In 2008, the statutory pension insurance
scheme recorded a surplus of just over 331/C252
billion, compared with a little more than 31
billion one year previously. The reserves wentup by 34 billion to 316 billion. This is equiva-
lent to around one month’s expenditure.
12
Overall, revenue rose by 21/C252%. This was
mainly due to the strong growth in compul-sory contributions (+4%), which reflects thefavourable development of the labour marketand also higher wage and salary increasescompared with previous years. Contributionsfor recipients of unemployment benefits fellby 13%. However, as the relative weight ofthese contributions is now very low, total rev-enue was only slightly impaired. Transfersfrom the central government budget ex-ceeded their prior-year figure by only
1/C252%. At
11The financial development of the statutory health and
long-term care insurance schemes in the third quarter of
2008 was analysed in the short articles of the Monthly
Report of December 2008. These are the most recent
data available.
12The increase in the reserves exceeds the surplus, in
particular, because the liquidity situation has been im-
proving from year to year as a result of paying new pen-
sions since April 2004 at the end of the current month
instead of at the end of the previous month. The con-
stant replacement of old pensions with new pensions
means that the liquidity situation of the statutory pension
insurance scheme is thus continually improving. By con-
trast, the budget outturn records pension expenditure ac-
cording to the accruals-based accounting method, which
is not affected by this changeover.Higher surplus

7411/C252%, the increase in expenditure was again
noticeably lower than revenue growth. Pen-sion expenditure, which is by far the largestcost item, went up by just over 1%. The pen-sion increase amounted to 0.54% for the firsthalf of the year and 1.1% for the second half.The number of pensions rose by less than
1/C252% as the population is currently ageing at a
fairly moderate pace. At 3%, health insur-ance contributions for pensioners attributableto the statutory pension insurance scheme in-creased more sharply. Further contributionrate increases on the part of individual healthinsurance institutions contributed to this.
In 2009, the statutory pension insurance
scheme will record a noticeably less favour-able result. The surplus of just over 32
1/C252bil-
lion which was forecast in the 2008 PensionInsurance Report was based on the Federal
Government’s macroeconomic assumptionsfrom October 2008.
13As things currently
stand, a significantly lower surplus is to be ex-pected. Revenue growth is again likely to lagbehind the rise in expenditure. A contributoryfactor to this will be the comparatively highmid-2009 pension increase, estimated at2
1/C252%, which is based on the strong wage
growth in 2008. As its reserves were toppedup previously, the statutory pension insurancescheme can make a contribution to automat-ic stabilisation.
Federal Employment AgencyAlthough, viewed in isolation, the Federal
Employment Agency recorded a deficit of justover 31 billion in 2008 compared with a sur-
plus of 36
1/C252billion one year previously, this
was accompanied by a surplus in the amountof just over 32
1/C252billion posted by the new
dedicated pension fund for civil servants em-ployed by the Federal Employment Agency. Inconsolidated terms, therefore, the FederalEmployment Agency and its civil servant pen-sion fund recorded a combined surplus of31
1/C252billion. A major factor in the financial
deterioration was the lowering of the Agen-cy’s contribution rate from 4.2% to 3.3%.Per se this caused revenue shortfalls of just
over 37 billion. However, in actual fact, the
inflow of contributions fell by less than 36 bil-Finances of the

13While the 2008 Pension Insurance Report’s calcula-
tions for 2009 were based on growth in total gross
wages and salaries of 2.7%, in its 2009 Annual Economic
Report, the Federal Government assumes growth of only
1.2%. If additional revenue paid on behalf of un-
employed persons is counterbalanced against this, the
new assumptions are likely to result in a decrease in in-

75lion because employment and earnings in-
creased relatively sharply. Without the lower-ing of the contribution rate, it would havegrown by 4
1/C252%. Furthermore, the reinte-
gration payment to central government, viawhich the Federal Employment Agency has tobear half of central government expenditureon the reintegration and administration ofunemployment benefit II recipients, exceededthe previous compensatory amount by 33 bil-
lion. However, particularly in the case of un-employment benefit, there were also consid-erable cost savings (- 33 billion), mainly be-
cause the number of recipients was 165,000lower on an annual average following thefavourable labour market development. Final-ly, the Federal grant, which is linked to turn-over tax revenue, was 31 billion higher than
in 2007 when the increase in the standardrate of VAT from 16% to 19% had not yetfully impacted on revenue. The Federal Em-ployment Agency’s reserves went up to atotal of 319
1/C252billion by the end of 2008.
However, just over 321/C252billion of this is ear-
marked for its civil servant pension fund,14
meaning that the level of resources availableto finance current expenditure has fallen tobelow 317 billion.
In 2009, the financial situation of the Federal
Employment Agency will deteriorate signifi-cantly. First, the contribution rate has beenlowered again to 2.8%. Second, expenditureon unemployment benefit and short-timeworking benefits, which is particularly sensi-tive to the business cycle, is expected to in-crease substantially as a result of the econom-ic slowdown. Third, much more will be spenton active labour market policy, not least inconnection with the measures envisaged in
the second economic stimulus package.Owing to these additional financial burdens,the reserves will be considerably depleted. Ifthe unfavourable development on the labourmarket continues into the coming year,Finances of the

76which, given its “lagged indicator” property
in the business cycle, is to be expected even ifthe economy quickly revives, the Federal Em-ployment Agency will have to rely on add-itional central government funds to financeits budget as early as 2010. This is also partlydue to the fact that the plan to put the contri-bution rate back up to 3.0%, which was pre-viously envisaged for mid-2010, has beenpostponed for six months. Intra-year liquidityassistance could be required already in 2009because the Federal grant is no longer trans-ferred in equal monthly amounts but is nowtransferred at the end of the year in one lumpsum. Since its own reserves are insufficient, infuture the Federal Employment Agency will
be reliant on central government loans inorder to maintain a stable contribution rate.However, it seems that there is a large riskthat the contribution rate of 3.0% will notsuffice to finance the Federal EmploymentAgency in the longer term and thus theAgency will struggle to repay the loans. Thereis therefore a danger that the Federal Em-ployment Agency’s budget will be structur-ally debt-financed (ie ultimately tax-financed),which as a matter of principle would only beappropriate to finance non-insurance-relatedbenefits.
