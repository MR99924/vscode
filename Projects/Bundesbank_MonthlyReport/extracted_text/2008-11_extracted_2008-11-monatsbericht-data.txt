6OverviewThe German economy under the impact
of the escalating crisis on the financial
markets and a worsening outlook for the
real economy
The prospects for the global economy have
deteriorated considerably, particularly as the
crisis on the financial markets has intensified
significantly since the third quarter; as 2008
draws to a close, the outlook is worse than it
has been in a long time. Though some relief
has been afforded by the notable easing of
price pressure on the commodities markets
and of consumer price inflation in recent
months, this will not be sufficient to notice-
ably brighten the dull real economic outlook
for the next few quarters. The full negative
impact on the goods and income cycle is not
expected to show up until next year. Up until
recently, the signs of trouble were mainly
confined to the industrialised countries, some
of which are now on the brink of a recession.
In recent months, however, emerging market
economies, too, have increasingly been feel-
ing the effects of the events unfolding on the
financial markets. In addition, they are facing
growing strains from an initial marked slow-
down in their exports to industrialised coun-
tries and from capital outflows.
The escalating crisis in the financial sector
since the summer was fuelled by the ongoing
weakness of the US real estate market, the
poor economic outlook and, notably, by
spiralling risk aversion following the insolv-
ency of a large US investment bank. Despite
declining yields on government bonds, finan-
cing conditions for enterprises on the capital
markets have worsened dramatically sinceGlobal

7the middle of 2008. Plummeting share prices
in industrialised countries and emerging mar-ket economies, a further decline in the pricesof risky assets and pronounced tensions onthe money markets have increased pressureon financial institutions. The foreign ex-change markets, in turn, were sucked intothe maelstrom and experienced considerablevolatility in the third quarter. As a conse-quence, the single European currency depre-ciated against the other major global curren-cies into November and, as this report wentto press, the trade-weighted value of theeuro was 8
1/C252% below the high it marked in
the second quarter. The difficulties in thefinancial system prompted numerous coun-tries to launch government rescue packagesfor individual institutions as well as broad-based aid measures for the financial sector asa whole. These measures, combined withcuts in short-term key interest rates in numer-ous countries, brought a degree of stabilityto the markets. However, the internationalfinancial system is now having to contendmore with the repercussions of the weakenedmacroeconomic environment.
Against this backdrop and given waning price
pressure, euro-area monetary policy waseased considerably in the fourth quarter. In aconcerted action with six other central banks,the Governing Council of the ECB lowered itsmain refinancing rate by
1/C252percentage point
to 3.75% on 8 October 2008. On 6 Novem-ber, it cut key interest rates further to 3.25%.In addition, temporary changes to the monet-ary policy framework were agreed. Thesechanges reflect the fact that the Eurosystemhas responded to the ongoing serious disrup-tion to the interbank market by de facto
taking the distribution of liquidity, which nor-mally takes place among credit institutionswithout the involvement of the central bank,into its own hands. This does not per se rep-
resent a change in the Eurosytem’s basicmonetary policy stance, but rather reflectsthe operational reaction to the evident dys-functionality of the unsecured money market.
In view of the current market turmoil, euro-
area banks have further tightened their creditstandards, according to the Bank LendingSurvey. However, there is no evidence yet ofbroad-based supply-side credit restrictions inthe euro area.
The rapid cooling of the global economy and
the fact that the underlying sentiment in Ger-many is increasingly characterised by cautionand restraint have progressively been weigh-ing on the German economy, too, since themiddle of 2008. According to the FederalStatistical Office’s flash estimate, seasonallyand calendar-adjusted real GDP in the thirdquarter was 0.5% down on the precedingthree months. While aggregate economicoutput grew almost at the same pace aspotential output in the first half of 2008on balance – excluding weather-related spe-cial factors – overall capacity utilisation subse-quently declined significantly. Manufacturing,which had previously benefited strongly fromthe positive overall economic development,was particularly hard hit by the dwindlingmomentum. This caused enterprises to beginrevising their investment and staffing plansdownwards. Averaged over all sectors, how-ever, the level of activity is likely to have

8remained within normal bounds. Neverthe-
less, another marked slackening of the dy-
namics appears likely in the fourth quarter.
There are no signs to date, however, of the
financial market crisis having a major damp-
ening effect on the German economy in the
form of restrictive lending by domestic banks,
even if the fairly strong credit growth seen in
the last few quarters has eased somewhat.
This was chiefly caused by slower growth in
loans to non-financial corporations and fur-
ther reduced lending to households. How-
ever, in Germany, as in the euro area as a
whole, the more moderate expansion of
loans to the private sector compared to pre-
vious quarters can probably be attributed
mainly to lower credit demand. While the
German banks participating in the Bank
Lending Survey did report tighter lending
conditions, the tightening was less pro-
nounced in Germany than in the euro area
overall. All in all, the more muted credit
growth in Germany can be attributed almost
entirely to traditional factors. To date the
financial market crisis is impacting Germany’s
real economy less as a result of restrained
bank lending than as a consequence of the
weaker external environment and a consider-
able deterioration in confidence.
The contribution of foreign trade noticeably
dampened GDP in the third quarter, as mar-
ginally declining export volumes coincided
with an above-average increase in imports.
One reason why the external sector has
ceased to be a driver of output since the
second quarter is the temporarily high inter-national co-movement of the cyclical con-
juncture.
The profound and persistent dislocations on
the international financial markets have, in
the meantime, cast a dark shadow over the
real economy in many countries. The German
economy, with its broad regional export
spread, will inevitably be clearly affected by
the resulting drop in demand in major sales
markets in the coming months, particularly as
domestic demand is not expected to yield any
noticeable positive impulses in the short
term.
Given the more muted sales prospects in the
international environment, exporting enter-
prises saw no immediate necessity to step up
their fixed capital formation. Besides this, in-
dustrial investment is likely to have reached
an advanced stage of the business cycle any-
way. This is evident inter alia from the fact
that the contribution which new machinery
and equipment as well as new factories and
office buildings made to value added in the
corporate sector in the first half of 2008
reached a level not exceeded at the peak of
the two previous investment cycles, ie shortly
after German reunification and in the year
2000.
Private consumption probably held up well in
the third quarter thanks to the abrupt turn-
around in the price of crude oil, the ongoing
positive evolution of the labour market and
higher wage growth. However, the poor
underlying trend in terms of real consumption
expenditure and the muted propensity to pur-

9chase would appear to indicate that the con-
sumer climate in Germany is still fragile.
Over time, however, the fact that in a number
of the countries worst affected by the finan-cial market crisis government support meas-ures for financial institutions have beenlaunched to prevent the turmoil from spread-ing and to rebuild confidence could have apositive effect. In addition, energy and com-modity prices have fallen steeply recently. Forexample, the seasonally adjusted price ofenergy imports dropped by more than 8%from June to September. The year-on-yearrise in inflation as measured by the consumerprice index declined from 3.3% in June to2.4% in October. Partly as a result of theongoing corrections on the internationalcommodities markets and positive baselineeffects, the rate of price increases is expectedto decline significantly further over the nextfew months, notwithstanding the euro’smarked depreciation against other major cur-rencies. The lower exchange rate of the eurois likely to have boosted German goods’ salesprospects.
Looking ahead to next year, the still very
robust labour market situation gives reasonto hope that the current slowdown of theGerman economy will not result in a self-reinforcing and entrenched downturn. Un-employment declined fairly steadily up untilthe end of October, and employment is ex-pected to have increased further up to Sep-tember. The fact that a lot of enterprises havedemonstrated their readiness to keep corestaffing levels unchanged in view of well-stocked working time accounts and the per-sistently acute shortage of skilled labour not
only supports households’ income situation,it also reduces the risk of job losses. It shouldbe remembered, however, that althoughfirms have a vested interest in maintaining astable core labour force, they can currentlymake any necessary adjustments fairly rapidlygiven increased levels of temporary hiringfrom employment agencies and fixed-termcontracts. Nonetheless, firms’ strategy of ini-tially not making – generally expensive – ad-justments to core staffing levels is particularlylikely to undergo a long-term change if thecost of safeguarding jobs increases. Con-tinued wage policy moderation will conse-quently not only protect the substantialachievements made on the labour market inrecent years, it will also limit the risk of pri-marily domestic downward pressure on theeconomy.
The public finance situation could undergo a
further slight improvement this year, despitethe overall economic downturn since thesecond quarter, and the general governmentbudget could post a surplus for the first timesince German reunification. One reason forthis is the positive cyclical momentum on anannual average following the economy’sstrong performance in the first quarter. How-ever, the public finance situation will probablydeteriorate noticeably in the coming year. In abaseline scenario, which includes recentlyagreed fiscal measures and a marked declinein profit-related taxes but excludes additionalspending in connection with governmentsupport measures for financial institutions,the deficit could reach sizeable proportions.

10Fiscal policymakers are currently making a
major contribution to steadying the level of
economic activity through the measures
aimed at stabilising the financial markets,
thus helping to avert the danger of a systemic
financial crisis in Germany, although this
intervention has not yet showed up in the
usual indicators measuring the expansiveness
of fiscal policy. In addition, the German gov-
ernment has responded to the economic
slowdown using a number of different instru-
ments assembled in a fiscal stabilisation pro-
gramme. While the planned measures could
provide a certain additional impetus, their
overall influence should not be overesti-
mated. The crucial importance of the past
achievements in the field of fiscal consoli-
dation for coping with hard times is currently
being vividly demonstrated. The fundamental
objective of achieving a structurally balanced
general government budget in the medium
term should therefore certainly not be aban-
doned despite the recent developments.
A solid foundation will allow the automatic
fiscal stabilisers to take full effect in the com-
ing period. If the economic situation proves
very unfavourable, further unexpected tax
shortfalls could initially also be absorbed.
Such an orientation of fiscal policy would ex-ploit the considerable potential for automatic
stabilisation. The fiscal consolidation achieved
in recent years means that Germany has a
certain radius of action without risking a
breach of the 3% deficit limit. Substantial
additional fiscal stabilisation programmes
might be warranted if an extraordinary reces-
sion were thought likely. In any case, any fur-
ther unfunded measures to boost the econ-
omy should be of very limited duration and
should avoid causing unnecessary distortions
of economic activity. In particular, substantial
growth losses could ensue in the longer term
in the event of a stampede to grant (sector-)
specific subsidies at national and international
levels, thereby distorting competition.
Given the tense current situation on the
financial markets and the dented underlying
sentiment in respect of the real economy, it
is particularly important that economic and
fiscal policymakers do not jeopardise the
foundations for sustainable growth and em-
ployment gains as well as sound public
finances by providing wrong incentives with
longer-term implications in implementing the
measures aimed at overcoming the crisis in
the short term.

11Global and European
settingWorld economic activity
The crisis of confidence in the financial mar-
kets has intensified even further since mid-
September. The heart of the crisis was again
in the United States, where the upheaval had
begun last year following the collapse of the
sub-prime mortgage market. Consequently,
the outlook for the world economy has con-
tinued to deteriorate significantly; as 2008
draws to a close, it is worse than it has been
in a long time. Of the various transmission
channels via which the disruptions to the
financial system are passed on to the real
economy, the tightening of financing con-
ditions for enterprises and households and
negative wealth effects seem to be to most
significant. Expectations in the private sector
have now also deteriorated sharply.
The negative effects on the goods and in-
come cycle, which are not expected to be-
come fully apparent until next year, are still
mainly being felt in the industrial countries,
some of which are now on the brink of a re-
cession. The fact that price pressure on the
commodity markets – and consequently also
at the consumer level – has eased consider-
ably in the past few months provided some
relief. This has made it easier for central
banks, above all in the industrial countries, to
cut interest rates significantly and further
broaden their use of liquidity policy instru-
ments. Extensive government measures for
recapitalising the ailing banking system have
now been taken and coordinating agree-
ments have been made at the euro-area and
international levels.World economy

12In recent months, emerging market econ-
omies, including some central and eastern
European countries, have been more severely
affected by the events unfolding on the
financial markets. Stock market prices have
fallen dramatically, interest rate premiums
– even for government bonds – have risen
significantly and the currencies of many
emerging market economies faced down-
ward pressure owing to capital outflows. In
addition, the looming marked deceleration of
exports from the emerging market economies
to industrial countries and, in many cases, the
substantial cyclically induced adjustment in
the prices of crude oil and other commodities
are increasingly having a negative impact.
As early as the summer – before the most
recent intensification of the financial crisis –
the slackening effects on the global economy
had gained the upper hand. These were
caused, first, by earlier financial sector mal-
functions and the severe pressure to adjust in
real estate markets in the USA and some
European countries. Second, global inflation,
which had initially continued to accelerate
from mid-year onwards, dampened global
growth in two ways: through the loss of con-
sumers’ purchasing power and concerns
about a sustained fall in future real income.
Against this backdrop, some central banks,
particularly in the emerging market econ-
omies, raised interest rates in order to coun-
teract the considerable increase in price
pressures and unfavourable inflation expect-
ations. However, real interest rates remained
relatively low – in some cases, they were even
negative.Seasonally adjusted,

13In the industrial countries, economic activity
slowed quite substantially in the third quarter.Real gross domestic product (GDP) declinedsomewhat in the United States following asharp rise – driven by the extensive stimuluspackage and foreign trade – in the spring.In Japan, economic activity remained on adownward course. The British economy con-tracted for the first time since the early1990s. Growth in the euro area was likewisedown on the depressed level of the precedingquarter. In the third quarter, real GDP in theindustrial countries overall fell to
1/C254% below
its level in the second quarter, in which it hadgrown somewhat. However, it was up by only
1/C252% on the level of the third quarter of 2007.
Together with the – in some cases – consider-
able inflation-related real income losses, thenegative trend in the developed economiesalso further dampened the pace of growth inthe emerging market economies (EMEs).However, year-on-year growth in overall out-put is still likely to have been rather high. Inmost emerging market economies in southand east Asia, industrial activity in particularbecame noticeably more subdued from mid-year onwards. This is especially true of India,Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. In thecase of China, the scaling back or suspensionof production by many industrial firms nearsporting venues – above all, in and aroundBeijing – during the Olympic Games in orderto improve the air quality was also significant.Year-on-year GDP growth fell by 1 percent-age point to 9% compared with the secondquarter. Private consumption was a majormainstay of economic growth and was boost-ed by the decline in inflation (4.0% in Octo-ber, compared with 7.1% in June). For the
current quarter, there are indications of a fur-ther slowdown owing primarily to the weakertrend in export demand.
In Latin America, the economic picture be-
came less uniform in the summer months.Seasonally adjusted industrial output in Brazilgrew again perceptibly (+2
3/C254%) from its level
of the second quarter and was up by 63/C254%
on the year. By contrast, the economic situ-ation in Mexico deteriorated further frommid-year onwards. This can be explainedlargely by reduced exports of goods to theUnited States and the downward trend inworkers’ remittances, which has been evidentfor some time. In addition, unlike in otheremerging market economies, consumer priceinflation has not fallen in recent months; at5.8%, the rate in October was even higherthan in the June-July period. In many LatinAmerican countries, the retarding effects arelikely to continue to gain strength in thefourth quarter owing mainly to a significantreduction in receipts from commodity exportsand the further tightening of lending condi-tions.
Around mid-year, the economies of the Com-
monwealth of Independent States (CIS) werestill growing at a rapid pace. Subsequently,however, the negative effects of the financialcrisis on the real economy became increasing-ly apparent, primarily in Russia and Ukraine,the two countries that were hit hardest. InRussia, the year-on-year rise in car sales hasnow slowed considerably owing to more diffi-cult loan financing and a loss of consumerconfidence. Furthermore, persistently high in-... with

14flation (14.2% in October) continued to place
a strain on households’ real income. Econom-
ic activity in the Caucasus was additionally
impaired by the Georgian conflict and the re-
sulting blockade of ports on the Black Sea.
For the current quarter, there are increasing
signs that economic growth in the CIS will
weaken again perceptibly in the wake of the
financial crisis and falling revenue from ex-
ports of energy sources and other commod-
ities.
In November, the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) again significantly lowered its
global growth projection; compared with the
beginning of October, the projection for 2008
was down 0.2 percentage point to 3.7% and
that for 2009 was down 0.8 percentage
point to 2.2%. The forecast for the advanced
economies was down by around the same
amount to 1.4% for 2008 and -0.3% for
2009. In its updated autumn forecast, the
IMF expects GDP to fall by 0.7% in the USA
and by 0.5% in the euro area. For the United
Kingdom, a decline of as much as 1.3% is
predicted. In the case of Japan, the IMF now
estimates that overall economic output will
decrease by 0.2%. Of the G7 states, only
Canada is expected to experience marginal
growth (+0.3%).
The forecast for the emerging market econ-
omies and the developing countries was
lowered by 0.3 percentage point to 6.6% for
2008 and by 1 percentage point to 5.1% for
2009. This reflects below-average corrections
for the south and east Asian emerging mar-
ket economies and Latin America, while the
projections for the African countries and theCommonwealth of Independent States were
reduced comparatively sharply. The IMF pre-
dicts that, at 3.5%, growth in Russia in 2009
will be 2 percentage points lower than previ-
ously forecast. In the central and east Euro-
pean countries – most of which are members
of the European Union – the pace of growth
is expected to slow from 5.7% in 2007 to
4.2% this year and 2.5% in the next. The
forecast for world trade growth in 2009 was
lowered dramatically by 2 percentage points
to 2.1%. Consumer price inflation in the ad-
vanced economies as well as in the bloc of
emerging market economies and developing
countries is expected to weaken by well over
2 percentage points in 2009 to 1.4% and
7.1%, respectively. The IMF forecasts a pre-
ponderance of downside risks, the most sig-
nificant of which will originate in the financial
markets.
The global improvement in the outlook for
prices is intrinsically linked to the decline in
commodity prices, which began around mid-
year and has continued throughout the re-
porting period. Following the peak in July
(US$1461/C252), the price of Brent crude oil fell
by almost two-thirds to US$533/C254in mid-
November. In euro terms, the decrease was
somewhat smaller (-54%) owing to depreci-
ation. The decline in crude oil prices was not
steady and was interrupted in mid-Septem-
ber, mainly because considerable hurricane
damage temporarily impaired oil production
in the Gulf of Mexico. From the beginning of
October, when fears of a recession increased
significantly, oil prices again began to decline
more dramatically; OPEC’s decision at the end
of October to cut production quotas failed toRevised IMF

15bring the decline to a halt. The fall in prices
for industrial raw materials also gained pacefrom the beginning of October; they werejust over one-third lower in mid-Novemberthan in July. Prices for food, drinks and to-bacco traded on the world markets wentdown by a similar amount during this period.
Owing to the decline in prices for crude oil
and other commodities, price pressures haveeased perceptibly over the past few months;seasonally adjusted consumer prices have fall-en again moderately following a sharp rise inthe May-July period. The annual rate of infla-tion in the industrial countries decreasedfrom 4.6% in July to 4.3% in September.A further decline seems likely for October andNovember. However, core inflation (exclud-ing energy and food), at 2.3% in Septem-ber compared with 2.4% in August, barelybudged.
Shortly after mid-year, it became apparent
that the stimulus package launched by the USgovernment in the spring had not succeededin bringing lasting stability to the US econ-omy. According to the initial estimate, realGDP in the third quarter fell marginally afterseasonal adjustment compared with thesecond quarter, in which it had grown robust-ly. It rose by just
3/C254% on the year. The weak
outcome was mainly attributable to the factthat real private consumption contracted forthe first time since 1991. This was due, first,to the fact that the available nominal incomewas 1% below the second-quarter level,which had been boosted considerably by taxrefunds. The sustained fall in employmentalso played a role in this respect. From June toOctober, the number of (non-farm) jobs de-
clined by around 720,000 (
1/C252%) after season-
al adjustment. The unemployment rate in-creased by 1 percentage point to 6.5%. Fur-thermore, households faced further losses inpurchasing power from mid-year onwards asa result of the sharp rise in energy and foodprices. Although the household saving ratio,which had increased considerably to 2.7% inthe second quarter owing to tax refundsgranted as part of the US government’sstimulus package, decreased again signifi-cantly as expected, it remained, at 1.3%,considerably higher than in the final quarterof 2007 and the first quarter of 2008.

16economic output. It was more than 40%
lower than the peak at the end of 2005.
Commercial spending on new plant and
equipment and buildings was cut by1/C254%. By
contrast, a sharp increase in real government
expenditure and a deceleration in the deple-
tion of inventories helped to boost domestic
demand. The decline in domestic demand
coincided with a further reduction of imports.
However, exports remained on an upward
curve in the third quarter; foreign trade thus
contributed1/C254percentage point to growth
overall.
In the third quarter, the annual rate of infla-
tion increased by just under 1 percentage
point to 5.3%. It reached a cyclical peak of
5.6% in July and declined over the following
months to 4.9% in September owing to fall-
ing crude oil prices. Excluding energy and
food, inflation stood at 2.5% as this report
went to press. The core Personal Consump-
tion Expenditure deflator, the US Federal
Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation in its
price analyses, decreased to 2.4%.
The Japanese economy contracted again
– albeit marginally – in the third quarter after
seasonal adjustment following a considerable
decline in the second quarter (-1%). Real GDP
was likewise down somewhat on the year.
The weak outcome was primarily attributable
to a sustained reduction in corporate invest-
ment of a seasonally adjusted 13/C254% com-
pared with the second quarter. Somewhat
more buoyant private consumption, a signifi-
cant increase in housing construction and
higher government investment expenditure
sustained domestic demand at the level ofthe previous quarter. In price-adjusted terms,
foreign trade had a marked negative impact
of1/C254% of GDP . Although exports still grew by
3/C254% in price-adjusted terms, this was offset
by a sharp increase of 2% in real imports,
which is hardly consistent with the picture of
stagnating domestic activity. Seasonally ad-
justed consumer prices declined slightly in
August and September in the wake of falling
crude oil prices. The former were up 2.1% on
the year at the end of the reporting period,
compared with 2.3% in July. Excluding
energy and food, the prices were only 0.2%
higher than in September 2007.
In the summer, overall output in the United
Kingdom fell quarter-on-quarter (by1/C252%) for
the first time since spring 1992. In year-on-
year terms, there was an increase of only
1/C254%. The decline in GDP was caused by nega-
tive developments in all major sectors of the
economy. Manufacturing output (excluding
construction) decreased by 1%, construction
contracted by3/C254% and real value added in
the services sector fell by1/C252%, although an
even larger decline in private services seg-
ments was offset by a slight increase in the
public sector. The most noteworthy develop-
ment is that, on the demand side, private
consumption – which has been the main driv-
ing force behind growth in recent years – no
longer had a positive effect. On a third-
quarter average, real retail sales stagnated at
the level of the second quarter. The low pro-
pensity to purchase is probably connected,
among other things, with the sharp increase
in unemployment over the past few months.

tinued unabated until September; at 5.2%,JapanUnited

17the annual rate of inflation even marked a
new high this year. This can be explained
largely by sharp rises in gas and electricity
prices. In October, however, the rate of infla-
tion fell back down to 4.5% owing to the
significant decline in crude oil prices. Since
mid-year, seasonally adjusted house prices
have decreased by no less than 63/C254%a n d
were 15% lower than a year earlier as this
report went to press.
The new EU member states continued to lose
economic momentum in the third quarter. In-
dustry was affected particularly severely, with
a reduction of 23/C254% in output. Year-on-year
growth was only 11/C254%. Latvia (-71/C252%) and
Estonia (-4%) are at the bottom end of the
ranking, while Poland and Slovakia still ex-
perienced relatively strong growth (21/C252% and
23/C254%, respectively). Industrial activity in the
new EU member states was dampened by a
decline in export growth. In addition, the
inflation-related losses in purchasing power
increased from mid-year onwards. Inflation
peaked at 7.1% in July and subsequently fell
to 5.9% in October. Despite the cyclical
downturn, however, the unemployment rate
decreased again marginally to 6.3% on aver-
age over the July-September three-month
period. In recent weeks, some new EU coun-
tries have increasingly been sucked into the
undertow created by the international finan-
cial crisis. Those countries with very high
structural current account deficits, low for-
eign reserves and a requirement for large in-
flows of funds from abroad in the short term
have proven particularly vulnerable in this
respect.Macroeconomic trends in the euro area
In the third quarter, real GDP in the euro area
was a seasonally adjusted1/C254% lower than in
the second quarter, in which it had already
declined owing, in part, to special factors. In
the summer months, year-on-year growth
was only3/C254%. The negative developments in
the euro area were caused by considerable
reductions in output in Germany, Italy and, to
a lesser extent, Spain, while France and most
of the smaller countries that have already
published initial GDP estimates still managed
to record minimal growth. The frontrunners
were Cyprus and Greece with a rise in overall
output of a seasonally adjusted1/C252%.
The decline in GDP in the euro area is – as
with the reduction in the second quarter,
which is partly due to technical issues – large-
ly attributable to the downward trend in
manufacturing. Industrial output in the third
quarter was down 1% on the quarter and
11/C252% on the year after seasonal adjustment.
Only energy production continued to grow,
while the output of intermediate goods and
the manufacture of capital goods and con-
sumer goods contracted significantly. The
decline in industrial output coincided with a
reduction of 11/C254percentage points in capacity
utilisation from July to October, meaning that
the latter fell below its long-term average for
the first time since the beginning of 2006. In
October, the Purchasing Managers’ Index for
industry in the euro area even dropped to its
lowest level since the start of the series in
1997. The negative development in new
orders is also consistent with the gloomier
economic picture. Their value in the July-New EU

18August period was1/C254% lower than in the
second quarter. Excluding the manufacture of
other transport equipment, where orders re-
ceived are strongly influenced by large orders,
they decreased by as much as 11/C252%. Indus-
trial confidence also deteriorated sharply. The
indicator is now as low as it was at the end of
2001, but is still clearly above the historic low
of 1993.The decline in construction output by a
seasonally adjusted1/C254% in the July-August
period from its second-quarter levels indicates
that construction investment in the third
quarter – no data are yet available for the ex-
penditure aggregates – contracted. Invest-
ment in new plant and equipment may have
fared somewhat better. On the demand side,
households’ low propensity to purchase also
contributed to the decline in real GDP . Sea-
sonally adjusted real retail sales (excluding
motor vehicles) barely exceeded the de-
pressed level of the preceding period and
were down 11/C252% on the year. Expenditure on
new cars likewise decreased further; in the
July-October period, new registrations in the
euro area were down 101/C252% on the year. The
year-on-year decline was particularly strong
in Spain (-35%) and Italy (-15%). Consumer
confidence in the euro area deteriorated
again noticeably in October. By contrast, ex-
ports to non-euro-area countries, which were
11/C252% in nominal terms above the second-
quarter average in the July-August period,
made a positive contribution. However, this
was accompanied by significantly stronger
growth (+43/C254%) in import values. Although
import price rises may still have been a signifi-
cant factor in mid-2008, the volume is also
likely to have grown markedly.
The slowdown in employment growth which
began in mid-2007 continued in the first half
of 2008 (further information is not yet avail-
able). In the second quarter, the number of
employed persons was up by only 0.2% on
the quarter, with year-on-year growth con-
tracting to 1.2%. The seasonally adjusted un-
employment rate increased to 7.5% in theSeasonally adjusted, quarterly

19third quarter owing to the weakened eco-
nomic performance; at the beginning of theyear, it still stood at 7.2%. This was mainly at-tributable to the sharp rise in underemploy-ment in Spain, where the corresponding raterose by more than 2 percentage points to11.5%. In Ireland, too, the labour marketsituation deteriorated significantly. By con-trast, other countries, including Germany, theNetherlands and Austria, saw marginal de-clines. According to initial estimates, whichare often revised upwards, seasonally adjust-ed hourly labour costs increased by 0.6% inthe second quarter and were up by 2.7% onthe year. At 3.1%, the rise in the first half of2008 was considerably sharper than it waspreviously.
Consumer price inflation in the euro area
eased again in the third quarter of 2008. Ona quarterly average, prices were up by a sea-sonally adjusted 0.7% on the second quarter,when they had risen by 1.1%. The increase inyear-on-year inflation from 3.6% in thesecond quarter to 3.8% in the third is alsoconnected with base effects resulting frommoderate price developments in the sameperiod last year. The improvement in the over-all picture was overwhelmingly driven by thestabilisation of the international oil markets,which led energy prices to go down by morethan 2% over the summer months. Among
the other categories of goods, by contrast,there was no relief on average. Excluding en-ergy, consumer prices in the third quarterrose by a seasonally adjusted 0.6% and thussomewhat more robustly than in the secondquarter. Since the beginning of 2008, year-on-year growth has remained unchanged at2.6%. In October, consumer prices fell by aseasonally adjusted 0.1%, with the annualrate of inflation declining to 3.2%.

20Monetary policy and
banking businessInterest rate policy and the money
market
The monetary policy reins were loosened no-
ticeably in the third quarter. Following the sig-
nificant intensification of the financial market
turmoil and the drop in commodity prices,
the Governing Council of the ECB, in a con-
certed effort with six other central banks,
lowered the main refinancing rate by1/C252per-
centage point to 3.75% on 8 October 2008.
On 6 November, it was lowered by another
1/C252percentage point to 3.25%.
At the beginning of October, the Governing
Council also announced changes to the oper-
ational framework of monetary policy which
will initially remain in place until 20 January
2009. Until then, weekly main refinancing
operations will be carried out as fixed-rate
tenders with full allotment at the prevailing
main refinancing interest rate. At the same
time, the width of the interest rate corridor
around the main refinancing rate, which con-
sists of the rates for the marginal lending and
deposit facilities, was reduced from 2 per-
centage points to 1. This was done by halving
the spread between each of the two cor-
responding interest rates and the rate for
the main refinancing operations to 50 basis
points. With its longer-term refinancing oper-
ation of 30 October, the Governing Council
also began carrying out these operations as
fixed-rate tenders with full allotment.
The Governing Council also decided in Octo-
ber to expand the range of collateral which
credit institutions could submit in order to
prevent potential liquidity shortages becauseCoordinated

21Deutsche BundesbankMoney market management and liquidity needs
During the three reserve maintenance periods between 
9 July and 7 October 2008, euro-area credit institutions‘ need for central bank liquidity determined by autono-mous liquidity factors fell by €7.8 billion in net terms. The continuing strong growth in the volume of banknotes in circulation, which recorded a new high within the period under review when it reached approximately €700 bil-lion on 7 October 2008, absorbed liquidity to the value of €7.1 billion. However, general government deposits 
with the Eurosystem still decreased by €9.7 billion. If 
the net foreign reserves and the other factors are taken together, a move which eliminates liquidity-neutral valu-ation effects, there was likewise a decline of €5.2 billion in the liquidity needs of banks over the three periods. 
This was caused mainly by Eurosystem purchases of 
ﬁ nancial assets which are unrelated to monetary policy. 
The liquidity needs resulting from the minimum reserve requirement expanded by €2.9 billion over the three maintenance periods and could be met by credit institu-
tions without any problems (see the table on page 23).
About a year after tensions had ﬁ  rst taken hold on 
the money market, Eurosystem liquidity management continued to be focused primarily on supporting the 
functioning of the money markets. To this end, the 
Eurosystem carried out additional reﬁ  nancing operations 
in the period under review, shifted the mix of maturities of these operations further towards longer-term reﬁ  -
nancing operations (from 64% to 66%) and provided a 
generous supply of liquidity (frontloading). Maintaining 
the overnight rate at a level close to the minimum bid rate continued to be the aim of liquidity management.
During the July-August reserve period, the generous 
supply of liquidity ensured that the EONIA remained 
generally stable with an average EONIA turnover of over €43 billion. The fact that the above-benchmark amounts of €18 billion, €14 billion, €10 billion, €8 billion and €3.0 
billion were slightly lower than those in the preceding 
period showed that the situation had eased to some extent. On 12 July, the last day of the reserve mainten-ance period, the ECB carried out a liquidity-absorbing ﬁ ne-tuning operation with a volume of €21.0 billion and 
the EONIA stood at 4.32%.
In the August-September reserve period there was a con-
tinuation of this comparatively stable development in the EONIA, which remained generally slightly above the 
minimum bid rate. Exceptions were the “usual” increase 
at the end of the month and the often increased volatil-ity on the last day of the reserve period.
In the September-October reserve period, the insolvency 
of US investment bank Lehmann Brothers resulted in a 
signiﬁ  cant tightening of the conditions on the money 
market. Alongside banks’ hoarding behaviour, cancelled credit lines and the problem posed by the drying-up of 
the longer-term money market sectors, mistrust between banks also became increasingly noticeable in overnight loans; towards the end of the period, EONIA turnover fell to record lows of around €30 billion. In order to curb the strong increase in the overnight money rate, the Eurosystem carried out liquidity-providing ﬁ  ne-tuning 
operations, signiﬁ  cantly increased the above-benchmark 
amounts in main reﬁ  nancing operations to up to €230.0 
billion and announced an additional longer-term 38-day 
reﬁ nancing operation which ran up to and included 
the last day of the quarter. The abundant supply of liquidity was likewise absorbed through ﬁ  ne-tuning 
operations. While these measures gave the banks more 
security for their own liquidity management, they also 
led to increased ﬂ  uctuations in the EONIA of between 
3.92% and 4.60%. In addition, average daily recourse to the marginal lending facility and to the deposit facility increased to around €7½ billion and around €20 billion 
respectively. The fact that redistribution on the money 
market was heavily restricted was also reﬂ  ected in the 
increased number of bidders in the main and longer-term reﬁ nancing operations as well as in increased allotment 
rates. Furthermore, larger turnover on EurexRepo’s GC 
Pooling in the last week of the reserve period indicated 
a strong preference for secured O/N transactions in times of crisis.
On the ﬁ  rst day of the subsequent October-November 
2008 reserve period, the ECB announced massive steps 
to further stimulate the money market as part of coordin-ated action with other leading central banks.

22of a lack of eligible assets. This measure was
flanked by the continuous topping-up of
liquidity in US dollars supplied through the
Eurosystem to European banks. In consult-
ation with the Swiss central bank, the Euro-
system is now also carrying out temporary
foreign currency swap transactions in Swiss
francs. The measures agreed with the US
Federal Reserve and the Swiss central bank
safeguard the refinancing of credit institu-tions in the euro area in US dollars and Swiss
francs.
The adjustments to the monetary policy
framework relate directly to the significant in-
tensification of the financial market turmoil
since mid-September, which was set in mo-
tion by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in
the USA. On the money market, this develop-
ment initially took the form of a considerable
increase in the volatility of EONIA, another
sharp rise in uncollateralised money market
rates and a significant decline in the volumes
traded between banks, even in the area of
overnight money, which had been relatively
unaffected by the tension on the money mar-
ket until then. Since the interest rate cut at
the start of October, the interbank money
market rates – including the EONIA – have
fallen perceptibly. However, the gap between
the (uncollateralised) three-month Euribor
and the (collateralised) three-month Eurepo
has remained substantial. At the end of the
period under review, it was 1.6 percentage
points. At the same time, greater use was
made of the marginal lending facility and
there was a sharp increase in liquid funds in-
vested in the deposit facility. Given this oper-
ational shortcoming of the interbank money
market, the Eurosystem essentially assumed
responsibility for distributing liquidity between
credit institutions by offering a generous ten-
der allotment at a fixed interest rate on the
refinancing side and providing an open de-
posit facility with a1/C252percentage point dis-
count on the interest payment on the deposit
side.%

23Monetary developments in the euro area
Third-quarter growth in M3 in the euro area
was roughly on a par with that of the second
quarter of 2008. In seasonally adjusted and
annualised terms, it rose by 8% from July to
September. The extremely liquid monetary
components cash and overnight deposits
which make up the money aggregate M1 in-
creased again at the end of the period under
review after a slight decrease in the second
quarter of 2008. By contrast, growth in com-
ponents remunerated close to market rates
slowed somewhat in the third quarter. In par-
ticular, banks entered into fewer repurchase
transactions with German non-banks than
previously in the period under review. The cir-
culation of short-term bank debt securities
also slowed somewhat on the quarter. By
contrast, seasonally adjusted money market
fund shares/units were again in greater de-
mand overall in the third quarter after they
were returned in large quantities in the
second quarter. However, short-term time
deposits again made by far the biggest con-
tribution to monetary growth in the third
quarter. They were remunerated at a slightly
higher rate in the period under review than in
the past.
The granting of bank loans to the private
sector in the euro area was again the main
source of money creation in the third quarter.
However, the pace of loan expansion to Ger-
man enterprises and households continued to
fall; from July to September, loans grew by a
seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of
just 61/C252% compared with more than 7% in
the second quarter. In particular, loans to fi-Factors determining bank liquidity*

grew at a much slower rate than in previous
quarters. Unsecuritised bank lending to non-
financial enterprises also grew at a percep-
tibly slower rate from July to September than
in the corresponding period a year earlier.
This may have been due partly to stricter
bank lending standards. Credit institutions at
any rate reported a continued massive tight-
ening of their credit standards in the BankLending Survey. At 12.1% in the previous
year, however, the increase in loans to Ger-
man non-financial enterprises was very high
in the 12 months up to the end of the period
under review. By contrast, lending to house-
holds has been extremely restrained for some
time, partly as a result of the moderate in-
crease in lending for house purchase. Over
these same 12 months, it grew by just 4%.Open market operations of the Eurosystem*

25Bank holdings of securities from private is-
suers in the euro area continued to growstrongly at a seasonally adjusted and annual-ised rate of more than 16
1/C252% from July to
September. Conversely, banks sold securitiesfrom public issuers in the euro area in netterms. Since loans to general government inthe euro area increased, however, new publicsector debt vis-/C224-vis banks decreased onlyslightly in the third quarter.
Monetary capital formation in the euro area
was fairly strong in the third quarter. Thiswas, however, attributable largely to thesharp rise in banks’ equity and reserves,which mainly reflects greater risk provisionand, to some extent, state recapitalisationmeasures. If equity and reserves are excluded,longer-term investment at banks in the euroarea increased by no more than a seasonallyadjusted and annualised rate of just under1
1/C252% in the period under review compared
with 4% in the previous quarter. This was at-tributable to both the low level of investorinterest in longer-term savings and time de-posits and limited sales of longer-term bankdebt securities to buyers outside the Germanbanking sector. Evidently, the liquidity prefer-ence of both banks and non-banks hasheightened during the financial market tur-moil. Moreover, the pronounced inverse termstructure in the third quarter reduced theattractiveness of longer-term investment.

dents may have reduced their investment
abroad and transferred the money to bank
accounts in the euro area.
When assessing the continued strength of
monetary expansion in terms of monetary
policy, it should be noted that the pace of
monetary expansion was boosted by the in-
verse term structure in the third quarter and
the liquidity preference of investors was influ-
enced by the financial market turmoil. Thus,
the current strength of monetary expansion
probably overstates the monetary growth
trend needed for stability policy. But even tak-
ing this into account, the continued strength
of monetary growth still points to persistent
price risks in the longer term. At all events,
the longer-term inflation projections basedon monetary indicators are still well above
the level which the Governing Council associ-
ates with price stability.
German banks’ deposit and lending
business with domestic customers
According to the balance sheet data available
up to the end of September, German banks’
business with customers in Germany has not
suffered any serious setbacks as many feared
following the developments on the financial
markets in the past year. However, German
investors favoured more liquid forms of in-
vestment, with other financial institutions
and insurance companies, in particular, in-
vesting in short-term bank deposits in the
third quarter. Following the continuous slow-
ing of growth in German customers’ deposits
at German banks in the first half of 2008,
bank balances in Germany grew at a slightly
stronger rate in the third quarter of 2008. De-
posits of domestic non-banks at German
credit institutions increased at a seasonally
adjusted and annualised rate of 51/C252% in the
period under review compared with just over
31/C252% in the second quarter.
Of the short-term bank deposits, time de-
posits remunerated close to market rates
with an agreed maturity of up to two years
were again almost the only component to in-
crease. They probably benefited above all
from the rise in interest rates in the euro area
at the beginning of the quarter. In addition to
households, “other financial institutions”, in
particular, invested in short-term time de-

27duced their overnight deposits. In addition,
German non-financial enterprises and insur-ance companies built up their very liquidmoney holdings substantially. Short-term sav-ings deposits (redeemable at notice of up tothree months), on the other hand, again ex-perienced an accelerated decrease in theperiod under review.
As in the previous two quarters, German in-
vestors again reduced their longer-term bankdeposits on a seasonally adjusted basis in thethird quarter of 2008. Whereas in the pastonly savings deposits redeemable at notice ofover three months had decreased, there wasnow also a considerable drop in time depositswith an agreed maturity of more than twoyears in the third quarter. The impetus for thisdevelopment came not only from house-holds. Longer-term time deposits held byGerman insurance companies did not experi-ence the usual seasonal rise in the periodunder review either.
In recent months, bank loans have risen
sharply, particularly those to the private sectorin Germany. This is attributable mainly to Ger-man banks having considerably expandedtheir holdings of securities issued by domesticenterprises in connection with a large securi-tisation operation in August. If loans to do-mestic enterprises and households – but nottheir holdings of securities – are considered,there was a seasonally adjusted and annual-ised growth rate of 2% from July to Septem-ber. This means that the fairly strong creditgrowth of earlier quarters had again slowedsomewhat. This was caused, among otherthings, by slower growth in loans to non-financial corporations and further reduced
lending to households. Non-monetary finan-cial enterprises, by contrast, increased theirborrowing from German banks significantlyin the period under review, with reverse re-purchase transactions between banks and for-eign financial institutions outside the bankingsector again playing a role. Credit institutionsalso sold large holdings of securities issued bydomestic public-sector entities in the thirdquarter. At the same time, central, state andlocal government also significantly reducedtheir loans from German banks.
The comparatively slow quarterly growth in
loans to the private sector may have beenpartly the result of lower demand for fundsfrom borrowers; the German results of theBank Lending Survey (BLS) would suggest this

29in any case. For the first time in three years,
the banks surveyed not only reported a dropin demand for loans for house purchase inthe third quarter of 2008 – as had been thecase for some time – but also a slight de-crease in the financing needs of enterprises.Only demand for consumer credits, which areless significant in terms of magnitude, rose atBLS institutions in the period under review.
Lending conditions were also tightened, and
although the degree to which this was donewas less severe than in the euro area as awhole, it was in some cases substantial byGerman standards. According to the respond-ents, this was particularly true of lendingbusiness with enterprises which was subjectto both considerably tighter lending stand-ards and wider margins. In this case, the re-spondents reported that both refinancing
problems on the money and bond marketsand the general assessment of the economicsituation had played a role. After being re-laxed in earlier quarters, the conditions forlending to households for house purchaseand consumption purposes barely changed;according to German BLS banks, only mar-gins for riskier loans increased significantly.As has already been the case for some time,the survey for the third quarter of 2008 con-tained additional questions on the isolatedimpact of the financial market turmoil on theparticipating banks’ lending policies.

30Deutsche BundesbankCornerstones of the Financial Market Stabilisation Act (Finanzmarktstabilisierungsgesetz)
The aim of the Financial Market Stabilisation Act, which
entered into force on 18 October 2008, is to support financial
sector enterprises domiciled in Germany when they run into li-
quidity difficulties and/or have insufficient capital at their dis-
posal, thus strengthening the stability of the financial system
and safeguarding the supply of credit to the German econ-
omy. The Financial Market Stabilisation Act consists (1) of the
Financial Market Stabilisation Fund Act, which, in conjunction
with the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund Ordinance, de-
fines the individual stabilisation instruments, the require-
ments attached to having recourse to the Fund as well as the
financing and administration of the package of measures, and
(2) of other legal norms which are designed to simplify and ac-
celerate the implementation of these stabilisation measures.
Financial Market Stabilisation Fund Act
In order to implement and finance the stabilisation measures
a designated Financial Market Stabilisation Fund (Fund) was
established in the form of a special Federal fund with no legal
personality. The newly founded Financial Market Stabilisation
Agency (FMSA), which is subject to the legal and technical
supervision of the Federal Ministry of Finance, is responsible
for administering the Fund.1
Decisions to apply stabilisation measures depend on the appli-
cation made by the individual company, giving special consid-
eration to its importance for the stability of the German finan-
cial system, the urgency of the situation and the principle of
the most effective and economical deployment of the means
available. All financial sector enterprises domiciled in Ger-
many and listed in section 2 (2) of the Financial Market Stabil-
isation Fund Act are eligible to lodge an application.These in-
clude inter alia private banks, banks organised under public
law, insurance companies, pension funds and capital invest-
ment companies as well as operators of stock and futures ex-
changes. There is no legal entitlement to receive support from
the Fund, nor is it permitted to force (German) financial sector
enterprises into making use of the stabilisation measures.
The Financial Market Stabilisation Fund Act specifies three
types of stabilisation instrument: assumption of guarantees,
recapitalisation and assumption of risk. These instruments
may be applied either separately or as a combined package,
depending on the nature of the problem, and can be applied
until 31 December 2009 only, after which date the Fund will
be wound up and dissolved.
Under the ruling on assuming guarantees, the Fund is able to
grant a default guarantee for any newly issued debt instru-ments and liabilities accrued which were incurred by financial
sector enterprises between 18 October 2008 and 31 December
2009.2None of the liabilities covered by a guarantee may ex-
ceed a term of 36 months. Hence, no guarantee term will ex-
tend beyond 31 December 2012. A precondition for the as-
sumption of a guarantee is capital adequacy, which simultan-
eously serves as the reference variable for the upper limit of
the guarantee assumed for a given enterprise (including any
of its affiliates). The Fund is expected to levy a guarantee com-
mission fee in line with market conditions.3Such guarantees
are designed to alleviate liquidity problems arising at corpor-
ate level and to support refinancing in the capital market. At a
macroeconomic level, the aim of guarantee measures is to bol-
ster confidence in the commercial viability of enterprises by
hedging any refinancing difficulties and in turn enhance the
smooth functioning of the unsecured interbank market.4
Overall, the cost of short-term interbank lending is also likely
to be cut back to an appropriate level.
The recapitalisation tool enables the Fund to acquire shares,
silent participations or other capital components of enter-
prises in exchange for an infusion of capital. However, such re-
capitalisation should be undertaken only in cases where there
is a substantial interest on the part of the Federal Government
and where the purpose sought by the Federal Government
cannot be better and more economically achieved by other
means. If the Fund makes use of the recapitalisation tool, then
the beneficiary enterprises are required to make an appropri-
ate payment to the Fund in line with market conditions; fur-
thermore, the Fund should aim at obtaining remuneration
which is preferential to that received by the original general
partners (for example, in the form of preferred dividends). As
a general principle, the size of any share in a single enterprise
(including its affiliates) must not exceed the amount of 510
billion. In certain cases, however, it is possible to make an ex-
ception to this rule. In the longer term, any participations ac-
quired by the Fund should not be allowed to remain in its pos-
session. Instead, they should be dissolved or sold in a manner
which is not detrimental to the market.5The purpose of the
recapitalisation tool is to provide the enterprise in question
with adequate capital for the foreseeable future in order, for
instance, to prevent a major curtailment in lending to the
non-financial private sectors (ie a credit crunch). Securing cap-
ital adequacy has the additional effect of boosting confidence
in the soundness of the enterprise concerned and is therefore
a vital prerequisite for resolving the functional disruptions
currently affecting the interbank market.
Under the assumption of risk provision, the Fund may acquire
any risk exposures, – particularly receivables, securities, finan-
1The FMSA also describes the Fund as the Special Fund for the Stabil-
isation of the Financial Market (SoFFin). Further information such as
the relevant legislative texts, the ordinance and the Fund’s organisa-
tional structure is posted on the following websites: www.soffin.de
and www.bundesfinanzministerium.de. — 2The Fund may also grant
guarantees to special purpose vehicles (SPVs) (which, pursuant to the
Financial-Market Stabilisation Fund Act, were not originally deemed
eligible to apply), provided these SPVs have assumed risk positions
from financial sector enterprises and the associated default and
liquidity risks are borne primarily by the enterprise making the trans-
fer (for example, by granting credit lines). — 3With regard to debt
instruments with a maturity of three to twelve months, the level ofthe guarantee commission fee should generally stand at 0.5%. By
contrast, in the case of liabilities with a maturity of 12 to 36 months,
institution-specific fees are to be levied which are based on market
interest rates for credit default swaps and therefore also reflect the
default risk involved. — 4Generally, a market is described as liquid
when transactions can be executed speedily and without any signifi-
cant impact on the market price. For example, low bid ask spreads are
one indicator of a liquid market. — 5The Fund is allowed to hold and
dispose of stakes in enterprises beyond 2012. — 6The terms and con-
ditions attached to assuming risks from SPVs correspond to the condi-
tions for assuming a guarantee (see footnote 2). — 7It is, for ex-
ample, possible for the selling enterprise to commit itself to paying a

loan commitments or warranties and participations in enter-prises (together with the corresponding collateral in eachcase) – which were purchased prior to 13 October 2008 in ex-change for a transfer of debt instruments issued by the Fed-eral Republic of Germany. The same applies to special purposevehicles (SPVs)
6which acquired risk exposures from financial
sector enterprises. Risk assets are purchased either at the bal-ance sheet value last used by the seller or at a value lowerthan this and may be combined with a risk participation be-longing to the selling enterprise.
7The level of the purchasing
fee charged by the Fund should reflect the assumed risk andat least be sufficient to cover the Fund’s refinancing costs. Useof the tool depends on the availability of adequate capitaland is generally limited to 55 billion per enterprise (including
its affiliates). Nevertheless, in certain cases, it is possible to de-viate from this rule, too. The objective of risk assumption is,first, to make liquidity and eligible assets available and,second, to support the capital position of the enterprise con-cerned.
In order to make use of any of the three tools the beneficiary
enterprise must be able to demonstrate that it is pursuing asound and prudent business policy. With regard to recapital-isation and risk assumption by the Fund, general provisionsapply to the effect that financial sector enterprises must satisfyadditional requirements with respect to the structure of theirremuneration schemes
8and forego any profit distributions,
non-consolidation-related capital reductions and buy-backs ofshares or other components of the liable capital. Moreover, inthe event of a recapitalisation, the beneficiary enterprises arecalled upon to take particular account of small and mediumsized enterprises’ borrowing needs by offering a suitablerange of services in line with market conditions.
As a means of financing the stabilisation package, the Federal
Ministry of Finance may utilise financial resources up to a max-imum amount of 5100 billion. This funding is provided
through government borrowing, dependent on requirements.For the purpose of financing recapitalisations and risk assump-tion, the Fund is initially able to draw upon resources amount-ing to no more than 570 billion. Where necessary, however,
this sum may be topped up by a further 510 billion, contingent
on the approval of the Budget Committee of the DeutscherBundestag. Under the provisions for assuming a guarantee,the Fund is able to assume guarantees up to the amount of5400 billion. On the basis of an assumed default rate of 5%,
the Fund has been equipped with funds of 520 billion to fi-
nance any defaults which might occur.It is not yet possible to quantify the financial burden to be
borne by the Fund precisely as this will depend on the extentof future recourse to the assistance available. What is more,some of the expenses are of limited duration, not least sinceacquired shares, in particular, are to be resold at a later date.Moreover, revenues from granting guarantees or assumingrisks and potential loss participation on the part of beneficiaryenterprises owing to the purchase of risk assets all have a cost-reducing effect. Once the Fund has been wound up, the actualcosts incurred will be split between central and state govern-ment in the ratio of 65:35 with the limit for each federal stateset at 57.7 billion.

Further legal norms laid down in the Financial Market
Stabilisation Act
In addition to the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund Act, the
Financial Market Stabilisation Act also contains a number ofregulations designed to facilitate and accelerate the imple-mentation of the three stabilisation tools. For example, the in-strument of statutorily authorised capital was created for thepurpose of implementing accelerated recapitalisation meas-ures. This instrument empowers the management board of apublic limited company to increase the enterprise’s share cap-ital by up to 50% by 31 December 2009 through the issuanceof new shares to the Fund while excluding shareholder sub-scription rights and solely with the approval of the supervisoryboard. The standard legal requirement set out in the Com-panies Act ( Aktiengesetz ) that any capital increases require
prior consent from a company’s general meeting thereforedoes not apply.
10To limit the dilution of shareholders’ owner-
ship rights the statutorily authorised capital is offset againstthe existing authorised capital.
11
In order to take due account of the exceptionally large lossesin value currently affecting a swathe of assets and the accom-panying heightened insolvency risks in the entire corporatesector, the Financial Market Stabilisation Act specifies a newdefinition of the concept of over-indebtedness as contained inthe German Insolvency Code ( Insolvenzordnung ), which ap-
plies to all enterprises. The reasoning behind this new ruling isthat the previous definition would have allowed losses invalue – especially those relating to shares and real estate – toresult in insolvencies, even in cases with a positive future fore-cast. Hence, the new version stipulates that enterprises whichare over-indebted in purely numerical terms but whose viabil-ity as a going concern is deemed highly probable will not beconsidered over-indebted and are therefore exempt from hav-ing to file an insolvency petition.
compensation sum if the Fund suffers a loss upon the maturity or the
realisation of the respective assets. — 8This involves inter alia exam-
ining the incentive effects and appropriateness of existing remuner-
ation schemes, gearing these schemes to long-term and sustainable
targets, avoiding the creation of incentives which encourage the tak-
ing of disproportionately high risks, restricting the salaries of senior
management and members of governing bodies to reasonable levels
and a ban on the awarding of bonuses and optional pay components
for the entire duration of the stabilisation programme. — 9Any costs
arising from possible use of the Fund by Landesbanken are borne by
the federal states in proportion to their respective stakes in the Lan-
desbanken. Accordingly, central government bears the proportionatecosts arising from beneficiary financial sector enterprises in which it
holds stakes. — 10Management boards are further entitled to deter-
mine the form of the shares – particularly with respect to the grant-
ing of preferred dividend rights and the prioritised distribution of
the company’s assets – subject to the approval of the supervisory
board. In addition, boards are able to equip the Fund with profit par-
ticipation rights without prior consent from the general meeting and
excluding shareholder subscription rights. — 11The instrument es-
tablishing statutorily authorised capital applies exclusively to finan-
cial sector enterprises operating as a public limited company, as a
partnership limited by shares or as a European company (SE).

quarter.
Bank lending rates rose across the board,
above all, at the beginning of the third quar-
ter of 2008. Most then fell marginally at the
end of the period under review. Overall, how-
ever, interest rates remained slightly higher
owing to the considerable increase in refinan-
cing costs in the capital markets, chiefly at
the end of the previous quarter, and the re-ported margin increases in lending business.
The only exceptions were short-term con-
sumer credits and longer-term large-volume
loans to enterprises. Ultimately, banks charged
5.7% or 6.5% for short-term loans to enter-
prises and 5.5% or 5.7% for long-term loans
to enterprises depending on volume. At the
same time, they demanded 6.2% for housing

33Financial marketsFinancial market trends
The financial market crisis has worsened con-
siderably since the second quarter of 2008.
The problems besetting the financial sector
include not only the continued weakness of
the US real estate market but, above all, the
gloomier economic outlook in the industrial
nations and the emerging and developing
world alike. The insolvency of a large US in-
vestment bank additionally heightened mar-
ket participants’ risk aversion. Plummeting
share prices, a further decline in prices for
risky assets and pronounced tensions on the
money markets put financial institutions
under increased pressure. The difficulties in
the financial system resulted in numerous
countries launching government rescue pack-
ages for individual institutions as well as
broad-based aid measures for the financial
sector as a whole. These generally include
guarantees for non-banks’ bank deposits as
well as conditional support measures for fi-
nancial institutions (see explanatory notes on
pages 34-36). In addition, in early October,
major central banks lowered their lending
rates in a concerted effort, which was fol-
lowed by further rate cuts. These actions re-
stored a measure of stability to the markets.
However, the international financial system is
now having to contend increasingly with the
repercussions of the weakened macroeco-
nomic environment.

34International financial market stabilisation measures
After the major economies had initially grant-
ed government assistance to distressed banks
and financial institutions only as a case-by-
case measure and in a discretionary manner,
there were growing signs following the crash
of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers
that only broad-based packages of measures
would be able to avert systemic crises in par-
ticularly hard-hit countries. In view of the
feared burden for taxpayers and the possibil-
ity of distorting competition, such recommen-
dations immediately met with considerable
misgivings in terms of regulatory and distribu-
tion policy. However, these reservations were
addressed by attaching specific conditions to
government assistance and by a more con-
certed international approach.
On 3 October, the US House of Representa-
tives adopted the “Emergency Economic Sta-
bilization Act 2008” following defeat of a
previous version. The centrepiece of this legis-
lation is the “Troubled Asset Relief Program”
(TARP). Originally designed as a vehicle for
purchasing and guaranteeing financial assets,
the programme provides US$700 billion
which all US savings associations and banks
are eligible to tap. This was followed by an
additional infusion of government capital – in
emulation of the UK model. Criticism of such
comprehensive government assistance was ad-
dressed by the attachment of stringent condi-
tions concerning, for example, participating
banks’ dividend policies, expanded regulation
or the ban on “golden handshakes”. In the
light of recent experience, plans have been
made to broadly replace the asset purchase
programme with further recapitalisation pro-
grammes.
These rescue measures heralded the start of
a series of additional economic relief pro-
grammes. The conclusions of the Council of
EU economic and finance ministers (ECOFIN)
of 7 October contain a commitment to pursue
a coordinated approach designed to restore
confidence in the financial sector. At the same
time, they specified guidelines for national
rescue measures which are mainly aimed at
containing the risk of distortion in the level
playing field and of abuse. Just one day later,
Italy and the United Kingdom were the first
EU countries to adopt rescue packages to pro-
tect their financial sectors. Since then, thecomprehensive UK package of measures has
played an instrumental role as a model for
all subsequently adopted stabilisation pro-
grammes. It encompasses not only the provi-
sion of short-term liquidity but also govern-
ment guarantees and a strategy to recapital-
ise the banking system through the purchase
of preference shares by the government.
At the international level, the joint action
plan announced by the G7 countries on 10 Oc-
tober represents a coordinated basis for fu-
ture action by the leading industrial nations.
The support measures contained in this plan
are to be designed to protect taxpayer inter-
ests and avoid any harmful effects for other
countries. With this objective in mind, the G7
countries have committed to strengthen their
cooperation.
On the basis of the EU guidelines and the G7
action plan, the heads of state or government
of the euro area issued a declaration on 12 Oc-
tober in Paris calling for coordinated action
by the European Union, euro-area govern-
ments, central banks and supervisors. The
final document puts forward concrete meas-
ures to be implemented by the individual na-
tions. These stabilisation packages should be
designed in such a way that they do not dis-
tort competition. For this reason, the provi-
sion of government assistance must be priced
at least in line with market conditions and ac-
companied by restructuring measures while
also protecting the interests of taxpayers.
These principles were endorsed by the Brus-
sels European Council on 16 October and
apply to all European Union countries.
Just one month later, on 15 November, the
heads of state or government of the G20
countries, along with representatives of inter-
national organisations, met in Washington
for a global financial summit. This culminated
in the adoption of a five-part declaration out-
lining the root causes of the current crisis and
listing actions to be taken immediately, re-
forms to avoid future crisis and a reaffirm-
ation of the group’s commitment to an open
global economy. An appended action plan
defines concrete actions for implementing
these agreements, some of which are sched-
uled for completion by 31 March 2009.

37nounced exchange rate volatility and a
broad-based recovery of the US dollar. In thisenvironment, the euro slipped visibly againstthe US dollar, after peaking at just underUS$1.60 in mid-July. A number of negativenews reports about the economy increasinglydarkened the euro-area growth outlook. Thiswas reflected most notably in the contrast be-tween the negative euro-area growth rates inthe second quarter and the surprisingly ro-bust growth in the USA. This led the marketsto expect a narrowing of the interest rate dif-ferential between the two currency zones,thereby putting the euro under pressure. Thevisible fall in crude oil prices also contributedto the depreciation of the euro against the USdollar, since this tends to reduce the US needfor capital imports to finance the stubbornlylarge US current account deficit, which iscaused inter alia by considerable imports of
oil. All in all, the euro briefly dipped belowthe US$1.40 mark up until mid-September.
Subsequently, however, the financial market
turmoil in the United States worsened whenthe US government had to pass a rescuepackage for its two major mortgage financecompanies, a major investment bank becameinsolvent and a systemically relevant insur-ance firm needed to be rescued. These meas-ures, and the attendant fears regarding theburdens these government measures wouldplace on the budget, caused the euro to re-cover 6% in less than two weeks. At the turnof the month, however, tensions in the finan-cial markets spilled over to this side of the At-lantic as several European banks ran into diffi-culties. Government aid measures were ne-cessary in various euro-area and EU countries.Against this backdrop, the euro came under
renewed pressure against the US dollar in Oc-tober. Despite having appreciated in the firsthalf of the year, the euro was, at US$1.27,trading 14% below its level at the beginningof the year as this report went to press.
In similar fashion, the euro fell almost con-
tinuously against the Japanese yen during thereporting period, after peaking at ¥170 inDaily data, log scale

38July. The economic outlook was growing vis-
ibly gloomier in Japan, too. However, as inter-
est rates there were already low, this initially
did not lead to rate cut expectations as it had
in the other key currency areas. This assess-
ment was confirmed in early October when
the major central banks – with the exception
of Japan – cut their interest rates by1/C252per-
centage point in a concerted move. Market
expectations that interest rate differentials
would continue to narrow, as well as invest-
ors’ heightened risk aversion, put pressure on
the euro’s rate against the yen. The excep-
tionally high exchange rate volatility and the
change in exchange rate trends caused for-
eign currency investments financed in yen
(such as carry trades) to appear increasingly
risky. Moreover, the yen benefited from the
fact that Japanese banks are less affected bythe US mortgage crisis than other institutions.
After a comment on the yen by the G7 fi-
nance ministers and central bank governors
and the subsequent unexpected interest rate
cut by the Bank of Japan, the euro temporar-
ily recovered some ground against the Japan-
ese currency at the end of October. At last re-
port, it was trading at ¥122, ie 26% lower
than at the beginning of the year.
In the past few months, despite fluctuations,
the euro posted net gains against the pound
sterling. In the UK, too, there have been
mounting signs of an economic downturn
since August. In addition, the United King-
dom has been particularly hard hit by the cri-
sis in the financial sector owing to the prob-
lems in the real estate markets and the rela-
tively large size of its financial sector. This en-Average since 1975 = 100, quarterly, log scale 1

39abled the euro to rise against the pound ster-
ling up until early September. However, high
UK inflation subsequently prevented expect-
ations of interest rate cuts from emerging.
This development, along with the onset of
problems afflicting financial institutions in the
euro area, then put pressure on the euro. It
was only when, in October, the market came
to believe that the Bank of England and the
UK government were giving the problem of
combating slumping growth top priority, that
expectations of interest rate cuts became
entrenched in the UK, which resulted in the
euro posting renewed gains. Following the
sharp reduction in interest rates and the pub-
lication of the inflation report by the Bank of
England in early November, the euro hit a
new peak of £0.86 and ended the reporting
period at £0.84, 15% higher than at the be-
ginning of the year.
The euro’s average rate against the currencies
of 22 key trading partners has thus fallen
41/C252% since the beginning of the year and
81/C252% from its second-quarter peak. The
weaker euro is helping improve the German
economy’s price competitiveness, as is the
comparatively moderate cost development in
Germany, and is thus per se having a stabilis-
ing effect on German economic activity.
Securities markets and portfolio
transactions
Since the middle of the year, bond markets
have likewise been feeling the effects of the
worsening financial market crisis and the per-
ceptibly gloomier economic outlook. In ahighly jittery environment, uncertainty about
subsequent yield trends on either side of the
Atlantic temporarily reached new highs.1
Yields on ten-year European government
bonds have fallen by a total of3/C254percentage
point to just over 4% since the end of June,
while similar US instruments were, on bal-
ance, trading slightly lower, at around 33/C254%,
as this report went to press. The effects on
government bond yields of financial market
turbulence and the various government res-
cue packages are apparently going in oppos-
ite directions. On the one hand, investors in
search of a safe haven bought heavily into
government bonds, especially in the light of
considerable share price losses; this tended to
reduce bond yields. On the other hand, the
potential budgetary pressure imposed by the
rescue measures and the attendant fears con-
cerning future recourse to the capital market
may well have pushed up yields. In the short-
term segment, in particular, slightly more fa-
vourable inflation expectations, not least be-
cause of the considerable drop in oil prices,
and the latest interest rate cuts by the major
central banks caused a drop in yields.
Federal bonds (Bunds), which have seen their
yields in the ten-year segment fall by just
under 1 percentage point since the second
quarter, were the main beneficiaries of port-
folio shifts to liquid and safe assets. The brisk
demand for German government instruments
was also reflected in the yield development
relative to bonds issued by other euro-area
countries. The GDP-weighted yield advantage

40of German bonds over other euro-area bonds
temporarily reached around3/C254percentage
point, a new all-time high since the launch of
monetary union. Since the second quarter,
Greece and Ireland in particular have seen
spreads widen more than other euro-area na-
tions. For one, this reflects differences in the
liquidity of various euro-area countries’
bonds, as is also mirrored in the bid-ask
spreads on bonds. At least for the most recent-ly issued government bonds, these are usually
very narrow. During the reporting period,
Bunds had the highest liquidity throughout
the euro area. For another, the heteroge-
neous development of risk premiums – meas-
ured in terms of credit default swaps (CDSs) –
also plays a role.2Whereas the premiums on
five-year contracts for German government
bonds have risen by 20 basis points since
mid-September, other euro-area countries
have seen theirs rise much more sharply, by
up to 84 basis points (see adjacent chart). Un-
like the rise in CDS premiums on government
bonds, the premiums on bank debt securities
– especially subordinated debt – have fallen
owing to the guarantees given by the govern-
ment. This demonstrates that the govern-
ment rescue packages have transferred a
considerable volume of risk from the financial
sector to the government sector.
The term structure of Federal bonds reflects
the various influences in the bond market
more broadly than the yields on long-term
bonds. Growing concerns about the econ-
omy over the course of the third quarter led
to a temporary inversion in the medium-term
maturity segment. At last report, investors’
flight to safe government-issued instruments
as well as falling short-term inflation expect-
ations, the Eurosystem’s latest interest-rate
cuts and changes in market participants’ ex-
pectations regarding the future monetary pol-
icy stance have put downward pressure on
yields, especially those at the short end of the
interest rate spectrum. All things considered,

41percentage points to 21/C252% since the end of
June. This means that the slope of the yieldcurve, expressed as the difference betweentwo-year and ten-year yields, has risen to justunder 1
3/C254percentage points.
Despite falling government bond yields,
firms’ financing conditions in the capital mar-ket have worsened dramatically since mid-2008, not least owing to the collapse in shareprices. In the euro-area bond markets, more-over, the yield gap between bonds still ratedinvestment grade (BBB) and governmentbonds reached a new high of over 600 basispoints, in line with trends in the UnitedStates. This rise probably reflects the gloomiereconomic outlook and fears that banks willimplement tighter lending standards. In add-ition, financial market players are currentlyfairly risk averse, which must also be seenagainst the backdrop of the failure of a majorinvestment bank and the problems encoun-tered by a notable insurance company. Inaddition, the liquidity of corporate bonds hasapparently diminished, which is likewise caus-ing yields to rise. This is indicated by the com-paratively small rise in the iTraxx indices,which reflect default risk. Still, the index forCDS premiums of various Europeaninvestment-grade issuers (iTraxx Europe) al-most hit its historic high, whereas the indexfor lower-grade issuers (iTraxx Europe Cross-over) significantly surpassed its previous all-time high.
Only in some areas of the German bond mar-
ket was issuing activity marked by the in-creased uncertainty in the financial markets.Gross sales of debt securities issued by resi-dents rose to a record high of 3417

in the third quarter of 2008 after having al-ready peaked in each of the two precedingquarters. After taking into account the slightperiod-on-period decline in redemptions andchanges in holdings of issuers’ own bondsand notes, domestic issuers tapped the cap-ital market for 337 billion net. By contrast,
German investors reduced their holdings ofdebt securities issued by non-residents by therecord amount of 318 billion. In the first half
of 2008, non-residents were still able to sell357 billion worth of bonds. The total amount
of funds raised from sales of domestic andforeign debt securities in the third quarterwas319 billion, compared with 325

42The public sector increased its borrowing in
the bond market by 341/C252billion from July to
September and thus by about the same mag-
nitude as in the first two quarters of 2008.
Whereas the state governments’ recourse to
the capital market, at 351/C252billion, was up on
the preceding three-month period, the Fed-
eral Government reduced its market debt
slightly by 31 billion net after having issued a
net31/C252billion worth of debt securities in the
preceding period. The Federal Government
redeemed, in particular, ten-year Bunds ( 314
billion) but also, to a lesser extent, two-year
Federal Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze) and Federal
savings notes for a combined total of 31 bil-
lion. By contrast, it issued 331/C252billion worth
of 30-year bonds, 37 billion worth of
medium-term Bobls and 33 billion worth of
short-term Bubills. Also, it generated 31/C252bil-
lion from the first-time sale of “day-bonds”
for private investors.
German credit institutions sold 31 billion net
of their own bonds and money market paper
in the July to September period. Since July
2007, however, they have reduced their out-
standing capital market debt by a total of
316 billion. During the quarter under review,
they redeemed public Pfandbriefe amounting
to3131/C252billion net and thus confirmed a
trend that has been in evidence for years and
is attributable largely to a drop in financing
requirements and the public sector’s growing
propensity to go straight to the bond market
for funds. In the current year alone, the vol-
ume of public Pfandbriefe outstanding thus
fell by 3381/C252billion. Net funds from the issu-
ance of mortgage Pfandbriefe, by contrast,
were positive in the third quarter ( 33 billion).Other bank debt securities,3which can be
structured flexibly, were issued to a total
amount of 311 billion, the highest quarterly
figure since the outbreak of the crisis. Sales of
specialised credit institutions’ debt securities,
by contrast, were down distinctly on the
quarter ( 31/C252billion following 314 billion).
Domestic enterprises tapped the bond mar-
ket for a net 3311/C252billion during the quarter
under review, almost all of which involved the
issuance of longer-term instruments. The
main reason why this figure is exceptionally
high lies in a substantial securitisation trans-
action effected with the help of a domestic
special-purpose vehicle. By contrast, the
amount of short-term instruments outstand-
ing did not rise noticeably.
In the third quarter of 2008, non-resident in-
vestors were the main buyers of debt secur-
ities, as they have been virtually without inter-
ruption since July 2007, adding a total of
3351/C252billion worth of debt instruments to
their portfolios. Debt securities issued by the
private sector accounted for around one-fifth
of this figure. However, some of these cross-
border transactions represent certificates and
warrants created in Germany which were
sold en bloc to affiliated companies abroad
and held there, in most cases, until maturity.
Ultimately, only a fraction of documented
purchases by private investors are transacted

by contrast, were net sellers of interest-bearing securities. As in the preceding quar-ters, sales were attributable exclusively to do-mestic non-banks, who sold 321 billion worth
net of debt securities.
5Domestic credit insti-
tutions, by contrast, increased their bondmarket exposure by 34
1/C252billion. They sold
312 billion worth of public-sector debt secur-
ities and purchased 3251/C252billion worth of
corporate bonds, attributable mostly to theaforementioned substantial securitisationtransaction.
In July and August, stock price movements on
both sides of the Atlantic started out relative-ly moderate. Despite worries about the stabil-ity of the financial sector and growing scepti-cism about the state of the economy, marketparticipants greeted the announcement bythe US government of aid measures for thetwo largest US real estate finance companieswith a certain feeling of confidence, especial-ly given falling oil prices and the positivequarterly figures presented by some USbanks. However, in September, in the light ofthe insolvency of a major US investment bankand the danger of a collapse of other finan-cial institutions, this confidence gave way togrowing global concerns about the overallstate of the financial sector. European finan-cial stock prices have subsequently droppedby more than 30% again after having alreadylost more than a quarter of their value be-tween May and mid-July of this year. At thesame time, stock price uncertainty – as meas-ured by the implied volatility of stock options– peaked anew in major markets, surpassingthe previous all-time high it reached in 2002.The growing jitteriness was accompanied by
a further decline in risk appetite, which ultim-ately spread to the entire stock market.
The adopted government rescue packages
for the financial sector were very slow to takehold in the stock markets, as their implemen-tation is a time-consuming process and theoverall outlook continued to cloud over. Ac-cording to Consensus Economics surveys,growth expectations for the key economieshave been revised downwards by 1

in the USA and the euro area, with Japanese
shares trading, at last report, around 44%
lower than at the beginning of the year. How-
ever, twelve-months-ahead earnings expect-
ations were scaled back much less drastically
than stock prices collapsed.6As a result, the
price-earnings ratio based on expected earn-
ings for European and US shares fell sharplyto 7.4 and 9.8 respectively in October. These
lows reflect the fact that the equity risk pre-
mium has now reached a record high.
Issuing activity in the domestic stock market
picked up somewhat in the third quarter
compared with the two preceding quarters.
Domestic enterprises issued 351/C252billion
worth of new shares, the vast majority of
which were listed equities ( 34 billion). Sales
of foreign stocks on the German market were
somewhat lower ( 31 billion). Net purchasers
of stocks in the third quarter included resi-
dent non-banks ( 316 billion) as well as, to a
lesser extent, domestic credit institutions
(321/C252billion). Both groups purchased domes-
tic instruments to the virtual exclusion of for-
eign stocks. By contrast, non-resident invest-
ors reduced their holdings of German stocks
by a total of 312 billion.7
In the third quarter, domestic investment
companies recorded inflows of funds
amounting to 341/C252billion, following 34 bil-
lion in the preceding three-month period. The
inflows were channelled solely into special-
ised funds reserved for institutional investors
(371/C252billion); by contrast, funds open to the
general public were confronted with outflows
amounting to 33 billion. In the case of mutual
funds, fund units were redeemed in particular
by bond-based funds ( 331/C252billion), followed
by money market funds ( 311/C252billion) and

third quarter, mutual fund shares were pur-

Foreign direct investment
In the third quarter, foreign direct investment
resulted in net capital exports amounting to
just under 3101/C252billion. Capital outflows thus
stood well below their second-quarter level
(3301/C252billion).
German proprietors provided 3111/C252billion
worth of additional funds to their affiliated
enterprises abroad during the period under
review, as against 3361/C252billion in the preced-
ing three-month period. They thereby in-
creased their direct capital stakes in their for-
eign branches by just under 38 billion. This
also included a significant boost to a stake in
a Swedish motor vehicle manufacturer. In
addition, foreign affiliates’ reinvested earn-
ings ( 311 billion) played a significant role. By
contrast, intragroup loans led to net capital
imports ( 37 billion).Major items of the balance of

47Economic conditions
in GermanyMacroeconomic situation
The rapid cooling of the world economy and
the fact that underlying sentiment domestic-
ally is increasingly being characterised by cau-
tion and restraint have been placing a grow-
ing strain on the German economy since the
middle of this year. According to the Federal
Statistical Office’s flash estimate, seasonally
and calendar-adjusted real gross domestic
product (GDP) in the third quarter was 0.5%
down on the quarter. Year-on-year growth
was 0.8% in calendar-adjusted terms, com-
pared with 1.9% in the preceding three-
month period. This already takes into account
the fact that the figure for the first half of the
year was revised upwards slightly. While over-
all economic output in the first half of 2008 –
with the exception of some weather-related
special factors – had almost kept pace with
production potential, overall capacity utilisa-
tion has now shown a marked decline. Across
all sectors, however, activity is likely to have
remained in the area of normal capacity utili-
sation. Nevertheless, a further perceptible
slowdown appears likely in the fourth quar-
ter.
The German economy has been subject to
considerable external pressure since the third
quarter. Manufacturing was especially hard
hit by this; the quite sharp cyclical downturn
in some major sales markets meant that this
sector failed to gain any new stimuli. With
this in mind, enterprises made initial revisions
to their investment plans and employment
arrangements, which had been reasonably
clear-cut hitherto. During the reporting
period, there were no major signs of theMarked cooling

48financial market crisis having a major damp-
ening effect on the German economy in the
shape of more restrictive lending by domestic
banks. Consumer confidence was still consid-
erably impaired, not least because there was
little sign of any price-related easing of pres-
sure on purchasing power since July despite
the massive price adjustment in the inter-
national oil markets. Nevertheless, consumers
are likely to have used the comparatively
favourable purchase prices to restock their oil
inventories before the start of the winter
heating period. Enterprises, too, probably
took advantage of the easing in the energy
and commodity markets to stock up with
inputs and intermediary products.
Since most industrial raw materials as well as
energy come from abroad, there was a verysharp increase in imports in the third quarter.
In real terms, there is likely to have been a
seasonally adjusted 31/C252% growth in imports
of goods compared with the second quarter.
In purely nominal terms, foreign trade is also
likely to have clearly dampened the GDP re-
sult for the third quarter owing to a seasonal-
ly adjusted fall of approximately3/C254% in the
total volume of German exports of goods
during the same period following a moderate
decline in the second quarter. The fact that
export activity has been providing no stimulus
since the second quarter is also due to the
high degree of co-movement in the global-
ised economy. This meant that it was increas-
ingly difficult to offset the trend decline in
business activity with US and UK customers
that had prevailed for some time.
Export-oriented industry, having expanded
very strongly in the past few years as a result
of the global upswing, has recently been be-
having somewhat more cautiously owing to
the marked decline in demand for exports.
Given the first noticeable cuts in capacity util-
isation, there was no longer any immediate
necessity to step up fixed capital formation,
especially as there will – as usual – have been
a time lag before many newly acquired ma-
chines and equipment achieved their full cap-
acity effect in the current production process.
From a cyclical point of view, industrial invest-
ment is, in any case, likely to have entered a
mature stage. This is also revealed by the fact
that the corporate sector investment ratio (ie
the share of new machinery and equipment
as well as of newly constructed production
facilities and office buildings in value added)
in the first half of 2008 reached a level2000 = 100, seasonally adjusted

49matched only by the peaks of the last two in-
vestment cycles shortly after German reunifi-cation and in the year 2000. From a structuralpoint of view, there is nevertheless indeed acontinuing need to expand the capital stockin the corporate sector. This is because therehas been a gradual decline in capital intensityin the past few years, not least as a result ofthe expansionary practice in recruitment.This, in itself, has dampened the trend inlabour productivity, which means there is aneed to focus more on projects that boostproductivity.
This scenario is largely consistent with the
autumn survey of the German Chamber ofIndustry and Commerce (DIHK). The results ofthis show that the surveyed enterprises havemade a comparatively moderate adjustmentto their plans for investment and employmentdespite a quite strong downturn in businessand export expectations. In the third quarter,deliveries of machinery and equipment werestill at quite a high level, not least owing toinvestment decisions taken earlier. By con-trast, industrial construction investment inthe reporting period is likely to have roughlymatched the average volume achieved in thefirst half of 2008.
Households were faced with diverging factors
after mid-year. Above all, the abrupt reversalin crude oil prices is likely to have relievedconsumers of the concern that their dispos-able income would be increasingly limited bydisproportionately large rises in heating costsand spending on fuel. Against this backdrop,private consumption was probably able tostabilise in the summer months followingsevere price-related setbacks in the first half
of the year. Given the continuing positivetrend in the labour market and higher wagegrowth, the weak underlying trend in realconsumer spending together with the de-pressed propensity to purchase is neverthelessan indication of the fact that consumer confi-dence in Germany is still fragile.

50international financial markets, is evidently
reducing the willingness to purchase goods
which considerably restrict consumers’ finan-
cial scope or which entail payment obliga-
tions in the future. This mainly affects sales of
motor vehicles, with the reluctance to pur-
chase being reinforced by the political debate
on a reform of motor vehicle tax in Germany
and by European Commission plans to tight-
en climate protection provisions. Moreover,
uncertain income prospects and rising con-
struction costs are weighing down demand
for new housing. In line with this, owing to
the weak underlying trend in new housing
construction, residential investment in the
third quarter is hardly likely to have been any
higher in seasonally adjusted terms than in
the preceding quarter.
Sectoral trends
Despite a marked fall in demand since the be-
ginning of the year, industry reduced its vol-
ume of production comparatively moderately
in the third quarter – as it had done in the
second quarter. Output in the third quarter
was 11/C254% down on the quarter in seasonally
adjusted terms, with output in the second
quarter being 1% down on its peak in the
first quarter. This means that the cyclical de-
cline has been rather moderate in industry so
far. This is also shown by the fact that output
between April and September 2008 as a
whole was slightly higher than in the second
half of 2007. The calendar-adjusted figure
was1/C254% up on the year in the third quarter.

51now is that the expansion of production cap-
acity between 2005 and 2007 failed to keeppace with the very sharp growth in orders.This led to the formation of a stock of orderswhich is now being completed. Furthermore,a large number of major projects were com-missioned at the turn of 2007-08 and, natur-ally enough, the time taken to process themstretches over a number of months.
Accordingly, industrial capacity utilisation up
to the end of the period under review washigher than average, even though utilisation,according to the Ifo Institute, showed a no-ticeable decline in October for the first timein two years. This decline was due mainly to acutback in production by manufacturers ofcapital goods. Nevertheless, utilisation in thissector is still far above the longer-term aver-age. Despite moderate losses, the intermedi-ate goods industry was reporting above-average capacity utilisation up to the end ofthe period under review, while free capacitywas becoming apparent in the consumergoods sector in some cases.
Construction output stabilised at a low level
in the third quarter in seasonally adjustedterms. This followed a sharp decline in thesecond quarter, which was a technical reac-tion to the weather-related buoyant construc-tion activity in the winter months. In 2008,construction’s performance was better withregard to existing stock than in new construc-tion activity – a trend that has been observ-able for a number of years now. Seasonallyadjusted hours worked in the finishing tradesin the first half of 2008 showed an increaseof almost 6% on the second half of 2007. Bycontrast, total hours worked in construction,
which includes structural work on housing,virtually stagnated in the same period.
In the third quarter, commercial enterprises’
activity is likely to have picked up noticeablyfrom the setback in the preceding three-month period. Seasonally adjusted retail salesbetween June and September were largelyunchanged in real terms, but the wholesale2000 = 100, seasonally adjusted, quarterly

52trade was able to expand its business percep-
tibly during the reporting period. The trend
slowdown in the production sector is likely to
have affected at least some areas of business-
related services. According to the Ifo data,
the business confidence of the surveyed ser-
vices firms showed a further deterioration in
the third quarter. Temporary work agencies,
which have benefited considerably from the
upturn in the labour market over the past
few years, were not the only subsector to re-
vise their expectations downwards. According
to the survey conducted by Creditreform and
the Centre for European Economic Research
(ZEW), providers of IT and communications
services also reported lower turnover in the
third quarter.
Employment and unemployment
The labour market has held up quite well
overall against the backdrop of the economic
downturn. By the end of October, unemploy-
ment had declined fairly steadily to a season-
ally adjusted figure of 3.15 million. The un-
employment rate fell from 7.8% in mid-2008
to 7.5%. This figure reflects the fact that
alleviating demographic factors and statistical
revisions more or less offset each other.
(According to the estimates of the Institute
for Employment Research (IAB) in Nurem-
berg, the labour force is declining slightly in
2008, while, since the beginning of the year,
unemployed persons aged 58 and over have
been included in the official figure again and
are no longer counted as part of the “hidden
reserve”.) Roughly 70% of the decline in un-
employment was accounted for by job seek-ers receiving the basic welfare allowance. This
means that the (net) exit rate from unemploy-
ment among this group of persons – who
more often lack certain training and skills,
have been unemployed for a lengthy period
of time, and typically have major gaps in their
work history – was just as high as for those
persons receiving unemployment benefits
under the statutory insurance scheme.
According to initial estimates by the Federal
Statistical Office, employment, too, showed a
further increase up to September, being
0.3% up on the June level. There was a simi-
larly sharp growth on a quarterly average,
and the figure for the second quarter was
1.5% up on the year. Although employment
growth in industry came to a halt, and the
decline continued in the construction sector,
there was a further increase in staffing levels
in the services sector. Employment creation
measures accounted for a growing part of
the increase. One factor in the still positive
overall trend in employment is that the eco-
nomic outlook did not start to become signifi-
cantly gloomier until October. However, the
continuing high level of vacancies (a season-
ally adjusted 572,000 vacancies were regis-
tered with the labour exchanges in mid-
October) and the long vacancy periods (in
October, positions reported as having been
filled had been vacant for an average of
64 days) indicate a considerable unsatisfied
demand for labour as well as difficulties in
recruitment. (See the explanatory notes on

53matching process.)1A cyclically induced mod-
erate increase in the number of jobseekers istherefore not necessarily reflected fully inhigher unemployment figures provided thejobseekers match the vacancies’ job profileand are sufficiently mobile.
Between the start of the year and August
(more recent data are unavailable at present),the increase in employment in the cases ofbusiness services (which includes labour leas-ing) slowed down and finally came to astandstill. Furthermore, reports that firmswant to reduce the scale of temporary em-ployment are becoming more frequent. Thismeans that setbacks might be experienced inthis sector, which has contributed aroundtwo-fifths to the expansion in employmentsubject to social security contributions sincethe beginning of 2006. On the other hand,given the problems in filling vacancies, firmswill attempt to keep their core staff even in adifficult economic setting. Such behaviour islikely to be made easier by the working hoursaccounts that were filled up in the period ofcyclical capacity overutilisation and the factthat short-time working benefits have recent-ly been extended from 12 to 18 months. Thisis also suggested by the survey of the GermanChamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK).Its findings were that the number of firmsplanning additional recruitment was lowerthan in the second quarter and that morefirms were intending to adjust staffing levels.Seasonally adjusted, quarterly

54Deuts che Bun desbankImprove d mat chin g on the la bour market? – Evi dence from the Beveri dge curve
Despite the sharp decline in unemployment over the past 
few years, almost 3 million people were still lookin g for pai d 
work in Germany in the thir d quarter of 2008. A ccording 
to a survey by the Institute for Employment Resear ch (IAB), 
there were approximately 800,000 imme diate jo b va cancies 
durin g the same perio d. If enterprises have to spen d consi d-
era ble time lookin g for suita bly qualiﬁ ed workers despite 
the hi gh level of unemployment an d if unemploye d persons 
are havin g difﬁ culty ﬁ  nding a jo b despite a lar ge num ber 
of va cancies, it is a si gn that there are serious mat chin g 
pro blems on the la bour market.
The Beveri dge curve, whi ch shows the relationship between 
the jo b va cancy rate an d the unemployment rate, provi des 
an in dication of the quality of the pla cement fun ction of 
the la bour market.1 As a rule, a re duction in unemployment 
is a ccompanie d by an in crease in jo b va cancies because, as 
the employment rate rises, the balan ce between supply an d 
deman d becomes more difﬁ cult. In a cyclical re covery phase, 
moreover, new jo bs are create d faster than they can be ﬁ lle d. 
At the same time, the num ber of unemploye d can a ctually 
continue to rise for a time while the num ber of va cancies is 
alrea dy in creasin g. At a later phase of the upturn pre cisely 
the opposite is true: va cancies are ﬁ  lle d mu ch more quickly 
than new jo bs can be create d, with the result that there is 
a ten dency for the num ber of va cancies to start showin g 
a decline while unemployment is still fallin g. Ideally, these 
loops in the Beveri dge curve return to their startin g point 
at the en d of the cycle. However, this did not happen in the 
ﬁ rst cycle illustrate d in the a ccompanyin g chart.2 Instea d, 
there was an untypi cally sharp in crease in the num ber of 
vacancies towar ds the en d of the upswin g in the year 2000 
but no si gniﬁ cant further re duction in unemployment, 
with the result that there was no return towar ds the start-
ing point either. Instea d, the loops of the Beveri dge curve 
shifte d further away from the ori gin, as it ha d done in the 
1970s an d 1980s. This is a si gn that stru ctural unemployment 
is in creasin g.
The present cycle is more in line with the i deal type. Both the 
num ber of va cancies an d the level of unemployment have 
been fallin g sin ce the en d of 200 6. Furthermore, this move-ment is so pronoun ced that the last shift in the Beveri dge 
curve to the ri ght seems to have been lar gely reverse d. The 
reasons for this can be seen both in the stru cture of the 
present cycle an d in the chan ge in the un derlyin g la bour 
market poli cy framework.
The last two expansionary phases differ su bstantially with 
respe ct to their se ctoral conﬁ gurations. The New E conomy 
boom was heavily servi ce-oriente d. In the nine quarters up to 
the thir d quarter of 2000 employment in the tertiary se ctor 
increase d by 6.6% while it decline d by 2.2 % in the pro duc-
tion se ctor. The upswin g in the past few years, by contrast, 
was driven to a greater extent by in dustry. Despite the fa ct 
that the rapi dly risin g num ber of temporary workers are fully 
capture d statisti cally in the servi ces se ctor, many of them 
are pla ced in in dustry. Employment in the pro duction se ctor 
increase d by 2.5 % between the ﬁ  rst quarter of 200 6 an d the 
secon d quarter of 2008. In the servi ces se ctor the in crease 
amounte d to 4.1 %. This means that the spee d of stru ctural 
chan ge towar ds the tertiary se ctor was mu ch slower than in 
the re covery perio d earlier. This mi ght have been important 
with respe ct to the balan ce between supply an d deman d on 
the la bour market in that differen ces in qualiﬁ cations an d 
other impe diments to the mo bility of la bour, espe cially in 
the event of an a ccelerate d sectoral stru ctural chan ge, coul d 
have playe d a less si gniﬁ cant role in the present upturn. The 
rapi d chan ge in the se ctoral stru cture an d the stron ger move 
towar ds new servi ces at the en d of the 1990s, however, 
coul d have ha d a greater limitation on the appli cation of 
spe ciﬁ c knowle dge an d skills. Developments on the supply 
side, whi ch remaine d lar gely un chan ged in their extent, 
likewise ha d an alleviatin g effe ct whereas in the pre ceding 
perio d there ha d still been discerni ble growth. 
The balan ce between supply an d deman d on the la bour 
market has also been assiste d by the la bour market poli cy 
reforms of the past few years. This is parti cularly true of the 
lar ge-s cale dere gulation of temporary employment. Hirin g

56Nevertheless, neutral plans for employment
predominated on the whole. Furthermore,
the Ifo employment barometer, which showed
a clear fall in recent months, is still just within
the neutral range.
Wages and prices
In the third quarter, no new pay agreements
of significance for the economy as whole
were concluded; negotiated wages rose
3.0% on the year owing to pay increases that
had been agreed earlier. Despite obviously
higher rates of increase in regular monthly
pay, the figure was only 1.7% in the second
quarter, which was due to a smaller number
of collectively agreed one-off payments being
scheduled than in the same period of 2007.Owing to new one-off payments in the
metal-working industry, this effect was no
longer operative in the third quarter. At
3.2%, negotiated basic rates of pay were, in
fact, somewhat lower than one year earlier.
This was due to the fact that older agree-
ments which ran for more than one year and
were still in force often provided for smaller
increases at the end of the agreement’s dur-
ation than at the beginning.
In November, wage bargainers in the metal-
working and electrical engineering industries
of Baden-W/C252rttemberg concluded a new pay
agreement with a duration of 18 months. In
addition to one-off payments (initially 3510
followed by a further 3122 later), permanent
pay increases amounting each time to 2.1%
are scheduled for both February and May
2009. The second stage of the pay increase
as well as the second one-off payment can be
deferred or shortened by up to seven months
by in-house agreement. With the high one-
off payment, the negotiating parties, first,
took due account of the fact that business
conditions were still positive in this sector.
Second, the long duration of the agreement
increased firms’ planning certainty, and the
scope for adjustment at firm level made ad-
vance provision for more difficult times. This
agreement has since been adopted by other
wage-bargaining areas.
The third quarter saw a turnaround in the
price trend on the import side. Although the
cost of imports was still 1.3% up on the pre-
ceding period on a quarterly average, prices
went down by 1.6% over the course of the
quarter. This was due mainly to the sharpYear-on-year change, on monthly basis

57price adjustment in the international oil mar-
kets. As a result, the cost of energy importsfell by 8.6% in the period from June to Sep-tember. The price trend for other importedgoods was noticeably less favourable, thedepreciation of the euro being a contributoryfactor. There was a quarter-on-quarter in-crease in the upward pressure on prices ofintermediate goods and consumer goods.The decline in the cost of capital goods cameto a standstill. The year-on-year increase inimport prices, excluding energy, went upfrom 0.6% to 1.7%. If energy is included, theyear-on-year figure went up from +7.5% to+8.7%. As the overall rise in import priceswas somewhat larger than the increase in ex-port prices, there was a seasonally adjusteddeterioration in the terms of trade of 0.4%on the quarter. In year-on-year terms, thefigure was -5.2%.
At the domestic industrial producer level,
however, there was a further, albeit compara-tively moderate price increase over the quar-ter. On an average of the three months, therise in seasonally adjusted domestic sellingprices, at 2.9%, was even somewhat largerthan in the preceding quarter, and the annualrate of increase went up from 6.0% to 8.5%.The difference between the trend in domesticfactory gate prices and the price trend for im-ports are due partly to the reduced weight ofcrude oil and of refined petroleum products(50.3‰ compared with 73.2‰). If energy isexcluded, domestic selling prices went up bya seasonally adjusted 1.3% on the quarter,which was the sharpest increase for a longtime.

58second quarter. Upward pressure increased
especially on the prices of intermediate goods
and capital goods. Consumer goods inflation
flattened out somewhat, mainly because of
falling food prices. Farm gate prices showed a
further fall in the third quarter in seasonally
adjusted terms after easing markedly in the
second quarter. Baseline effects also meant
that the year-on-year increase went down
from just over 12% to 1.5%. Rising input
prices were one reason for construction prices
being raised by 1.3% on the quarter; the
year-on-year increase was thus 4.0%.
There was initially still no major relief at the
consumer level. Although the seasonally ad-
justed rise in prices was no more than rela-
tively subdued during the third quarter, at
0.4%, there was still a sharp increase of
0.7% on average, which was hardly any less
sharp than in the second quarter. That price
developments were not more favourable was
also due to the alleviating effects of adjust-
ments to crude oil prices coinciding with
lagged effects of earlier increases in the cost
of crude oil. Although the prices of refined
petroleum products fell by 6.0% over the
quarter, gas prices were simultaneously raised
by 7.3%. Moreover, there were sharper sea-
sonal price increases for clothing than in pre-
vious years, not least on account of the euro’s
depreciation in the international foreign ex-
change markets. Finally, the expected correc-
tions to food prices in view of the downward
price trend in the world markets largely failed
to materialise. Nevertheless, the year-on-year
increase in the national consumer price index
(CPI) went down from 3.3% in mid-2008 to
2.9% in September. On a quarterly average,prices went up by 3.1% on the year, com-
pared with an increase of 2.9% in the second
quarter. The annual rate of the Harmonised
Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), which is cal-
culated in accordance with European stand-
ards, went up from 3.0% to 3.3%.2
In seasonally adjusted terms, the purchasing
power of the euro increased somewhat in
October, mainly as a result of lower prices for
fuel and heating oil. By contrast, further pro-
viders raised gas prices sharply. Moreover,
there were increases in the prices of food
again. As in previous months, the depreci-
ation of the euro had a noticeably adverse im-
pact in the case of industrial goods. The mod-
erate price trend in services and housing rents
continued, supported by the abolition/lower-
ing of tuition fees in two federal states. Over-
all, the year-on-year rise in consumer prices
according to the CPI was 2.4%. The HICP
figure was +2.5%. Not least owing to the
ongoing corrections in the international com-
modity markets and to positive baseline
effects, a further marked decline in the rate
of inflation is to be expected in November.

59too, which are major sales markets for the
regionally broadly based German economy,have now been affected. The repercussionsare now also overshadowing the economiccatching-up process in the emerging marketeconomies and in the transition countries ofcentral and eastern Europe, from which Ger-man exporters have been benefiting stronglyup to now. The resulting weakness in de-mand will discernibly dampen economic ac-tivity in Germany, especially as significant do-mestic impulses are not to be expected in theshort term. As time goes on, the fact thatthere has recently been a massive reductionin the cost of energy and raw materials mighthave a noticeably positive effect, however. Inaddition, the sales outlook for German goodsin overseas markets has, in itself, improvedsomewhat owing to the fact that the eurohas depreciated very sharply since mid-Julyagainst both the US dollar and the Japaneseyen. Finally, the governments of a number ofcountries most affected by the economic set-backs have also taken measures with the aimof preventing a slide into severe recession.
Export business must be expected to be quite
unfavourable in the winter months. Accord-ing to the surveys of the Ifo Institute, exportexpectations for the next three months inmanufacturing have been deterioratingsharply since the middle of the year and wereclearly contractionary in October. Given themajor role which export customers play formost of German industry, it is understandablethat such a massive worsening of the short-term outlook for exports has also had an im-pact on business expectations overall.

60the survey results, however, is the notable dis-
crepancy between assessments of the busi-
ness situation and expectations – a discrep-
ancy which became even wider after the es-
calation of the international financial market
crisis in September. This might also reflect the
much higher uncertainty with regard to the
real economic implications of this unpredict-
able risk factor. The Federal government’s
package of measures to stabilise the German
financial system, which has the objective of
restoring orderly business activity in the finan-
cial markets, has a key role in preventing
home-grown financial problems from aggra-
vating the current external strains on the Ger-
man economy.
The substantial deterioration in short-term
sales expectations, as revealed by the senti-
ment indicators, is consistent with the trend
decline in the volume of industrial orders
since the beginning of 2008. Seasonally ad-
justed orders, at 33/C254%, were quite clearly
down on the quarter in the summer months.
This followed considerable falls in the first
two quarters of the year. While the fall was
comparatively moderate in the case of inter-
mediate goods and consumer goods, the
second and third quarters saw a sharp overall
drop in demand for capital goods. It should
be remembered, however, that the flow of
orders in the final quarter of 2007 and the
first quarter of 2008 was characterised to an
exceptional extent by large-volume invest-
ment projects, especially from export custom-
ers. In purely nominal terms, one-half of the
decline in orders of capital goods between
April and September 2008 – a fall of almost
81/C252% on the preceding six-month period inseasonally adjusted terms – was due to the
volume of large orders returning to a normal
pattern.
The weak flow of orders placed with order-
based industry over the past few months has
led to a marked decline in the reserves of
orders. In terms of production, however,
there is still the option of compensating for
the lack of new orders by processing orders
that are already on the books. This is also
shown by the fact that the reach of the order
books has declined only slightly so far accord-
ing to the Ifo business survey, while the as-
sessment of order backlogs – which is per-
haps characterised more by the current flow
of orders – has become noticeably less posi-
tive. Sectors of industry in which there is usu-
ally a short lead time before production are
likely to cut back their output quite clearly in
the near future, however. Given the marked
slowdown in sales, much the same applies to
the motor vehicle industry and suppliers of
motor vehicle parts.
On 5 November, against the backdrop of the
increasing deterioration of the overall eco-
nomic situation, the Federal government
adopted a package of measures designed to
counter the economic slowdown and safe-
guard jobs. These measures comprise fiscal
policy instruments and increased funding for
lending programmes for the years 2009 and
2010. Their main aim is to strengthen and/or
stimulate private and public investment. Sales
of new cars are also being promoted by a
temporary lifting of motor vehicle tax. A

61fects on the macroeconomic process is called
for depending on the type and scale of theparticular measure taken. Experience of earl-ier stimulus packages and simulations usingeconometric models would lead to the ex-pectation, if anything, of a limited effect interms of the economy as a whole. There isthe potential for a stabilising effect on theconstruction sector, however.
The fairly robust labour market situation up
to the end of the period under review giveshope that the current slowdown in the Ger-man economy will not lead into a self-reinfor-cing and persistent downswing. The fact thatmany enterprises are prepared to maintaintheir core staffing levels, given well-stockedworking hours accounts and the continuingacute shortage of skilled labour, not only, initself, supports households’ income situation,it also reduces the risk of job losses thatusually dampens the propensity to consume.This stabilising element will be countered by
the fact that the necessary adjustment in thefirms’ workforce can be implemented quiterapidly at present owing to the higher level oflabour leasing and temporary employment.Firms’ strategy of initially not making – gener-ally expensive – adjustments to their corestaffing levels is likely to change if the cost ofmaintaining jobs increases. Continued wagepolicy moderation will therefore not onlysafeguard the substantial success of recentyears on the labour market, it will also lowerthe risk of downward cyclical pressure that isprimarily domestic in origin. The markedlybrighter price climate also offers the prospectof households’ real incomes no longer beingas strongly affected by inflation-related lossesfor the foreseeable future. For enterprises,too, cost pressure is likely to have eased per-ceptibly recently, the rise in the cost of mater-ials having severely reduced enterprises’ earn-ings earlier in 2008.

this is the positive cyclical momentum on an
annual average following the economy’s
strong performance in the first quarter. How-
ever, there is particular uncertainty with re-
gard to the support measures for financial in-
stitutions (see the box on pages 64-65). In
this context, it also cannot be ruled out that,
rather than recording a further marked de-
cline, which would otherwise be expected,
the debt ratio will increase.
Government revenue is expected to, at most,
decline slightly in relation to GDP during the
course of 2008. On the one hand, legislative
changes have led to significant revenue short-
falls. The business tax reform and a further
cut in the contribution rate of the Federal Em-
ployment Agency from 4.2% to 3.3% have
resulted in substantial revenue shortfalls, only
a fraction of which will be offset by the rising
contribution rates to the statutory health and
public long-term care insurance schemes. On
the other hand, the exceptionally robust

63growth trend in revenue from profit-related
taxes (after adjustment for legislative changesand cyclical influences), which has been evi-dent for several years now, has thus far con-tinued. In addition, the revenue ratio is likelyto be bolstered by the fact that the highrevenue-yielding source of gross wages andsalaries is increasing at a more rapid pacethan nominal GDP for the first time since theyear 2000. Wage tax receipts will be boostedin addition by tax progression effects, particu-larly following the relatively high wage settle-ments.
The government expenditure ratio is likely to
fall markedly again in 2008, albeit more mod-erately than in previous years. Alongside therelatively high average nominal GDP growth,which reduces the ratio via the denominator,in particular the declining number of un-employed persons is leading to lower expend-iture. Furthermore, the moderate wagegrowth of the past few years is continuing tohave a dampening effect because there is atime-lag before many government expenses(for example, pensions) are adjusted to thewage trend. By contrast, strong expendituregrowth is expected for government invest-ment and in the healthcare sector.
The public finance situation will probably de-
teriorate noticeably in the coming year, result-ing in a renewed deficit. In a baseline scen-ario, which includes recently agreed fiscalmeasures and a marked decline in revenuefrom profit-related taxes but excludes add-itional spending in connection with govern-ment support measures for financial institu-tions, the deficit could reach sizeable propor-tions. It should be noted that, although the
overall course of macroeconomic develop-ment next year is currently expected to beweak, a particularly beneficial economicgrowth profile can be assumed from thepoint of view of the general governmentbudgets. However, there are also consider-able aggregate risks. Firstly, the macroeco-nomic outlook and the impact of the govern-ment support measures for the financial mar-kets are very uncertain. Secondly, the current-ly high level of revenue from profit-relatedtaxes harbours greater setback potential.
The revenue ratio may stay roughly at its
2008 level, even assuming that revenue fromprofit-related taxes returns to a normal level.For one thing, progression-related additionaltax receipts are also expected in 2009, whilegross wages and salaries could once againrise more rapidly than nominal gross domesticproduct. Lastly, an amendment to the finan-cing of the EU budget, that was agreed in2007 and is provisionally planned to be imple-mented in 2009, means that Germany has totransfer less turnover tax revenue (but moreresources based on gross national income,which are recorded on the expenditure side)to the EU, thus leaving central governmentwith higher tax receipts. This effect will beparticularly pronounced in 2009, as backpay-ments from 2007 and 2008 are also expect-ed. By contrast, increases and decreases intax and social contribution rates are likely tolargely cancel each other out. A further cut inthe contribution rate of the Federal Employ-ment Agency by

other tax breaks will be more or less offset byrising contribution rates to the statutoryExpenditure

64Deutsche BundesbankThe impact of the financial market crisis on public finances
The current crisis on the financial markets is also impacting
on the development of public finances. At present, however,
these effects cannot be quantified reliably. This box first out-
lines the various impact channels and then describes how the
corresponding amounts are recorded statistically. Direct
assistance is recorded differently in the budgetary accounts
(government’s financial statistics) and in the national ac-
counts, which are used as a basis for assessing the Maastricht
criteria for the deficit and debt levels agreed in the EU.
The channels through which the financial market crisis is
influencing public finances
Indirect effects on the real economy
To the extent that the financial market crisis impairs real eco-
nomic growth and, therefore, also the macroeconomic refer-
ence variables for taxes and social contributions (especially
corporate earnings, wages and salaries, and consumption),
government revenue will be lower. Moreover, government
expenditure will increase if unemployment rises. In addition,
government interest expenditure and property income may
be affected.
Particular impact on revenue from profit-related taxes
Another possible consequence are substantial revenue short-
falls that may be independent of the macroeconomic refer-
ence variables which are usually used for taxes. Thus the
annual development of the national accounts variable
“entrepreneurial and property income” deviates in part sig-
nificantly from that of the actual assessment base for profit-
related taxes. For example, write-downs on impaired assets
are not recognised in the national accounts variable but they
may still be relevant for tax revenue. However, the massive
write-downs in the financial sector that are currently being
talked about would have no (direct) effect on tax revenue if
the profits were not first taxed in Germany or if high tax-loss
carryforwards already existed. The development of profit-
related taxes, which has, on the whole, been favourable so
far this year, indicates that the financial market crisis has
resulted at most in small tax shortfalls, at least up to October.
In the coming year – according to the official tax estimate –
profit-related taxes are expected to decline in a counter-
movement to the sharp growth in revenue in the past few
years. Even in retrospect, however, it is still likely to be hard
to quantify the direct impact of the financial market crisis on
revenue.Direct government support measures for financial
institutions
Public sector support measures for financial institutions
ultimately mean that public finances could be affected dir-
ectly. This is true for recapitalisations or purchases of im-
paired assets, for example. However, it is also possible for
public entities to issue guarantees, which do not lead directly
to payments. Such measures may be carried out via central,
state and local government’s core budgets but also via spe-
cial funds, public (financial) enterprises or special-purpose
vehicles.
Recording of support measures for financial institutions in
general government budgets and government accounts
Recording in general government budgetary accounts
The government stabilisation measures are in part recorded
differently in central, state and local government’s individual
budgets and in the government’s financial statistics than
they are in the government accounts within the national ac-
counts. Thus, in 2007 support measures did not give rise to
any payments from the Federal budget, and in the current
year only one capital transfer of 51.2 billion has been record-
ed so far to the KfW Group in connection with support meas-
ures for IKB Bank. Future burdens could arise from central
government guarantees in connection with the sale of IKB
Bank and support measures for HypoRealEstate if these re-
sult in payment obligations. Support measures undertaken
to date by state government for financial institutions which
they own have placed little strain on state government
finances. Total guarantees of 57 billion for the Landesbanken
in Saxony and in North Rhine-Westphalia have evidently
been drawn only to a limited extent so far, and the capital
injection of 51/C252billion to HSH Nordbank was financed out-
side the core budgets of Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg.
Further support measures are likely to come mainly from the
Financial Market Stabilisation Fund, which was set up in Oc-
tober as a Federal (ie central government) special fund. The
Fund’s entire expenditure on recapitalisations, asset pur-
chases and interest is classified as budgetary expenditure and
therefore included in the special fund’s deficit. Guarantees
are not recorded as increasing the deficits until they actually
result in cash flows. Any interest income, fees from issuing
guarantees and subsequent proceeds from the sale of partici-
pating interests and asset disposals will improve the Fund’s
fiscal balance. If the Fund (and therefore general govern-
ment) incurs debt, this will be recorded in the government’s
financial statistics if the Fund finances this debt by borrow-
ing. The Fund’s activities will be recorded in the core budgets
only after it has been liquidated, that is if there are addition-
al debt servicing costs owing to accumulated debt. The legis-

tween central and state government in the ratio of 65:35, al-though state government’s participation is limited to a max-imum amount of 57.7 billion.
1
Recording in the national accounts (Maastricht criteria for
general government)
The Maastricht criteria are based on the national accounts
and the supplementary information contained in the “ESA95 manual on government deficit and debt” issued by the EUstatistics authority, Eurostat. They record general govern-ment in its entirety, including special funds (ie including theFinancial Market Stabilisation Fund) and any associated en-tities. Figures are shown in line with reporting rules harmon-ised at European level, and it is on this basis that the budget-ary accounts data are transferred to the national accounts.
In contrast to the budgetary accounts, transactions involving
government financial assets, as a rule, do not have an impacton the deficit in the national accounts. Purchasing or sellinga participating interest or another type of financial asset,therefore, normally does not affect the national accountsbalance. One exception to this is if the purchase price or theexpected return on the investment is not in line with marketprices. However, the EU’s rules on competition set strict limitsfor such capital injections at preferential rates that are to beclassified (at least partially) as deficit-increasing capital trans-fers. By contrast, the effect of the above-mentioned financialtransactions on the debt level is usually consistent with thatstated in the government’s financial statistics.
Guarantees are treated as contingent liabilities in the nation-
al accounts, too, and so are generally not recorded as ex-penditure until they are actually drawn on. However, accord-ing to Eurostat, government guarantees to financially dis-tressed enterprises that would not have access to capital mar-kets without such support and that are highly likely to make(partial) use of such guarantees are to be recorded – unlikein the financial statistics – as increasing the debt level as soonas they are issued. The amount of the guarantee that isexpected to be drawn is then to be recorded as a deficit-increasing capital transfer. Public bodies that take on im-paired assets from financial institutions and which are pro-tected from losses by government guarantees are ascribed tothe government sector along with their debts. The effectthat taking on impaired assets has on the deficit correspondsto the difference between the assets’ purchase price andtheir market price.
In the national accounts, transactions and entities are as-
signed to the government to a greater extent than in thebudgetary accounts. If they are assigned to the governmentsector, then the rules outlined above apply to the way inwhich deficit and debt are recorded. This means, for
instance, that the national accounts deficit rises if a publicenterprise incurs an expenditure which is identified as atransfer carried out on behalf of general government. In thiscase, the debt level likewise generally increases if it is notpossible to offset this amount against a withdrawal of equitycapital by the government.
However, in specific cases, recording is subject to uncertainty.
On the one hand, this is due to the fact that individual casesare sometimes extremely complex and the statisticians donot always have all of the relevant information available. Onthe other hand, the accounting rules themselves are not al-ways detailed enough to be able to classify each individualcase unambiguously.
2Against this backdrop, Eurostat, in par-
ticular, is charged with the important task – at the Europeanlevel and independent of any political considerations – ofdocumenting strains on government budgets in the statisticsand combating “creative accounting” by means of suitablebasic principles. A solid statistical basis is a key requirementfor the proper application of budgetary rules at Europeanlevel and is also essential for assessing the development ofpublic finances at national level.
Since the first rescue package for IKB Bank at the end of July
2007, a number of banks in Germany have received supportfrom central government, individual state governments orpublic sector financial institutions commissioned by generalgovernment. The Federal Statistical Office, in consultationwith Eurostat, has recorded central government supportmeasures of 57.3 billion as increasing the deficit in the na-
tional accounts for 2007. Ultimately, this had little impact onthe debt level. As KfW’s support measures for IKB Bank in2007 mainly reflected a decrease in KfW’s capital position bythe end of the accounting year, government debt rose onlymarginally. Instead, the stock of government financial assets– the participating interest in the KfW – decreased. For thefirst six months of 2008 the effect on the deficit amounts sofar to 53
1/C252billion. As regards the debt level, there has not
yet been a final decision as to whether borrowing in theorder of 540 billion that was taken up in connection with the
special-purpose vehicles established to support SachsenLBand WestLB should be allocated to the Maastricht debt level.It is currently uncertain which individual burdens will arise inthe second half of 2008 owing to the rescue package forHypoRealEstate, additional assistance for the Landesbankenand to the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund, which is allo-cated to the government sector.
ment support measures for financial institutions are currently being
discussed in a statistical task force.

effect of the increase in mid-2008 – the pub-
lic long-term care insurance scheme.
Owing to unfavourable cyclical influences,
the expenditure ratio will increase again in
2009 for the first time since 2003. However,
growth in expenditure is likely to accelerate
markedly for non-cyclical reasons, too. For ex-
ample, exceptionally strong growth in health-
care spending is expected, not least owing to
new arrangements for the remuneration of
outpatient treatment and hospital financing.
Furthermore, government investment will
probably once again be stepped up notice-
ably. Finally, the above-mentioned change in
EU financing arrangements means that Ger-
many will have to make higher own resource
payments, which are based on gross national
income and are recorded on the expenditure
side.2
The German government has responded to
the economic slowdown using a number of
different instruments assembled in a fiscal
stabilisation programme. It is important to
bear in mind that, irrespective of this, exten-
sive contributions to steadying the level of
economic activity are already being made. By
means of the financial market stabilisation
measures, fiscal policymakers have helped to
avert the danger of a systemic financial crisis
in Germany. Monetary policymakers are mak-
ing a contribution through a wide range of
interest rate and liquidity policy operations.
While the supplementary fiscal measures,
which are currently going through the parlia-
mentary process, could provide a certain add-
itional economic impetus, their influenceshould not be overestimated. Attempts by
general government to actively fine-tune eco-
nomic policy inevitably entail substantial
problems and are at most appropriate in
uniquely identifiable exceptional circum-
stances.
The fundamental objective of achieving a
structurally balanced general government
budget in the medium term, as well as sound
public finances, should not be abandoned
despite the recent developments. This will
generally not limit the effect of the automatic
stabilisers. Moreover, if the economic situ-
ation proves very unfavourable, further unex-
pected tax shortfalls could initially also be ab-
sorbed at present in Germany – in line with
the European fiscal framework (see box on
page 67). This would exploit the considerable
potential for automatic stabilisation. The fis-
cal consolidation achieved in recent years
means that Germany has a certain radius of
action without risking a breach of the 3%
deficit limit. Substantial fiscal stabilisation
programmes might be warranted if an extra-
ordinary recession were thought likely. Pos-
sible unfunded measures to boost the econ-
omy should be of limited duration and should
avoid causing unnecessary distortions of eco-
nomic activity. In particular, substantial
growth losses could ensue in the longer term
in the event of a stampede to grant (sector-)
specific subsidies at national and international
levels, thereby distorting competition. In any
case, once the downturn has been overcome,
measures should rapidly be introduced to

67Budgetary rules and the financial market crisis
The Treaty establishing the European Community,
and the Stability and Growth Pact agreed commonrules for EU countries’ fiscal policy. The essentialaim of these provisions is to ensure sound publicfinances in the EU. The financial market crisis andits subsequent effects on the real economy couldplace strains on public finances. However, this doesnot invalidate the European fiscal rules. These pro-vide enough flexibility to deal even with the cur-rent very unusual circumstances. Thus, fiscal supportto financial institutions to fend off a systemic finan-cial market crisis is, in principle, compatible withthe provisions. Even in a serious economic down-turn, observing the rules generally does not requirea fiscal policy stance that amplifies recessionary eco-nomic developments.
In particular those countries that have achieved a
sound fiscal position, ie a close-to-balance budgetor a surplus and a low debt ratio, are well equippedto withstand the current fiscal challenges. The auto-matic stabilisers can freely take effect and, in mostcases, additional amounts can be spent as part ofsupport measures for financial institutions withoutthis exceeding the 3% ceiling for the deficit ratio.Moreover, support measures in the form of guaran-tees and recapitalisations are often likely to be onlypartly deficit-increasing (see box on pages 64 and 65).However, countries that – in breach of the agree-ments – have failed to achieve their structuralbudgetary objective in good times and, for ex-ample, have neglected to use unexpected revenuegrowth in the past few years for consolidation havea much smaller budgetary room for manoeuvrethan countries with a sustainable starting position.If the deficit ceiling were to be exceeded during thecurrent crisis, the following three factors, in particu-lar, would have to be examined before an excessivedeficit procedure is launched: whether the over-shooting is clearly attributable to direct support forfinancial institutions or to a major economic down-turn, whether it is temporary and whether the def-icit ratio remains close to the reference value.
It is precisely in times of crisis that one sees just how
quickly and radically confidence is lost and the mar-ket players’ assessment of a country’s risk profileand fiscal situation can change. This underlines theimportance of the requirement that all countriesrapidly achieve a sound fiscal position once theyhave overcome the financial market crisis so as to
safeguard long-term fiscal sustainability. The needfor credible fiscal rules in the EU and in the monet-ary union has recently been emphatically under-scored.
This experience is also of relevance for the current
fiscal policy debate in Germany. The stronger an-choring of the aim of achieving a structurally bal-anced budget, which was high up on the agenda ofthe Federalism Reform Commission II, has recentlybeen eclipsed by current issues. What is more, thereare now some calls for central government to aban-don its medium-term budgetary objectives alto-gether. However, this does not appear warranted. Itshould be noted that exceptional circumstances,such as the danger of a systemic banking crisis, canbe overcome within the fiscal framework that is cur-rently being discussed. The extraordinary expend-iture on support measures is likely to be predomin-antly temporary and to be initially reflected primar-ily in the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund thatwas established to manage the financial marketcrisis outside of the core budgets.
1In addition, it
must also be borne in mind that the anchoring of astructurally balanced budget in budgetary legisla-tion would also take due account of the respectivecyclical situation. For example, deficits in a givenyear would be in line with this objective if they re-sult from the effect of the automatic stabilisers andare therefore temporary. Furthermore, consider-ation could also be given to temporarily toleratingunexpected developments in tax revenue that ex-ceed the presumed effect of the automatic stabil-isers subject to a rule-based provision ensuring thatthey will be offset in the following years.
2
Plans to reform national budgetary rules shouldtherefore not be abandoned. Ultimately, the crucialfactor is that the rules take fiscal policy require-ments into account even in exceptional circum-stances and, at the same time, that they safeguarda sustainable budgetary policy. This includes ensur-ing that any structural aberrations are promptlycorrected as soon as the situation returns to normal.A symmetric approach, designed to prevent furtherdebt accumulation, requires not only that deficitsare permitted in bad times but also that surplusesare achieved in good times.
1This expenditure, even if it is not clearly shown in the
core budgetary accounts at first, represents a financial bur-den on general government. However, once the Fund hasbeen liquidated, any accumulated debt will be transferredto the core budgets, out of which the resulting interestpayments would have to be financed. To keep this debt toa minimum, it is essential that resources are used
efficiently, on the one hand to ensure the stability of thefinancial market but, on the other hand, to take adequateconsideration of the fiscal burden resulting from thesemeasures. — 2See the reference in footnote 8 on page 72.

Budgetary development of central, state
and local government
Tax revenue
Tax revenue3rose markedly by 4% in the
third quarter compared with the same period
last year (see the chart on page 69 and the
table on page 70). As in the preceding quar-
ters, revenue from income-related taxes in-
creased sharply (+7%). Wage tax receipts
grew considerably, owing to the increase in
gross wages and salaries – including tax pro-
gression effects – but also the reduction in
child benefit payments, which are deducted
from cash receipts. Once again, assessed in-
come tax recorded a particularly strong in-
crease. In addition to buoyant underlying dy-
namics, lower refunds to employees made a
crucial contribution to this development. In-
vestment income tax payments (particularly
on interest and dividend income) also rose
substantially. By contrast, corporation tax rev-
enue fell sharply, which was connected with
the disbursement of corporation tax credits
which accrued prior to 2001,4as well as with
the relief afforded by the business tax reform,
which entered into force in 2008. Although
there is considerable uncertainty about the
level of shortfalls caused by the reform of
business taxes, the underlying development
of corporation tax receipts likewise still
appears to be positive and, at least until Sep-
tember, no serious effects on revenue were
evident as a result of the financial marketcrisis. Revenue from consumption-related
taxes – which sometimes swings erratically
from one quarter to the next – increased by a
total of 21/C252%. Marked growth in turnover tax
revenue contrasted with a decline in the two
most important excise duties, energy tax and
tobacco tax.
The latest official tax estimate predicts a rise
in tax revenue for the year as a whole, includ-
ing growth in local government taxes, of
41/C252% and an increase in the tax ratio (as de-
fined in the government’s financial statistics)
of 0.3 percentage point to 22.5%.5The tax
ratio will increase, firstly due to the relatively
high growth in wages, including the effects
of tax progression on income tax, and, sec-
ondly, owing to the continued marked
growth in profit-related taxes, despite short-
falls as a result of the business tax reform. By
contrast, revenue from consumption-related
taxes will grow at a somewhat slower pace
than nominal GDP , although the increase in
VAT at the start of 2007 still had a positive
effect on cash receipts at the beginning of
2008. The macroeconomic slowdown of re-
cent months will only have a limited impact
on the revenue outcome for 2008 as, on an

pended. Since 2008, the remaining credits are generally
paid out in ten equal amounts on 30 September each
year.
5The estimate is based on the Federal Government’s lat-
est macroeconomic forecast. This estimates real GDP
growth of 1.7% in 2008 (unchanged compared with
May 2008) and nominal GDP growth of 3% (May 2008:
3.4%). Real GDP growth of 0.2% (May 2008: 1.2%) and

ables have been relatively stable. However,profit-related taxes are subject to consider-able forecast uncertainties with regard to theactual impact of the business tax reform, aswell as with respect to the short-term effectsof the financial market crisis and the deterior-ating earnings outlook.
Overall, compared with the last official tax es-
timate in May 2008, revenue expectationshave now been raised by 37
1/C252billion, particu-
larly since revenue from profit-related taxeshas so far been surprisingly positive in 2008.Compared with the November 2007 estimateon which the 2008 Federal budget is based,an extra 36 billion will be received by general
government. However, the revision results inan increase of merely 3
1/C252billion for central
government, as the corrections largely affectlocal business tax, which mainly goes to localgovernment and, moreover, have a negativeeffect on taxes which accrue exclusively tocentral government.
Revenue growth of 2% and a virtually un-
changed tax ratio are forecast for 2009. Fur-ther marked growth in wage tax receipts isexpected, also owing to the effects of taxprogression. However, revenue from profit-related taxes will decrease. This is connectedwith subdued earnings expectations in thewake of the economic slowdown. Further-more, a certain natural counterswing to thesharp rise in previous years is anticipated.Compared with the May estimate, the figureshave been revised downwards by a total of32 billion after adjustment for differences in
taking account of legislative changes. How-ever, the estimates are supported in the short
term by the fact that the Federal Governmentnow expects shortfalls following the ruling ofthe European Court of Justice in the Meilickecase to mainly fall in 2010, rather than in2009.

These measures could burden government

The official tax estimate contains considerable
risks. For one thing, the likely course of
macroeconomic development is currently
fraught with a particularly high degree of un-
certainty – and since October, when the gov-
ernment made its forecast, the risks have, if
anything, increased. For another thing, esti-

casting the (at present very high) level of rev-

estimate how quickly and radically the bal-
looning growth rates of recent years will re-
verse and what impact the business tax re-form and the financial market crisis will
have.7

71Employment Agency once again significantly
exceeded the old compensatory amountreceived in the same quarter of last year (byalmost 31 billion). By contrast, central gov-
ernment received 32 billion less from asset
realisations. Growth in expenditure amount-ed to a total of 37
1/C252% (or 36 billion). Add-
itional outlays of 311/C252billion resulted from
payments due to the post office pension fundfollowing the exhaustion of the proceedsfrom securitisation. Moreover, one-off extra-ordinary capital transfers of almost 32
1/C252bil-
lion were made – to support IKB Bank and asa result of the European Court of Justice’sruling repealing an old subsidy repayment ob-ligation of the post office. Furthermore, add-itional transfers of 3
1/C252billion were made to
both the Federal Employment Agency andthe Federal Railways Fund. Growth in person-nel expenditure of 9
1/C252% (or 31/C252billion) is no
doubt due to the extension of the relativelyhigh (retroactive) pay settlement concluded inspring to public sector employees with civilservants status and to retired civil servants,while the increase in other operating expend-iture by 10
1/C252% (or 31/C252billion) is chiefly attrib-
utable to military expenditure.
The Federal budget recorded a cumulative
deficit of just over 318 billion at the end of
the third quarter, compared with just over316
1/C252billion one year previously. The desired
aim of reducing the full-year deficit by 321/C252
billion to just over 312 billion thus requires a
considerable surplus in the fourth quarter.One question that is of particular significancefor the annual outturn is whether the privat-isation proceeds of just over 310
1/C252billion en-
visaged in the budget will actually be receivedin full. Only just over 311/C252billion have been
realised to date. In addition, in response tothe slump in share prices in the stock mar-kets, the planned initial public offering of thenational rail company Deutsche Bahn hasbeen postponed. Following sizeable assetrealisations over the past few years, it is be-coming more difficult to find an alternativeoffset in the short term. However, excludingprivatisation proceeds and the additionalone-off payments mentioned, central govern-ment’s end-of-year budgetary position is likelyto be better than planned.
It is envisaged that the Budget Committee’s
adjustment meeting will amend the previousdeficit target of almost 311 billion for the
2009 Federal budget. In addition to thechanges in the latest official tax estimate,€b n

72which predict revenue shortfalls of just over
32 billion for 2009, in particular the package
of fiscal measures adopted by the Federal
Government at the beginning of November
with the aim of stabilising macroeconomic
momentum still has to be factored into the
equation. The resulting extra burdens for the
Federal budget amount to 321/C252billion. This
alone would increase the deficit to a total of
3151/C252billion. Furthermore, one-off proceeds
from asset disposals totalling almost 341/C252bil-
lion to date could be lowered – also owing to
the presently low company valuations on the
stock markets. Additional burdens are loom-
ing, too, in connection with unemployment
benefit II and the Federal Employment Agen-
cy’s reintegration payment.
As the budgetary burdens ensuing from
measures to boost the economy should be
very temporary, there is no reason to call into
question central government’s medium-term
structural budgetary objectives (ie adjusted
for cyclical influences and proceeds from
asset realisations – see the box on page 67).
Expenditure to support financial institutions
will initially be borne by the Financial Market
Stabilisation Fund, and the Federal budget
will only be burdened if there are outstanding
debts on the fund’s liquidation, which will
probably not occur until after the end of the
medium-term financial planning period (see
the box on pages 64-65). However, the gen-
erally expected slowdown in macroeconomic
growth rates is likely to delay reducing the
remaining overall deficit. As in the case of
general government, cyclically induced
borrowing will have no impact on central
government’s structural position. Moreover,further unexpected tax shortfalls could, if
need be, also be absorbed.8However, once
the economic slowdown has been overcome,
the Federal budget should be rigorously and
rapidly consolidated to achieve a solid basic
fiscal position. To underpin this aim, it re-
mains important to agree on a reform of the
debt rule within the framework of the second
phase of the reform of Germany’s federal
structure (“Federalism Reform II”).
State government budgets9
In the third quarter of 2008, state govern-
ment’s budgetary position deteriorated mod-
erately on the year. The surplus fell by just
over 31/C252billion to just under 311/C252billion. With
slower growth in tax revenue (+3%) and a
decline in other receipts, overall revenue in-
creased by only 11/C252%. At the same time, ex-
penditure increased further (+21/C252%), prob-
ably not least as a result of renewed percep-
tible growth in transfers to local government.
Around half of the 16 states look likely to re-
cord a budget surplus for the year as a whole
and – contrary to the budget plans – the
same applies to the state government sector
as a whole. Despite burdens from higher per-
sonnel expenditure, the business tax reform

73and the economic slowdown, the surplus
could well match the level achieved last year
(33 billion).10Expenditure resulting from the
financial market crisis has so far barely been
reflected in the cash balances. Further sup-
port in the wake of the crisis is likely to be
provided primarily by the Financial Market
Stabilisation Fund. However, state govern-
ments must also make a contribution to the
support measures (in addition to paying a
share of a potential cumulative debt of the
Fund) which is commensurate with their
shareholdings in institutions that request
financial assistance (see the box on pages
64-65).
The budget plans available so far, which
would hardly have needed any additional re-
vision in terms of tax revenue in the light of
the largely unchanged tax estimate, envisage
almost no new net borrowing for around half
of the states in 2009. The east German states
and Berlin are still planning at least close-to-
balance budgets and are thus preparing for
the accelerated reduction in Solidarity Pact
funding from 2009 (by just over 3700 billion
annually). By contrast, no significant progress
towards consolidation is planned in those
states that still have considerable deficits.
This particularly applies to the heavily in-
debted states of Bremen and Saarland as
well as Schleswig-Holstein, but it also applies
to Hesse, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-
Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate. State
government will be particularly burdened by
marked growth in personnel expenditure, but
also by scheduled further increases in trans-
fers to local government. Furthermore, it will
now also be burdened by tax shortfalls inconnection with the fiscal stabilisation pro-
gramme.
Social security funds11
Statutory pension insurance scheme
In the third quarter, the statutory pension in-
surance scheme’s deficit almost halved on the
year to 31/C252billion. Revenue growth of 21/C252%
in total was mainly due to income from em-
ployees’ compulsory contributions, which in-
creased by just over 31/C252%. Since the contri-
bution amounts for recipients of unemploy-
ment benefits are relatively low, their re-
newed sharp decline (-12%) only slightly
dampened the overall rise in income from
contributions. Growth in revenue was curbed
by transfers from the Federal budget, which,
overall, were only1/C252% up on the year. At al-
most 2%, expenditure increased perceptibly
faster than in the preceding quarters. The
main reason for this was the higher pension
increase in the amount of 1.1% on 1 July
2008 owing to the suspension of the “Riester
factor”, which is designed to dampen the
level of pension adjustments by making a de-
duction allowance for employees’ presumed
supplementary private pension provision. The
pension adjustment in mid-2007 was only
half as high (+0.54%). All in all, pension ex-

74penditure rose by just over 11/C252%. By contrast,
the rise in rehabilitation spending was well
above average (+10%).
Overall, the 2008 surplus could be more than
three times higher than last year (just over 31
billion) and the reserves could then be replen-
ished so that they amount to up to one
month’s expenditure. In view of the poorer
macroeconomic outlook, weaker employ-
ment dynamics are likely in 2009. Despite the
expected continued marked growth in aver-
age earnings, income from contributions is
therefore likely to increase less strongly. Fur-
thermore, a pension increase of more than
21/C252% can be expected mid-2009, owing par-
ticularly to the significant rise in average earn-
ings in 2008. This is attributable, on the one
hand, to the continued suspension of the“Riester factor” and, on the other, to the fact
that the demographic sustainability factor will
probably boost pension levels, firstly because
of the favourable 2008 employment trend
and secondly because the number of pension
recipients is currently expanding only moder-
ately. The statutory pension insurance
scheme’s surplus is therefore likely to decline
significantly in 2009.
Federal Employment Agency
The Federal Employment Agency recorded a
surplus of just over 31/C252billion in the third
quarter. Compared with the outturn at the
same stage of last year, this amounts to a fi-
nancial deterioration of almost 311/C252billion,
which is primarily due to the lowering of the
contribution rate from 4.2% to 3.3% on
1 January 2008. Furthermore, the replace-
ment of the compensatory amount with the
reintegration payment led to a much bigger
transfer to the Federal budget (+ 31 billion).
This could only be offset to a limited extent
by the further reduction in expenditure on
unemployment benefit I (-17% or - 31/C252billion)
as a result of the favourable employment
trend and the somewhat higher Federal
grant. Only a little more was spent on active
labour market policy measures.
If the Federal Employment Agency’s budget is
viewed in isolation, the cumulative deficit for
the first three quarters amounts to 321/C252bil-
lion. During the same period of last year, the
Agency posted a surplus of 331/C252billion. How-
ever, it should be borne in mind that in the
first half of 2008 expenditure was inflated byQuarterly

75the recording of an amount of 321/C252billion as
a one-off transfer to the newly establishedcivil servant pension reserve. If the FederalEmployment Agency and its pension reserveare viewed in consolidated terms, the budgetwas practically balanced from January to Sep-tember.
12A marked surplus is expected in the
fourth quarter, which is usually a strong fi-nancial quarter. Overall, the reserves are thuslikely to be topped up again. The increase inthe civil servant pension reserve is partly off-set by an (albeit smaller) reduction in the Fed-eral Employment Agency’s non-earmarked re-serves.
On 1 January 2009, the contribution rate will
be reduced further to 2.8%. This will producerevenue shortfalls of just over 34 billion in
2009. Furthermore, as a result of the macro-economic slowdown, expenditure on un-employment benefit I and probably alsospending on active labour market policymeasures are likely to increase on an annualaverage in 2009. A considerable deficit istherefore expected, which will have to becovered by drawing on the non-earmarkedreserves. The Federal Government itself con-siders a contribution rate of 2.8% to be un-sustainable. It is therefore planned to put therate back up to 3.0% in mid-2010. However,it seems doubtful whether this will suffice toensure the ongoing independent financing ofthe Federal Employment Agency. Assumingother expenditure largely remains stable, a3% contribution rate can hardly finance morethan 900,000 recipients of unemploymentbenefit, which roughly corresponds to thevery low figure in 2008.Quarterly

the amount of the one-off transfer to the pension re-
serve. Current payments to the reserve should also be de-
ducted from expenditure. Conversely, the pension reser-
ve’s spending, chiefly on current pensions and healthcare
