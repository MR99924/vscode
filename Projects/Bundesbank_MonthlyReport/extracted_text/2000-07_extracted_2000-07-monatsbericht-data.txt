ManufacturingIndustrial activity in May continued on an up-
ward trend with a further rise in demand formanufactured goods of 2
12% in seasonally
adjusted terms. If the two spring months ofApril and May are taken together to adjustshort-term random fluctuations, there was avery sharp rise of just under 5% comparedwith the average of the first quarter of 2000.Year-on-year growth in demand, which hadalready been in double digits during the firstfew months of the year, increased further to14
34%.
The main reason for this development was a
persistently sharp growth in foreign demand.In April and May the year-on-year rise in thissector amounted to 20%. Although domes-tic demand was lower at 11
14%, its seasonal-
ly adjusted rate of increase was no longer lag-ging behind the export sector recently.
Manufacturing output has likewise shown ro-
bust growth due to the sizeable scale of neworders. Seasonally adjusted, the average fig-ure for April and May exceeded the level ofthe first quarter by approximately 3
12%. The
annual increase was 834%, compared with
612% in the period from January to March.
ConstructionThe situation in the construction sector re-
mained subdued. While construction ordersin April and May were somewhat higher, sea-sonally adjusted, than in the winter quarter,Orders received

6the year-on-year decline, which had already
amounted to 7% in the first quarter, in-creased to more than 8%.
With a decline of around 13
12% in April and
May, the year-on-year fall in orders in housingconstruction remained above the average.Orders received in both commercial and pub-lic sector construction also clearly failed tomatch the levels of the preceding year (5
34%
and 7%, respectively) even though the sea-sonally adjusted volume of orders did notshow any further decline at the end of theperiod under review.
After adjustment for seasonal fluctuations,
construction output picked up somewhat inMay compared with April. Taking the twospring months together, however, the figurefalls well short of the result for the first quar-ter which was comparatively good owing tothe mild weather conditions. According tothe available data – which will probably be re-vised upwards somewhat, however – therewas a year-on-year decline of 5
14% in the
two-month period of April and May.
Labour marketThere has been little improvement in the situ-
ation on the labour market recently. Whileemployment had been rising well into thespring, there was scarcely any fall in un-employment towards the middle of the year.Seasonally adjusted, the unemployment rateremained at 9.6% in June. The number ofpersons registered as being out of workamounted to 3.91 million. The year-on-yearEconomic conditions in Germany*

7decline increased only marginally to 215,000
persons.
In June, the number of participants in voca-
tional training programmes and in job-creation programmes, at just under 670,000,remained almost as high as in May. Com-pared with the same period in 1999, thisnevertheless signifies a reduction of 135,000persons.
According to the estimations of the Federal
Statistical Office, the seasonally adjustednumber of persons in work rose to 36.24 mil-lion in April. Compared with the first quarter,there was an increase of almost 35,000, giv-ing a year-on-year growth of just under95,000.
PricesThe annual rate of consumer price inflation
went up to 1.9% in June, compared with1.4% in May. One of the main factors in thiswas that the rise in oil prices was now beingpassed on to the end-user. The (for the timeof the year) comparatively high price in-creases for package tours and hotel serviceswere another factor. By contrast, other goodsand services and house rents did not showany significant price movements. The annualrate of price change (excluding mineral oilproducts and holiday tours) went up from nomore than 0.5% to 0.7%.
During the first few weeks of July, inter-
national oil prices persisted at a level of al-most US$ 30 per barrel despite the OPECcountries having twice stepped up productionslightly. However, year-on-year inflation fell to
just under 60%, compared with about 80%in the preceding months and significantlymore than 100% at the turn of 1999-2000.The reason for this was that oil prices hadbeen raised sharply a year before.
Import prices, for which data are currently
available up to May, showed a marked in-crease during that month. Seasonally adjust-ed, they rose by 2% month-on-month: inApril they had fallen slightly as a result of adip in prices on the international energy mar-kets. The year-on-year increase went up to11.7%, compared with 9.8% previously.
Industrial producer prices were also raised
considerably in May. The annual rate of infla-tion increased to 2.7%, compared with2.1% and 2.4%, respectively, in April andMarch. The year-on-year rise in prices forintermediate goods that are dependent onimports of raw materials was far higher thanaverage, while producer prices of capitalgoods were no more than 0.3% above thelevel reached in 1999.
Public finance
Federal cash trendsIn June the Federal Government ran a cash
surplus of 33
12billion; by contrast, a deficit
of almost 3112billion had been recorded for
the same month last year. This improvementis attributable to a steep decline in cash ex-penditure. The cash deficit for the first sixmonths of this year, taken together, was alsoEmployment

8significantly down on the year; at slightly over
311 billion, it was almost 3712billion below
the corresponding 1999 figure. The main rea-son for this was that the decrease in cash ex-penditure, at just over 6
12%, was substan-
tially larger than the decline in cash receipts(not quite 2
12%). However, given the strong
fluctuations in cash receipts and expenditurethat occur during the year and the differencesbetween cash accounts and budgetary ac-counts, these intermediate figures do not per-mit a direct inference to budgetary results for2000 as a whole. Abundant tax receipts andsharply declining labour-market related ex-penditure suggest that in 2000 as a wholethe envisaged reduction in the budget deficitfrom just over 326 billion to slightly less than
325
12billion – this figure excludes proceeds
from the upcoming auction of UMTS li-cences – will not be jeopardised, notwith-standing additional expenditure arising inother budgetary areas.
Public sector borrowingIn May the central, regional and local author-
ities’ aggregate debt increased by not quite32
12billion. The public authorities cut back
on money market loans by almost 32 billion
while tapping the capital market for funds tothe tune of almost 34
12billion net. The Fed-
eral Government was the most prominentborrower, expanding its indebtedness by al-most 32 billion. It redeemed money market
loans worth slightly over 32
12billion and in-
creased its capital market debt by 3412bil-
lion, raising these funds almost exclusivelythrough the issue of Federal bonds. By con-trast, Federal savings bonds were redeemedFederal finance on a cash basis*

*The transactions recorded here as cash receipts and
cash expenditure comprise payments into and out of
the accounts carried by the Bundesbank for the Federal
Government. The cash receipts and cash expenditure
differ from those shown in the official financial statis-
tics primarily because these transactions are recorded
not at the time they are entered in the budgetary
accounts but at the time of the actual inflow or out-
flow, and because transactions on behalf of the Euro-
pean Union (which are not entered in the Federal bud-
get) are conducted through the accounts of the Federal

9for slightly more than 312billion on balance.
As for the special funds, the “German Unity”Fund expanded its liabilities by 3
34billion,
drawing exclusively on the money market.The Länder Governments, by contrast, re-duced their debt by 3
12billion. In particular,
they redeemed almost 3112billion worth of
cash advances from banks while issuingbonds amounting to 3
34billion net. The local
authorities are likely to have had only scantrecourse to the credit markets in May.
Owing to its large cash surplus, the Federal
Government was able to cut back on its debtto a relatively large extent (by almost 34 bil-
lion). A reduction in money market loans of3
12billion was accompanied by a redemp-
tion of capital market debt amounting to justunder 33
12billion. Gross borrowing, sup-
ported mainly through the issue of FederalTreasury notes, totalled almost 34
12billion;
however, repayments were on the whole con-siderably higher. The amounts of both Federalbonds and Federal savings bonds outstandingwere reduced by over 31 billion each. At the
same time, the Federal Government re-deemed Treasury notes to the tune of slightlyover 3
12billion net.
In the first six months of the year, taken to-
gether, the Federal Government’s debt roseby just over 39 billion, whereas the budget
had envisaged net borrowing of 325 billion
in 2000 as a whole; the latter figure, how-ever, makes no allowance for additional re-ceipts stemming from the sale of mobile-phone licences. Net borrowing in the first sixmonths of 1999 had amounted to slightlymore than 319
12billion, with the annual es-timate only slightly exceeding the corres-
ponding figure for 2000. Net borrowing thisyear has largely taken the form of Federalbond issues, whose amount outstandingalone rose by 310 billion. In addition, the sale
of five-year special Federal bonds yieldedslightly over 32 billion. By contrast, redemp-
tions primarily involved loans against bor-rowers’ notes and Federal savings bonds,amounting to approximately 32
12billion for
each type of debt instrument. Money marketdebt was expanded by almost 32
12billion.Net borrowing in the market

10Securities markets
Bond marketSales activity in the German bond market
once again ran at a high level in May. Domes-tic borrowers issued bonds to the marketvalue of 373.1 billion, compared with 362.1
billion in April.
1Just over three-quarters of
that sum was accounted for by bonds de-nominated in euro. Net of redemptions, andafter taking due account of changes in is-suers’ holdings of their own bonds, net salescame to 325.1 billion, compared with 320.7
billion in April. As a month before, it was pre-dominantly longer-term paper (with matur-ities of more than four years) that was sold.Foreign bonds were sold in the German mar-ket to the extent of 34.2 billion net. On
balance, it was only bonds denominated ineuro or Deutsche Mark and issued by non-residents that were sold ( 36.9 billion). Net
sales of domestic and foreign bonds yielded329.2 billion in May, compared with 322.5
billion a month earlier.
In May, three-quarters of domestic bonds
were issued by credit institutions ( 318.8 bil-
lion net). Of these, communal bonds (Öffent-
liche Pfandbriefe) and other bank bonds were
in the forefront, at 310.0 billion and 37.3
billion, respectively. On balance, bonds issuedby specialised credit institutions totalling 31.9
billion were sold. The outstanding amountof mortgage bonds (Hypothekenpfandbriefe)
declined by 30.4 billion.
On balance, the public sector issued bonds
amounting to 35.2 billion in May. The Fed-eral Government received 34.3 billion net
from sales of bonds. It launched, by tender, aten-year bond issue at 5.25% with an issuevolume of 38 billion and five-year special
Federal bonds of series 135 (5% coupon) to-talling 36 billion. On balance, sales of ten-
year bonds yielded 34.1 billion; 30-year Fed-
eral bonds and two-year Treasury notes weresold to the extent of 30.5 billion net and
30.4 billion, respectively. Five-year special
Federal bonds to the value of 30.3 billion net
were sold. The outstanding amount of Fed-eral savings bonds, by contrast, declined by30.6 billion.
2The Länder Governments’
bonded debt rose by 30.8 billion.
In May, sales of industrial bonds came to 31.1
billion, which was about the same amount asa month earlier ( 31.2 billion). In May 1999
the volume of corporate bonds outstandingdeclined by 30.2 billion.
In the market for Deutsche Mark/euro bonds
issued by non-residents under the lead man-agement of a German syndicate, the issuevolume was smaller in May, at 30.6 billion
(gross), than a month earlier ( 31.5 billion).
After deduction of redemptions, the out-standing amount decreased by 32.5 billion,
as in April.
1The figures analysed here since the beginning of the
year 2000 comprise not only bonds and notes and short-
dated debt securities issued by credit institutions but also
commercial paper and bonds issued by non-banks with
original maturities of up to and including one year
(money-market paper).
2The individual items for the Federal Government are
shown at nominal values, rather than at market values,
and without taking account of the changes in issuers’
holdings of their own bonds. The sum total of these indi-
vidual figures therefore normally fails to tally with the
above-mentioned aggregate net sales of Federal Govern-
ment bonds.Sales of bonds

11On the buyers’ side of the bond market, for-
eign investors were again in the forefront inMay; they built up their bond portfolios by315.4 billion. At 39.8 billion, bonds issued
by private borrowers predominated. Domes-tic credit institutions bought debt securities tothe value of 310.1 billion net, two-thirds of
this amount being invested in German bonds.Domestic non-banks purchased bonds worth33.8 billion net. On balance, they bought do-
mestic and foreign paper, all denominated ineuro, to the tune of 32.8 billion and 31.0 bil-
lion, respectively.
Equity marketIn May, domestic enterprises placed new
shares in the German equity market to themarket value of 31.6 billion, and thus dis-
tinctly less than in the previous month ( 34.4
billion). On balance, foreign equities weresold in Germany to the tune of 38.2 billion.
Altogether, sales of domestic and foreignshares in the German equity marketamounted to 39.7 billion in May, compared
with 37.8 billion in April.
In May, domestic credit institutions bought
equities totalling 37.6 billion (net), 36.8 bil-
lion of this sum consisting mainly of domesticpaper. Foreign investors purchased Germanequities to the extent of 30.8 billion net. Do-
mestic non-banks increased their share port-folios by 31.4 billion. On balance, they sold
domestic paper (– 36.0 billion) and pur-
chased only foreign shares ( 37.3 billion).Investment fund certificates
At36.8 billion, the amount raised by domes-
tic investment funds in May was much thesame as a month earlier ( 37.1 billion). About
two-thirds of this sum accrued to specialisedfunds. Specifically, mixed funds and share-based funds sold certificates to the value of31.8 billion and 31.2 billion net, respectively.
Bond-based funds sold investment fund cer-tificates to the extent of 31.1 billion, while
the outstanding amount of certificates issuedby open-end real estate funds and money-market funds remained virtually unchanged.Funds open to the general public received32.6 billion in May, compared with 33.4 bil-
lion in April. As in the preceding months,share-based funds predominated, at 33.2 bil-
lion. Mixed funds and pension investmentSales and purchases of bonds*

30.6 billion and 30.1 billion, respectively.
Bond-based funds, by contrast, registeredoutflows of resources (– 31.0 billion). The
outstanding amount of certificates issued bymoney-market funds and open-end real es-tate funds likewise declined by 30.5 billion
and 30.4 billion, respectively. In May, foreign
investment fund certificates were sold to aslightly smaller extent, at 33.5 billion, than a
month earlier ( 33.9 billion). The total amount
raised by sales of domestic and foreign invest-ment fund certificates therefore came to310.3 billion.
The investment fund certificates were mainly
bought by domestic non-banks ( 37.5 billion),
which purchased domestic and foreign certi-ficates, about one-half each. Credit institu-tions’ portfolios of investment fund certifi-cates increased by 32.2 billion. Non-residents
bought certificates issued by German invest-ment funds to the extent of 30.6 billion.
Balance of payments
The deficit on Germany’s current account –
the combined outcome of foreign trade,services, factor income and current trans-fers – increased from 31.7 billion in April to
33.0 billion in May. The increase was due to
a seasonally-related decline in the export sur-plus.
According to calculations by the Federal Stat-
istical Office, Germany had a trade surplus of33.8 billion in May compared with one of
34.8 billion in April. This decline was largelyin line with the usual seasonal trend; in sea-
sonally adjusted terms the surplus in each ofthe two months amounted to approximately34
12billion. Exports and imports both rose
substantially in seasonally adjusted terms inMay. If the figures for April and May aretaken together, exports rose by 2% com-pared with the February-March period. Al-though in the two-month comparison im-ports grew by 5
12%, much of this increase
was due to the recent sharp rise in importprices, notably for energy.
The deficit on invisible current transactions
with non-residents totalled 36.5 billion in
May compared with 36.1 billion in April. The
rise was therefore considerably more moder-ate than is normal for the time of year. Therewas only a marginal increase of 30.3 billion
in the deficit on services, which rose to 34.0
billion, but this was the result of slightly largerexpenditure on foreign travel. There was alsoa slight deficit on factor income during themonth under review ( 30.8 billion compared
with a balanced result in April). At 31.7 bil-
lion, by contrast, the deficit on current trans-fers was significantly smaller than in the pre-vious month ( 32.5 billion); this was largely
due to a reduction in Germany’s net pay-ments to the EU budget.
Small net amounts of capital were again im-
ported through portfolio investment in themonth under review ( 33.1 billion compared
with 31.3 billion in April). International play-
ers invested fairly substantial amounts ( 316.7
billion) in the German securities markets.Their interest was focused primarily on bondsand notes ( 38.3 billion) and money marketPurchases of

for German shares ( 30.8 billion) and invest-

The statistically recorded operations of enter-

15Determinants and
macroeconomicsignificanceof product wageand consumptionwageIn macroeconomic terms, wages and
salaries have a dual character. On theone hand they represent the largestcost factor for enterprises, on theother hand they are the principalsource of income for households. Foremployees, it is net earnings valued interms of units of consumption, i.e. the(real) consumption wage, that count,whereas the key variable for enter-prises when making decisions is labourcosts in relation to expected sellingprices, i.e. the (real) product wage.The gap between product wage andconsumption wage – the wedge drivenbetween them – stems mainly from theburdens imposed by taxes and socialsecurity contributions. A large or in-creasing tax wedge, as prevailed inGermany in the nineties, not only re-sults in significant welfare losses butalso complicates wage policy and maylead to more rigid unemploymentstructures, not least because of itsdampening effect on the incentive towork and on demand. The moderatepay settlements agreed for the years2000 and 2001 and the reduction inthe burden of taxes planned for nextyear, in particular, are thus steps in theright direction in macroeconomic andemployment policy terms.

16Agreed pay rates, actual earnings and
wage drift
Wage trends in Germany are primarily geared
to the pay rates formally negotiated betweenmanagement and labour. For firms which arebound by the terms of collective pay agree-ments and for employees organised in tradeunions, these rates of pay form the basis ofthe wages and salaries that are paid. Despitethe erosion of collective pay bargaining thatis evident in some areas and the falling mem-bership of trade unions, about 90% of allwage and salary earners in Germany subjectto social security contributions are covered bywage settlements concluded at the companyor sectoral level, according to data from theFederal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
As can be seen from the Bundesbank’s pay
rate statistics, agreed pay rates in Germany,including negotiated ancillary benefits (suchas holiday and Christmas bonuses, in particu-lar), rose on a monthly basis by a total of38.3% between 1991 and 1999, or by 4.1%per year. However, this masks some disparatedevelopments over the past decade. Above-average growth rates were recorded at thebeginning of the nineties, owing both to therelatively high wage settlements in westernGermany and the rapid convergence of eastGerman negotiated wages to the relevantwest German standards that had been pur-sued by the trade unions. In the second halfof the nineties, by contrast, negotiated payraises were quite moderate on aggregate,given the narrower leeway for income distri-bution and the favourable price climate.The reduction in negotiated annual working
hours also has to be taken into account,which resulted in correspondingly higherrates of growth in pay measured on an hourlybasis. Reductions in standard working hoursin return for forgoing increases in incomethat would otherwise have been possible ac-counted for just over
13percentage point per
year of the increase in pay rates during thenineties. Nevertheless, working hours playeda far less important role in wage bargainingin the nineties than they had done in westernGermany in the second half of the eighties.As was the case for the pay component, thetrend towards reduced working hours wasdriven mainly by the rapid convergence be-tween eastern and western Germany. Thus ineastern Germany negotiated working hoursdecreased by
12% per year between 1991
and 1999, whereas the corresponding rate inwestern Germany was
14%. East-West parity
has largely been achieved meanwhile in theamount of paid holiday granted, whereasnegotiated weekly working hours in easternGermany in 1999, at 39
14hours, were still
just under two hours more than in the west.1
Although pay agreements, for the time oftheir duration, largely determine the level ofactual gross earnings, they by no means doso completely. Depending on the relativestrength of the demand for labour, the wagesand salaries that are actually paid differ fromagreed pay rates in terms of their level andtheir trend. In the period under review, actualearnings rose by 3.3% per year; this was

1734percentage point per year less than the
agreed rates of pay (on a monthly basis). Thisnegative wage drift throughout the ninetiesstands in sharp contrast to developments inthe second half of the eighties, when actualearnings had risen broadly in line with agreedpay rates.
Negative wage drift (on a monthly basis) is
caused partly by differences between actualand negotiated working hours, known astime drift. It also stems in part from divergen-cies between actual and negotiated hourlycompensation. The two components areinterrelated, however. Higher overtime work-ing, for example, may lead both to a positivetime drift and to a positive wage drift on anhourly basis, owing to overtime premiums.Nevertheless, decomposing wage drift intothese two components provides further in-sights into the reasons for its decline since theearly nineties.
Time drift, which mainly reflects part-time
effects, overtime and hours lost due to short-time working and sickness,
2was in fact
slightly positive throughout the period underreview. The main reason for this was the ex-ceptionally wide time drift in 1992 (3.4%).This primarily reflects the fact that the num-ber of short-time workers in eastern Ger-many, following a huge rise in 1991, de-creased by over 1.2 million in the followingyear. In addition, the number of working daysin 1992 was 1
12% higher than in 1991. If the
exceptional year 1992 is disregarded, the pastdecade shows a negative time drift amount-ing to
14% per year. This mainly reflects the
increased share of part-time work, which ac-counts for as much as12percentage point
per year, mainly owing to the sharp rise injobs below a defined earnings threshold ex-empt from social security contributions. Thisdevelopment was partly offset by a fall in thesickness ratio in western Germany during thenineties and the declining significance ofshort-time working.
Seen from a somewhat longer-term perspec-
tive, however, wage drift (measured on anhourly basis) was a more crucial factor behindthe divergence of agreed pay rates and actualearnings. On an hourly basis, the aggregateincrease in actual gross earnings recorded be-tween 1991 and 1999 was 7
12% (or 1 per-
centage point per year) lower than the rise inAgreed pay rates, actual earnings and

18agreed pay rates. This gap may be seen pri-
marily as an indication of an excessive rise inagreed pay rates (from the employer’s pointof view), which firms attempted to counter-act by abolishing or reducing additional bene-fits not covered by the pay agreement, byintroducing some flexibility into the formalpay agreement or by opting out of member-ship of the employers’ federation altogether.The latter seems to have played a major roleabove all in eastern Germany in the earlynineties, as employers sought to alleviate thesharp cost pressures generated by pay settle-ments. Moreover, in the recent past enter-prises in both parts of Germany appear tohave made increasing use of the extendedflexibility that has been incorporated intowage agreements in the past few years, forexample by bringing working hours moreclosely into line with operational require-ments by defining an annual quota for work-ing time. This lessened the need to pay trad-itional overtime premiums.
Product wage, consumption wage and
tax wedge
Wages and salaries have a key bearing both
on the demand for labour and the domesticsupply of goods, on the one hand, and onfirms’ profitability and price formation, on theother. At a given level of labour productivityand an existing price level, total labour inputcosts are the relevant decision criterion foremployers with respect to the demand for la-bour and the appropriate combination of in-puts. In microeconomic terms, labour costscomprise both direct remuneration and allnon-wage labour costs, which are not neces-
sarily related closely and directly to labouroutput.
3Ultimately, it is the cost structure
which determines how a given volume ofwork is divided up into working hours andamong employees. In general it may be saidthat the demand for employees decreases(particularly at times of economic uncertainty)as the proportion of fixed labour costs risesand that of variable or profit-related elementsfalls, and vice versa.
There are various statistical definitions for
what expenditure items should be included inlabour costs. Whereas the labour cost surveyof the manufacturing industry and selectedservice sectors, which is carried out every fouryears and was last conducted in 1996, isbased on a more comprehensive and moredeeply disaggregated concept, the labourcost concept used in the national accounts(“compensation of employees”) is more suit-able for macroeconomic analyses, not leastbecause of the timeliness of the data. Com-pensation of employees comprises not onlyactual employee earnings but also employers’social contributions.
Non-wage labour costs, which in addition to
statutory social security contributions includeemployers’ contributions to company pensionplans as well as imputed social security contri-butions for civil servants, rose by 4.7% peryear in the last decade, clearly outpacinggross earnings. This mainly reflects the in-

19crease in contribution rates to the statutory
social security funds which, totalling 4114%
at the end of 1999, were 6 percentage pointshigher than they had been at the start of1991. The cost to employers of the factor la-bour per employee rose on balance between1991 and 1999 by 32.3%, or 3.6% per year.On an annual average, approximately
13per-
centage point of this increase in labour costswas due to the rise in employers’social contri-butions. Consequently, their share in total la-bour costs increased during the nineties fromjust over 18% to nearly 20%. The share ofgross earnings in total labour costs decreasedaccordingly from nearly 82% to 80%.
Employees, too, were affected by the rising
level of government levies in the form ofhigher social security contributions. More-over, the amount of wage tax (including thesolidarity surcharge)
4payable on gross earn-
ings expanded faster owing to tax progres-sion effects – despite several tax relief meas-ures such as a marked increase in the basictax allowance.
5As a result, the rise in net
earnings per employee during the nineties, atan annual average of 2.1%, was more than1 percentage point per year less than theimprovement in gross earnings.
6Compared
with total labour costs, i.e. the relevant vari-able for enterprises, the growth deficit ofhouseholds’ net earnings amounted to asmuch as 1
12percentage points per year on
average during the past decade.
The wedge between the demand price and
the supply price of the factor labour causedby direct government levies thus increasedon balance during the period under review.Whereas in 1991 households received almost
57% of the compensation of employeespaid by enterprises directly, this figure haddropped to just under 51% by 1997. Thismeans that the growing burden on the factorlabour, which had been observed for quitesome time, was amplified further in the nine-ties. In the early sixties, the average burden oftaxes and social security contributions hadamounted to less than 30%, in the early sev-enties to approximately one-third and in theearly eighties to just over 40%. For employ-ees, wages and salaries thus account for asmaller share of their disposable income,which, in turn, largely determines the scopeof private consumption and consequently af-fects the domestic demand for goods. How-ever, the increase in the average burden doesnot fully reflect the level of the marginal bur-den that now applies. This was certainly detri-mental to the return on investment in educa-tion and is likely to have reduced the willing-
4In addition, many employees pay a voluntary church
tax.
5However, the increase in wage tax in the national ac-
counts was also affected by two exceptional statistical ef-
fects. Firstly, wage tax receipts were artificially boosted
from 1996 owing to the revision of the family allowance
system within the framework of the 1996 Annual Tax
Act. This revision resulted in the abolition of children’s al-
lowance, which had taken the form of a tax allowance
deductible from gross earnings (child benefit, which is
paid as a government transfer, was concurrently in-
creased). Secondly, recorded wage tax receipts were like-
wise boosted by the change in the method of granting
government financial assistance to home buyers, which
likewise came into effect in 1996. Whereas it previously
took the form of a special tax allowance, which largely
reduced wage tax, the grant payable to home buyers as
from 1996 is recorded in the national accounts as a cap-
ital transfer. During the transitional period until 2004, in
which the two systems will coexist, shifts will thus occur
between wage tax and capital transfers.
6For simplicity it is assumed that the amount of wage
tax deducted at source is identical to the final tax assess-
ment on the corresponding labour income. In reality,
however, these two variables may differ owing to supple-
mentary tax payments or tax refunds.Levies on gross

21ness of individuals to supply labour and to
take on employment. Moreover, it is note-worthy that social security contributions haveincreasingly been used like a form of taxationover the past few years and that it is becom-ing ever harder to identify offsetting effectsof the increase in the total levy burden in theform of equivalence.
Furthermore, the growing burden of govern-
ment levies has increasingly narrowed the lee-way for real income distribution available tolabour and management. The fact that thegovernment used the macroeconomic scopefor income distribution in order to fund socialsecurity benefits by levering up statutory non-wage costs has probably placed a handicapon the pay bargaining process and made itharder to reduce unemployment. This may beparticularly true of those sub-sectors of thelabour market which are relatively sensitive topay rates and which are widely exposed tointernational competition or where switchingto the shadow economy is an option. In add-ition, this development has doubtless ham-pered the process of structural change to-wards labour-intensive service industries.
The last two years saw at least some stabilisa-
tion in the relationship between labour costsand net earnings, and a slight improvement isto be expected in the coming years. This ispartly attributable to the reduction in incometax from the beginning of 2001 and partly tothe progressive reduction in pension contribu-tion rates which was introduced in April 1999as part of the “ecological tax reform”. Never-theless, at the present time it seems unlikelythat the gap between product wage and con-sumption wage, which continued to broaden
throughout the nineties, will narrow signifi-cantly in the near future. With respect to theproduction factor labour, therefore, Germanyis likely to remain among the “high levy coun-tries” by international standards.
7
However, the “wedge” between productwage and consumption wage is determinednot only by the direct burden that taxes andsocial security contributions impose on thefactor labour but also, at the macroeconomiclevel, by relative prices at the consumer andproducer level (see also the explanationsgiven on page 23). In terms of incentives forwork and employment, the real marginal taxwedge, which measures the effective margin-al burden on labour input, is of major import-ance. Ultimately, enterprises and employeesalike are interested not so much in thegrowth of nominal labour costs and net earn-
ings as in the trend in realwages and salaries.
In this context consideration must also alwaysbe given to the question of whether pricetrends are consistent with the requirement ofprice stability. Lowering excessive real labourcosts by means of inflation is incompatiblewith this requirement. For firms’ profitabilityit is the net selling price (excluding indirecttaxes) of their products that is the yardstick,whereas the key criterion for employees is thescope for consumption offered by their la-bour income. Therefore consumer prices arethe appropriate reference variable for calcu-lating employees’ real wages.

22Trends in producer and consumer prices can
diverge significantly, either because of theburdens on consumption that stem from spe-cial or general excise taxes or because ofprice shifts in external trade (terms of tradeeffect). Thus consumer price increases out-paced the upward movement in domesticproducer prices (measured by the GDP defla-tor adjusted for indirect taxes) by approxi-mately 1 percentage point in both 1996 and1997. In the year 2000, too, the rate of con-sumer price inflation is expected to be signifi-cantly higher than the rate of increase in do-mestic producer prices, owing to the sharprise in oil prices, the depreciation of the euroin the foreign exchange markets and higherenergy taxation.Throughout the nineties the contribution of
the price component to the widening of thetax and price wedge averaged 0.2 percentagepoint per year; approximately two-thirds ofthis was accounted for by the rise in indirecttaxation. Consequently, the differential be-tween the rates of change of labour costsand net compensation totalled 1
34percent-
age points per year in real terms. On the onehand, price-adjusted labour costs – which inthis case have been approximated using thetax-adjusted GDP deflator – rose by an aver-age of 1.6% in the last decade. On the otherhand, real net earnings per employee de-clined slightly on aggregate; this decline hasto be seen in the context of an excessivelyhigh starting base (especially in the early nine-ties), the narrow scope for real income distri-bution throughout the last decade and a per-Product and consumption wage*

23The concept of the “tax wedge” on the labour market
Government taxes and social security contribu-
tions, which impose a burden on the productionfactor labour, drive a wedge between the de-mand price of labour (product wage) and thesupply price of labour (consumption wage).
1
This usually results in evasive reactions on partof the parties concerned. Such substitution ef-fects are mainly determined by the level of the(effective) marginal tax rate and the duration ofthe time horizon. Rising burdens generally resultin disproportionately large increases in effi-ciency losses on the labour market. In the longterm, for a given tax wedge (irrespective of thepayment burden) it is the respective elasticitiesof labour supply and labour demand that deter-mine the actual distribution of burdens and thusthe relationship between the cost and incomeeffects of the tax wedge.The tax wedge ( q) itself is a measure of the dif-
ference between product wage (w
p) and con-
sumption wage (w c). Expressed as a fraction of
the product wage, this gives us

bour costs comprise direct remuneration and alladditional non-wage labour costs. In the termin-ology of national accounts this is synonymouswith compensation of employees, which consistsof gross wages and salaries plus employers’ so-cial contributions. If w
brstands for the gross
earnings per employee and tAgfor the relation-
ship between employers’ social contributionsand those gross earnings, the (real) productwage per employee at a given selling price of P
Y
is given by
(2) w p=w br·( 1+ tAg)/P Y
From the employees’ point of view, by contrast,
net earnings are the relevant variable; they arecalculated as gross earnings less employees’ so-cial contributions and wage tax (including soli-darity surcharge) payable by employees. If t
An
andtTdenote the shares in gross wages and sal-
aries accounted for by employees’ social contri-butions and wage tax, respectively, and takinginto account the impact of indirect tax ( t

the prices of consumer goods, the real consump-tion wage per employee is calculated by
(3) w
c=w br·( 1– tAn–tT)/[ P C·( 1+ tC)]
Equations (1) to (3) then result in the following
approximation for the tax wedge:(4)q=tT+tSV+tC+tP,1+tC+tP
where tSVstands for the combined share of so-
cial contributions of employees and employersandt
P=( P C–PY)/P Ydenotes the divergent de-
velopment of selling prices and (pre-tax) consu-mer prices (which, in addition to t
C, can be inter-
preted as a component of the “price wedge”).From a macroeconomic perspective, the pricewedge is also determined by shifts in the termsof trade. A deterioration in the terms of traderesulting from dearer import prices, for example,reduces the real domestic leeway for income dis-tribution. The price wedge has the effect of atax on domestic incomes in favour of foreigncountries.The relationship between product and consump-tion wage can also be expressed as follows:
(5) w
p=( 1+q)·w c=1+tC+tP·wc1–q 1–tT–tSV
The term in the numerator of the quotient is of
particular interest in terms of its monetary policyimplications as it denotes the factors that have adirect impact on consumer prices.The marginal levy burden, which is relevant forincentive and employment effects, differs fromthe average levy ratio in that the wage tax vol-ume increases, even without any changes in taxlegislation, because of tax progression whereassocial security contributions are only payablewithin a defined band above a certain minimumearnings level up to a maximum assessable in-come limit. These two effects can be expressedby what is called residual income elasticity. Thisindicator measures the extent to which a relativechange in product wage results in a relativechange in consumption wage. If qdenotes the
average effective burden and q’ the effective
marginal burden, the residual elasticity ( h)i s
given by
(6)h=
1–q’

In this context, it must also be taken into ac-
count that, particularly in the case of low in-comes, the loss of social benefits when taking onemployment liable to taxes and social securitycontributions can result de facto in a very high
(implied) marginal burden (the residual elasticityis correspondingly low owing to the transferpayment forfeit ratio). This, in turn, adversely af-fects the willingness to look for and take on ajob (the so-called poverty trap problem).

Tax wedge, wage trends and
employment
The real product wage, i.e. compensation per
employee in relation to the price of domesticvalue added, is an important determinant ofenterprises’ demand for labour and thus of
the level of employment. Ceteris paribus, the
higher the real compensation payable by en-terprises, the lower is the demand for labour.In terms of employment policy, therefore,wage negotiators should take account of theanticipated trend in employers’ social contri-butions. This is all the more true as econo-metric studies have shown that the taxwedge due to social security contributionsand wage tax adversely affects the level ofunemployment in macroeconomic terms.
8
Moreover, wage negotiations must take ac-count of both terms of trade effects and theimpact of changes in indirect taxation onprices when assessing the price component.The“ex ante income distribution” in favour
of foreign countries or the government sectorresulting from a deterioration in the terms oftrade or increases in indirect taxes must notgive rise to pay rate conflicts to the detrimentof employment opportunities.

The sharp increase in the price of the factorlabour in the early nineties, which was causedboth by the relatively high pay settlements inwestern Germany and the rapid convergenceof agreed east German pay rates towardswest German standards, had a marked im-pact on the labour market. In the three-yearperiod up to the end of 1993 the number ofemployed persons in Germany decreased bynearly 2 million. It is true that this owed muchto the adjustment requirements of east Ger-Percent-

25man firms to the conditions of a free market
economy. Nevertheless, wage policies gearedmore to productivity trends (adjusted for re-dundancy-induced distortions) and regionalconditions could have significantly alleviatedthe adjustment process, which alone in theeast German manufacturing sector (includingmining) resulted in 1.3 million redundanciesduring this period. However, in the west Ger-man manufacturing sector, too, approximate-ly 1 million jobs were lost on balance in thefirst third of the last decade, which was onlypartly due to increasing outsourcing by firms.The high pay settlements of 1995, reinforcedby the disproportionate rise in employers’social contributions, in conjunction with theappreciation of the Deutsche Mark, led to anoticeable slowdown in economic activitywhich, with a certain time lag, likewise hadan adverse effect on the labour market.
The strategy of moderate wage settlements
that has basically been pursued by labour andmanagement ever since began to bear fruitat the end of the last decade. In 1998 and1999 there was a slight growth in employ-ment on an annual average, although itshould be pointed out that this was support-ed by the deployment of labour market policymeasures on a massive scale, particularly in1998. In terms of costs, the conditions for asustainable expansion of employment on the“primary” labour market during the comingyears may be gauged as rather favourable.This owes something to both the latest roundof pay agreements – which also give firmsgreater planning certainty because of theirlonger duration – and the further reduction innon-wage labour costs envisaged by the Fed-
eral Government.
Although moderate pay increases throughout
the economy can contribute significantly per
seto ensuring that the current economic up-
turn in Germany is accompanied by a distinctgrowth in employment, a sufficient degree ofwage flexibility and wage differentiation is ofequal importance, particularly in the lowerskill segments. However, no significant pro-gress has been made in this respect in thepast few years. In order to maintain or createemployment opportunities for poorly quali-fied persons with a low productivity, it is es-sential to make the product wage rangemore congruent with the productivity profile.
At the same time it must be ensured that the
consumption wage clearly exceeds the in-come and other benefits (e.g. not having tomove home) that can be obtained from non-employment.
10The willingness to work de-
pends on the relationship between the con-sumption wage and alternative sources of in-come which are available if no “official” em-ployment is taken on. The acceptance wage,which is determined by that relationship,marks the minimum wage of the labour sup-ply. This primarily concerns low-skilled work-ers whose jobs are characterised by a relative-ly low level of productivity, so that the marketrate of remuneration is unlikely to exceedtheir demands.
10Another factor is the extent to which social security
expenditure fosters the flexibility of the labour market.
For example, high social security contributions that are
merely used to finance generous wage substitutes would
have a doubly adverse effect on the labour market.Moderate wage

26In order to better (re-)integrate these individ-
uals into the work process, the statutoryshare of income available to non-workerswould have to be reviewed and the marginaltax wedge reduced. One possible approachto achieving the latter is currently being pur-sued by pilot schemes which were agreed inthe context of the Alliance for Jobs, Trainingand Competitiveness and which are due tostart in the second half of the current year.These model schemes are aimed at making iteasier for low-skilled workers and the long-term unemployed to take on employment li-able to taxes and social security contributionsby subsidising social security contributions,thus reducing non-wage labour costs. Ashas been indicated by various studies,
11the
efficacy of such forms of wage subsidiesdepends on their practical implementation(target-group orientation versus promotionof larger segments of the labour market,scope and duration), the functioning of thelabour market and the fiscal costs involved. Inpractice it is hard to avoid the dangers thatfirms might simply cash in on the subsidywithout creating any additional jobs, thatnew recruits might merely displace existingemployees or that staff taken on might beshed again as soon as the subsidies are ter-minated.
The interplay between labour supply and la-
bour demand hinges more on the marginalburden than on the average levy burden.Generally, the marginal burden is the rele-vant criterion with respect to the numberof working hours individuals are willing towork. Another relevant parameter is the de-gree to which pension schemes favour earlyretirement, which in microeconomic terms
is tantamount to taxing people who workuntil the normal retirement age.
12As most
married couples in Germany are jointly as-sessed for income tax purposes, the mar-ginal burden is also relevant in the familycontext in deciding how much labour a“second earner” is willing to supply. Thesame applies whenever the costs of, say,potential vocational training have to beweighed against the benefits. Owing to thescaled progression of the German income taxsystem, the marginal tax burden is usuallygreater than the average burden. Taking theaverage pay of a skilled production worker asa yardstick, an unmarried employee in 1999only received 35
12% of the additional costs
of a pay rise incurred by the enterprise.13
Almost two-thirds of the extra labourcosts in this case accrued to the governmentin the form of social security contributionsand wage tax (including the solidarity sur-charge).
The reduction in income tax rates planned
for the next few years must be measurednot least by the degree to which it willhelp to alleviate the marginal burden inthe medium and upper income brackets. Amarked and sustained reduction in thedegree of progression of the income tax

29Deposit protection
and investorcompensationin GermanyThe EC Deposit Guarantee and Investor
Compensation Directives were trans-lated into German law by the 1998 De-posit Guarantee and Investor Compen-sation Act. This has led in Germany tothe creation of statutory deposit pro-tection schemes that comply with theharmonised provisions of the EU dir-ectives. These schemes coexist with thealready-established voluntary depositprotection schemes operated by thevarious categories of banks, on whichwe last reported in the July 1992Monthly Report of the Deutsche Bun-desbank. This means that depositorscontinue to have their accustomedlevel of protection, while a special pro-tection for investors has been createdfor the first time. The subject of theearlier article was deposit protectionin Germany operated on the basis ofthe banks’ own voluntary self-helpschemes. The present article is intend-ed to provide a supplementary accountof the revised system of compensationfor deposits and investment businessfollowing the entry into force of theDeposit Guarantee and Investor Com-pensation Act.
The Deposit Guarantee and Investor Com-
pensation Act entered into force in Germanywith effect from August 1, 1998 for the jointimplementation of the EC Deposit GuaranteeDirective (94/19/EC of May 30, 1994) and theEC Investor Compensation Directive (97/9/ECof March 3, 1997).

30tee schemes in the EU member states pro-
vided for its translation into national law byJuly 1, 1995. The delayed implementation ofthis directive in Germany was also due to anaction filed by the Federal Republic of Ger-many against the Deposit Guarantee Directiveat the European Court of Justice. A petitionwas made to declare the directive void. In thealternative, the action was directed againstthe directive’s provisions on the “export ban”and on “topping-up”, and against the prin-ciple of compulsory membership in a depositguarantee scheme. The directive provided forcredit institutions from countries with a high-er level of cover being permitted to guaranteeonly the level of cover of the host country fortheir foreign establishments (export ban). De-posit protection schemes with a higher levelof cover have to admit the branches of for-eign credit institutions in order to guaranteethem the same scope of cover in the hostcountry as that of the institutions based there(topping-up). The action was rejected by theEuropean Court of Justice in a ruling ofMay 13, 1997.
The Investor Compensation Directive, which
is largely modelled on the Deposit GuaranteeDirective, was to be implemented by themember states before September 26, 1998.Unlike the situation pertaining to deposit pro-tection, in Germany there had previously notbeen any voluntary investor compensationsystem for customers of undertakings – otherthan credit institutions – providing investmentservices. Harmonisation at the EU level nowextends the scope of protection explicitly toinvestment services provided by credit institu-tions and financial services institutions (insti-tutions). The scope of protection covers
funds, securities, derivatives and money mar-ket instruments. Investor protection comesinto play if an institution is no longer in a pos-ition to pay back funds that it owes investorsin connection with investment business, or toreturn securities or financial instruments thatbelong to investors and which the institutionholds in custody or manages for the investors.However, the act does not safeguard claimsresulting from unsound investment advice orif the issuer of the securities becomes insolv-ent.
Following the rejection of the action by the
European Court of Justice in 1997, the timingas well as practical considerations made itconvenient to implement both directives to-gether in one act in Germany, since both dir-ectives contain largely identical, harmonisedminimum provisions in terms of the scopeand amount of creditor protection.
The Act Implementing the EC Deposit Guar-
antee Directive and the EC Investor Compen-sation Directive (Deposit Guarantee and In-vestor Compensation Act) means that, forthe first time in Germany, there are statutoryprovisions for the protection of deposits andof claims arising from investment business.Until the act came into force, deposits wereprotected solely by the voluntary private-lawself-help schemes operated by the various as-sociations of banks. Statutory provisions spe-cifically governing deposit protection werenot required in Germany in the past. In fact,the existing voluntary system of deposit pro-tection strengthened the conviction that suchprivate-law deposit protection systems in the

31form of the banks’ self-help schemes can en-
sure that bank creditors are provided with anadequate degree of protection that takes dueaccount of the particular sensitivity to fluctu-ations in confidence in the banking industry,without having to have recourse to govern-ment if an institution collapses. The existingdeposit protection schemes in Germany playa major part in fostering confidence in thestability of the German banking system. Smallinvestors, in particular, should be adequatelyprotected if their bank fails. A guaranteethreshold, which may result in the loss – as aretention – even of parts of small deposit bal-ances, would run counter to such a system-stabilising protection of depositor confidence.In this connection, too much emphasis isplaced in most cases on the problem of moralhazard in banks’ behaviour. It is assumed thata high degree of deposit protection will resultin non-risk-oriented behaviour on the part ofdepositors when selecting a credit institution,and this is generally discussed as an argumentfor a perceptible limiting of individual guaran-tee thresholds. This problem has so far notbecome apparent in Germany. When weigh-ing up the competing approaches, moral haz-ard behaviour by banks can be countered bymeans of efficient banking supervision andrisk control by the private guarantee schemesthemselves. The disciplinary effect of an indi-vidual assessment of a bank’s solvency by itscurrent and potential depositors – which is tobe prompted by a low guarantee threshold orretention by the depositors – is, at all events,subject to many different qualifications.
Owing to positive experience of the system of
private deposit protection in Germany, the le-gislative intention when implementing the
Deposit Guarantee Directive was geared tomaintaining the voluntary system of depositprotection even after the Deposit Guaranteeand Investor Compensation Act had enteredinto force, i.e. to ensure that statutorily re-quired minimum cover was augmented. Eventhe Deposit Guarantee Directive does not callinto question the retaining of established na-tional systems. Given the structures of depositprotection that have evolved in Germany, therequirements of harmonisation contained inthe directive have thus been implementedfaithfully by the Deposit Guarantee and In-vestor Compensation Act.

Compulsory membership in a deposit
guarantee scheme
Under the Deposit Guarantee and Investor
Compensation Act, all deposit-taking creditinstitutions under private and public law aswell as all securities trading firms are obligedto cover their deposits and liabilities arisingfrom investment business through member-ship in a statutory compensation scheme. Forconstitutional reasons, institutions’ compul-sory membership in a guarantee scheme asprescribed by the directives requires a systemof protection that is organised on the basis ofpublic law. It was therefore not possible toimplement the Deposit Guarantee Directivesolely within the framework provided by theexisting private-law self-help schemes of the

32banking industry. Participation in a statutory
compensation scheme is also compulsory forthose institutions which already belong to thebanking associations’ voluntary protectionschemes.
In conformity with the Deposit Guarantee
Directive, the Deposit Guarantee and InvestorCompensation Act exempts members ofschemes safeguarding the viability of institu-tions from compulsory membership in astatutory compensation scheme. Members ofthe schemes which safeguard the viability ofinstitutions are exempt if, by virtue of theirby-laws, the schemes protect the membercredit institutions themselves, i.e. prevent im-pending insolvency through restructuring.The guarantee schemes of the Federal Associ-ation of German People’s Banks and Raiff-eisen Banks, or operated by the regional co-operative associations and the German Sav-ings Bank and Giro Association or the region-al savings bank associations, protect the insti-tutions by virtue of their by-laws, and aretherefore deemed to be systems which cansubstitute for compulsory membership in thestatutory compensation scheme under theterms of the directive.
The German savings bank system has amend-
ed its specimen by-laws to bring them intoline with the Deposit Guarantee and InvestorCompensation Act: the Land banks/regionalgiro institutions and the regional building andloan associations have now been explicitly in-cluded in the protection of institutions pro-vided by the savings bank schemes. Conse-quently, these institutions do not have to bemembers of a statutory guarantee scheme
either.
Implementing the two EC directives in the
Deposit Guarantee and Investor Compen-sation Act also entailed amendments tothe Banking Act. Section 23a (Guaranteescheme) now provides that an institutionwhich conducts banking business within themeaning of section 1 (1) sentence 2 num-bers 1, 4 or 10 of the Banking Act (depositbusiness, principal broking services, under-writing business) or which provides financialservices within the meaning of section 1 (1a)sentence 2 numbers 1 to 4 (investment brok-ing, contract broking, portfolio management,own-account trading) shall draw attention inits price list to its membership in a compensa-tion scheme. New customers have to be in-formed about the guarantee provisions, in-cluding the amount and scope of the guaran-tee. Section 32 (3) and (3a) of the BankingAct now provides that, before granting the li-cence, the Federal Banking Supervisory Officeshall consult the guarantee scheme appropri-ate for the institution, and shall, on grantingthe licence, inform the institution, if it is liableto pay contributions under the Deposit Guar-antee and Investor Compensation Act, of thecompensation scheme to which it has beenassigned. Under the Deposit Guarantee andInvestor Compensation Act the Federal Bank-ing Supervisory Office may, in a closely re-stricted number of cases, assign an institu-tion, on request, to a compensation schemeother than that provided for by law. Pursuantto section 35 (1) of the Banking Act, an insti-tution’s licence expires if the institution hasbeen excluded from the relevant statutory

33compensation scheme. In particular, this may
be the case if an institution fails to meet thestatutory contribution or cooperation require-ments.
Also, if credit institutions belong to a deposit
protection scheme they are not obliged tobe members of an investor compensationscheme as well, since the scope of their statu-tory protection also covers investment ser-vices.
Statutory compensation schemes
The Deposit Guarantee and Investor Com-
pensation Act provides for the establishmentof different compensation schemes for threecategories of institutions: private deposit-taking credit institutions including privatebuilding and loan associations, public deposit-taking credit institutions, and “other institu-tions”. The last category includes those insti-tutions which are not deposit-taking credit in-stitutions: in other words, institutions (secur-ities trading banks, financial services institu-tions, investment companies) which conductinvestment and contract broking, portfoliomanagement or own-account trading or prin-cipal broking or underwriting business, re-spectively. The Deposit Guarantee and Invest-or Compensation Act does not cover financialservices institutions which are not securitiestrading firms, the business of which is gearedsolely to non-EEA deposit broking, moneytransmission services or foreign currency deal-ing.Under the Deposit Guarantee and Investor
Compensation Act, the statutory compensa-tion schemes are set up at the ReconstructionLoan Corporation (Kreditanstalt für Wieder-
aufbau), a specialised bank of the Federal
Government, as special Federal funds havingno legal personality.
The functions and powers of a compensation
scheme may be assigned to a private-law en-tity, however, if the latter meets the require-ments for performing the statutory functionsof the compensation scheme pursuant to theDeposit Guarantee and Investor Compensa-tion Act. By allowing such public-law func-tions to be assigned to private-law entities,the act has made it possible, firstly, to easepressure on the public sector and, secondly,to make use of the private initiative and ex-pertise that are available in the field of de-posit protection. For this purpose, the func-tion of an “entrusted compensation scheme”has to be assigned by regulation to private-law legal entities. The legal status of an en-trusted compensation scheme is determinedby public law under the statutory mandate ofthe Deposit Guarantee and Investor Compen-sation Act. The compensation schemes maytake administrative action such as decisionson contributions and ordering audits. TheFederal Banking Supervisory Office will take adecision on any objections to administrativeacts. The compensation schemes have a par-tial legal capacity; in the course of their busi-ness operations they may themselves sue, orbe sued, at an administrative court.

34Act are subject to supervision by the Federal
Banking Supervisory Office. The Federal Bank-ing Supervisory Office is to counteract any ir-regularities which may impair the proper per-formance of the functions of a compensationscheme or jeopardise the assets accumulated.The alternative protection schemes of thesavings bank and cooperative sectors are alsosubject to supervision. The Federal BankingSupervisory Office also oversees whetherthese schemes meet the requirements of theact – in particular, the requirements pertain-ing to solvency and liquidity, and the availabil-ity of the necessary assets. For this purpose,under the Deposit Guarantee and InvestorCompensation Act there exist special require-ments to provide information on the amountand investment of the funds, and the use ofthe funds for compensation paid. To thatend, an approved annual report providedwith an audit certificate is to be submitted tothe Federal Banking Supervisory Office andthe Deutsche Bundesbank. Furthermore, theFederal Banking Supervisory Office has thesame rights to receive information and orderaudits as it has vis-à-vis an individual institu-tion pursuant to section 44 (1) of the BankingAct. The Deposit Guarantee and InvestorCompensation Act also gives the FederalBanking Supervisory Office authority to issueorders to the persons charged with the func-tions and powers of the compensationschemes for the purpose of preventing orhelping to eliminate irregularities.Compensation schemes of the deposit-
taking credit institutions
In setting up the statutory compensation
schemes for the deposit-taking credit institu-tions which come under the Deposit Guaran-tee and Investor Compensation Act, it waspossible to use the established organisationalstructure of the relevant banking associ-ations. The Federal Association of GermanBanks (Bundesverband deutscher Banken)
and the Federal Association of Public Banks(Bundesverband Öffentlicher Banken Deutsch-lands) declared that they were prepared to as-
sume the responsibilities and powers of anentrusted compensation scheme for the cat-egories of private and public credit institu-tions, respectively. Those responsibilities andpowers were assigned to them by the FederalMinistry of Finance by regulations of Au-gust 24, 1998. The Federal Association ofGerman Banks has set up a private limitedcompany for this purpose ( Entschädigungs-
einrichtung deutscher Banken GmbH). As-
signed to this compensation scheme aredeposit-taking credit institutions under pri-vate law which are simultaneously membersof the Federal Association of German Banksand of its voluntary Deposit Guarantee Fund,and whose deposits are additionally protect-ed by that fund. The private building andloan associations and those private institu-tions which do not belong to any voluntarydeposit protection scheme are additionally as-signed to this compensation scheme. TheFederal Association of Public Banks has set upa similar compensation scheme of its own forthe category of public-law credit institutions,theEntschädigungseinrichtung des Bundes-

GmbH. For the institutions, assignment to a

The newly established compensation schemes
of the Federal Association of German Banksand the Federal Association of Public Banksare legally independent subsidiaries of thetwo respective associations. All shares in thesubscribed capital are held by the respectiveassociation in question. The performance ofthe compensation schemes’ functions is bothlegally and organisationally separate from theassociations’ own voluntary Deposit Guaran-tee Funds.
Under the act, there is adequate assurance
that the claims of the persons eligible to becompensated will be satisfied if the entrustedcompensation scheme has resources of itsown equivalent to 31 million or more. In set-
ting up the compensation schemes fordeposit-taking credit institutions, the min-imum amount was provided by the transferof funds from the voluntary deposit protec-tion schemes of the Federal Association ofGerman Banks and the Federal Association ofPublic Banks.
Compensation scheme of the securities
trading firms
Unlike the credit institutions, the securities
trading firms were not in a position to effecta solution at the association level. Under theDeposit Guarantee and Investor Compensa-tion Act, therefore, a compensation scheme(Entschädigungseinrichtung der Wertpapier-
handelsunternehmen) was set up at the Re-
construction Loan Corporation. All other in-stitutions that must belong to a guaranteescheme under the terms of the act are as-signed to the compensation scheme at theReconstruction Loan Corporation. A first-timecontribution was needed to meet the min-imum statutory provision of funds. Depend-ing on the type of institution and the scopeof the licence, this contribution amounted to0.1% or 1% of the liable capital or of at leastthe statutory initial capital, respectively, of theinstitution in question and had to be paidwithin two months of the act coming intoforce.
Scope of the right to compensation
The deposit guarantee and investor compen-
sation directives require no more than min-imum harmonisation for the protection of de-positors and investors. In terms of the scopeand amount of the rights to compensation,the Deposit Guarantee and Investor Compen-sation Act is geared to these harmonised min-imum requirements of the two EC directives.Deposits in the narrow sense are protected aswell as certain investment services providedin principal broking, safe custody and under-writing business, investment and contractbroking, portfolio management and own-account trading.
Under the act, a creditor’s right to compensa-
tion arising from deposits and investmentbusiness is based on the following factors:

36Essentially, account balances and claims
arising from registered debt securities aredeemed to be protected deposits. Claims aris-ing from bearer or order bonds do not fallwithin the definition of protected deposits.No right to compensation exists if deposits orfunds are not denominated in the currency ofa country in the European Economic Area orin euro.
Claims for the transfer of ownership of secur-
ities or the disbursement of funds in connec-tion with investment business, such as pro-ceeds from the sale of securities, are deemedto be protected claims arising from invest-ment business. If there exist claims arisingfrom both deposits and investment services,these may each be asserted separately. In thecase of deposit-taking credit institutions,claims for the disbursement of funds in con-nection with investment business are deemedto be deposits; with such institutions, thelegal claim to compensation arising from in-vestment business therefore covers solely theclaim to surrender the securities. In invest-ment business, the calculation of the amountof the claim to compensation is based on themarket value of the financial instruments onthe date when it is determined that compen-sation is payable.

from investment business, the amount of theclaim to compensation is limited to 90% ofthe non-fulfilled claims (i.e. a retention of10%) and the equivalent of 320,000 for
each creditor.The claims of certain groups of depositors,
which do not require any special protectionunder the provisions of the directives, are alsoexcluded from statutory compensation underthe Deposit Guarantee and Investor Compen-sation Act. In particular, these are credit insti-tutions, financial services institutions, otherfinancial institutions and investment com-panies (including the special funds managedby them), public bodies, medium-sized andlarge incorporated enterprises, insurance en-terprises, as well as creditors in certain grouprelationships.
If a credit institution is additionally a voluntary
member of a deposit protection scheme oper-ated by the banking associations, this supple-ments the statutory protection. The type andscope of the supplementary cover is basedon the by-laws of the voluntary protectionscheme in question. The scope of protectionand the amount of deposit cover in the vol-untary supplementary deposit protectionscheme have not changed following theentry into force of the Deposit Guarantee andInvestor Compensation Act.
The directives also call for the protection of
customers of branches which institutionshave established in other member states ofthe European Economic Area. Such branchesdo not require authorisation by the supervis-ory authority of the host country. The estab-lishment of such branches merely has to bereported to the supervisory authority in ques-tion. In the single European market with free-dom of establishment and cross-border trans-actions in services, the home-country banking

Under the Deposit Guarantee and Investor
Compensation Act, branches in Germany ofenterprises domiciled in another state of theEuropean Economic Area have the right tojoin a statutory compensation scheme pro-vided that the level or scope of statutorycompensation exceeds the level of cover inthe enterprise’s home country (topping-up).As the Deposit Guarantee and Investor Com-pensation Act has implemented only the min-imum requirements of the directives, there isvirtually no need for increasing the branch of-fices’ scope of cover.
The supplementary voluntary deposit protec-
tion schemes operated by the banking associ-ations, which ensure a higher level of cover,are not affected by the act and, therefore,the statutory right of “topping up”. However,branches of foreign private credit institutionsmay apply for membership in the voluntaryDeposit Guarantee Fund of the Federal Asso-ciation of German Banks. Branches of foreigninstitutions may be admitted if they meet therequirements for membership under the by-laws of the association’s Deposit GuaranteeFund. For branches of EU credit institutionswhich are not additionally members of a vol-untary German deposit protection scheme,sole responsibility lies with the deposit protec-tion system in the home country.
Branches of enterprises domiciled in non-EEA
countries, which are deemed to be a credit in-stitution or a financial services institution pur-suant to section 53 of the Banking Act, comeunder the Deposit Guarantee and Investor
Compensation Act and must belong to acompensation scheme in Germany.
The Deposit Guarantee and the Investor
Compensation Directives initially provided forinstitutions from member states with a higherlevel of cover for their branches abroad grant-ing only the level of cover of the host country(export ban). This provision was in force for alimited period until December 31, 1999 andwas one of the points addressed by the Fed-eral Republic of Germany’s action at the Euro-pean Court of Justice, but was not extendedby the Commission. Since January 1, 2000branches of credit institutions from othermember states may therefore offer depositguarantees in the host country that exceedthe statutory level of cover of the host coun-try. Section 14 of the Deposit Guarantee andInvestor Compensation Act which imple-mented the export ban in respect of Germaninstitutions’ branches in other states of theEuropean Economic Area is therefore nolonger required. It was of minor importancein any case as only the minimum require-ments of the directives were implemented.

38to pay compensation from the funds raised
by contributions after the deduction of thecosts. In line with the provisions of the direct-ives, the funding of the statutory compensa-tion schemes is to be ensured by all deposit-taking credit institutions and all other institu-tions conducting investment business. Thefunds for paying compensation thereforehave to be raised by the institutions them-selves. Funding can be ensured all the moreeffectively, the higher the number of institu-tions there are in any given compensationscheme. However, the compensation schemeoperated by the Federal Association of PublicBanks – like the voluntary Deposit GuaranteeFund of the public credit institutions – has nomore than a comparatively small number ofheterogeneous banks assigned to it. Thiswould appear to make appropriate risk diver-sification more difficult. Ultimately, however,
the compensation scheme is still likely to haveviable funding on account of the public-lawcharacter of the assigned institutions. The actdoes not provide for an “overflow arrange-ment” among the individual statutory com-pensation schemes.
The Federal Ministry of Finance has issued
regulations on the contributions to the com-pensation schemes on the basis of the De-posit Guarantee and Investor CompensationAct. The regulations contain provisions on theannual contributions, special contributionsand borrowing. The assigned institutions areobliged to pay annual contributions onSeptember 30 each year.

for paying compensation suffice.
Deposit-taking credit institutionsPursuant to the regulation of the Federal
Ministry of Finance of July 10, 1999 on thecontributions to the compensation schemesof the Federal Association of German Banksand of the Federal Association of PublicBanks in Germany, the annual contributionamounts to 0.008% of the balance sheetitem “amounts owed to customers” in thelast annual accounts prepared before July 1.Certain liabilities contained in this balancesheet item, which have no relation to protect-ed business within the meaning of the De-posit Guarantee and Investor CompensationAct, do not have to be included in calculatingthe deposits to be guaranteed. If an institu-tion makes use of these possibilities of deduc-tion, it must provide evidence – authenticatedby an external auditor or accounting firm – ofthe amount of the items deducted. Notwith-standing this, institutions with significant spe-cial features in their business structure maypay an annual contribution amounting to 1%of the potential scope of the compensationclaims within the meaning of the DepositGuarantee and Investor Compensation Act.
In accordance with the regulation, the min-
imum volume of funds required for the com-pensation schemes is staggered in relation tothe contributions over an introductory period.Up to December 31, 1999 the required min-imum volume of funds was 75% of the con-tributions to be paid as start-up funding. In2000, it is one and a half times the sum ofthe most recently paid annual contributions,
and from January 1, 2001 double the sum ofthe most recently paid annual contributions.The minimum volume is intended to ensurethat funds are also available for compensa-tion payments in the short term.
The compensation scheme is to raise special
contributions from the institutions assignedto it or borrow funds if the compensationschemes’ funds fall below the prescribed min-imum volume, or if claims have become dueagainst the compensation scheme and meet-ing them within two months would lead tosuch a shortfall. The amount of the specialcontributions or borrowing should be suchthat compliance with the minimum volume isensured taking into account the expected re-turn flows of funds and after deducting theexisting claims against the compensationscheme and other costs. This implements thelegislative aim of meeting the compensationclaims of the credit institutions’ creditors bymeans of the credit institutions’ contributionsto the compensation scheme. The level ofspecial contributions for each institution is de-termined by the share most recently payableby the institution to the total volume ofcontributions. The respective compensationscheme may exempt individual institutionsfrom all or some of their obligation to payspecial contributions if there are grounds tofear that paying the special contribution infull would result in compensation having tobe paid to the institution itself (domino ef-fect). A decision on exemption has to be ap-proved by the Federal Banking SupervisoryOffice. If the compensation scheme has bor-rowed funds, it may – likewise with the ap-

Securities trading firmsThe “Regulation governing contributions to
the compensation scheme of the securitiestrading firms at the Reconstruction Loan Cor-poration”, issued by the Federal Ministry ofFinance on August 19, 1999 provides forgraduated contributions in line with thescope of the institution’s licence. The contri-butions are graduated depending on how thetransactions requiring a licence are defined inthe Banking Act, and on whether the licenceauthorises the institution to acquire owner-ship or possession of customers’ funds or se-curities, to trade in financial instruments forits own account or to conduct own-accounttrading for others. The annual contributionrate is:
– 1% for institutions liable to pay contribu-
tions which are authorised to acquireownership or possession of customers’funds and securities;
– 2% for institutions liable to pay contribu-
tions which are additionally authorised toconduct own-account trading for othersor to trade in financial instruments fortheir own account;– 0.3% for institutions liable to pay contri-
butions which are not authorised to ac-quire ownership or possession of custom-ers’ funds or securities;
– in all cases, however, a minimum contri-
bution of 3200.
Only those institutions assigned to the com-
pensation scheme of the securities tradingfirms on January 1 of any given year are liableto pay contributions.
The gross receipts from commissions and
from financial transactions which are requiredto be shown in the annual accounts (i.e. themost recent annual accounts approved be-fore July 1 of a given year) are used as thebasis for calculating the contributions. If theannual accounts are unavailable on July 1,the compensation scheme may fix, as partpayment, one and a quarter times the annualcontribution, with the annual contributionbeing estimated taking account of the scaleand structure of the business of the institu-tion or a group of comparable institutions. Inthe case of a newly assigned institution, con-tributions are to be determined on the basisof the projected profit and loss accounts forthe first accounting year to be submitted be-fore the commencement of business. Whendetermining the basis for calculating contri-butions, 90% of the gross receipts fromtransactions with customers who have noright to compensation under the DepositGuarantee and Investor Compensation Actmay be ignored if the institution presents evi-dence of this which has been authenticatedby an external auditor. For a transitional

41period, the regulation makes additional con-
cessions for the contribution years 1999 and2000. These include the possibility of non-inclusion of 90% of the aforementionedgross receipts from financial transactionseven if evidence is not provided. This is in-tended to prevent hardship in the case of se-curities trading firms which are liable to paycontributions to a compensation scheme forthe first time.
Initial practical experience of raising contribu-
tions from the securities trading firms as-signed to their compensation scheme re-vealed isolated problems in defining the grosscommission receipts, although this does notcall into question their suitability as a basis forcalculation. Rather, it should be possible tostructure the institutions’ accounting prac-tices in such a way that the required earningsfigures are modelled correctly. This does notpreclude the possibility of an amendment tothe regulation taking account of more de-tailed information on the size and volume ofthe contributions.
The provisions on raising special contributions
and on the special payments when funds areborrowed by the securities trading firm’s com-pensation scheme correspond to those for thecompensation schemes of the deposit-takingcredit institutions.
Compensation
The creditors of credit institutions and of cer-
tain financial services institutions, in the eventof the institution’s insolvency, can bring a civilclaim for compensation against the compen-
sation scheme to which their debtor institu-tion belongs. A legal right to compensationof this kind does not exist for the protectedcreditors under the by-laws of the private de-posit protection schemes. The ruling thatcompensation is payable is made by the Fed-eral Banking Supervisory Office and is pub-lished in the Federal Gazette. The compensa-tion scheme checks the creditors’ claims thathave been submitted in writing and verifiestheir eligibility, and has to pay compensationto the creditors within three months of thedate when it was determined that compensa-tion is payable. The claim to compensationmust be submitted by the creditor to therelevant compensation scheme within oneyear.
In cases where credit institutions do both de-
posit and investment business which comeunder the terms of the Deposit Guaranteeand Investor Compensation Act, the claim todeposit protection and investor compensa-tion applies in each case up to the respectivecover limit. The calculation of the amount ofthe claim to compensation is based on theamounts of the deposits or funds and themarket value of the securities on the datewhen it is determined that compensation ispayable, including any interest accrued untilthe settlement of the claim.

42tive grounds. This well-established system of
voluntary protection schemes operated bythe associations of the various categories ofbanks continues unchanged even after theDeposit Guarantee and Investor Compensa-tion Act has entered into force. As privateself-help schemes operated by the banks,these supplementary deposit protectionschemes are not subject to the provisions ofthe act. We refer you to the article publishedin the July 1992 Monthly Report for an over-view of the historical background to depositprotection in Germany and a general accountof the Deposit Guarantee Fund of the privatebanks at the Federal Association of GermanBanks as well as the protection schemes inthe savings bank and cooperative sectors.
As before, the deposit-protection limit per
creditor at the Deposit Guarantee Fund of theFederal Association of German Banks is 30%of the bank’s liable capital as defined in sec-tion 10 (2) of the Banking Act, with the pru-dential supplementary capital being includedonly up to the level of 25% of the core cap-ital.
Protection is given to all liabilities to non-
credit institutions (in particular: individuals,business enterprises and public bodies) whichare required to be shown in the balance sheetitem “amounts owed to customers”, such assight deposits, time deposits and savingsdeposits, including registered bank savingsbonds. Liabilities are protected irrespective ofthe currency in which they are denominated.Furthermore, the protection of deposits alsoextends to branches abroad. Liabilities forwhich a bank has issued bearer instruments,liabilities arising from securities repurchase or
repo transactions, and obligations to returnsecurities under stock lending transactionsare not protected, however.
Since 1998, the institutions belonging to the
Deposit Guarantee Fund have been subject toan annual classification. The principles for theclassification procedure form part of the by-laws. Institutions are classified by their finan-cial soundness using key figures on theirfinancial position and profitability, and by anassessment of the quality of management.Classification is undertaken by a private limit-ed company for assessing private banks, theGBB (Gesellschaft für Bankbeurteilung im pri-vaten Bankgewerbe mbH), which is a subsid-
iary of the Audit Association of GermanBanks (Prüfungsverband deutscher Banken).
Banks are assigned to one of the classes A, Bor C (with three sub-classes) depending onthe outcome of the classification. Banks be-longing to class C are rated as particularlyrisk-prone and require continuous and inten-sive assessment. Banks assigned to class B orC are required to pay a higher contributionwhich must not exceed two and a half timesthe current standard rate. The general annualcontribution rate is 0.3‰ of the balancesheet item “amounts owed to customers” inthe most recent annual accounts. The re-quirement to make an annual contributionmay be suspended or its amount reduced ifthe assets of the Deposit Guarantee Fundhave reached an appropriate level. Further-more, banks which have paid more than20 annual contributions and are assigned toclass A may be exempted from the obligationto make contributions. The Deposit Guaran-

suspending the raising of contributions frombanks which meet the above-mentioned re-quirements.
The German branches of foreign banks basic-
ally have the possibility of cooperating in theprivate deposit protection scheme of the Fed-eral Association of German Banks. On com-petitive grounds, the conditions that apply tothem are the same as those for domesticbanks. The foreign banks’ branches which aremembers of the Federal Association of Ger-man Banks may be exempted, upon applica-tion, from the simultaneous obligation to co-operate in the Deposit Guarantee Fund if theprotection scheme of their home state safe-guards the deposits maintained in Germanyto an extent equivalent to the EU directive.
By 1994, certain institutions which were not
members of a deposit protection scheme inthe past on account of their particular, low-risk business structure or owing to their publiclegal status had set up additional self-helpschemes of their own operated by their re-spective banking associations. The main rea-sons for this were the transparency require-ment of section 23a of the Banking Act(newly introduced as part of the fourthamendment to the Banking Act) if an institu-tion is not a member of a deposit protectionscheme, and the EU’s efforts at harmonisa-tion with regard to the call for making mem-bership in a deposit guarantee scheme com-pulsory for all deposit-taking credit institu-tions. This means that the protection schemesfor the private banks as well as the institu-tional protections of the savings bank andcooperative bank sectors – which were al-
ready in existence in the early nineties – arenow joined, in particular, by public credit in-stitutions and private building and loan asso-ciations with protection schemes of theirown. These schemes supplement statutorycompensation on the basis of the DepositGuarantee and Investor Compensation Actwith voluntary guarantee payments. TheDeposit Guarantee Fund established at theFederal Association of Public Banks safe-guards – without prejudice to any guarantor’suncalled liability – all liabilities to non-creditinstitutions with the exception of liabilities forwhich bearer instruments have been issued.In the case of the private building and loanassociations, all liabilities to customers arisingfrom savings deposits under savings and loancontracts are protected. Liabilities arisingfrom other deposits are safeguarded up to atotal of DM 100,000 per depositor.
In setting up entrusted compensation
schemes, a subsidiarity clause was added tothe by-laws of the voluntary deposit protec-tion funds of the Federal Association of Ger-man Banks and the Federal Association ofPublic Banks. This clause stipulates that com-pensation under the by-laws will be paid todepositors only if they do not already have aclaim under the statutory deposit protectionscheme. Any claims beyond that will be met bythe voluntary deposit protection schemes upto the ceiling provided for under the by-laws.
In general, supplementary protection com-
prises both deposits in Germany and thosewith branches abroad, irrespective of the cur-rency in which they are denominated and

the deposits of those depositors who have noclaim against the statutory compensationscheme concerned (public sector, investmentcompanies with their fund assets, and allbusiness enterprises with the exception of thebanks).
The combination of statutory depositor com-
pensation and supplementary voluntary de-posit protection will ensure that a compre-
hensive and well-established level of protec-tion against the loss of deposits will also beafforded to depositors in Germany in futurein the event of their credit institution becom-ing insolvent. This will help to maintain thepublic’s confidence in the stability of the Ger-man banking system – a confidence that hasevolved over many years.

47Germany’s role in
international servicetransactionsInternational service transactions have
attracted increasing attention in thepast few years owing to the growingimportance of the services sector foreconomic growth and employment inthe highly developed industrial coun-tries and the increased efforts withinthe framework of the World Trade Or-ganisation (WTO) and the Organisa-tion for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment (OECD) to achieve great-er liberalisation of cross-border tradein services. This is especially true forGermany because the German servicesaccount, unlike the country’s trade bal-ance, has been recording deficits forsome time now, and these deficits ac-tually increased substantially duringthe nineties. This raises the question asto whether the German business com-munity has become less competitiveand lost market shares in the servicessectors with a promising future. Thefollowing article provides a detailedanalysis of Germany’s role in cross-border services compared with that ofother industrial countries.
Trends in international service
transactions
The expansion of international service trans-
actions has accelerated perceptibly in thepast two decades. In the nineties alone, ex-ports of services increased by approximately85% in terms of volume; this corresponds toan annual growth rate of 6
12%, comparedOverview

Deutsche
Bundesbank
Monthly Report
July 2000
48with 512% in the eighties. Thus, in both
decades, trade in services expanded some-what more rapidly than trade in goods. Theindustrial countries account for almost three-quarters of total turnover from services trans-actions. Their market share in the servicessector is therefore slightly greater (around5 percentage points) than their share in inter-national trade in goods.
Firstly, the dynamic growth of cross-border
turnover in the services sector must be con-sidered in the context of the overall expan-sion of global trade, which ultimately reflectsthe increasing division of labour in the globalproduction process. Secondly, its develop-ment was also influenced by a number ofspecial factors. For example, technologicaldevelopments such as the progress made inthe processing and transmission of informa-
tion and other data played a key role in manyareas. However, it was often impossible to ex-ploit these improved technological possibil-ities until the trade barriers prevailing in theinternational trade in services were elimin-ated in the eighties and nineties. Trade ingoods among the industrial countries, bycontrast, had already been largely liberalised.International trade in services first becamethe object of multilateral liberalisation negoti-ations during the Uruguay round (1986–1994) and was given an initial multilateralframework in the “General Agreement onTrade in Services” (GATS).
This development was also bolstered by the
liberalisation of financial transactions in thecourse of the eighties and the simultaneousderegulation of the financial markets, whichhighlighted the obstacles facing the suppliersof cross-border financial services. Often,these regulations were not primarily intendedto prevent the respective national service pro-viders from trading but, instead, were basedon prudential considerations or concernabout savers’ protection. The efforts toachieve a greater harmonisation of nationalbanking and financial market supervision or –as in the case of the European Union – the re-ciprocal recognition of prudentially motivatedmarket access regulations are to be seen inthis context, as they made it possible for therespective services markets to open upincreasingly as a result of growing financialinterdependence and IT interlinkage acrossnational borders. It is therefore not surprisingthat strong turnover growth was recorded es-pecially in the field of financial services (in-

49cluding insurance services) – even though the
share of this sub-sector in the industrial coun-tries’ total cross-border turnover in the ser-vices sector is not particularly large. In theG-7 countries, financial and insurance ser-vices account for only 6% of turnover fromservices transactions.
Turnover in the area of foreign travel, which
accounts for around 30% of total inter-national trade in services, also expanded sub-stantially. Here, too, liberalisation and deregu-lation measures – especially in civil aviation –and the associated price cuts are likely tohave played an important role, as they firstmade long-distance travel possible for broadsections of the population. Another import-ant factor was probably the opening of theborders of the former Soviet Union and its al-lied countries, which tended to strengthenglobal demand for travel services.
Against this background, the below-average
growth of turnover in the transportation sec-tor – which accounts for almost one-quarterof total cross-border turnover in the servicessector and represents the second most im-portant sub-sector after foreign travel – mayappear somewhat surprising. However, it canbe explained by the sharp decline in freightand transportation costs, which dampenedthe development of turnover despite the con-siderably stronger real growth of transportservices. Other reasons might have been thedeclining importance of “staple commod-ities” in international trade and the increasingtransportation of high-tech goods.Despite the overall dynamic expansion of
international trade in services, the share ofservices in total cross-border payment trans-actions is relatively small, at around one-fifth,especially as value added in the services sec-tor accounts for more than one-half of GDPin the industrial countries. This is most likelyattributable to the relatively late liberalisationof trade in invisibles, which has still notreached the level achieved in merchandisetrade, and the late deregulation of the ter-tiary sector, which did not gather force untilthe nineties.
One must also bear in mind that numerous
services are not suited for international tradeor are included only indirectly as intermediateinput in the value of the traded goods. Final-ly, it should also be kept in mind that ser-vices are often provided through subsidiariesabroad because the provider is often requiredto be present in the market.
This article is based on balance of payments
statistics on cross-border service transactions.However, these reflect “only” the transac-tions of residents with non-residents, i.e. theyprovide information on service transactions ofenterprises and individuals domiciled in Ger-many with counterparties abroad. Thus, bal-ance of payments data cannot precisely re-flect the international market position of Ger-man service enterprises because the transac-tions of the foreign subsidiaries of Germanservice firms with counterparties abroad haveno influence on the German balance of pay-ments (and are therefore not contained in thedata used in this article).

The United States is by far the largest export-er and importer of services worldwide, ac-counting for more than 16% of global turn-over in international service transactions in1998 (more recent data are not yet available).This means that its share even slightly exceedsthe country’s position in global trade in goods(just under 15%). At just under 8% of globalturnover in the services sector, Germanycomes in second, but its share in servicetransactions remains behind its position inglobal merchandise trade (just over 9%).
Germany is followed by Japan and the UnitedKingdom, each of which account for 6
12%
of international turnover in services (com-pared with a share of 6
12%a n d5 % ,r e -
spectively, in global trade in goods).
However, this ranking masks considerable dif-
ferences in the structure of the individualcountries’ turnover in services, as becomesevident when export and import turnover arecompared. With a share of 19%, the UnitedStates is the leading exporter of servicesworldwide, followed at some distance by theUnited Kingdom (7
12%) and by Germany
and France (each with just over 6%). Whileon the imports side the United States againtakes the lead (13
12%), it is followed more
closely by Germany (912%) and Japan
(812%), whereas the United Kingdom has a
substantially smaller share (just under 6%).
As a result, the United States, the United
Kingdom and France record large surpluses intheir trade in services, whereas Japan, fol-lowed by Germany, records the largest deficitin cross-border service transactions. Yet evenwithout taking the above-mentioned restric-tions into account, this does not necessarilyprovide an insight into the international com-%

Germany’s position as a supplier
and customer in international tradein services
With an average annual growth rate of al-
most 7
12%, the international market for for-
eign travel, which accounts for the largestshare of turnover in services worldwide, wasamong those that expanded particularlystrongly in the nineties. In 1998 (more recent
data are not available for the entire market),turnover in foreign travel amounted to US$810 billion, which means that almost one-third of global turnover in the services sectorwas attributable to tourism. In Germany, theimportance of this sub-sector is even greater,especially on the expenditure side. More thanone-third of German imports of services arerelated to foreign travel, compared with ashare of only one-fifth on the revenue side.With the exception of the United States(20%), Germany thus accounts for the great-est share (16
12%) of foreign travel expend-
iture of all industrial countries. In fact, its def-icit in this area is the largest worldwide. Theclimatic and geographic conditions in Ger-many obviously also play an important role inthis, even though the infrastructure for travelTravel receipts and expenditure

52within Germany is well up to international
standards.
German expenditure on foreign travel grew
most significantly in the first half of the nine-ties, when, after reunification, many eastGermans were able to satisfy their pent-updemand for holiday trips for the first time inyears. This strong rise in spending on foreigntravel did not level off substantially until themid-nineties; since then, travel expenditure
has developed broadly in line with disposableincome. However, with per capita spendingon foreign travel amounting to almost US$600, Germany, along with the United King-dom, has remained at the top of the leagueof major industrial countries. In the UnitedStates and Japan, per capita expenditure onforeign travel is less than half as high (justover US$ 200); French and Italian travellers,too, spend considerably less for their tripsabroad (around US$ 300). Only the smaller in-dustrial countries such as Switzerland andAustria recorded higher per capita expend-iture on foreign travel than Germany (aroundUS$ 1,000 and US$ 1,200, respectively).
German travellers’ favourite destinations are
the southern European holiday countries, es-pecially Spain and Italy, as well as the neigh-bouring Alpine countries Austria and Switzer-land, which accordingly – and in contrast toGermany – figure at the top of the league interms of per capita revenue (around US$1,400 and US$ 1,100, respectively). In 1999,three-quarters of total German expenditureon foreign travel went to the EU countriesand Switzerland. The highest growth rates,however, were recorded for long-distancedestinations such as the countries in theCaribbean and South-East Asia. As a result,the overall share of the overseas countrieshas risen from 15
12% to 18% in the course
of the past decade. The central and easternEuropean countries also became populartravel destinations for German tourists andbusiness travellers in the nineties, accountingfor 4% of German travel expenditure lastyear.%

53The market for international transportation is
the second most important services sub-sector in terms of turnover after foreigntravel. In 1998, world-wide turnover in trans-portation services amounted to just over US$660 million or almost one-quarter of globaltrade in services. Freight services had thegreatest weight, accounting for almost one-half of this amount, followed by passengertransport (just over one-quarter); port (includ-ing airport) fees and other transportation ser-vices accounted for the remainder.
At an annual rate of 5%, turnover growth
in cross-border transportation services wasbelow average in the nineties. However, thiswas probably chiefly attributable to the de-clining international freight charges and thelower prices for passenger transport; in realterms, transportation services increased muchmore rapidly. German businesses’ supply anddemand in the field of international transpor-tation are broadly similar. German revenuefrom transportation services provided to for-eign customers accounts for just under 7%of global turnover in this area, making Ger-many, along with Japan, France, the Nether-lands and the United Kingdom, one of themost important suppliers. All of these coun-tries have very similar shares in world-widerevenue from transportation services, whilethe United States – if only because of itssize – tops the list with a 15% share.
German revenue from transportation services
accounted for around one-quarter of thecountry’s total revenue from services in 1999,a proportion similar to that recorded world-wide. At an annual growth rate of just overGermany’s service transactions (f.o.b.)*

546%, revenue accruing from passenger air
transport expanded particularly strongly. Onthe expenditure side, by contrast, paymentsmade to non-residents for freight servicesrose particularly fast (at an average annualgrowth rate of 8%). This was attributable tothe dynamic expansion of German foreigntrade, on the one hand, and the country’sweak position in international marine trans-port, on the other. Overall, the deficit on Ger-many’s transportation account increased to35 billion last year – despite larger surpluses
in passenger air transport – compared with32 billion in 1990.
The remaining cross-border services cover a
broad range of categories, each of which car-ries a relatively low weight in world-widecross-border turnover in the tertiary sector.Yet some of these sub-sectors have witnessed
surprisingly buoyant growth during the pastfew years. This holds true, for example, forfinancial services, which gained substantialweight in the nineties in the context of the in-creasing integration of financial markets andthe opening-up of national markets to for-eign suppliers. Although there are no com-prehensive statistics on world-wide turnoverin financial services, this trend is clearly dis-cernible from the data available for the majorindustrial countries alone. In the course of thenineties, the G-7 countries’ revenue from fi-nancial services to foreign clients expanded atan average annual rate of just under 7%. At40% and 30%, respectively, the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom account forthe largest share of the receipts of the G-7countries in this sub-sector. Financial institu-tions domiciled in Germany, by contrast, ac-count for only around 10%. Yet in the pastfew years, their revenue has also increasedvery rapidly (at an average annual rate of22% during the nineties) from its initially lowlevel.
However, expenditure on foreign financial
services grew even faster in Germany thanrevenue: during the nineties, it increased atan annual average rate of 30%. German im-ports of financial services account for 14% ofthe respective imports of the G-7 countries –a somewhat larger share than on the exportsside. On balance, Germany’s traditional sur-plus in this area recently declined (to just over31 billion in 1999) owing to the stronger
growth in expenditure.

55Yet any conclusions regarding the competi-
tiveness of the German financial institutionsthat are drawn from this data must be treatedwith caution. In any case, it must be kept inmind that only transactions between (foreignand domestic) institutions located in Germanyand non-residents are taken into consider-ation here. For example, financial servicesthat branch offices or subsidiaries abroad pro-vide for their respective clients abroad are dis-regarded. After all, the German banking in-dustry alone has almost 680 foreign branchoffices and subsidiaries.
Another services sub-sector experiencing
robust growth is “technological” services,which comprise patent and licence transac-tions with non-residents, revenue from andexpenditure on research and development,and engineering and EDP services. Suppliersfrom the United States and Japan dominatethe market in this field. On the basis of thedata available for the G-7 countries, for ex-ample, these two countries recently account-ed for 50% and 16
12%, respectively, of turn-
over from patent and licence transactions,followed by the United Kingdom (13%) andGermany (8%). As with financial transac-tions, however, the German share in importsof technological services is larger. On balance,Germany recorded a deficit of 33
12billion in
this sub-sector in 1999. Yet it would be over-simplifying to interpret this fact alone asproof of Germany’s backwardness as a loca-tion for science-based industries. Patent andlicence transactions, for example, also includea substantial number of clearing transactionsbetween foreign firms in Germany and theirparent enterprises which are, in part, also in-fluenced by decisions on corporate policy and
tax considerations.
Publicity, trade fairs and telecommunications
services have also become more important inGerman cross-border trade in services. Inthese areas, too, Germany is more stronglyrepresented on the demand side. The sameholds true for international film business,where the US film and television industry haslong played the leading role. German netpayments to foreign suppliers increasedsteadily throughout the nineties, reaching adeficit of 33 billion in 1999, compared with
3
12billion at the beginning of the decade.

56still achieving relatively large net receipts at
the beginning of the nineties, particularlyfrom transactions with developing and oil-producing countries, turnover growth inthese fields slowed in subsequent years, espe-cially on the revenue side. It is likely that therepresentation of suppliers directly throughsubsidiaries or joint ventures has become evermore important in today’s highly competitivemarkets.
In addition to the services which have been
discussed so far and which are principally pro-vided within a competitive international en-vironment, government services providedoutside the market also play a role in Ger-many. In terms of world-wide turnover in theservices sector, government services are rela-tively insignificant, accounting for around5% of global cross-border service transac-
tions at the beginning of the nineties (sincethen, this share has dropped to under 4%).In Germany, however, the correspondingshare was twice as high (almost 10%) at thebeginning of nineties. The bulk of German re-ceipts in this area was in the form of revenuefrom foreign troops and their families sta-tioned in Germany. Following the fall of theBerlin wall and the removal of troops by theformer Allied countries, revenue from armedforces stationed in Germany declined succes-sively. Accordingly, the share of governmentservices in overall German turnover from ser-vices also fell in the course of the nineties,reaching 2
12% in 1999. At the same time,
the deficit on Germany’s services accountrose substantially. The most important coun-terpart in this respect was the US balance ofpayments, which profited from the “peacedividends”.
With the exception of this special develop-
ment in the sub-sector of government ser-vices, German business has largely been ableto maintain its position in the “other” areasof international service transactions – i.e. ex-cluding foreign travel, transportation servicesand government services. At just under 8%,Germany’s share in world-wide revenue fromservices in these areas was almost as great in1998 as at the beginning of the nineties. Inview of the relatively strong global growth inthese sectors and the fact that German sup-pliers had to face falling market shares in sev-eral important areas such as commercial andtelecommunications services, this can only betaken to mean that German firms enjoy com-petitive advantages in various other sub-US$

57sectors, which had a positive impact on the
overall results. (These cannot be analysed indetail as a precise classification is not possibleowing to a lack of detailed statistics.)
Conclusions
Overall, the special development in the field
of government services as well as the recenttrends in foreign travel have put a strain onGermany’s cross-border services account. Thiswas, however, chiefly attributable to a one-off shift in the level of German expenditureon foreign travel which arose from the pent-up demand in eastern Germany in the firsthalf of the nineties and which led to a suddensurge in the spending of German tourists andbusiness travellers abroad.
In the meantime, these special factors in con-
nection with German unification have re-ceded again. If these factors are disregarded,Germany has been able broadly to maintainits position in international service transac-tions in the past ten years and therefore mostcertainly participated in the stronger growthrecorded in the tertiary sector internationally,
too.
By contrast, important trading partners such
as France and Italy sustained considerablelosses of market shares in their trade in“other” services (excluding foreign travel,transportation and government services)throughout the last decade, whereas theUnited States and the United Kingdom re-corded substantial gains. In the fast-growingsectors of cross-border services – notably fi-nancial and insurance services as well as themore scientific service sectors – which con-tributed substantially towards strengtheningthese two countries’ positions, German sup-pliers were unable to record similar successes.Obviously, Germany’s comparative competi-tive advantage remained chiefly focused onthe field of industrial production in the pastdecade. The technological revolution in thefields of telecommunications and the mediais only slowly leading to changes, and theseare not (yet) reflected in the international ser-vice transactions data on which this article isbased.
