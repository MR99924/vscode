5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a wholeAs assumed in the flash estimate by the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, German real gross do-mestic product (GDP) fell by 0.2% in the firstquarter of 2003 after seasonal and working-day adjustment. Adjusted for variations in thenumber of working days, real GDP was 0.2%up on the year, compared with +0.7% in thefourth quarter of last year. The unadjustedfigures show an increase of 0.5%, as in thelast three months of 2002.
In particular, developments in construction
and its associated sectors had an adverse im-pact on overall output. Seasonally adjustedand at constant prices, construction invest-ment was 3.3% down on the fourth quarterand around 8% down on the year. Unfavour-able winter weather conditions led to markedcut-backs. Furthermore, there was a percep-tible decline in real net exports. Exports ofgoods and services did show a further in-crease, but there was a much sharper rise inimports, not least owing to a high level ofenergy imports. A large part of the demandfor imported energy came from householdsfor covering winter heating needs. This wasone major factor contributing to quite asharp rise in aggregate private consumption.
IndustryIndustrial business activity was subdued at
the start of the second quarter. In April, neworders and output were both down on theprevious months in seasonally adjusted terms.GDP

Output

Monthly Report
June 2003
6Output fell by around 112% against its aver-
age level in the first quarter, which had bene-fited to some extent from the effects ofcatching up on breaks in production duringDecember. Year-on-year growth, which hadbeen more than 1
34% in the first three
months of the year, was almost entirely lost.Producers of capital goods even recordedsizeable declines on the year. Manufacturersof machinery and equipment and of road ve-hicles were especially affected.
In terms of orders received, there was a
weakening, in particular, of domestic de-mand. In April, seasonally adjusted orderswere roughly 1% down on their first-quarterlevel and 1
34% down on the year. Producers
of private motor vehicles showed especiallyheavy losses, while export business held upcomparatively well. After seasonal adjust-
ment, there was a decline in orders comparedwith the first quarter. In characterising thecyclical trend, however, due considerationhas to be given to the fact that Januaryshowed large-scale backlog effects due tothe holidays and days taken off work in De-cember.
ConstructionNo improvement in the construction sector
was evident up to the end of the periodunder review. In April, seasonally adjustedconstruction output held up largely at thelevel in March, when the limiting factors im-posed by the winter weather conditions hadceased to apply. Nevertheless, the fact thatthere was still a large decline on the yearamounting to 7
12% clearly reveals the persist-
ent underlying negative trend.
The decline in demand for construction work
continued well into March (more recent dataare unavailable at present). In seasonally ad-justed terms, the fall in the first quarter as awhole amounted to 6
14% on the final quar-
ter of 2002. The year-on-year decline, at justover 15%, was even sharper than on an an-nual average of 2002 (-5
34%). Residential
construction as well as industrial and publicsector construction were affected by dramaticcutbacks in ordering.
Labour marketThe labour market remained affected by the
downturn in economic activity. As estimatedby the Federal Statistical Office, there was aSeasonally and working-day adjusted, quarterly

7further sharp seasonally adjusted fall in the
number of persons in work in March. At al-most 50,000 persons, the month-on-monthfall was scarcely smaller than before. The em-ployment level declined to 38.32 million. Onbalance, there were 515,000 fewer personsin a job than one year earlier.
According to the Federal Labour Office, un-
employment decreased somewhat in May.The decrease was only slightly larger thanusual in that month, with the effect that theseasonally adjusted figure remained almostconstant at 4.45 million. The year-on-year in-crease, which had been around 470,000 inApril, went down to 395,000. The seasonallyadjusted unemployment rate, as calculatedby the Federal Labour Office, was 10.7%.Using the internationally standardisedmethod, the relevant figure was 9.4%.
Nevertheless, it would seem inappropriate to
infer a cyclical stabilisation from the fact thatunemployment is stagnating in seasonally ad-justed terms. Once again, it is rather the casethat measures as part of the reform of the la-bour market have led to many persons previ-ously registered as unemployed not keepingup or renewing their registration. As is shownby the large number of persons who wereformerly in work and become unemployed,the economic situation remains unfavourablefor the labour market. The year-on-year in-crease in short-time working and the continu-ing decline in reported job vacancies are alsoevidence of that.Economic conditions in Germany*

8Prices
Price developments in the past few months
have been affected by falling oil prices. Therecently observable rise in the prices quotedon the international markets has been on alimited scale so far. Moreover, the appreci-ation of the euro had a price-dampening im-pact.
Seasonally adjusted consumer prices fell
slightly in May. The year-on-year rate of in-crease went down to 0.7% from 1.2% in thefirst quarter. The corresponding figures forHICP inflation were 0.6% and 1.1% respect-ively. Even excluding energy, inflation wasvery moderate. The prices of both industrialgoods and food have remained stable of late.Services and housing rents have shown only aslight upward movement.
The dampening impact of oil prices and the
high euro exchange rate are most clearlyidentifiable in the case of import prices (forwhich statistics are available up to April).Compared with their most recent peak in thefirst few months of this year, they have fallenby 3% in seasonally adjusted terms. Importprices were 3.0% down on the year, afterhaving shown a year-on-year increase for atime. Industrial producer prices, which hadbeen rising for some while, have also beengoing down since April in seasonally adjustedterms. The year-on-year figure, which hadgone up to as much as +1.9% in February,declined to +1.3% in May.Public finance
Indebtedness of central, state and
local government
In April the indebtedness of central, state and
local government rose at an accelerated rate:after going up by 34.4 billion in March, new
liabilities amounting to 310.0 billion net were
taken up in April. Net Federal Governmentborrowing, however, remained limited to32.1 billion. On the one hand, liabilities from
money market loans increased sharply by38.0 billion. On the other, there were sizeable
net redemptions amounting to 35.9 billion on
the capital market. The amount of Federalbonds (Bunds) outstanding actually fell by36.1 billion. Although the topping-up of the

9raised 35.1 billion and the income yielded by
market management operations amountedto a further 32.0 billion, only 32.1 billion of
the proceeds from the top-up accrued to theFederal Government. The larger amount wasforwarded to the ERP Special Fund as part ofthe joint issue. In April a Bund and a bond ofthe Treuhand Agency were each redeemed tothe volume of 35.1 billion.
State government borrowing, which amount-
ed to 34.5 billion net, largely consisted of
issues of Treasury notes, which, given onlyminor redemptions, yielded 33.5 billion net.
Among the individual issues, a five-year bondwith a volume of 31 billion was launched by
the Federal State of Saxony-Anhalt. The Land
governments borrowed 33.2 billion by in-
creasing short-term cash advances frombanks. By contrast, they redeemed otherbank loans to the net value of 32.1 billion.
For a short time, the off-budget special fundsincreased their indebtedness significantly inApril. The main reason for this was the afore-mentioned participation by the ERP SpecialFund in the Bund issue, in which it borrowed33.0 billion. These funds were used in early
May to redeem the last ERP bond in circula-tion from 1993. Local government appears tohave again marginally increased its indebted-ness in April.
Federal Government borrowingIn May the Federal Government increased its
indebtedness by 31.4 billion. In contrast to
the previous month, the Federal Govern-ment’s money market debt was reducedagain (by 35.7 billion) to 312.5 billion. Twoissues were the focal point of gross borrow-
ing on the capital market, which amountedto321.3 billion. First, a new series of five-
year Federal notes (Bobls), with a coupon of3%, was introduced. This achieved an auc-tion volume of 35.0 billion. Including sales
from market management operations ( 33.5
billion) and redemptions ( 37.7 billion), the
outstanding amount of Bobls went up by30.8 billion. Second, the topping-up of the
March issue of Schätze raised 34.1 billion; in
addition, sales from market management op-erations yielded 31.3 billion net. Net earnings
from the current sale of Bunds amounted to32.1 billion. Owing to redemptions, the
amount of Federal savings notes outstandingfell by 31.1 billion. The average yield from the

Securities markets
Bond marketIn April domestic borrowers issued bonds in
the German market to a market value of389.9 billion, which was less than in the pre-
ceding month ( 398.2 billion). As redemptions
and changes in issuers’ holdings of their ownbonds were once again at a high level, netsales, at 311.5 billion, were down somewhat
from the respective figure for March ( 314.6
billion). Sales of foreign bonds in the Germanmarket raised 37.2 billion net; the bulk of
these bonds were denominated in euro. InMarch the volume of foreign paper outstand-ing in Germany went down by 31.7 billion.
Overall, net sales of domestic and foreignbonds yielded 318.7 billion in April, com-
pared with 312.9 billion a month previously.
The bulk of funds raised went to the public
sector, although its borrowing on the bondmarket, at 38.6 billion, was lower than a
month earlier ( 312.1 billion). The Federal
Government raised 38.9 billion net from sales
of debt securities. Most of these were two-year Federal Treasury notes and ten-year Fed-eral bonds, net sales of which amounted to34.3 billion and 31.3 billion respectively. In
April, the Land governments increased the
volume of debt securities issued by 34.2 bil-
lion, a somewhat sharper increase than amonth earlier ( 33.1 billion). Bonds of the for-
mer Treuhand agency worth 34.5 billion wereredeemed. This borrower no longer issues
paper on the bond market under its ownname but instead refinances itself in conjunc-tion with the Federal Government.
In April, net sales of corporate bonds
amounted to 34.4 billion, following sales of
31.9 billion worth of such paper in March by
domestic enterprises.
Credit institutions redeemed 31.5 billion net
of their own bonds. The issuance of mort-gage Pfandbriefe ( 34.9 billion) and debt se-
curities issued by specialised credit institutions(31.6 billion) contrasted with net redemptions
of public Pfandbriefe and other bank bondsamounting to 34.1 billion and 33.9 billion re-
spectively.
In April the main purchasers were domestic
non-banks ( 39.9 billion) and foreign investors
(38.4 billion), whereas credit institutions in-
creased their holdings of bonds and notesonly marginally, on balance ( 30.3 billion). Do-
mestic non-banks invested primarily in for-eign bonds ( 35.5 billion) and added 37.0 bil-
lion worth of public sector bonds to theirholdings. By contrast, their net sales ofbonds issued by domestic private borrowersamounted to 32.6 billion.
Equity marketIn April, issuing activity on the German equity
market was exceptionally high owing to thecapital increase of an important financial in-stitution. Sales of new shares by German en-terprises, at a market value of 34.7 billion, at-
tained their highest monthly value sinceBond sales

111999. At the same time the amount of for-
eign equities held by German investors fellnearly three times as sharply as in March, by37.4 billion. Shares issued by German enter-
prises were purchased primarily by domesticcredit institutions, which increased their hold-ings of such shares by 34.2 billion net. Do-
mestic non-banks purchased 31.7 billion net
of German shares and sold 37.1 billion worth
of foreign shares. Foreign investors reducedtheir holdings of domestic shares by 31.2 bil-
lion net.
Mutual fund sharesThe amount raised by sales of domestic mu-
tual funds in April, at 37.0 billion, was down
on the previous month ( 39.9 billion). The
monies were invested primarily in specialisedfunds ( 34.7 billion). The funds open to the
general public sold 32.3 billion worth of cer-
tificates. As in previous months, the bulk ofthese monies went to open-end real estatefunds ( 31.8 billion). Share-based funds and
bond-based funds sold 30.9 billion and
30.5 billion worth of certificates respectively.
Money market funds and mixed funds, how-ever, redeemed own shares ( 30.7 billion and
30.1 billion respectively). In April, 30.2 billion
net of foreign fund shares were returned.
All of the mutual fund shares were bought by
domestic non-banks ( 36.9 billion), which, on
balance, added only domestic fund shares totheir portfolios. Credit institutions’ holdingsof mutual fund shares went down by 30.1 bil-
lion.Balance of payments
Germany’s current account ran a surplus of
33.0 billion in April compared with one of
36.6 billion in the previous month. The main
reason for the deterioration was a larger def-icit on invisible current transactions, which isthat part of the current account comprisingservices, factor income and current transfers.There was also a smaller trade surplus.
According to figures from the Federal Statis-
tical Office, the trade surplus in April declinedby30.5 billion from the previous month to
39.2 billion. After the elimination of seasonal
factors, however, the trade surplus increasedby31 billion to 39

12goods. Thus, exports were down by 2% on
the month whereas the value of imports wasactually almost 5% below the level in the pre-vious month. However, the noticeable declinein imports was also due to the substantial fallin the prices of imported goods. If the threemonths of February, March and April aretaken together, exports decreased by 3%compared with the previous three-monthperiod whereas imports on a three-monthcomparison fell by no more than 1%.
The deficit on invisible current transactions
with non-residents increased from 32.5 billion
in March to 35.3 billion in April. This was due
mainly to the larger deficit on services, whichrose by 31.4 billion from the previous month
to33.1 billion. Furthermore, net expenditure
on current transfers increased by 30.8 billion
to32.7 billion in April while the surplus on
factor income fell to 30.5 billion compared
with 31.1 billion in March.
In the case of the financial account there
were again net inflows of capital as a resultof portfolio investment and direct investmentin April whereas capital exports predomin-ated in the case of credit transactions. Capitalimports arising from portfolio transactionsamounted to 37.5 billion net compared with
317.0 billion in March. Non-residents invested
somewhat less ( 37.3 billion) on the German
securities markets in April than in the previ-ous month ( 311.5 billion). Their interest was
focused mainly on bonds and notes issued byprivate borrowers ( 36.2 billion) while they
added only limited amounts of public bonds(30.8 billion) and money market paper ( 31.4

13reduced their net holdings of German shares
(31.2 billion). As in the previous month, Ger-
man investors sold part of their holdings offoreign securities ( 30.2 billion). The reduction
again fell heaviest on dividend-bearing paper(37.3 billion) although money market paper
(31.8 billion) and investment fund certificates
(30.2 billion) were also affected. However,
German residents transferred most of thefunds that became available into foreignbonds and notes ( 39.1 billion), the bulk of
which was euro-denominated paper ( 36.1 bil-
lion).
Net capital imports were also recorded in the
field of direct investment ( 33.5 billion com-
pared with 37.3 billion in March). German en-
terprises withdrew funds from their foreignbranches, both in the form of equity capital(31.1 billion) and in the form of credits ( 33.8
billion). Moreover, foreign proprietors re-duced their direct investment in Germany
during the month under review ( 30.8 billion).
By contrast, it was capital outflows that pre-
dominated ( 315.1 billion net) in the case of
non-securitised credit transactions. Enter-prises and individuals invested funds mostlyat the short end of the market ( 39.3 billion) –
primarily by increasing their deposits with for-eign banks – whereas public authorities im-ported 31.8 billion net. 37.2 billion net was
exported by the German banking system,whose accounts reflect, as it were, the othercross-border payments. These funds were ex-ported solely through the transactions of Ger-man credit institutions. By contrast, the assetsposition of the Bundesbank remained un-changed in April.
The Bundesbank’s foreign reserves declined –
at transaction values – by 31.4 billion in April.

15The debate on
deflationary risksin GermanyFalling inflation rates and repeatedly
disappointed growth expectations inmany major industrial countries havethrust the risk of deflation into a prom-inent position in the current public de-bate. In particular the unstable Ger-man economy with its persistentlyweak growth has, in view of the lowrate of inflation, led to fears of im-pending deflation in some quarters.
Indeed, a merely temporary decline in
the price level is sometimes wronglydescribed as “deflation”. However, theterm “deflation” should be used onlyif there are negative rates of pricechange over a longer period of time.A development of this kind can resultin a self-perpetuating downward spiral,in which conventional economic policyoptions are severely restricted.
The German economy is currently not
exhibiting any critical signs of impend-ing deflation. However, the risks result-ing from the macroeconomic stag-nation, which is still continuing in2003, should be monitored carefully.Against this background, confidence-bolstering structural reforms embed-ded in a consistent overall strategy areof key importance.

16Deflation
In the following, the term “deflation” is used
to describe a continuous decline in the gen-eral price level. Like inflation, it constitutes abreach of the central bank’s objective ofmaintaining price stability. A temporary de-cline in the price level, which may occur dur-ing a period of low inflation, is not coveredby this concept of deflation.
A mere decrease in the prices of some cat-
egories of goods, in individual sectors or incertain regions should also not be termed de-flation. In a market economy, such adjust-ments in relative prices are a response tochanges in supply and demand – for example,differences in sectoral productivity develop-ments – and are essential for an efficient,wealth-enhancing allocation of resources.Thus, for example, the marked price de-creases in the information and communica-tion technologies are an expression of therapid technological progress made in thissector and not an indication of a deflationarytrend.
Even a decline in the general price level is not
necessarily a cause for concern – the reasonsfor such a development are much more cru-cial. A fundamental distinction can be madebetween supply factors and demand factors.Decreases in the price level owing to positivesupply shocks (eg a somewhat greater in-crease in productivity, a higher degree ofcompetition as a result of deregulation or afall in commodity prices) are a result of beingable to produce more goods with a giveninput or apply production factors in the pro-duction process less expensively. Under other-
wise unchanged conditions, the goods pro-duced can be offered at lower prices.
In comparison, a sharp fall in aggregate de-
mand with a given production potential leadsto the underutilisation of production capacity,which likewise reduces the price level. Al-though the fall in demand tends to be moder-ated by the price movement, a price declinecan also lead to expectations of further pricereductions and thus reinforce demand-siderestraint.
Whereas the former kind of price level de-
creases are usually temporary and thus fairlyinnocuous in economic policy terms, sustainedprice decreases of the latter kind are problem-atic as they can be accompanied by a disrup-tion of the macroeconomic equilibrium, thusleading to additional destabilising effects onprices.
Possible self-perpetuating effects
of deflation
Deflation can potentially drag an economy
into a self-reinforcing crisis. At the same time,the possibilities of countering these unwel-come developments through economic policyare limited.
In principle, there are several transmission
channels through which a sustained fall in thegeneral price level can have a negative effecton real economic activity. Expectations withrespect to further price level developmentsplay a key role in self-perpetuating effects.

17If the price decline is connected with the pro-
spect of a further future fall in prices, thismay lead to a general reluctance to purchase.This in turn would lead to a further decreasein aggregate demand, which would addition-ally serve to strengthen the downward move-ment of the price level.
In existing debt contracts with fixed nominal
payments, a fall in the price level leads to anincrease in real debt and in the real interestburden. This results in a greater probability ofdefault on the part of debtors, which can in-tensify the deflationary developments for sev-eral reasons. Thus, the increase in the finan-cial system’s risk provisioning and the deteri-oration in corporate credit ratings leads tosluggish lending, which in itself further weak-ens aggregate demand. The rising number ofinsolvencies caused by the unexpected in-crease in real debt and in the real interest bur-den also contributes to the general economicdownswing. This gives rise to job losses, fearsfor the future and income uncertainty, there-by further intensifying the general reluctanceto purchase.
In principle, nominal interest rates cannot be-
come negative as long as a risk-free, liquidand interest-free asset exists in the form ofcash. The real interest rate rises with the rateof deflation once the zero interest rate boundhas been reached. Therefore, the real interestrate can no longer be lowered in order tostimulate economic activity in this situation.
There is a similar although less binding effect
in a monetary union: the short-term nominalinterest rate is the same in all the memberstates and the monetary policy is determined
by the average price outlook for all of thesecountries. If there are differences betweenthe national rates of price change, then thereal interest rates also vary from country tocountry if there is a common nominal interestrate. This can have a destabilising impact ifone country or a group of countries showssigns of deflation owing to excessively lowdemand, whilst the other countries do not.The real interest rate is then higher in thecountries with deflation than in the othercountries, which further curbs demand in theformer and thus strengthens the deflationarytendencies. However, the central bank willreact to these retarding effects if they impacton the whole monetary area’s outlook forinflation.
Furthermore, deflation places particular
strains on public finances. Without takinginto consideration active government coun-termeasures, it leads to an increase in thegovernment deficit through the action of theautomatic stabilisers. This affects revenuefrom taxes and social security contributions inparticular. A fall in employees’ per capitagross wages and salaries, above all, wouldhave a strong negative impact as the usualbudget relief afforded by fiscal drag would bereversed.

clining private consumption and dwindling
1The focus here is solely on the financial “strains” placed
on government budgets by decreasing (or negative) fiscal
drag. However, one must not overlook the fact that, al-
though fiscal drag affords relief for government budgets,
it constitutes a fundamental macroeconomic problem as
it expands the growth-inhibiting “tax wedge” between
labour costs and net wages. In other words, inflation may
take pressure off fiscal budgets on the revenue side, but
is nevertheless macroeconomically harmful through this
channel.Self-perpetuat-

18corporate profits would also put a strain on
government revenues.2On the expenditure
side, rising unemployment leads to labourmarket-related additional spending. This con-trasts with savings through the governmentbuying tangible goods more cheaply. Interestexpenditure is likely to react to a fall in thenominal interest rate level (to be expected ina deflation) only with a time lag owing to themedium to long-term maturity structure.
However, there are also factors which can
counter the self-perpetuating downward pro-cess outlined above. The increase in the realdebt burden as a result of deflation is mir-rored by real growth in creditors’ assets. Thistends to boost demand: the increase in thereal money stock, in particular, lowers interestrates and thus helps to heighten demand. Inaddition, positive wealth effects may lead togreater purchases of goods. However, thesepositive effects are likely to be limited. Firstly,if the debtor becomes insolvent, it is not pos-sible to (fully) realise the increase in assets.
3
Secondly, the general uncertainty prevalent ina deflationary situation is likely to mean thatcreditors will also exercise restraint in theirbuying behaviour. Thirdly, it is to be assumedthat creditors have a lower propensity tospend than debtors which implies that, withregard to expenditure, the real increase inassets is also not likely to have a full compen-satory effect.
Downward nominal wage rigidities, which
are often cited in this context, do not neces-sarily have a stabilising effect either, above allin the case of stronger price decreases in ex-cess of the productivity rate. As nominalwage reductions are precluded, price level de-
creases lead to higher real wages. Althoughthis counteracts sustained expectations offalling prices and increases employees’ pur-chasing power, higher real wages tend to re-duce employment and, with that, the total in-come of all employees. The question of whichof the two effects will dominate depends ul-timately upon the institutional framework ofthe labour market as well as the duration andstrength of the initial contractionary shock.
In a monetary union, deflation in one country
–ceteris paribus – improves the price com-
petitiveness of that country. This – whenviewed in isolation – increases foreign de-mand for domestic goods and reduces do-mestic demand for foreign goods, which hasa stabilising effect on domestic price develop-ments. However, in a single currency area,there is also a potential risk that the deflation-ary tendencies in a large member state will be“exported” to the other member states. Ifforeign demand for goods produced by acountry with deflation increases as a result ofthat country’s heightened price competitive-ness and demand for other countries’ goodsfalls as a result, downward price pressure mayalso ensue in the latter group.
2A sharp fall in prices would lead to a sharp fall in turn-
over tax revenue as the turnover tax already paid on pre-
viously purchased intermediate goods and services (as
part of input tax relief) can be deducted from the turn-
over tax payments for (cheaper) end-products. A down-
turn in profits in the corporate sector affects tax revenue,
although most losses can probably be offset against tax
on future profits only with a time lag.
3This does not apply to cash, which does not constitute
a repayable government debt, and so no compensatory
effect is to be expected.Stabilising

19All in all, the above considerations make it
clear that deflation brings with it particularmacroeconomic dangers, as it can be accom-panied by a number of self-perpetuating ef-fects. Furthermore, once a deflationary situ-ation has set in, the monetary and fiscalpolicy options for stimulating economic activ-ity and thus ending the downward spiral arelimited.
Therefore, the possibilities for increasing de-
mand by means of active, expansionary fiscalmeasures are restricted insofar as deflation in-creases the deficit through the workings ofthe automatic stabilisers; in addition, out-standing general government debt is drivenup in real terms. This also leads to an increasein ongoing real interest payments, which fur-ther limits the scope for expenditure. More-over, economic expectations cannot be stabil-ised by means of expansionary fiscal meas-ures if the government is already in an unsus-tainable fiscal position and economic agentstherefore have to expect that a future in-crease in the tax burden will be unavoidable.
The monetary policy options have been large-
ly exhausted once short-term nominal interestrates hit zero. Expectations of a decliningprice level then lead to positive short-termreal interest rates which rise as the rate of de-flation increases. This further curbs aggregatedemand. However, a negative real interestrate, which is impeded by the zero interestrate bound, may possibly be advisable inorder to overcome a severe economic down-turn. Furthermore, the impact of alternativeliquidity-providing measures would probablybe restricted. It is thus to be feared that theadditional funds will either remain with the
banks – as they estimate the risk of grantingnew loans in a deflationary phase to be toohigh (credit crunch) – or will be used by non-banks to repay existing loans or accumulatefinancial assets rather than for spending(liquidity trap).
Owing to the given limits of a “classic”
macroeconomic policy, it is extremely difficultto combat deflation once it has already set in.Therefore, the attention of the individual pol-icy areas should be focused on applyingappropriate preventative measures to stopthe economy slipping into deflation.
Periods of deflation
Even though the past few decades were
marked above all by inflationary processes,since 1980 there have also repeatedly beenperiods of declining price levels. Industrialcountries were also affected (see table onpage 20). These phases were, however, most-ly only of short duration and low intensity.They were frequently caused by an exchange-rate-related fall in import prices (as was thecase, for example, in Germany at the end of1986 and beginning of 1987). Only in Japanhave consumer prices fallen over a longerperiod of time since the mid-1990s.
By contrast, notably the last quarter of the
19th century and the period between theFirst and the Second World War saw parti-cularly marked phases of sustained andsometimes significant price level decline.Above all the 19th century was marked by

20constantly recurring periods of deflation.
From 1875 to 1899 alone, Germany experi-enced three periods of price level decline (seechart on page 21). The predominant monet-ary system of the time, the international goldstandard, no doubt played the main contri-butory role in this. Whereas the money supplywas largely fixed through the availableamount of gold, the demand for money roseconstantly, not least as a result of the popula-tion increase, industrialisation and the grow-ing number of countries pegging their curren-cies to gold. Money therefore became morescarce and the price level fell. Owing to thelarge gold discoveries made at the end of the19th century as well as, in particular, the in-creasing tendency to sever deposit moneyfrom currency in circulation (which waspegged to gold), deflationary risks later re-ceded into the background; they were re-
placed increasingly by inflationary tendencies.
Besides this monetary explanatory factor, real
economic developments no doubt alsohelped to bring about deflation. Technologic-al progress had caused productivity to in-crease, especially in the industrial sector,which led to a fall in the price of industrialgoods. In addition, the development of newareas under cultivation, above all in theUnited States, together with technologicalprogress in the transport sector caused theprices of agricultural products to fall sharply.The price decreases in the United States werefinally transmitted to other countries throughthe gold standard mechanism.
There were also episodes of constantly falling
prices between the First and the SecondWorld War. Besides the deflation of 1920–22in the United States, the Great Depression of1929–33 should be mentioned in particular.During this period, prices in Germany fell atan annual average rate of 6
12% and real
gross national product decreased by around3% per year. The downturn in productionwas even more dramatic in the USA than inGermany.
The 1929 stock market crash in the USA is
often cited as the trigger for the Great De-pression. However, in addition to the rigiditiesof the international gold exchange standardof the time, the Federal Reserve’s excessivelyrestrictive monetary policy was probably alsoresponsible for the onset and tenacity of theGreat Depression.

21following the stock market crash as well
as the decrease in the money stock M1. In1932, the short-term real interest rate aver-aged 11% despite the interest rate reductionsintroduced in the meantime. The terms offinance were thus extremely unfavourable.This restrictive monetary framework no doubtalso intensified the difficulties in the bankingsector.
A more recent example of deflation can – as
already mentioned – be seen in the case ofJapan, which repeatedly experienced phasesof persistently falling consumer prices in the1990s. At the same time, the GDP growthrate weakened. In this respect, the develop-ments in Japan were similar to those in theGreat Depression. In both cases, a speculativebubble on the asset markets burst. Thispushed down macroeconomic demand andthe price level as a result of corporate insolv-encies, banking crises and other recession-induced consequences. Nevertheless, theprice level decline in Japan was considerablyweaker than, for instance, the fall in prices inGermany during the Great Depression. More-over, overall production did not diminishduring this period.
The economic slowdown in Japan was ac-
companied by a comparatively small increasein the money stock and – primarily as a resultof supply-side and structural factors – a sub-stantial downturn in Japanese banks’ reallending to the private sector, which has actu-ally been falling more rapidly since 1999.With hindsight, it is now clear that the defla-tionary risks in Japan were obviously not rec-ognised in time.

22the beginning of the 1990s appeared to bear
a great resemblance to comparable past eco-nomic cycles. Only later did it become appar-ent that economic recovery was considerablymore sluggish than on previous occasions,which was also exacerbated by the burstingof the housing price bubble and the East Asiacrisis.
4Even though the Bank of Japan had
lowered the central bank rate to almost 0%by 1995, this was not enough to prevent thecountry sliding into deflation. The continued
appreciation of the yen in the first half of the1990s was also a contributory factor. Al-though the long-term interest rates also fellduring the economic downturn, they stillstood at 5% in 1995 as market participantswere not expecting the price level to declinein the future. From today’s perspective, realfinancing costs were thus very high.
All in all, this description of individual defla-
tionary periods, in particular the Great De-pression and the last decade in Japan, showsthat a deflation can have grave consequencesfor an economy. These arise on the one handfrom the fact that deflation can become self-perpetuating and thus pull the economy intoa downhill slide. On the other hand, the factthat it is very difficult for traditional economicpolicy measures to stop such a developmentonce this slide has started also plays animportant role.
Current situation in Germany
In view of the definition of deflation given
earlier in this article and historical experienceof periods of price decline, it becomes clearthat the present economic situation in Ger-many cannot be described as deflationary.
Although inflation rates have been falling sig-
nificantly for more than a year, they are stillpositive. On an average of the April-Mayperiod, the consumer price index was 0.8%%

23higher than 12 months previously. Even tak-
ing into consideration the measurementproblems involved in recording prices, whichhave, moreover, become less important inGermany owing in particular to improvedquality adjustment procedures, a generalprice decline is not in evidence. In fact, thereis practically price stability in Germany.
Wages have further increased significantly
despite the poor economic situation. In thefirst quarter of 2003, negotiated wages werearound 3% higher than 12 months previous-ly. Owing to the elimination of benefits out-side the agreed pay scales, the wage in-creases effectively paid per employee weresomewhat lower (2.4%) and further improve-ments in productivity helped to reduce cor-porate cost pressures. However, unit labourcosts also increased again by around
12%, ie
at the moment, a deflationary trend is not inevidence here either.
Economic activity is very sluggish at present.
However, the economy has not in generalshifted onto a downward track despite aslight decline in the first quarter of the year.Instead, the situation is marked by prolongedstagnation. A wait-and-see attitude to buyingtriggered by the expectation of falling prices,which is characteristic of a deflation, is not inevidence. The recent slight reduction in thepropensity to consume can be explained in-stead by employment risks and the associatedincome risks.
Unlike in Japan, it can also not be stated that
there has been a general sharp fall in theprices on the property markets in Germany.%

24Despite the heterogeneity of the market seg-
ments and data imperfections, house pricesexperienced a rather flat underlying trendand only a slight price decline in the secondhalf of the 1990s. The upward trend also re-mained in evidence with regard to residentialproperties in the last two years.
Finally, almost all of the available price fore-
casts for Germany predict that there will be afurther positive price trend in the next twoyears. It is apparently possible that the zerobound will be reached temporarily duringsome months in 2004, although this would bepredominantly as a result of a further reduc-tion in the cost of imports, the price develop-ment of which recently had a marked effecton the general rate of inflation (see chart onpage 26). However, neither the national andinternational forecasting institutes nor the
financial markets expect the price level toundergo a self-perpetuating downward spiral.A sharp fall in prices in some market seg-ments, such as for information and communi-cation technology goods, are – as alreadymentioned – not an expression of deflation,but rather the result of enormous increases inproductivity and, to that extent, a sign offunctioning competitive markets as well as ofthe “breathing” of relative prices required tofulfil the allocative function of prices.

25there is a danger of the economy sliding into
deflation owing to its weak and fragile overallstate. As the Bundesbank set out in detail inits policy paper entitled “Ways out of thecrisis”,
5Germany is currently suffering from a
crisis of growth and confidence, in whichshort-term, medium-term and long-termnegative factors are eclipsing and reinforcingone another. The economy is not goingthrough a classic short-term, self-adjustingrecession, but rather a persistent period ofstagnation, which has now been continuingfor almost three years and is increasingvulnerability to negative shocks.
The further decline in capacity utilisation is
dampening companies’ propensity to invest.The labour market is in the grip of the eco-nomic slump and this, in turn, is having anegative effect on disposable income, publicopinion and the propensity to consume. Con-fidence in the self-healing powers of theeconomy and the ability of politicians to im-plement reforms has taken a blow. Someelements of risk for deflationary tendencies tocome into being may certainly develop fromthe length of this “virtual stagnation”, espe-cially as no clear stimuli for overcoming theeconomic downturn are as yet discernible.
In this context, exchange rate developments
are also worthy of consideration. Since thebeginning of the year, the euro has risen by12
12% against the US dollar and by almost
9% against the weighted average of all themajor currencies. This could lead to two kindsof restraining price effects. On the one hand,the higher exchange rate puts direct pressureon import prices, whilst on the other, appreci-ation curbs foreign demand for domestic
products. Both developments have beennoticeable for some time and are also con-tained in most of the forecasts for 2004.
The weak trend in bank loans is also often
seen as a risk factor. Although this can be ex-plained predominantly by the cyclically-induced muted demand for credit on the partof the private sector, the banks also appear tobe exercising more caution in their lendingactivities in response to the greater risks in-volved (see also article on pages 67 to 76 ofthis Monthly Report). Thus, higher interestrates are being charged for high-risk loansPrice forecasts*

gent. In addition, there have been cutbacks incredit volume. Credit supply behaviour as awhole has become more prudent.
The potential interaction of the various nega-
tive factors could at worst intensify the eco-nomic weakness or even further delay theexpected recovery. However, it is unlikelythat the economy will slide into a self-perpetuating downward spiral of price leveldecline and contractionary tendencies on theproduct and financial markets. Risks from ex-change rate developments are normally onlytemporary as their price effects taper off aftera certain time. Even a – welcome – fall in theprice of oil and the resultant dampening ofconsumer prices is hardly likely to create apermanent deflationary impetus. Despite cer-tain difficulties regarding financing via bankloans, in particular on the part of small andmedium-sized enterprises, it would be incor-rect to speak of a general credit crunch; thebanking system still functions normally andloans are still available at market conditionsequivalent to risk. Furthermore – as alreadymentioned – there are counter-forces in Euro-pean monetary union which hinder the emer-gence of deflationary tendencies in individualregions, even in ones as large as Germany.The improvement in competitiveness associ-ated with the price stability achieved here inGermany will, in the medium term, strength-en the demand for domestic products andthus stimulate economic activity.
All in all, there is therefore currently nothing
to indicate that Germany is slipping into de-flation with a sustained price level decline1995 = 100, seasonally adjusted, log scale

27and a self-perpetuating real economic down-
hill slide. Nevertheless, given the fragile na-ture of the general economy, price trends andthe aforementioned risk factors should bemonitored and analysed carefully so as to de-tect potential deflationary developments in atimely manner.
Conclusions for economic policy
Germany is currently one of the euro-area
countries with the highest degree of pricestability and also has a substantial effect onthe development of the EMU price aggregateowing to the size of its economy. Consumerprice inflation is just under 2% in the euroarea at present and is therefore within therange in which the ECB Governing Councilconsiders that price stability can be main-tained in the medium term. A stable pricelevel is macroeconomically advantageous. Itencourages competition and helps to avoidconflicts with regard to wage policy or in-come distribution. Stable prices are thereforean essential prerequisite for adequate eco-nomic growth.
In principle, both inflationary as well as defla-
tionary developments are to be averted inorder to maintain price level stability. More-over, in the EMU the knock-on risk of a crisisbeing passed on from a large member stateto other countries must be taken into consid-eration. Monetary policy takes deflationaryrisks into account in two ways. Firstly, theECB Governing Council – in its recent specifi-cation of its monetary policy strategy –spelled out its stability policy expectationswith a medium-term euro-area inflation rate
of “just under 2%”. In view of the currentdivergence of inflation rates, this goal offersall the member states a sufficiently largesafety margin for deflation. Secondly, the ECBGoverning Council has created monetaryconditions – most recently through its deci-sion of 5 June 2003 to lower interest rates –which allow adequate scope for renewedpositive real economic growth and, from thepoint of view of monetary policy, realisationof the stability objective under the ECB’sstrategy.
The focal point of the debate on deflationary
risks in Germany is above all the weak growthof the German economy since the mid-1990s, which is marked by a loss of confi-dence among investors and consumers, fall-ing capacity utilisation, rising unemploymentand protracted restraint in investment. Thispersistent stagnation must be overcome bymeans of structural reforms. The implementa-tion of overdue reforms would improve theGerman economy’s resistance to macroeco-nomic disruptions and provide protectionagainst deflationary risks in the medium term.
The key aspects of such a comprehensive
structural reform are sustainable public fi-nances together with a reduction in output-inhibiting and incentive-distorting subsidiesand social benefits, a reform of the pensionand health insurance schemes which takesinto account the demographic strains andhigh non-wage labour costs in Germany, aswell as an overhaul of the institutional frame-work on the labour market. As the positivelong-term effects of such reforms may be ac-

least in the short term, it is important to im-plement the reform measures in a way thatbolsters confidence in the reliability and dur-ability of the policy. In this case, positive ex-
pectation effects may, even in the short term,help to overcome the stagnation.

29Overall financial
flows in 2002The accelerated slide in share prices,
high volatility on the financial marketsand a halting cyclical trend last yearfurther accentuated the tendencies inGermany’s real economy and financingpatterns which had already becomeapparent in 2001. Investment recededagain across a broad front. This causeda mismatch between domestic borrow-ing requirements and the supply ofsavings as a result of which capitalamounting to 350 billion, or just under
3% of aggregate disposable income,was exported on balance. Moreover, asthe capital stock grew only marginally,the recourse to external financingsources and consequently the servicesof financial intermediaries was muchweaker than it had been for manyyears. By contrast, households’ savingsand acquisition of financial assets in-creased further. Despite this, the stockof financial assets declined for the firsttime in 50 years in the wake of fallingvalues. At the end of 2002, it amount-ed to around 53.6 trillion, or 2.6 times
as much as households’ disposable in-come. Other industrial countries, too,suffered perceptible asset losses. Thesewere particularly severe in the Anglo-Saxon economies, where claims on theinsurance sector were also strongly af-fected.

30Aggregate investment
The pronounced economic slowdown last
year was markedly reflected in the fixed cap-ital formation of the domestic sectors. Thepropensity to invest diminished significantlycompared with the already moderate resultrecorded in 2001. The prices of capital goodsremained stable. Net nominal capital forma-tion amounted to only 3
12% of the aggre-
gate disposable income of the domesticsectors. This was by far the lowest value sinceGerman reunification when the investmentratio temporarily shot up to around 12%. Butcompared with the average value between1991 and 2001 of almost 10%, too, it is evi-dent that the associated weak momentum ofeconomic development is not just a cyclicalphenomenon but also indicates a persistentcrisis of growth and confidence.
This is also suggested by the fact that the de-
crease in investment, as in the previous year,was broadly based and more pronounced.Whereas enterprises and households record-ed at least positive net investment in 2002,the amount invested by general government– despite a high budget deficit – in new non-financial assets did not even offset the con-sumption of fixed capital. Thus its grosscapital formation amounting to 333
12billion
fell short of the depreciation total of 33412
billion.
Another factor which substantially contrib-
uted to the downturn in investment was thereduction in firms’ expenditure on machineryand equipment. This downward trend – whichhas been observed for quite a long time –has meanwhile created a position where the
share of non-financial corporations in theaggregate acquisition of non-financial assetscontracted in 2002 to a little more than one-quarter, whereas the bulk of investment (con-stituting over two-thirds) came from house-holds. In the “dynamic” year 1991 produc-tion enterprises had accounted for more thanhalf of all non-financial asset formation andhouseholds for only just over a third. Al-though households, too, invested less in2002, the decline compared with 2001 ofjust over 310 billion was more moderate than
that of enterprises (almost 320 billion). This
decline was largely due to a further fall inhouse-building. In addition, expenditure byself-employed persons and sole proprietorson machinery and equipment likewise de-creased, although this accounted for onlyaround 15% of investment by the householdsector.
Domestic saving
In contrast to investment, the aggregate sav-
ing of the various sectors increased signifi-cantly last year. It totalled over 3110 billion,
or 6
12% of disposable income. On a long-
term comparison, however, this is still a lowlevel. Quite disparate developments wererecorded in 2002. In view of the difficultsituation of public finances, general govern-ment again registered a dissaving. This sec-tor’s expenditure on consumption exceededits current revenue by just over 350 billion,
which was 320 billion more than in 2001. In-

32ernment showed an even larger deficit of just
under 380 billion. For the first time in several
years, saving by financial institutions, asshown in the national accounts, dippednoticeably to merely 33 billion. The main
reason for this was the major earningsproblems, with which the banks were con-fronted particularly strongly last year.
By contrast, the non-financial private sector
increased its net saving by around 345 billion
compared with 2001; the bulk of this increasewas, remarkably, attributable to enterprises.Excluding net capital transfers, they oncemore recorded a small positive retained in-come total ( 310 billion), after this figure had
actually been negative during the precedingthree years – according to the national ac-counts – as a result of tax-induced profit dis-tributions. Investable funds, which includenet capital transfers, amounted to 326 billion.
Households expanded their net surplus againby almost 310 billion to just over 3160 billion.
On the one hand, the net capital transfersthey received went up marginally year-on-year and, on the other, their savings volumeexpanded somewhat.
Financial balances and financial flows
If the aforementioned investment in 2002 is
compared with aggregate saving, the resultfor the economy as a whole – compared with2001 – is a sharply increased financial surplusamounting to around 350 billion or almost
3% of disposable income. Consequently, netclaims on the rest of the world made upalmost half of overall asset formation. Thevolume and composition of the acquisition of
assets partially reflect the German economy’sgood competitive position in the exportmarkets as well as a significant improvementin the terms of trade in 2002; but they alsomirror an overall weak level of non-financialasset formation in Germany and a smallergrowth of the German economy by inter-national standards.
On balance, it was primarily the non-financial
corporations which contributed to the highexport of capital last year. Whereas this sectoris usually dependant on an inflow of fundsfrom other sectors, it actually recorded a sur-plus of almost 310 billion in 2002. In 2001 it
had recorded a financial gap of almost 350
billion. This outcome, which is historically un-precedented, resulted from the simultaneouscombination of lower investment and highersaving. Households also contributed to theincrease in the macroeconomic surplus. Theyraised their net accumulation of capital to arecord level of almost 3120 billion or 6
12%o f
disposable income. All three sectors in surplustogether generated funds totalling just under3130 billion in 2002. Around two-thirds of
these resources were absorbed by generalgovernment. Its financing shortfall amountedto just over 375 billion or 3.6% of GDP; this
was significantly more than in the first half ofthe 1990s, when the additional burdensrelated to reunification had to be borne.
In conjunction with the weak real economic
activities of the non-financial sectors, the as-sociated financial transactions also declined.However, the various categories were affect-ed in very different ways. Whereas the acqui-

33sition of financial assets was only marginally
smaller than in 2001, the demand for exter-nal resources was significantly lower than inthe previous year and, in terms of theamount, was actually lower than in any yearsince reunification. At the same time, cross-border flows went down sharply for thesecond time in a row since 2000, which wasan exceptional year in respect of financialflows. In terms of volume they roughlymatched the level of 1997. It was mainly theproduction enterprises which contributed tothis; they have considerably scaled back theirfinancial activities since 2001. Thus theirfinancial asset formation, which previouslyhad been characterised not least by cross-border credit business among affiliates,amounted to only 390 billion, which was less
than half the amount recorded in 2000. In2002 the external financing of enterprises, inwhich foreign sources likewise play an im-portant role, declined to just over 360 billion
or just under one-sixth of the resources re-quired in 2000.
In the light of the persistent bear market and
the historically low interest rates on the cap-ital market, the financial asset acquisition ofthe non-financial sectors continued to show abias towards shorter-term investment. As aresult, short-term financial asset formationwas almost twice as high as the correspond-ing longer-term investment. Whereas in thecase of the latter, notably equities and bondswere shunned, in the short-term range,money market instruments and traditionalbank deposits gained in favour. The lattermade up almost half of all short-term invest-ment. On the financing side, by contrast, thedominance of longer-term borrowing per-
sisted. Securitised lending actually gainedground compared with 2001. This was mainlydriven by the high deficit of general govern-ment, which drew heavily on the capital mar-ket last year, whereas it redeemed bank loanson balance. This was the principal reason whylonger-term net borrowing from banks by allnon-financial sectors amounted to less than31 billion last year. This contrasted with a 5 bn

Firms’ uses and sources of funds
The overall volume of funds used by non-
financial corporations, ie their acquisitionof both financial and non-financial assets,showed a further marked contraction lastyear. In 2002 the balance sheet growth ofjust under 3300 billion was around the same
as the average of 1997/98 and approachedthe average value for the years 1991 to 1997.By contrast, the period between 1998 and2000 had been characterised by an unpre-cedented rate of expansion attributablemainly to financial assets.
Financial asset formation was likewise the
principal factor behind the subsequent “re-turn to normal”. It amounted to 390 billion
during the reporting period; this was aroundone-third lower than in 2001 and amounted– as mentioned – to less than half of thevalue recorded in the extraordinary year2000. Its share in the use of funds amountedlast year to barely one-third, compared withtwo-fifths in 2000. However, there werenoticeable shifts within individual financialasset positions. Thus in contrast to 2001enterprises increased their acquisition ofmoney market paper, whereas they offloadednotes and bonds on balance. The increase inparticipating interests in domestic firms wasonly marginally higher than in 2001; by con-trast, foreign investment remained at therelatively high level seen in the previousperiod. Cross-border lending by Germanenterprises, by contrast, contracted sharply
again. Foreign subsidiaries actually repaidalmost 330 billion net; during the record year
2000 such lending to affiliates had amountedto just over 350 billion. Bank deposits were
affected to an even greater extent. Whereasin 2001 German credit institutions had seentheir stocks of transferable deposits and timedeposits increase, they lost almost half ofthese positions in 2002 on balance. Suchstrong portfolio shifts in the enterprise sector,mainly within the short-term area, were,however, not unusual in the 1990s either.
In 2002 gross investment decreased by
around 7% to a nominal value of 3200 bil-
lion; this was roughly on a par with the long-term average. On the one hand, inventorieswere run down again and machinery andequipment were reduced by one-tenth vis-à-vis the previous year. On the other hand,companies sharply cut their budgets for in-dustrial construction projects (-4
12%), which
accounted for just over one-third of allcorporate investment.
Looking at the sources of funds, a noticeable
shift occurred last year. Internal financing,which dominated the first half of the 1990sand which had lost much ground in the wakeof the subsequent stock market boom, hasresumed its traditional position. With justunder 72%, it reached a share that wasalmost as large as in 1995, which was whenthe highest value was recorded. This figurewas 30 percentage points above the averagelevel for the period between 1998 and 2000.The main reason for this was the reversedtrends in saving and retained income, whichFurther fall in

36recorded a positive outturn for the first time
in several years. Previously, driven by theshareholder value principle and tax consider-ations, sizeable dividends have been dis-bursed.
Given the combination of improved internal
financing and a significantly lower borrowingrequirement, the recourse to external finan-cial resources went down to just over 360 bil-lion. External financing was thus only one-
third as high as in 2001 and actually fellbelow the already low average level duringthe period from 1991 to 1997. The drop inexternal procurement of resources vis-à-vis2001, which amounted to 3120 billion, was
reflected in both reduced equity sales and asmaller credit demand. The decline in equityissues of around 350 billion compared with
2001 was mainly due to low share sales; theissue volume plummeted to only 37 billion in
total. The very restrained borrowing by Ger-man enterprises amounting to only 320 bil-
lion in all, which was considerably lower eventhan the historical low in 1994, primarilyconcerned domestic bank loans and financialtransactions with foreign enterprises. Therecourse to financial and trade credits fromabroad, which had previously been a keyfeature of the external financing picture,amounted to only 315 billion in 2002. In the
case of loans from domestic banks (borrow-ing from foreign institutions is traditionallyonly of minor importance), redemptions actu-ally exceeded new loans. This related primar-ily to short-term loans, which had expandedvery sharply between 1998 and 2000. Long-er-term liabilities, which normally play a pre-dominant role in financing transactions withbanks, likewise increased only marginally in2002 ( 32 billion). Even the corresponding
figure of just over 320 billion which was re-
corded for this maturity category in 2001 hadbeen very low in a multi-year comparison. Allin all, the outstanding bank liabilities of pro-duction enterprises dropped by over 320 bil-
lion last year – an event never before record-ed on such a scale. 5 bn

37Households’ investment and borrowing
behaviour
In contrast to enterprises, households’ finan-
cial flows increased slightly in 2002. But boththeir sources and uses of funds, at just under3180 billion, were well down on the long-
term average during the 1990s. This fall wasmainly attributable to households’ acquisitionof non-financial assets, which has been wan-ing since 2000, and the associated lower de-mand for credit. Net investment by house-holds went down again last year comparedwith 2001 by some 310 billion to 345 billion;
this was more than one-third below thelonger-term average. The investment ratioamounted to only 3% of households’ dispos-able income, marking a new low. The furtherreduction in the building of owner-occupiedhouses was primarily responsible for thisdevelopment.
Since house-building is mostly financed
through debt, the downturn in this field ofinvestment correspondingly led to a furtherfall in the external procurement of resourcesby households. In 2002 it amounted to only317 billion in total, whereas the average for
the 1990s had been almost 380 billion. The
individual types of credit developed very dif-ferently. Whereas commercial loans were re-deemed on balance, as in 2001, consumercredit expanded by 32 billion and housing
loans by just over 320 billion. This was only
one-third as high as in 1999 before housingconstruction came under pressure. House-holds’ demand for resources for consumptionpurposes was likewise very small comparedwith the long-term trend; during the first halfof the 1990s, in particular, it had been twice
as high for reasons related to German reunifi-cation.
Households’ saving grew in importance in
2002. The saving ratio rose further from10.1% of disposable income in 2001 to10.4% in 2002. The rise in the saving ratiowas presumably fuelled by consumers’ pur-chasing restraint at the start of the year in thecontext of the perceived hike in prices accom-panying the changeover to the euro and thesubsequent erosion of consumer confidence,but also by negative wealth effects due tosliding share prices and, not least, the deteri-orated labour market outlook. The introduc-tion last year of government-subsidised sup-plementary private pension plans playedhardly any role. The number of contracts con-cluded was below the expected level. Itwould be overhasty, however, to infer fromthis a general lack of interest in private pen-sion provision, since other types of invest-ment linked to retirement were in highdemand.
Despite the aforementioned rise, the saving
ratio was much higher on average in the1990s and also before reunification. Even so,it cannot be said that households in Germanyaccumulate fewer assets by internationalstandards. This idea frequently results fromconfusing different concepts of saving.Whereas in Germany and, for example, in theUnited States the saving ratios are traditional-ly recorded as a net value – ie after deductionof the depreciation allowances as shown inthe national accounts – other countries showthe gross value.

39allowances obviously leads to higher saving
ratios that the net concept, which for meth-odological reasons is actually preferable.However, owing to problems associated withthe precise statistical recording of depreci-ation allowances at a sectoral level, the Euro-pean Commission and Eurostat have decidedto publish only gross saving ratios initially.Even though this deviates from the basic con-cept of the change in net worth and focusesmore on the internal financing possibilities ofhouseholds, it at least permits consistentcomparisons to be made. On this calculationbasis the saving ratio in Germany amountedin 2002 to 16% of disposable income (includ-ing depreciation allowances), which was sig-nificantly above the EU average. Over the lastfew years Germany, Italy and France haveexhibited approximately the same propensityto save on average, at just over 15
12%. In the
United Kingdom and the United States, bycontrast, the willingness to forego consump-tion was far less pronounced.
The transaction-related volume of financial
assets grew by around one-tenth to just over3130 billion in 2002. In view of the restrained
acquisition of non-financial assets, three-quarters of the overall uses of funds went into“financial saving”. The further fall in shareprices in 2002 and the problematic inter-national situation resulted in an even larger in-crease in relatively risk-free assets than was re-corded in 2001. It is thus hardly surprisingthat traditional bank deposits attracted moreattention again last year, whereas in 2000 netdeposits had been withdrawn on a largescale. Transferable deposits attained a recordscore, whereas time deposits declined on bal-ance. This is partly attributable to the fact that
overnight money accounts offered very at-tractive interest rates. In addition, in the caseof transferable deposits the invested funds arevery readily available to the investor. This sug-gests that investors often temporarily lodgetheir money in such investment vehicles witha view to withdrawing it quickly should theeconomic conditions change.
Despite the media reports about the prob-
lems facing the insurance sector, householdsstrongly stepped up their demand for invest-ment with insurance enterprises in 2002.Their long-term claims on insurance firmswent up sharply by just under 10%. Theserelate mainly to life assurance and pensioninsurance policies, which are concluded forthe purpose of old-age provision. In theas a percentage of disposable income 1

40preceding two years, by contrast, the sale of
standard insurance products had shown slightnet losses. This was seen at the time as signal-linginter alia a “wait-and-see” attitude pend-
ing the planned introduction of supplemen-tary private pension plans. Given the intro-duction of the new government promotionscheme for such private pension provision in2002, it might have been expected that suchcontracts would be concluded to the detri-ment of traditional insurance investments.The fact that this was not the case was prob-ably due to various aspects relating to theconcrete design and implementation of thegovernment’s supplementary private pensionplan scheme. However, the overall pattern ofinvestment shows that households are indeedprepared to make greater provision for theirold age.
New investment in equities, which had char-
acterised the years 1999 and 2000, came to ahalt during the period under review. This ap-plies to both the direct and indirect purchaseof company shares. Shareholders sold equi-ties on an even larger scale on balance thanin 2001, while interest in equity-based mutualfunds also receded considerably. This was off-set to a certain extent by households’ buoy-ant demand for share units in real estate andmoney market funds. In spite of this, the ac-quisition of mutual fund shares fell signifi-cantly overall. The total value of just 337 bil-
lion fell well short of the record figure from2000 of just under 355 billion. The percent-
age of this form of investment in the overallacquisition of financial assets consequentlydropped to just over one-quarter, whereastwo years earlier it had accounted for almost
half.
Development of households’ financial
assets
The purchase of financial instruments by
households accounts for only part of thechange in value in their holdings of financialassets. Since portfolio positions are generallysubject to price fluctuations, the stock offinancial assets can be correspondingly influ-enced positively or negatively. Whereas in thefirst half of the 1990s the expansion of finan-cial holdings had been closely linked to trans-action-related activities, valuation gains sub-sequently played an increasingly importantrole in the wake of rising share prices. Theyear 1999 proved exceptional in this respect,with half of the growth in financial assetsbeing attributable to the increase in the valueof equities. Since 2000, when the bull marketgave way to a bear market, the value of thestock of financial assets has, by contrast,grown more slowly than the underlying rateof “financial saving”. In the first year of thebear market, over two-fifths of the acquisi-tion of financial assets was wiped out by valu-ation-related losses. In the following twoyears the losses were even greater. In 2001they amounted to around 60%, while in2002 the share price losses actually exceededthe total transaction-related increases. In2001 and 2002, taken together, purchases ofnew assets amounting to just over 3250 bil-
lion shrank to an effective level of financialasset growth of only 335 billion. The out-
come of the development in 2002 was that

41the stock of financial assets fell in nominal
terms for the first time since the beginning ofthe statistical series in 1949. However, it sig-nificantly exceeded the value prevailing priorto the stock market boom. The ratio of finan-cial assets to households’ disposable income– which is frequently used as an indicator ofprosperity – has now declined for the thirdyear in a row. At just over 260%, this ratiowas 14 percentage points below the peakmeasured at the end of 1999. Since liabilitiesexpanded at roughly the same speed duringthis period as disposable income, net financialassets recorded a similar decline in their ratio;at the end of 2002 they amounted to onlyone-and-a-half times as much as disposableincome.
As a result of share price losses as well as ac-
tive portfolio switches, profound shifts alsooccurred in the structure of households’assets compared with the preceding years.Securities have lost ground to a significant ex-tent. One reason for this was that householdshave reduced such holdings; another – moreimportant – reason was the big impact of theslide in share prices. Corresponding gainsfrom bonds came nowhere near compensat-ing for this effect. In 2002 all security hold-ings accounted for less than one-third offinancial assets, compared with almost two-fifths at the end of 1999. The percentageshare of directly held equities (measured atcurrent prices) was actually lower, at 4
12%,
than at the beginning of the 1990s. The re-spective share of bank deposits increasedsomewhat to over one-third as a result of theabove-average inflow of new resources.However, this does not alter the long-termdecline of bank deposits within the portfolio
as a result of disintermediation. At the be-ginning of the 1990s, their share was almost10 percentage points higher. Investmentsplaced with insurance enterprises and pen-sion funds grew continuously throughout theperiod under review. Including claims arisingfrom company pension commitments, insur-ance investments had accounted for onlyone-quarter of households’ total financial%

43assets in 1991. Since then this share has risen
to one-third. This mostly comprises house-holds’ claims on life assurance companiesand various pension funds as well as on en-terprises under company pension commit-ments – ie assets which essentially serve thepurpose of old-age provision.
The development on the stock exchanges
over the last few years has had a majorimpact not only on German households’financial assets but also on those in otherindustrial countries. This is indicated by thedata for those economies which already havethe outturn of their financial accounts for2002. However, the scale of the changesvaries with the diverging importance ofequity-related wealth between countries,deviations in share price trends and the inten-sity of financial asset acquisition. Differencesin recording and valuing individual asset com-ponents, particularly shares, may also play arole.
As in Germany, all the countries reviewed in
2002 recorded a decline in households’ finan-cial assets. In several economies, this processactually began at the end of 1999. Whereasthe contraction in financial assets was limitedto a single-digit rate in Japan and in continen-tal European countries, it was far larger(around 15%) in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
1
Looking at the ratio of financial assets to dis-posable income, the picture becomes moresimilar. All countries, with the exception ofJapan, recorded a decline over several years;this was, however, particularly marked inthe UK and the USA. In Japan, by contrast,this indicator stagnated because disposableincome also showed a tendency to decline.
Another factor in the United States and theUnited Kingdom is that the relatively signifi-cant claims on the insurance sector in thosecountries declined as a result of sliding shareprices. This is because in the case of certaintypes of investment vehicles, for exampleunit-linked life assurance policies and contri-bution-defined company pensions, the invest-ment risk rests not with the insurance com-pany or the pension fund but instead withthe insured person or the employee.
The trend-decline in households’ stocks of
financial assets also altered the investmentstructure in the countries under review – justlike in Germany. In all the countries the im-portance of risk-free bank deposits increased.By contrast, equities lost a lot of ground – inseveral countries around half. Based on thefigures available, Finnish households had byfar the highest portion of shares in theirfinancial assets, amounting to over half. Therespective share of the French and Spanishhouseholds at the end of 2002, at almostone-fifth each, actually surpassed the Anglo-Saxon countries, with their deeplyentrenched capital markets. However, itshould be borne in mind that in the continen-tal European countries, non-listed sharesenjoy particular importance. Spain was also afrontrunner in the field of bank deposits, witha share of over two-fifths; this was exceededonly by the Japanese households which re-corded over 50%. Italian households had by

overall portfolios, at one-quarter. There weredifferent tendencies over time in respect ofclaims on insurance companies and pensionfunds. They mostly increased their share inoverall financial assets. They declined only inthe Anglo-Saxon countries, where house-holds, as mentioned, to a certain extent par-ticipate directly in the risk. The developmentin the UK was particularly extreme. Its highshare, by international standards, of just overhalf went down by 10 percentage points.
The development of households’ financial
assets in Germany and other industrial coun-tries in the past few years has shown whatdistortions can result from exaggeratedtrends in the prices of financial assets: for onething economically, as a result of first expan-sionary and then contractionary wealth andconfidence effects, and, for another thing,with regard to the cost-inducing adjustmentof portfolios to the new setting. This alsoapplies to investments made for the purpose
of old-age provision. In economies in whichthe “pay-as-you-go” system currently pre-dominates there is a broad consensus thatboth individual and company-based pensionprovision will have to be strengthened tocope with demographic problems. Althoughfinancial instruments with value growthpotential offer the chance of high returns,they carry considerable risks, which are alsodifficult to assess. A particularly worryingphenomenon occurs when claims on insur-ance companies and pension funds are like-wise subject to price fluctuations. Given anaccumulation of such risks, households maybe confronted with problems when planningfor old-age provision, particularly if they areolder. Hence although funded pension ar-rangements remain fundamentally desirable,one should not lose sight of the needto diversify the risk associated with invest-ments.

51The development
of Germanenterprises’international capitallinks betweenend-1998 andend-2001The latest results from the Bundes-
bank’s foreign direct investment surveyshow that the foreign direct invest-ment stocks of German investorsabroad as well as foreign investors inGermany have more than doubled be-tween end-1998 and end-2001. Majorcross-border mergers and corporatetake-overs were primarily responsiblefor this development. German enter-prises’ capital links with partners anddirect investment enterprises in theUnited States of America expandedparticularly rapidly and are now on apar with Germany’s direct investmentrelationships with enterprises in alleuro-area countries put together.However, the temporary depreciationof the euro against the US dollar dur-ing the observation period must betaken into consideration, as this causedthe amount of foreign assets denomin-ated in foreign currency to increase innominal terms upon conversion intoeuro. German companies attracted theattention of investors from euro-areacountries, in particular; between end-1998 and end-2001 these foreign part-ners nearly tripled their direct invest-ment in Germany. The present articlewill discuss in more detail develop-ments regarding the German econo-my’s international capital links.

52Overview of developments between
end-1998 and end-2001
German direct corporate assets held abroad,
which are composed of equity capital andloans provided to direct investment enter-prises abroad by German investors togetherwith other affiliated enterprises in Germany,rose during the period under review from3301 billion to 3628 billion, or more than
doubled in nominal terms. This growth isdue, above all, to the vast foreign direct in-vestment flows associated with cross-borderacquisitions of large enterprises in 1999 and2000. Once the economy began to slump inthe course of 2001, these take-overs and ac-quisitions fell distinctly, however. In addition,account needs to be taken of the distortionscaused by converting foreign currencyamounts into euro. Stocks of German directinvestment in euro-area countries are nolonger influenced by exchange rate effectsbecause of the single currency; for that rea-son, German foreign direct investment assetsheld abroad have been affected to a majorextent only by the temporary depreciation ofthe euro against the US dollar (-25% duringthe period under review) and the pound ster-ling (-13%). This depreciation caused a com-mensurate increase in the euro value of for-eign assets denominated in foreign currency.This effect contributed to a rapid rise in in-vestment by German enterprises in US andBritish direct investment enterprises, whichrose from around one-third of all foreign dir-ect investment stocks at end-1998 to 43% atend-2001.A breakdown of foreign direct investment
capital provided directly by German investorsby type of capital shows that equity capital –a key building block of foreign direct invest-ment relationships – rose disproportionatelysharply between end-1998 and end-2001, by3269 billion to 3505 billion (see table on
page 53). The bulk of this increase (+ 3234 bil-
lion) was accounted for by pro rata nominalcapital and capital reserves. Despite large divi-dend payments ( 343 billion) by foreign direct
investment enterprises to German parentcompanies, profits brought forward andrevenue reserves more than doubled duringthe observation period, to 3135 billion. The
pro rata profits and losses for the financialyear, however, reflect the sharp slump inglobal economic growth over the course of2001. Whereas profits for the financial yearrose only moderately, by 39 billion to 336 bil-
lion between 1998 and 2001, losses for thefinancial year rose distinctly, by 320 billion to
333 billion. Lending by German investors and
other affiliated enterprises in Germany to for-eign direct investment enterprises, too, wentup sharply, by 358 billion net. Nearly two-
thirds of this was accounted for by additionalinter-company loans, the volume of whichwas nearly equal that of direct lending byGerman investors at end-2001. Conversely,lending by foreign direct investment enter-prises to their German parent companies hasto be taken into account, too. These reverseflows are deducted from foreign direct invest-ment capital according to international stand-ards. At end-2001 they amounted to 372 bil-
lion, more than three times their end-1998level. What this shows is that large Germancompanies are increasingly using intra-group

53financing vehicles to obtain capital abroad at
low cost, as these loans stemmed mostlyfrom proceeds from securities issued on inter-national financial markets by the financingvehicles of large German groups – basedabroad not least for tax reasons.
In the opposite direction – ie foreign direct in-
vestment in Germany – the cross-border ac-tivities of some major groups between end-1998 and end-2001, in particular, played akey role in causing foreign direct investmentcapital to more than double, from 3218 bil-
lion to 3469 billion. This strong increase was
the result of some exceptionally large-scaledirect investment transactions, especially in2000. When evaluating these data, however,it must be noted that the growth of foreigndirect investment assets in Germany is attrib-utable for the most part not to additional
funds provided for investment but to the ac-quisition of some major German enterprisesby foreign investors. The majority of these in-vestors came from European Union countries(their foreign direct investment stocks rose by3214 billion to 3336 billion at end-2001),
with the lion’s share being accounted for byeuro-area countries (+ 3186 billion to 3285
billion at end-2001).

54however, to the size of pro rata nominal cap-
ital and capital reserves; up by 3178 billion (to
3289 billion), they rose even more quickly
than German enterprises’ participation in thecapital of foreign partners. This rise, rather,was slowed down on balance by the otherequity capital components. Profits broughtforward and revenue reserves went up to apaltry 322 billion and amounted only to just
under one-sixth of profits brought forwardand revenue reserves posted by German dir-
ect investment enterprises located abroad.Reasons for the relatively low level of profitsreported by foreign-owned German enter-prises included the gloomier economic out-look in Germany and corporate tax reform.Following this reform, it was possible onlyuntil 2001 to release without restrictions rev-enue reserves, which had hitherto been sub-ject to a higher tax rate, in a way that minim-ised the tax burden, an option which enter-prises made widespread use of. During theperiod under review 331 billion in dividends
were paid to foreign parent companies –much more than in earlier comparableperiods. The weak economy in Germany in2001 made itself felt clearly in enterprises’profits and losses for the financial year, too.The pro rata profits, at 319 billion, were up
by only around one-quarter from their end-1998 levels. Losses for the financial year,however, at an end-2001 level of 3100 bil-
lion, reached an all-time (negative) record, yetthis was due to a major extent to extraordin-ary losses in the telecommunications industryin connection with write-downs of UMTS li-cences, to name one culprit. Lending by for-eign investors and other affiliated enterprisesabroad added up to a record 3268 billion at
end-2001. The share of lending in foreign dir-ect investment assets is generally higher inthe case of foreign direct investment in Ger-many than in the case of German foreign dir-ect investment abroad. During the periodunder review, however, this lending was in-creased disproportionately sharply, by 3157
billion, with the share provided directly by for-eign investors increasing from 39% to 46%.Reverse flows played only a subordinated role 5 bn

55regarding direct investment enterprises in
Germany, increasing by 35 billion to 313 bil-
lion. In contrast to the distinct increase in theamount of financing procured by Germanenterprises on the foreign capital market viatheir intra-group subsidiaries, conversely, for-eign parent companies almost completelyavoided using the German capital markets toobtain finance.
The significance of holding companies
If primary foreign direct investment relation-
ships are broken down by the branch of eco-nomic activity of the direct investment enter-prises, it is striking to note that financial in-vestment in holding companies has beengaining increasing importance from year toyear in both directions of cross-border capitallinks. Whereas at end-1998 383 billion, or
only just under 28% of German foreign directinvestment assets, were invested in holdingcompanies abroad, this percentage had al-ready risen to 38%, or 3240 billion, by end-
2001. The trend is even clearer in the case ofprimary foreign direct investment in Germany.At end-1998 as much as 56% of foreign cor-porate assets ( 3122 billion) were invested in
holding companies in Germany; by end-2001this figure had risen to over 71% ( 3335 bil-
lion). These numbers underline the key rolethat holding companies play in the structureof major international groups. However, whatthis “roundabout” method of financingthrough holding companies indicates is thatdevelopments in foreign direct investment infurther companies can be analysed only to alimited extent by country and branch of eco-nomic activity. Direct investment is not actual-
ly the main explicit purpose of investing fundsdirectly into holding companies; rather, ad-ministrative and tax reasons are the factorsbehind primary capital links. An attempt musttherefore be made to “see through” theseholding companies in order to identify the ac-tual direct investment enterprises. The firststep in doing this is to take account of partici-pating interests in further direct investmententerprises held by holding companies whichare majority-owned on a cross-border basis;the holding companies’ participating interestsin these additional direct investment enter-prises is considered “secondary” foreign directinvestment. In order to avoid double count-ing, in a next step the primary foreign directinvestment relationships with these holdingcompanies are factored out of the analysis.
What becomes apparent is that, in this type
of consolidated calculation, cross-border cor-porate assets acquire a distinctly differentstructure both in absolute terms and in theircomposition by type of capital (see chart onpage 54). Seen in this light, primary and sec-ondary German foreign direct investmentrose by an even greater margin between end-1998 and end-2001, by 3380 billion to 3699
billion. Equity capital, in particular, was nearly356 billion higher than if only primary foreign
direct investment had been examined. Onereason for this is that holding companies ob-tained additional finance abroad and pro-vided their direct investment enterprises witha higher volume of corporate assets as nom-inal capital and capital reserves than whatthey themselves received from their Germaninvestors.

56If this same consolidated approach is applied
to foreign direct investment in Germany,however, the result is a distinct reduction inforeign direct investment stocks. Accordingly,between end-1998 and end-2001 primaryand secondary foreign corporate assets inGermany were increased by only 3124 billion
to3301 billion, less than half compared with
primary foreign direct investment stocks(+3251 billion). The primary reason was that
foreign-owned German holding companieshad to pay more to purchase further direct in-vestment enterprises in Germany than wasreflected in the balance sheet values of thesecondary foreign direct investment enter-prises which entered into the calculation inplace of the holding companies.
In the following, the development of foreign
direct investment will be analysed in the lightof a regional and sectoral breakdown solelyon the basis of consolidated primary and sec-ondary financial relationships.
Regional distribution of corporate assets
German foreign direct investment
abroad
During the period under review, the industrial
countries were in the throes of radical eco-nomic and technological change. New infor-mation technologies now generally enable allmarket participants to communicate simultan-eously and at low cost; this is increasing mar-ket transparency and forcing enterprises to bemore proactive in confronting competition onglobal markets than in the past. One particu-larly noteworthy result of the technological
upheaval has been that nearly 90% of Ger-man corporate assets abroad additionally builtup during the period under review were ac-counted for by investment in industrial coun-tries (see table on page 57). Just over one-third of this growth (+ 3121 billion) was used
to increase the size of corporate assets inEuropean Union countries. Distinct increaseswere visible in particular in the United King-dom (a non-exchange-rate-adjusted + 332 bil-
lion, most of which was accounted for by thefinancial sector), France (+ 319 billion), Luxem-
bourg (+ 316 billion) and the Netherlands
(+322 billion).
The bulk of the remaining two-thirds of the
growth in foreign direct investment in indus-trial countries was accounted for by com-panies in the United States, where Germancorporate assets more than tripled during theperiod under review, increasing by 3197 bil-
lion to 3287 billion (without adjustment for
exchange rate effects). This development wasencouraged by the fact that the US economygrew continuously between the mid-1990sand 2000 and by rapid structural change inconnection with new information technolo-gies, which, combined with flexible productand labour markets, provided a multitude ofincentives for foreign direct investment. Inthe sectoral breakdown, growth in foreigndirect investment in the manufacturing sector(+313 billion, with the focus on chemicals, at
311 billion), however, played only a minor
role. The financial sector was the decisive fac-tor here (monetary intermediation: + 317 bil-
lion, other financial intermediation + 386 bil-
lion).

57For German investors, participating interests in
Japan continue to play only a relatively modestrole. German corporate assets held in Japanamounted to a mere 39 billion at end-2001.
The various direct investment enterprise indi-
cators display a different weight distribution(see chart on page 58). On the whole, duringthe period under review the number of statis-tically recorded German direct investmententerprises
2abroad went up by just over
4,500 to nearly 33,600. Industrial countries,particularly European Union countries, ac-counted for only around half of this increase.Austria, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain sawtheir figures increase by triple-digit margins. Inthe other EU countries, foreign direct invest-ment went up considerably not only in the UK(+388 direct investment enterprises) but par-ticularly in Sweden, by just under 50% to 631enterprises. Foreign direct investment stocks inthat country more than doubled, to 37b i l l i o n
as at end-2001, yet they started at a ratherlow level. The number of foreign direct invest-ment enterprises in the United States rose by700 to just over 4,000 at end-2001. The netincrease in recorded foreign direct investmententerprises in countries in transition and de-veloping countries, from 2,100 to 10,300 dur-ing the period under review, is considerable.Countries in transition accounted for two-thirds of this increase, particularly Poland(+350 direct investment enterprises), theCzech Republic (+262) and Hungary (+115).Primary and secondary direct

58Total turnover in foreign enterprises in which
Germans have a stake increased by over 50%from 1998 levels to 31,347 billion in 2001; in
countries in transition, however, turnovermore than doubled, to 3119 billion. The rise
in employment in foreign direct investmententerprises (+820,000 in all) also dispropor-tionately benefited countries in transition,who alone accounted for one-third of this in-crease. The countries in transition did lesswell, however, when it came to growth ofcorporate assets. Although the volume ofcorporate assets reached 341 billion at the
end of the three-year period, just over twicethe level at which they started, in relativeterms their growth lagged behind the growthobserved in the industrial countries (+125%).That may have particularly owed somethingto the fact that countries in transition current-ly have no business potential for the type of
“mega-mergers” which have ignited the ex-plosive growth in cross-border corporateassets in industrial countries during the periodunder review.
In China,
3which is also classified as a country
in transition, German foreign direct invest-ment stocks increased by 34 billion to 37 bil-
lion. Additional investment was almost exclu-sively in manufacturing companies. Turnoverin the 661 direct investment enterprises ofGerman investors in China, at just under 323

59export. This is understandable since the Chi-
nese market holds out the promise of stronggrowth in view of the size of the economyand the pent-up demand of the population interms of raising its standard of living. Lookingtowards the future, the deregulation of theservices sector following China’s accession tothe WTO in December 2001 gives cause toexpect a further increase in foreign direct in-vestment, especially in the long-overlookedareas of telecommunications, retail trade,banking and insurance.
The ten countries scheduled to join the Euro-
pean Union on 1 May 2004 deserve particularattention.
4Except for Cyprus and Malta,
these countries are all countries in transition.The integration of these countries’ economieswith those of the European Union countriespicked up steam in the past few years in con-nection with accession efforts. More thanhalf of these countries’ foreign trade is nowsettled with EU countries. For accession coun-tries’ economies, foreign direct investment isa key contributor to the process of catchingup to the EU member states. The transfer oftechnology and know-how means that prod-uctivity may be expected to increase over themedium to long term. The attendant im-provement in the supply of real capital is notdirectly associated with increases in theamount of borrowing from foreign countriesthrough the international banking system.During the observation period these countrieswere less affected by the shock in the infor-mation and communications technology sec-tor than other regions; they were thereforeable to continue the catching-up process,growing faster than the EU average. These in-cipient markets have become increasingly im-
portant to German investors. German corpor-ate assets held in these countries nearlydoubled during the reporting period, to 329
billion. More than four-fifths of this increasewas accounted for by Poland, the Czech Re-public and Hungary, countries already men-tioned earlier in this article. German invest-ment in the other seven acceding countriesrose by two and a half times up until end-2001, yet they started at a rather low com-bined level of 31.4 billion at end-1998.

60direct investment in African nations held firm
at a relatively low level of 34 billion, the focus
of German foreign direct investment con-tinued to be developing countries in theAmericas at end-2001, at 331 billion (+ 312
billion). During the reporting period Mexicobenefited from a free trade agreement withthe EU which entered into force on 1 July2000 and removed bilateral customs barriersvis-à-vis European Union countries. Germanforeign direct investment stocks and turnoverin Mexico nearly doubled, to 37 billion and
328 billion respectively. By contrast, German
foreign direct investment stocks in Brazil andArgentina each went up by only 3
12billion.
Employment at direct investment enterprisesof German investors in those two countrieswas even scaled back slightly. This reflectedthe severe economic and political crises. Be-tween end-1998 and end-2001 the Brazilianreal lost over 30% of its value against theeuro, which, seen in isolation, led to a com-mensurate reduction in the foreign direct in-vestment stocks denominated in real uponconversion into euro. Up until mid-2002 theArgentine peso was pegged to the US dollar,which worsened the competitiveness of theArgentine economy. In the developing coun-tries of Asia and Oceania, German corporateassets rose by 311 billion to 321 billion. Here,
too, investment is marked by distinct concen-tration: nearly 60% of foreign direct invest-ment went to only three countries (HongKong, Singapore and South Korea); in eachcountry foreign direct investment stocks morethan doubled during the observation period.The number of persons employed at the dir-ect investment enterprises in the Asian andOceanian developing countries went up by89,000 to 338,000, with just under one-third
accounted for by India alone.
Foreign direct investment in GermanyThe increase in foreign direct investment
stocks in Germany over the period betweenend-1998 and end-2001 – as in earlier years– is attributable almost entirely to investorsfrom industrial countries (see table onpage 61). 3105 billion, or more than four-
fifths of the net increase, were accounted forby investors from European Union countries,mostly from euro-area countries (+ 388 bil-
lion). The number of all direct investment en-terprises
5went up by slightly more than 10%
to 13,800. Whereas investors from EU coun-tries increased their investment in Germanyby 1,500 enterprises to 8,700 direct invest-ment enterprises on balance, investors fromnon-EU industrial countries and from coun-tries in transition and developing countriesmade a slight reduction in the number oftheir direct investment enterprises domiciledin Germany during the observation period. Aparticularly striking development was thetwelve-fold increase in foreign direct invest-ment assets ( 349 billion) accredited to invest-
ors from Luxembourg at end-2001. The bulkof these funds ( 338 billion) was invested in
holding companies in Germany. The Luxem-bourg “financial centre” undoubtedly en-joyed the benefits of its favourable location inthe settlement of cross-border large-valuetransactions.

61ect investment enterprises in Germany with
investors from Luxembourg to double. In add-ition, Dutch investors likewise showed greatinterest in German direct investment enter-prises, once again documenting the Nether-lands’ position as an international holdingcompany site. Alongside considerable invest-ment in corporate assets (+ 314 billion), which
was spread widely across the individualbranches of the manufacturing sector (+ 36
billion) and in trading offices (+ 33 billion), the
number of Dutch direct investment enter-prises in Germany rose by 400 to just over2,900. Just under one-third of the total in-crease in the number of employed persons(+389,000 in all) was accounted for by directinvestment enterprises with Dutch investors.That meant that, at an end-2001 figure of526,000 employees, one-quarter of all per-sons employed in enterprises in Germanywith a foreign capital stake were working atDutch direct investment enterprises. Investorsfrom France likewise added heavily to their in-vestment in Germany, with an increase of313 billion. The number of French direct in-
vestment enterprises in Germany went up bymore than 20% to just under 1,500 at end-2001, and employment was also up by68,000 to 274,000 persons, putting France insecond place among EU nations in terms ofthese indicators. Investors from the UnitedKingdom doubled their corporate assets inGermany to 323 billion. Large-scale transac-
tions in transport, storage and communica-tion accounted for 36 billion. UK investors in-

creased their foreign direct investment in Ger-many by 317 billion to just under 390 billion.
Particularly deserving of mention here are in-vestors from the United States, who, with astake of 356 billion as at end-2001, remained
the largest single foreign investor in Germany.The number of US direct investment enter-prises, turnover and number of employees intheir foreign direct investment enterprises inGermany all remained roughly at their 1998levels. During the observation period, Swissinvestors expanded their foreign direct invest-ment in Germany by 33 billion to just over
320 billion, yet they reduced the number of
direct investment enterprises (-79), which ulti-mately led to a decline in turnover (- 36 bil-
lion) and a reduction in the number of em-ployees (by 37,000).
The regional distribution of foreign direct in-
vestment in Germany changes if corporateassets are not assigned to the primary invest-or beyond Germany’s borders but to thedomicile of the parent company instead.Seen in this light, the amount attributable toinvestors from EU countries was reduced by328 billion to 3175 billion as at end-2001,
whereas the foreign direct investment stocksof investors from non-EU industrial countriesrose by 323 billion to 3113 billion. Foreign
direct investment by investors from theUnited States and Japan who invested in en-terprises in Germany through holding com-panies based in the Netherlands are mainlyresponsible for these shifts.Foreign direct investment stocks by

Some major cross-border corporate take-overs
and acquisitions during the three-year observa-tion period were the reason why additionalstocks of German direct investment abroadwere concentrated among a very few investorsin Germany. Whereas the ten German investorswith the largest foreign holdings accounted for30% of German corporate assets abroad atend-1998 ( 398 billion in just over 1,700 direct
investment enterprises), at end-2001 well over40% ( 3304 billion in 2,000 enterprises) of the
value of foreign direct investment holdings wasconcentrated on Germany’s ten largest invest-ors. Turnover in these enterprises abroad, how-ever, rose by only just over 3110 billion and, at
3396 billion, made up only just under 30% of
total turnover of foreign direct investmententerprises of German investors. The numberof employees in the foreign direct investmententerprises of the ten largest investors in 2001was even down by 65,000 from 1998 levelsand made up only 16% of all employees of for-eign direct investment enterprises at end-2001.
All in all, during the observation period just
under half of additional German corporateassets abroad were provided by holding com-panies in Germany (+ 3184 billion; see table
on page 62). This meant that at end-2001just over two-fifths ( 3290 billion) of foreign
direct investment stocks were in the books ofholding companies. They also accounted fornearly 90% of the increase in corporate own-ership of holding companies abroad (+ 343
billion in all) which themselves did not holdany further reportable participating interests.

64Investors from the German financial inter-
mediation sector increased their holdings incompanies abroad to over two and a halftimes the starting level during the periodunder review. What needs to be noted,though, is that success in selling financial ser-vices is still heavily dependent on local condi-tions and linked to close customer relation-ships. German banks, in particular, added373 billion to their equity participations,
bringing the total to 3110 billion; these par-
ticipations were mainly in other financialintermediation ( 333 billion) and credit institu-
tions abroad ( 331 billion). During the obser-
vation period, a net total of 107 foreignequity participations in credit institutionswere added (494 foreign banks as at end-2001) and employment at these institutionsnearly doubled to 114,000 persons.Of enterprises from the German manufactur-
ing sector, it was particularly investors fromthe sector “Manufacture of motor vehicles,trailers and semi-trailers” and the chemical in-dustry which upped their foreign corporateassets. For enterprises from the manufacturingindustry, equity participations in foreign part-ners from the same sector were less signifi-cant; these enterprises were more interested ininvesting in the “other financial intermedi-ation” sector abroad. During the observationperiod they increased their foreign direct in-vestment stocks in these companies by 356 bil-
lion to 374 billion. Investors from the “Manu-
facture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers” sector made the largest single contri-bution, increasing their investment by 346 bil-
lion. Through leasing and financing deals,these companies support car sales abroad andensure that, from a financing perspective, Ger-man manufacturers are able to maintain theircompetitiveness on international markets.
It may be inferred from the wholesale and re-
tail trade indicators of capital links with foreigncompanies that trading direct investmententerprises of their own are high up on Ger-man enterprises’ list of priorities. Acquisitionof equity participations in trade grew by asharp 325 billion, and the 12,700 direct invest-
ment enterprises generated, most recently,37% of foreign turnover in terms of the turn-over of all foreign equity participations held byGerman enterprises. Wholesale and retail trad-ing direct investment enterprises were thelargest single employers out of all foreignequity participations, employing 917,000 per-sons. In addition, German companies alsomade marked increases in their direct invest-

65ments in the transport, storage and communi-
cation sector as well as in services, where for-eign corporate assets grew sharply.
During the period under review, reported fi-
nancial assets, particularly holdings of equityparticipations, rose faster than fixed assetsand intangible assets in the balance sheets ofenterprises in Germany with a foreign partici-pating interest. This is the consequence of for-eign investors increasing their ownership ofGerman holding companies which themselvesheld no further reportable participating inter-ests in Germany. Foreign direct investment inmanufacturing enterprises in Germany rose bynearly 50% (see chart on page 64). Foreigndirect investment was spread widely across in-dividual branches of economic activity. Despitethe fact that manufacturing enterprises in Ger-many saw their 2001 profits suffer their worstslump since 1993, between 1998 and 2001equity participations in 394 such enterpriseswere acquired. At end-2001, therefore, for-eign investors held direct investments in morethan 3,600 enterprises within this sector. Halfof the 3781 billion in total turnover generated
in 2001 by German enterprises in which for-eign investors held a stake was concentratedon these 3,600 enterprises, which at end-2001 employed nearly 1.2 million persons.
Major transactions in transport, storage and
communication had a strong impact onforeign direct investment in Germany, too.During the period under review foreign assetsrose by 319 billion to 321 billion. Enterprises
in this sector reported sizeable holdings offixed assets and intangible assets in their end-2001 balance sheets and obtained a major
portion of their financing through inter-company loans. Foreign investors’ ownershipof companies in the German financial inter-mediation sector went up by 310 billion. In
the remainder of the services sector, too, for-eign investment interest remained unabatedin the three-year period under review.
The German economy’s international capital
links grew exceptionally dynamically in thethree-year reporting period between end-1998 and end-2001 owing in particularmeasure to major mergers. However, the re-ceding of the wave of cross-border mergersand the economic gloom that has been exist-ent since 2001 indicate that this momentumlost steam following those three years. Theincreasing extent of economic links betweenGerman enterprises and other countries is en-abling full advantage to be taken of the inter-national division of labour. At the same time,though, this makes economies increasinglyinterdependent. For instance, cyclical swings,which are reflected in the earnings situationof German subsidiaries located in other coun-tries, can be transmitted rapidly to groups asa whole through these financial links and canaffect not only local investment activity butpotentially also investment in the parent com-pany’s country of domicile.

67German results of
euro-area banklending surveyIn January 2003 the Eurosystem intro-
duced a quarterly bank lending surveyof the euro area. The aim of the surveyis to obtain more information on thebanks’ lending business than is pro-vided by the statistics already avail-able. From both a monetary policy per-spective and a general economic per-spective, the main emphasis is on dis-tinguishing between the demand-sidedeterminants and supply-side deter-minants of changes in lending businessand on ascertaining the relationshipbetween these changes and the eco-nomic cycle. This is the first time thatchanges in the underlying conditionsfor lending and their determinants arebeing recorded for the euro area atregular intervals. The results of thefirst two surveys in January and Aprilare now available. These results haveto be interpreted with care given thefact that there are only two observa-tion periods. Nevertheless, the surveyresults so far available for Germany –much like those for the euro area ingeneral – indicate that the banks, onthe whole, are pursuing a slightly morerestrictive lending policy. This has beenreflected first and foremost in highermargins, especially in the case of riskierloans, and in more stringent collateralrequirements. The findings of the sur-veys do not indicate that there is acredit crunch.

68Background and aims of the bank
lending survey of the euro area
A euro-area bank lending survey is justified by
the importance of the banks in financing en-terprises and households in the euro area. Incontrast to financial systems, such as that ofthe United States, which are more market-oriented, the euro-area economies are pri-marily bank-based.
1This means, for example,
that not only households but also enterprisesdepend mainly on the banks for their externalfinancing and use the financial markets foronly a much smaller part of this. This appliesall the more to small and medium-sized en-terprises (SMEs), which, in view of their lowerdegree of transparency with regard to theircorporate activities and financial status, areparticularly reliant on the banks as financialintermediaries and mostly have no access toother external sources of funds.
Banks try to limit their credit risk not only by
collecting and processing information ontheir borrowers but also by considering otherfactors. The components of the loan agree-ment which, in addition to the agreed interestrate, have a major bearing on the lending de-cision include the collateral provided by theborrower and other lending conditions suchas limits on the credit volume, the maturity ofthe loan and loan covenants. These play anespecially important role in determining thecredit relationship between the banks andtheir customers and are decisive parametersfor the banks’ lending policy. A deteriorationin a customer’s creditworthiness may there-fore be reflected not only in a matching in-crease in the risk premium on the interestrate but also in restrictions on the size of
the loan or, indeed, a refusal to grant one.A bank’s decision in such circumstances willbe influenced by its own balance-sheet pos-ition and economic situation in relation to thestructure of its credit portfolio, its capital ratioand profitability as well as the nature ofits business relationship with the customer.A house bank principle, as it is called, hasevolved in this context, especially in Germany:a close customer-bank relationship providesthe customer – enterprises and individualsalike – with a kind of “liquidity insurance”. Inreturn for a customer’s extensive use of thehouse bank’s banking services and given theresulting additional information gained aboutthe customer, the bank typically grants thecustomer more generous loans, even in timesof greater economic difficulties, than it woulddo, or could do, as part of its normal stand-ardised retail business.
Even so, the relationships between banks and
customers are also subject to the structuraltransformation taking place in the bankingand financial systems. As in the other euro-area countries, the banking market in Ger-many is characterised by a steadily increasingpressure to consolidate, technological changein the distribution channels and in theprocessing of deposits and loans as well asgrowing competition from other financial
1At the end of 2002, for example, the loans granted by
domestic banks to the private sector amounted to 109%
of GDP in the euro area and to 125% of GDP in
Germany; by contrast, they amounted to only 78% of
GDP in the United States (source: International Financial
Statistics, IMF).Banks’ role

69market players.2These changes are naturally
having an impact on the financing optionsopen to households and enterprises. Conse-quently, the financial conditions for enter-prises and households change not only as aresult of cyclical developments but also onaccount of structural factors. Such changescan have a significant effect on investmentand consumption patterns and therefore ondevelopments in the economy as a whole.
Another factor, and one that is important
from the point of view of monetary policy-makers, is the particular role played by thebanks’ financing conditions for householdsand enterprises in the monetary policy trans-mission process. A cyclically or structurally in-duced change in the banks’ supply of creditcan alter the effect of monetary policy meas-ures on economic agents and therefore themonetary policy transmission mechanism.Various empirical studies
3point to the influ-
ence of what is known as the credit channelon the transmission of monetary policy deci-sions. Consequently, a change in the keyinterest rates by the central bank may affectdifferent groups of borrowers to a greater orlesser extent and may vary in its overall inten-sity. Firstly, this can be due simply to the lend-ing behaviour of the bank itself (bank lendingchannel), which is influenced by the afore-mentioned balance-sheet position and eco-nomic situation of the bank. Secondly, theborrower’s ability to provide the collateralneeded for a loan fluctuates owing to, say,valuation changes resulting from cyclical up-swings and downturns (balance-sheet chan-nel).Information on changes in bank lending be-
haviour is therefore important for enabling acentral bank to improve its assessment of thepotential effectiveness of its own monetarypolicy measures and to gear them to theunderlying economic conditions. It is particu-larly important in this context to be able todistinguish between factors which affect thecredit supply and those which influence thecredit volume by altering the demand forcredit. As a rule, the available data onchanges in bank lending provide informationonly on transaction volumes, which do not in-dicate whether and to what extent changesare influenced by supply or demand. Even ifthese data are analysed in conjunction withthe existing statistics on bank lending rates,an unambiguous interpretation is still notpossible because the aforementioned factorsinfluencing lending decisions cannot be in-cluded in the analysis.
The aim of the bank lending survey of the
euro area is to close this gap. For the firsttime the survey provides quite detailed quali-tative information on changes in bank lend-

70ing behaviour in the euro area. This informa-
tion covers not only the margins but also vari-ous loan conditions such as collateral require-ments and possible volume restrictions. It alsoprovides the banks’ assessments of the fac-tors determining their credit supply and thoseinfluencing credit demand. Consequently, thefindings of the survey also make it easier tointerpret existing statistics. The Federal Re-serve System in the United States and theBank of Japan already have many years’ ex-perience with similar regular surveys on lend-ing. Surveys undertaken by the US centralbank have shown that over the long term thedata obtained from the surveys can help toimprove the forecasting of credit growth andeconomic developments.

Structure and implementation of thebank lending survey
The bank lending survey is based on a ques-
tionnaire containing a total of 18 questionson lending to enterprises and households(housing and consumer loans). The questionsconcentrate on developments during theprevious three months, ie the first quarter of2003 in the case of the results of the currentApril survey. On the supply side they concernthe credit standards, their determinants andthe credit terms and conditions. The changesin credit demand experienced by each individ-ual institution and the factors influencing thisare also surveyed. Furthermore, the institu-tions are asked to state what changes theyexpect both in their own lending policy and incustomer demand during the following threemonths. In a final item the banks are asked tooutline any additional factors affecting their
lending behaviour over the previous threemonths.
Eighty-six banks, including 17 German banks,
take part in the regular quarterly surveythroughout the euro area. The German banksare selected to reflect the diversity of theGerman banking system and the variouscategories of banks within it. This also meansthat the choice of participating banks islinked not only to their respective marketshare of loans to enterprises and householdsbut also to the market share of the relevantbanking category. In Germany the selectedbanks answer the survey questionnaire
5by
means of interviews. The interviews with thebank loan officers – usually board membersor staff reporting directly to them – are con-ducted at the end of the quarter. In additionto the answers to the questionnaire, theseinterviews yield important background infor-mation on developments and determinants inthe field of bank lending. This informationcan be used to interpret the findings. As amatter of principle, great importance is at-tached to the participating institutions enjoy-ing confidentiality not only with respect totheir participation but also, and more import-

71antly, with regard to the information dis-
closed at the interview.
All of the participating national central banks
pass on the individual results obtained fromthe survey in an anonymous form to the Euro-pean Central Bank (ECB). The ECB aggregatesthe results for the euro area on the basis ofthe country weights and submits an analysisof the findings for both the euro area and thecountry aggregates to the ECB GoverningCouncil for its monetary policy meeting in thefollowing month; the weight of the Germanresults currently amounts to 36.2%.
6In
future, the results will also be published regu-larly in the relevant monthly reports of theECB and the Bundesbank.
In principle, however, the interpretation of
the survey results is subject to various qualifi-cations. Firstly, these include the qualitativeand subjective character of the survey find-ings, ie they are not objective, quantitativedata such as precise figures on credit volumebut reflect tendency estimates recorded on afive-point scale. Even so, the interpretationcan be improved by augmenting these esti-mates with “soft” information arising fromadditional data disclosed by the banks duringthe interviews. Secondly, the survey is con-cerned only with identifying changes; conse-quently, information on levels – such as thedegree of restriction imposed by a bank’s cur-rent lending policy – cannot be automaticallyderived from the survey data. Finally, any in-terpretation is currently subject to the qualifi-cation that there is still a lack of experienceand longer-term data that would allow inter-temporal comparisons, for example, over aninterest rate or business cycle. During the an-
alysis a net percentage is calculated in orderto improve the quantitative assessment of theaggregated qualitative results. This net per-centage is the difference between the per-centage share of responses in the restrictiverange less the percentage share of theresponses in the expansionary range. Thismeans that a positive value suggests a re-strictive tendency while a negative value indi-cates an expansionary tendency.
Initial results for Germany
Generally speaking, the results of the
April 2003 bank lending survey suggest that,in the case of Germany, there was a furtherslight tightening of the surveyed institutions’credit standards in the first quarter of 2003although the degree of tightening was lessthan in the previous quarter. This applies bothto lending to enterprises and to housing andconsumer loans to households (see the chartson pages 72 and 75). This means that theGerman results are more or less consistentwith those of the euro area as a whole.
According to the data on credit standards
supplied by the institutions surveyed, it wasmainly loans to large enterprises in Germanythat were subject to a further slight tighten-ing in conditions during the first quarter of2003 whereas – in contrast to the previousquarter – small and medium-sized enterpriseswere hardly affected by additional restrictionsduring this period (see the table on page 73).

72The institutions mentioned an estimated
higher degree of risk as the main reason forthe tighter conditions.
7This assessment con-
cerned the general economic outlook, factorsspecific to certain sectors or companies aswell as the value of collateral. The banks’ fi-nancing costs and balance-sheet restrictionswere also reasons for the slight additionaltightening of the lending conditions. This wasreflected in a further increase in margins,greater volume restrictions as well as morestringent collateral requirements and loancovenants. Furthermore, the banks, in somecases, were again somewhat more restrictivewith respect to maturities (see the table onpage 74).
In the case of the banks surveyed it was main-
ly the demand for credit from large enter-prises that showed a slight average decline in
the first quarter of 2003. The surveyed insti-tutions believe that, as in the previous quar-ter, this was due primarily to a reduction inthe financing required for fixed investment. Inthe case of about half the banks, however,debt restructuring and the absence of alter-native sources of finance increased the de-mand for bank credit. This means that, as inthe previous quarter, the survey responses inthe area of corporate credit in the first quar-ter of this year do not indicate that the slug-gish growth in lending during this period wasdue primarily to factors on the supply side;the survey results show that the somewhatmore restrictive lending policy was accom-panied by a slight fall in demand. This is trueregardless of company size or credit maturityand is somewhat inconsistent with the assess-ments expressed by the banks in the previousquarter which suggested that there would bea tightening of the credit standards, especiallyfor small and medium-sized enterprises aswell as for short maturities.
The banks participating in the survey as-
sumed that there would again be a slighttightening of their credit standards, especiallyfor small and medium-sized enterprises, inthe second quarter of 2003 (see adjacentchart). At the same time, they expected that,in line with their forecast for the previousquarter, there would be virtually no change inthe overall demand for credit during this

7Even so, this could partly be a reflection of a deterior-
ation in the creditworthiness of borrowers, which is to be
attributed to the demand side. This would be the case if,
when considering loans, the banks responded simply to
the increase in credit risk without altering their risk sensi-
tivity.Corporate

73period. It is therefore only in the case of large
enterprises that a slight decline in credit de-mand was expected; by contrast, a slight risein demand was expected from small andmedium-sized enterprises. The expectationsfor the second quarter of 2003 therefore indi-cate a difficult environment for borrowers, es-pecially small and medium-sized enterprisesand those seeking short-term credit.
The banks participating in the survey again
tightened their credit terms and conditionsslightly for households, too. The results of theApril survey are consistent with those fromthe first round of the bank lending survey inJanuary, which indicated a more restrictivelending policy in the final quarter of 2002(see the chart of page 75). In both surveyrounds these results applied to housing loansand consumer loans and were above the
declining average in the euro area, especiallyfor the first quarter of 2003.
Regarding the causes of the further slight
tightening of the credit standards for grant-ing housing loans to households in the firstquarter of 2003, most respondents men-tioned their risk assessment of the generaleconomic outlook whereas the prospects forthe housing market, the most important ex-planatory factor in the previous quarter, werenow virtually irrelevant on the supply side. Inaddition, a fairly small number of the bankssurveyed gave their financing costs andbalance-sheet restrictions as reasons for theirmore restrictive lending policy. As in the previ-ous quarter, the more stringent credit termsand conditions were reflected primarily in aChanges in the credit standards applied to enterprises over the past three months

riskier exposures in particular. On the demandside, by contrast, the banks believed that, onaverage, there had been no change in thefirst quarter of 2003; however, there wereconsiderable variations from one institutionto another. Demand, the banks said, hadbeen influenced, on the one hand, by specialfactors and by anticipatory effects in connec-tion with the expected abolition of the grantto home buyers. On the other hand, demandhad been depressed, as in the previous quar-ter, by the lack of consumer confidence inparticular and by the outlook on the housingmarket. The banks taking part in the surveyexpected no significant changes in their ownlending policy in the second quarter of 2003.At the same time, however, they assumed an-other slight reduction in households’ demand
for housing loans.
As in the previous quarter, the banks partici-
pating in the survey slightly tightened theircredit terms and conditions for consumerloans in the first quarter of 2003. They gaverisk assessment with respect to the generaleconomic outlook and the creditworthinessof households as the reasons for this. Accord-ingly, the main indication of the slight tight-ening of credit standards was again an in-crease in the margins for riskier exposures inthe credit terms and conditions. This time,too, the assessments of the banks surveyedproduced a very mixed picture on the de-mand side, with considerable differencesfrom institution to institution, although thesedifferences more or less cancelled out.

75cording to the banks, subdued consumer
confidence continued to have a curbing ef-fect on demand in some cases. Generallyspeaking, the banks surveyed did not expecta further change in their credit standards inthe second quarter of 2003. By contrast, thepicture with regard to expected demand forconsumer loans was also fairly mixed thistime and showed a slightly rising tendency onaverage.
Conclusions
Owing to its qualitative data on the banks’
lending behaviour, the bank lending survey ofthe euro area is likely to make a major contri-bution to the interpretation of the macroeco-nomic and monetary situation in the euroarea. It is the first comprehensive survey ofthe European banks’ lending business andcan therefore augment the wide-rangingstatistics already available with valuable infor-mation on the banks’ lending business onboth the supply side and the demand side.The results available so far are already provid-ing important initial data on the current creditterms and conditions applied by the banks inthe euro area. When interpreting these find-ings, however, it must be remembered thatthey are qualitative, subjective data whichcan do no more than give a general indicationof changes. The extent to which this is reflect-ed quantitatively in the credit volume or inthe interest rate margins and ultimately af-fects the development of the economy can-not yet be gauged owing to the absence of alonger-term observation period. Assessmentsof levels – for example, the general degreeof restriction on lending – cannot be derived
at this point either.
The initial survey results for Germany indicate
that, overall, the banks were somewhat morerestrictive in their lending in the final quarterof 2002 and the first quarter of 2003. This isvery largely in line with the general euro-areatrend. These changes were reflected primarilyin the margins, especially in the case of riskierDistribution of responses

76loans, and to some extent stricter additional
credit conditions relating to collateral, volumeand maturity. This probably reflects a furtherincrease in the banks’ general risk awareness.In the case of the banks surveyed, credit de-mand, especially from enterprises, declinedfurther whereas demand from households inthe first quarter of 2003 largely remained un-changed. The banks taking part in the surveysignalled another slight tightening of theirlending policy in the area of loans to enter-
prises in the second quarter of 2003 whereastheir policy for housing and consumer loanswould remain largely unchanged. Generallyspeaking, the results therefore suggest thatcurrent credit developments are being affect-ed not only by discernible weakness on thedemand side but also by supply-side factorsin some cases. The survey did not provide anyindication of a credit crunch.

77Monetary policy:
how relevant areother policymakers?Bundesbank SpringConference 2003In May the Bundesbank held its fifth
spring conference. This year’s themewas “Monetary policy: how relevantare other policymakers?”, and the par-ticipants considered to what extent acentral bank should take into accountthe decisions of other economic policy-makers, ie foreign central banks andfiscal policymakers, in its decision-making process. In the past few yearsthis has increasingly been the subjectof academic studies. At the same time,economic policymakers have been in-creasingly confronted with the ques-tions raised by such studies. As expect-ed, the conference did not offer anyconclusive answers, but it did draw at-tention to several important, and somenew arguments, which are to be con-sidered below.
Monetary policymakers in many countries
are again facing the question as to just howclosely they should consider in their decision-making process the decisions of other eco-nomic policymakers at home and abroad.One relevant issue is the relationship betweenmonetary policy and fiscal policy. Does fiscalpolicy making impair or support monetarypolicy and what rules for the individual areasof policy making could defuse any possibleconflicts? The discussion surrounding the Sta-bility and Growth Pact in Europe and the rele-vant provisions in the Maastricht Treaty con-cerning public deficits and indebtedness inthe countries participating in monetary unionare examples of just how seriously the rela-tionships between these two areas of policy

78making are taken. Another topic is the rela-
tionship between domestic and foreign mon-etary policy. Many countries are now con-sidering, for example, whether their own cen-tral bank should tie its policy to that of othercentral banks by setting fixed exchange ratesor at least taking them into account during itsdecision-making process or whether to allowfree-floating exchange rates. Finally, one cancombine both of these issues and discuss theinteraction of monetary policy and fiscal pol-icy within an international framework. An-other important question is what the appro-priate fiscal policy for a given monetary unionis, or more generally, what the implications ofchoosing a particular exchange rate systemare for the international harmonisation of fis-cal policy?
Academic in nature, the conference did not,
however, set out to provide answers to thequestions at hand, but instead was more con-cerned with discussing theoretical and empir-ical models which could help to improve theanalysis of concrete problems, examine con-ventional arguments and create the basis forfuture solutions. The conference programmeis on page 79.
Economic research today tends to make
statements based on models which describea general equilibrium and which are derivedfrom very fundamental principles. One ofthese principles is that households maximisetheir benefits and companies maximise theirprofits and that expectations are consistentlyderived from the structure of the model inuse. By using such models, one is more im-mune to accusations that false conclusionshave been drawn as behaviour patterns have
simply been maintained instead of being de-rived from the principles mentioned above.Furthermore, such models are generally wellsuited to identifying the implications of eco-nomic policies for the welfare of a country.All of the analyses presented at the confer-ence attempted to satisfy the strict require-ments of the model framework.
However, using this method also has its price.
The analysis becomes more complex, andmany phenomena occurring in the real worldcannot be sufficiently considered. Therefore,economic research is currently preoccupiedwith finding out which aspects of the econ-omy are to be studied so that a model willcapture basic features that are empirically sig-nificant without losing its manageability.Conversely, we also want to know how ro-bust some conclusions are if the modelframework is enlarged or modified. The con-ference showed, for example, that the con-sideration of imperfect competition betweencompanies and of sticky prices in an economyhas consequences for determining monetaryand fiscal policies that will maximise thewelfare of a society. One result of imperfectcompetition is that positive interest rates areadvantageous from an economic welfarepoint of view; inertia witnessed in the price-formation process can justify why centralbanks should strive for low and steady ratesof inflation instead of a highly volatile pricelevel. These conclusions may appear to betrivial at first glance. However, they confirmour belief that this class of economic modelsis capable of revealing other, less obvious in-sights.

80When analysing the relationship between
monetary and fiscal policies, several differentaspects can be emphasised. One can ask, forexample, how an “all-powerful government”should use the instruments available in thesetwo policy areas to optimise economic per-formance. The result then becomes a bench-mark for evaluating sub-optimal policies al-though these appear to be more realistic.Other approaches tend to show that variousinstitutions with different objectives are re-sponsible for these two areas of policy mak-ing, and this leads to a degree of strategicinteraction. The question here is under whichconstellations do monetary and fiscal policiestend to support each other and when do theytend to conflict with each other. Finally, onecan change the point of view further still andask the question from a monetary policystandpoint, ie to what extent a particular fis-cal policy impedes monetary policy in achiev-ing its goal. One of these perspectives willprove to be more appropriate depending onthe question posed.
One prerequisite to approaching these com-
plex questions is to be aware of the most im-portant transmission channels of these policyareas as well as their interdependencies. Adirect relationship exists between monetaryand fiscal policies since, as a rule, profitsmade by central banks are turned over to thegovernment. Monetary policy can also affectpublic finances because, by determining theprice level, it also contributes towards settingthe real value of public debt. Finally, there arealso more indirect points of reference sinceboth monetary and fiscal policies influenceeconomic variables which are of commoninterest, such as demand. All of these aspects
were discussed at the conference.
With regard to transmission channels, special
attention was also given to expectation ef-fects, which are triggered by fiscal policy –namely that today’s deficits will in future leadto higher taxes or lower expenditure. A studypresented in the United States points out thatthe inclusion of such effects presents anti-cyclical fiscal policy in a much less favourablelight. This is ultimately also important with re-gard to whether, from the perspective of themonetary policymakers, fiscal policymakersare to be considered to be strategic partnersor a possible hindrance. Another paper alsogave the impression that at least the discre-tionary components of US fiscal policy havetended to have a more disruptive rather thana stabilising effect on economic development.At the same time, however, the paper con-cluded that this did not seriously embarrassmonetary policymakers. The paper also tem-pered concerns that policymakers in theUnited States and Europe could not succeedin moderating inflation expectations throughmonetary policy measures owing to an in-creasing level of government debt. Duringdiscussions, however, it was pointed out thatthe paper had neglected important aspects ofthe European debate. In particular, possiblecoordination deficits as well as external ef-fects were not addressed in European fiscalpolicies, which inter alia make it tempting to
act simply as a free rider. Finally, the otherpoint of view was considered, namely whichmonetary policy trends appear advantageousfrom the standpoint of fiscal policy. In thiscontext, two monetary policy rules were com-

81pared: on the one hand, monetary targeting,
which sets a target for monetary growth,and, on the other, a policy which aims to ad-here strictly to an inflation goal. The advan-tages of monetary targeting become appar-ent here since it permits fluctuations in pricedevelopments. This in turn makes it easier forfiscal policy to keep under control any gov-ernment debt arising from the issue of nom-inal securities.
An empirical study examined how monetary
and fiscal policies in the United States andGermany have interacted in the past. Thestudy concluded that the two policies haveoften pushed economic development in op-posite directions. When economies are facedwith a demand shock, however, it is moreprobable that the two policies will both pullin the same direction, thus providing mutualsupport. This study also pointed out that suchconclusions are not independent of themodel structure in use. This again highlightsjust how important it is to be very carefulwhen developing economic models.
The analysis of the link between one’s own
monetary policy and that of other countrieswas another focal point of the conference. Ifone asks whether and, if yes, how a centralbank should coordinate its policies with othercentral banks, the next question is whether itshould strive for fixed exchange rates, formonetary union (in an extreme case), or forfree-floating exchange rates or whether anintermediate regime may make more sense.
In the aforementioned general equilibrium
models flexible exchange rates mostly appearto be advantageous because they make it
easier for an economy whose prices are notentirely flexible to deal with shocks in an opti-mal way. During the conference, two possibleobjections to this viewpoint were discussed.The discussion first examined what conse-quences arise from the fact that exchangerates are not always a result of uncoveredinterest rate parity but rather that this under-lying relationship is also influenced by shocks,which happen in systems with free-floatingexchange rates in particular. Reducing oravoiding such shocks by selecting fixed ex-change rates or exchange rates with limitedflexibility can prove to be advantageous insuch models. This especially applies to openeconomies with a large export sector whereastraditional arguments in favour of more flex-ible exchange rates dominate in more closedeconomies. Interestingly, arguments in favourof fixed exchange rates (or monetary union)carry more weight than traditional reasoning,which states it is imperative that participatingcountries be exposed to similar productivityshocks.
A second possible objection to the traditional
argumentation in favour of flexible exchangerates may result from the fact that com-panies’ pricing policy and the prevailing ex-change rate system are not unrelated. In acountry with fixed exchange rates, wherecompanies may be confronted with fairlylarge demand shocks, it may be worth settingprices more flexibly in order to absorb suchshocks. This conclusion must, however, betreated with a certain degree of caution. If aharmonised monetary policy in the participat-ing countries reduces demand shocks, it is

82conceivable that companies may not attach
much importance to price flexibility. Onetherefore cannot simply assume that a mon-etary union will exhibit greater price flexibility.
Finally, if one were to consider several econ-
omies together, the obvious question is howmonetary policy and fiscal policy (should) re-late to one another. European monetaryunion and the debate on the role of nationalfiscal policies provide an occasion for justsuch a discussion. The discussion of the prosand cons of coordinating monetary and fiscalpolicies at a global level also makes examin-ing such models interesting. In this context,views presented at the conference state thatthe advantages of an internationally agreedfiscal policy, which actively seeks to correctdisruptive factors in an economy, depend onthe monetary regime in the participatingcountries as well as the type of shocks in-volved. It would therefore appear advisablethat, in addition to having a common monet-ary policy (ie monetary union) or a harmon-ised monetary policy, fiscal policy should alsobe harmonised. By contrast, in a world with-out monetary coordination, a harmonised fis-cal policy can actually be detrimental.
Another paper dealt with a related subject. If
one assumes that two countries form a mon-etary union and have also agreed to coordin-
ate their fiscal policies, the question arises asto just how the harmonised policy shouldfunction and which tasks should it and/ormonetary policy assume when it comes tocorrecting shocks. It becomes evident here,too, that it is essential to recognise the typeof disruption before the appropriate fiscalpolicy can be set. In this context, the confer-ence examined in particular the case wherethe price-setting behaviour of companies ex-hibits unexplained fluctuations and comparedthis with the results seen during times ofproductivity shocks. One further conclusionwas that, while a (common) monetary policyought to focus on stabilising economic devel-opment within monetary union, an optimalfiscal policy should concern itself exclusivelywith solving national problems.
While the newer models developed by aca-
demic economists do offer advantages overtraditional analyses, they have hitherto paidlittle attention to the coexistence of monetaryand fiscal policies. The conference has shownthat this was not justified. Indeed, this facthas raised many new questions and chal-lenges for economic researchers. This holdseven more true if an international dimensionis brought into the picture.

*These euro area retail bank interest rates should be used with caution and Member States. Furthermore, the national interest rates are not harmonised
for statistical purposes only, primarily to analyse their development over in terms of their coverage (new business and/or outstanding amounts), th e
time rather than their level. They are calculated as the weighted average of nature of the data (nominal or effective) or the compilation method. The
national interest rates provided by the national central banks. The national country weights for the euro area retail bank interest rates are derived from
rates represent those rates that are currently available from national MFI balance sheet statistics or close proxies. The weights reflect thesources and which are judged to fit the standard categories. These national country-specific proportions of the relevant instruments within the eur o
rates have been aggregated to derive information for the euro area, in area, measured as outstanding amounts. The weights are adjusted monthly,some cases relying on proxies and working assumptions due to the so that interest rates and weights always refer to the same month. —1En-
