Economic conditions
Underlying trends
German economic output is likely to contract 
slightly in the second quarter of 2019. Special 
factors that contributed to a marked increase 
in gross domestic product (GDP) in the first 
quarter of this year have run their course or are 
even going into reverse. Looking at the quar -
terly average, certain rebound effects are to be 
expected in the construction sector, for ex -
ample, after a very strong weather- related ex -
pansion of activity in the winter months. Fur -
thermore, car purchases were put on hold last 
autumn owing to supply difficulties following 
the introduction of the new worldwide har -
monised light vehicles test procedure (WLTP) 
and most of these cars have been bought in 
the meantime. Fiscal stimuli, too, are having a 
significantly reduced impact. Finally, advance 
purchases in the United Kingdom in the run- up 
to leaving the European Union, which was ori -
ginally scheduled for the end of March, are 
now probably having a negative impact on ex -
ports. Added to this is the continuing sluggish 
underlying cyclical trend, which is due chiefly 
to the ongoing downturn in industry. The ex -
pansionary forces for more domestically ori -
ented sectors are still fundamentally intact, 
however. The picture of a two- speed economy 
is thus set to continue.1
Industry
April 2019 saw a steep fall in industrial output. 
In seasonally adjusted terms, it was 2½% down 
on the month. This meant that industrial out -
put was also down substantially on the average 
of the first quarter (-2.0%). German car manu -
facturers suffered especially sharp cutbacks in 
production (-5%). According to data provided 
by the German Association of the Automotive 
Industry (VDA) on the numbers of passenger cars manufactured, motor vehicle output is 
likely to have picked up again in May, however. 
It is possible that this volatility is connected 
with the UK’s withdrawal from the European 
Union, which was originally planned for the 
end of March. Added to this was a consider -
able decline in German mechanical engineering 
output in April compared with the preceding 
quarter. Manufacturers of computers and elec -
tronic and optical products, on the other hand, 
reported a steep increase in output. Overall, 
however, production of capital goods was 
down by a significant 2¾% on the quarter. 
Output of intermediate and consumer goods 
underwent a somewhat smaller decline (1¾% 
and ½% respectively).
The order situation of German industrial enter -
prises became marginally brighter in April 2019 
with a seasonally adjusted month- on- month 
increase of ¼%. Even so, it was distinctly below 
its level in the previous quarter (-½%). Marked 
regional discrepancies were recorded. While 
there was a sharp contraction in the inflow of 
orders from Germany and other euro area 
countries (-4½% and -3¼% respectively), there 
was quite considerable growth in orders from 
countries outside the euro area (+5¾%). This 
increase was due chiefly to orders received by 
the automotive sector after it had suffered a 
double- digit slump in the preceding quarter. As 
in the case of production, this might be con -
nected with the postponement of the date of 
Brexit. In addition to this, other transport 
equipment met with brisk demand in non- euro 
area countries. Across all regions and sectors, 
however, the intake of orders in the capital 
goods sector was down slightly compared with 
the previous quarter (-¼%). There was a signifi -
cantly stronger decline in the inflow of orders 
in the case of intermediate goods producers 
(-1½%). By contrast, manufacturers of con -German econ -

sumer goods received a considerably larger 
number of new orders (+3%).
Nominal industrial sales in April 2019 followed 
industrial output – albeit on a much reduced 
scale – and were slightly down on the month in 
seasonally adjusted terms (-¼%). Compared 
with the previous quarter, they showed a 
marked fall of ¾%. In a regional breakdown, 
the sharp and broad- based drop in sales in 
non- euro area countries was the key reason for 
the overall decline. Industrial enterprises’ do -
mestic sales were only slightly down on the 
quarter. In the other euro area countries, sales 
showed a marked increase, in fact, with Ger -
man manufacturers of machinery, in particular, 
enjoying high sales figures. Taking all the re -
gions together, sales of capital goods – just like 
sales of intermediate goods – had a dampen -
ing impact, however. This contrasted with sales 
of consumer goods, which expanded strongly. 
Nominal goods exports in April 2019 showed a 
sharp seasonally adjusted fall on the month 
(-3¾%). Compared with the average of the 
first quarter, there was also a steep fall in both 
nominal and real terms (-3% in each case). Par -
ticularly noteworthy is the sharp decline in ex -
ports to the United Kingdom. There was a con -
siderable seasonally adjusted fall in nominal 
imports of goods in April both on the month 
(-1¼%) and compared with the previous quar -
ter (-1½% in nominal terms and -1¾% after 
price adjustment).
Construction
Construction output increased slightly in April. 
After seasonal adjustment, it expanded by ¼% 
on the month. Compared with the average of 
the first quarter, the increase was significantly 
stronger at 1½%. This is noteworthy in light of 
the fact that construction was already expand -
ing strongly in the first quarter owing to very 
favourable weather conditions. The continued 
growth in April compared with the preceding 
quarter was, moreover, broad- based. The main 
construction sector and the finishing trades Slight fall in

both experienced strong growth in their vol -
ume of production (+1¼% and +1¾% respect -
ively). Other economic indicators also suggest 
that construction activity is continuing to flour -
ish at present in Germany, defying the – on the 
whole  – weak underlying cyclical trend. It is 
true that the first three months of 2019 – data 
are available up to that point – saw a consider -
able seasonally adjusted fall in construction 
orders compared with the previous quarter 
(-2%). This decline should nevertheless be seen 
in the context of the very sharp rise in the final 
quarter of 2018 when construction firms 
posted double-  digit growth in orders. Further -
more, according to the Ifo Institute, capacity 
utilisation and the reach of orders in the main 
construction sector are both close to their re -
cord levels.
Labour market
Employment growth remains on the up. Al -
though employment growth was slower in 
April than on an average of the first quarter of 
2019, it was still considerable. After seasonal 
adjustment, the number of persons in work in 
April rose by 32,000 overall on the month. Em -
ployment was up by 484,000 persons, or 1.1%, 
compared with the same month last year. This 
is essentially the outcome of the strong expan -
sion in jobs subject to social security contribu -
tions, although growth in this area was also 
subdued towards the end of the period under 
review. Above all, there were markedly fewer 
jobs available in temporary agency employ -
ment. The manufacturing sector was hiring 
staff again on balance. The largest increases, 
however, were shown by the health and social 
care sector, business and support services (not 
including temporary agency workers) as well as 
the construction sector. The leading indicators 
of labour demand are still expansionary. Never -
theless, besides the Ifo employment barometer, 
which had been falling for several months, 
there were also slight dampeners in May re -
garding the number of reported vacancies, the 
Federal Employment Agency’s BA-  X job index and the labour market barometer of the Insti -
tute for Employment Research (IAB).
May saw a sharp rise in registered unemploy -
ment in seasonally adjusted terms. There were 
2.28 million persons registered as unemployed 
with the Federal Employment Agency, which 
was 60,000 more than in April. The unemploy -
ment rate went up by 0.1 percentage point to 
5.0%. The number of unemployed persons was 
80,000 lower than in the same month last year. 
Most of the month- on- month increase is due 
to a study by the Federal Employment Agency 
at the facilities (jobcentres) run jointly by the 
Agency and local governments concerning the 
unemployment status of recipients of un -
employment benefit II and has nothing to do 
with the current cyclical slowdown.2 Neverthe -
less, there was also a perceptible increase in 
the number of recipients of unemployment 
benefit under the statutory insurance scheme, 
which is more sensitive to cyclical conditions. 
This development had already set in somewhat 
earlier, but was masked in the first few months 
of the current year by the expansion of labour 
market policy measures. There was no add -
itional increase in such measures in May and 
the rising number of unemployed persons in 
the statutory insurance scheme became notice -
able. There was a further decline in the IAB un -
employment barometer. It is now in negative 
territory, leading to the expectation that un -
employment will go up slightly in the next three 
months.Growth grad -
ually easing but 
still markedConsiderable 
rise in 
unemployment

a statistical 
 revision
2 Persons able to work who receive unemployment bene -
fit II because they are in need but who are not available to 
the labour market for various reasons, i.e. because they are 
participating in a labour market policy measure or have to 
look after small children or care for relatives, are classified 
as not working. If this requirement for non- availability on 
the labour market ends, these persons are counted as un -
employed. Checks at jobcentres, which are facilities run 
jointly by the Federal Employment Agency and local gov -
ernments, revealed that the unemployment status of per -
sons entitled to benefits was not always up to date. This 
led to an upward revision of the unemployment figure by 
around 30,000 to 40,000.Deutsche Bundesbank

Prices
Crude oil prices in May initially remained at 
their prior- month level before declining notice -
ably against the backdrop of the gloomier de -
mand outlook. On an average of the month, 
prices stood at just over US$70 and were thus 
clearly down on the previous year’s level. Prices 
then went down further, with a barrel of Brent 
crude oil costing US$62 as this report went to 
press. The discount on crude oil futures was 
US$2 for deliveries six months ahead and 
US$2¼ for deliveries 12 months ahead.
Prices at the upstream stages were clearly ac -
celerating again in April. This was not only due 
to a marked rise in energy prices. Other goods 
were becoming somewhat more expensive, 
too. Despite this, annual import price inflation 
fell to 1½%, as energy prices had gone up even 
more sharply in April 2018. Producer prices 
were still more than 2½% up on the year, how -
ever.
Seasonally adjusted consumer prices (HICP) in 
May continued to show an increase on the 
month. Energy became perceptibly more ex -
pensive again, because energy prices were re -
corded only in the period in which crude oil 
prices showed a further rise. Prices of food and 
industrial goods (excluding energy) likewise in -
creased somewhat. By contrast, the prices of 
services eased slightly. Overall, the annual HICP 
rate fell to 1.3% and annual CPI inflation went 
down to 1.4%. In April, the HICP figure was 
2.1% (CPI: 2%). If energy and food are ex -
cluded, the decline was even steeper in fact 
(from 2.0% to 0.9%). A part in this was also 
played by the fact that Whitsuntide was later 
this year compared with 2018, falling in June 
rather than in May. This meant that rising prices 
in connection with Whitsuntide, for instance 
for package holidays, did not show up in the 
reporting month. Additionally, there was a 
sharp fall in the prices of package holidays in 
May beyond this calendar effect.Securities markets
Bond market
At €106.4 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in April 2019 was considerably 
below the previous month’s figure (€120.3 bil -
lion). After deducting the significantly higher 
redemptions and taking account of changes in 
issuers’ holdings of their own debt securities, 
net sales of domestic debt securities amounted 
to €18.3 billion. The outstanding volume of 
foreign debt securities in Germany rose by €5.0 
billion during the reporting month, which 
meant that the outstanding volume of debt in -
struments in the German market decreased by 
€13.3 billion overall.
In the reporting month, the public sector re -
deemed debt securities worth €15.1 billion net, 
which was attributable exclusively to central 
government, including the resolution agency 
that is classified as part of it (€15.9 billion). 
Central government principally redeemed five-  
year Federal notes (€12.4 billion) and, to a 
lesser extent, Federal Treasury discount paper 
(Bubills) and two- year Federal Treasury notes 
(€3.2 billion and €2.8 billion respectively). By 
contrast, it issued ten- year and 30- year Federal 
bonds (Bunds) worth €4.5 billion and €1.4 bil -
lion net respectively. State governments issued 
bonds to the net value of €0.8 billion.
In April, domestic credit institutions reduced 
their capital market debt by €8.3 billion. In par -
ticular, there was a fall in the outstanding vol -
ume of debt securities issued by specialised 
credit institutions (€5.4 billion), but also in the 
outstanding volume of other bank debt secur -
ities that can be structured flexibly (€2.9 billion) 
and of public Pfandbriefe (€1.1 billion). Only 
mortgage Pfandbriefe were issued, at a total of 
€1.0 billion net.
Domestic enterprises issued bonds with a net 
value of €5.1 billion in the reporting month, 
compared with €2.6 billion one month earlier.

ities of more than one year. The majority of the 
bonds were issued by financial corporations 
(without a banking licence).
In April, domestic non- banks and the Bundes -
bank were the main actors on the buyers’ side. 
The former bought bonds worth €4.5 billion 
net, with interest largely focused on foreign 
paper. The Bundesbank acquired debt secur -
ities worth €1.3 billion net, which comprised 
exclusively domestic paper. This contrasted 
with net sales by domestic credit institutions 
totalling €8.0 billion. Foreign investors, too, 
offloaded interest- bearing paper worth €11.0 
billion net.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
issued new shares worth €0.2 billion net in the 
German equity market. The volume of foreign 
equities in the German market rose by €4.5 bil -
lion over the same period. Domestic non- banks 
were the sole purchasers, adding a net €5.9 bil -
lion worth of equities to their portfolio, the 
vast majority of which were foreign shares. By 
contrast, non- resident investors and domestic 
credit institutions offloaded shares amounting 
to €0.8 billion and €0.4 billion net respectively.
Mutual funds
In April, domestic mutual funds recorded mod -
erate inflows of €9.5 billion net. On balance, 
specialised funds reserved for institutional in -
vestors (€8.2 billion) were the primary benefi -
ciaries. Among the asset classes, mixed 
securities- based funds, in particular, engaged in 
selling new shares (€4.4 billion). However, 
open- end real estate funds (€1.8 billion), bond 
funds (€1.6 billion) and funds of funds (€1.2 bil -
lion) also recorded inflows. The outstanding 
volume of foreign mutual fund shares distrib -
uted in Germany increased by €2.3 billion dur -
ing the reporting month. In April, mutual fund 
shares were purchased mainly by domestic non- banks (€11.0 billion), as well as by resident 
credit institutions (€1.1 billion). By contrast, for -
eign investors sold German mutual fund shares 
worth €0.3 billion in net terms.
Balance of payments
In April 2019, Germany’s current account re -
corded a surplus of €22.6 billion. The result 
was €8.3 billion down on the previous month’s 
level. This was mainly due to a reduced surplus 
in the goods account; however, the surplus in 
invisible current transactions – comprising the 
services account as well as primary and second -
ary income – also narrowed.
In the reporting month, the surplus in the 
goods account decreased by €6.1 billion on the 
month to €19.2 billion, with exports of goods 
falling more sharply than imports.Purchases of

In April, the surplus in invisible current transac -
tions went down by €2.2 billion to €3.3 billion, 
chiefly owing to the fact that net receipts in 
primary income dropped by €2.1 billion to €7.6 
billion. Higher dividend payments on portfolio 
investments by non- residents played a key role 
here. Conversely, the deficits in the services ac -
count and in secondary income were virtually 
unchanged. The deficit in services remained at 
€0.7 billion. Both sides of the balance sheet 
were shortened in almost equal measure. While 
movements in the individual positions were 
relatively small on the whole, the sum of the 
decreases slightly outweighed the sum of the 
increases, with reduced spending on travel, in 
particular, playing a role on the expenditure 
side. At €3.6 billion, the deficit in the secondary 
income account stood at the same level as in 
March. This saw both sides of the balance 
sheet expand somewhat. On the income side, 
a key contribution was made by higher general 
government receipts, which arose primarily 
from current taxes on income and wealth. On 
the expenditure side, although payments to the 
EU budget went down, mainly in the context 
of financing related to gross national income, 
the increase in non- government sector spend -
ing was slightly stronger.
In April 2019, the international capital markets 
operated in an environment of mixed economic 
signals and ongoing monetary policy accom -
modation. Against this backdrop, Germany’s 
cross- border portfolio investment generated 
net capital exports in the amount of €19.4 bil -
lion, compared with net capital imports of 
€22.2 billion in March. Non- resident investors 
sold German securities totalling €12.2 billion 
net. They mainly parted with money market 
paper (€10.5 billion) and bonds (€0.5 billion), in 
some cases replacing public sector bonds with 
bonds issued by the private sector. They also 
disposed of equities (€0.9 billion) and mutual 
fund shares (€0.3 billion). Domestic investors 
added foreign securities worth €7.2 billion net 
to their portfolios. They focused on acquiring 
bonds (€7.1 billion) – especially those denomin -
ated in euro – and mutual fund shares (€2.3 Smaller surplus

Direct investment generated net capital exports 
of €4.2 billion in April, compared with €23.4 
billion in March. German enterprises injected 
additional capital totalling €16.3 billion net into 
their foreign affiliates, mainly in the form of 
equity capital (€17.8 billion), of which €4.7 bil -
lion was reinvested earnings. By contrast, they 
reduced the amount of funding provided 
through intra- group lending (€1.5 billion). For -
eign enterprises stepped up their direct invest -
ment in Germany by €12.1 billion on balance, 
primarily by increasing the volume of credit 
they provided to affiliated enterprises (€11.0 
billion). Moreover, they provided domestic en -
terprises with additional equity capital (€1.1 bil -
lion).
Other statistically recorded investment, which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -posits and other investment, saw net inflows of 
capital from abroad in the amount of €12.5 bil -
lion in April (as opposed to outflows of €15.6 
billion in March). This was due to net capital 
imports by the banking system as well as by 
non- banks amounting to €7.8 billion and €4.8 
billion respectively. Monetary financial institu -
tions (excluding the Bundesbank) attracted net 
inflows of funds from abroad (€12.3 billion). By 
contrast, the Bundesbank’s net claims rose by 
€4.5 billion. This mainly stemmed from the fact 
that the Bundesbank’s liabilities vis- à- vis non-  
residents declined more sharply than its 
 TARGET2 claims in April. The decline in 
 TARGET2 claims was probably due in part to a 
countermovement to the strong quarter- end 
increase the month before. Enterprises and

Outlook for the German economy – 
 macroeconomic projections for 2019 
and 2020 and an outlook for 2021
After a boom phase, the German economy is currently experiencing a marked cooldown. Domes -
tic expansionary forces remain intact, yet the underlying cyclical trend is only subdued. This is 
mainly due to the downturn in industry, where lacklustre export growth is taking a toll. From the 
second half of 2019, exports should gradually start increasing more strongly again, however. 
Industry ought to regain traction, too, and the dichotomous state of Germany’s economy should 
become less pronounced. Private consumption and investment are likely to record solid growth 
over the remainder of the projection horizon, albeit slightly weaker than in 2019. A slowdown in 
employment growth driven by demographic factors is the key contributor here. Fiscal policy will 
continue to have an expansionary effect in the coming years.
In this scenario, calendar- adjusted real gross domestic product (GDP) is set to grow by just 0.6% 
this year. At a rate of 1.2%, the pace of growth will be markedly higher again in 2020. It could 
then see another slight intensification in 2021 and again reach the pace at which aggregate cap -
acity is expanded. Capacity utilisation is going to be distinctly higher than the norm across the 
whole of the projection horizon. Inflation, as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer 
Prices (HICP), is likely to weaken significantly this year, from 1.9% in 2018 to 1.4%. This is due, 
above all, to lower price rises for energy. In the following two years, energy is not expected to 
increase by much in price. This partially masks the fact that other goods and services will see 
somewhat stronger price increases from year to year against the backdrop of rising import prices 
and persistent wage pressures. Accordingly, the inflation rate excluding energy and food could go 
up from 1.3% in 2018 to 1.7% in 2021. Parallel to this, headline inflation will probably climb to 
1.5% in 2020, then 1.7% in 2021.
The general government surplus will likely shrink markedly this year, but will still amount to 
around 1% of GDP. It should fall further over the coming years. A loosened fiscal policy is the 
main reason behind the decrease. In addition, positive cyclical effects are tailing off. The debt 
ratio is likely to fall below the 60% threshold this year.
Compared with the projections from last December, significantly lower economic growth is now 
expected for the current year in particular. In line with the subdued state of economic activity 
over the projection horizon, inflation excluding energy and food will likely turn out to be mark -
edly lower. Changing with the path of energy prices, consumer price inflation is now expected to 
be considerably weaker overall, especially in 2020. For economic growth and, to a lesser extent, 
for the rate of inflation, it is the downside risks that predominate as things stand today.Deutsche Bundesbank

Economic outlook1
In the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quar -
ter of 2019, the German economy saw only 
muted growth. In the final quarter of 2018 and 
the first quarter of 2019 taken together, real 
GDP rose by just 0.4% after seasonal and cal -
endar adjustment. It thus fell well short of the 
expectations expressed in the December pro -
jection.2 This means that the underlying cyclical 
trend has remained persistently weak since 
mid-2018. The December outlook had pro -
jected a fairly subdued underlying pace of 
growth, but it had been assumed that produc -
tion in the automobile industry would be sig -
nificantly ramped up once the problems in con -
nection with the introduction of a new EU-  
wide emissions test (Worldwide Harmonised 
Light Vehicle Test Procedure – WLTP) were 
gradually overcome. For this reason, in particu -
lar, GDP growth of slightly above potential had 
been expected. In reality, however, the catch-  
up effects in the automobile industry were 
largely eclipsed by weaker global demand for 
motor vehicles.3 In addition, the autumn 
brought the beginnings of a broad- based 
downturn in other export- oriented industry be -
yond the automotive sector, too; this had not 
been foreseen. By contrast, domestic economic 
activity remained robust, in line with the ex -
pectations contained in the December projec -tion.4 Temporary factors played a big part in 
the marked increase in GDP in the first quarter 
of 2019. The fiscal measures effective since the 
beginning of the year and consumers catching 
up on deferred car purchases gave a further 
boost to private consumption. On top of this, 
the favourable weather conditions facilitated 
high levels of construction investment.5
Only a slight increase in GDP is to be expected 
in the second and third quarters of the current 
year. The economy in Germany is initially likely 
to remain in its dichotomous state. On the one 
hand, the outlook for exports is weak and the 
downturn in industry is likely to continue. New 
orders have declined strongly and on a broad 
front since the start of 2019. Furthermore, the 
ifo Institute’s business climate index for the 
manufacturing sector has fallen significantly in 
recent months, as have production and export 
expectations. In industry’s wake, business in -
vestment is also likely to take a hit. On the 
other hand, domestic expansionary forces re -
main intact. Wages and employment should 
continue to climb robustly. Overall recruitment 
plans are one indicator of this, even if those of 
industry have dimmed recently. Furthermore, 
business expectations in the main construction 
sector and in trade, as well as in the other ser -
vices sectors, albeit to a lesser extent, bright -
ened again somewhat after dipping at the start 
of 2019. On balance, the weak underlying cyc -
lical trend is likely to continue in the second 
and third quarters of 2019. After a slight de -
crease in the second quarter, real GDP is likely 
to pick up again somewhat in the third quar -Only muted

4 The comparatively steep increase in aggregate demand 
was bolstered by, among other factors, clear catch- up ef -
fects when it came to motor vehicle purchases. At the 
same time, however, inventories were heavily depleted, to 
an extent which had not been anticipated.

ter.6 A more protracted, clear decline in eco -
nomic output currently seems an unlikely pro -
spect, though.
Over the remainder of the projection horizon, 
the German economy is likely to see somewhat 
stronger growth again. Key here is the expect -
ation that exports will gradually shake off stag -
nation in the second half of the year and will 
then go on to increase more strongly again in 
keeping with the assumed recovery in foreign 
demand. This should allow industry to regain 
traction, and business investment should re -
cover. These developments should see Germa -
ny’s economic dichotomy become less pro -
nounced. Over the coming years, the domestic 
economy will tend to become weaker. There 
will be a solid increase in private consumption, 
albeit somewhat weaker than that recorded 
this year on account of less dynamic growth in 
real disposable incomes. The impact of demo -
graphic effects will be increasingly curbing 
growth in the labour supply; as a result, while 
wages will continue to climb fairly sharply, em -
ployment growth will slacken substantially. To -
gether with the demographically induced re -
duction in newly established households, the 
smaller increase in real disposable incomes 
overall will tend to also have a dampening ef -
fect on demand for housing and thus on hous -
ing construction investment. On top of this, the 
construction sector is already working at max -
imum capacity and expanding production cap -
acity can only be done gradually. Fiscal policy, 
which is set to be expansionary in the coming 
years, will not fully counterbalance the domes -
tic economy.
In this scenario, the German economy will ini -
tially see only weak growth but will pick up 
some speed again in the medium run. After an 
increase in calendar- adjusted real GDP of just 
0.6% in the current year, economic output 
should increase markedly more strongly in 
2020 at 1.2%. The year 2021 could see it ex -
pand slightly more robustly again (see the table Return to some -

6 A contributing factor here is that the one-  off effects 
which played a major part in the higher Q1 GDP growth 
will likely peter out to a large extent. Looking at the con -
struction industry, irrespective of the sector’s continuing 
boom, the very strong first quarter on the back of good 
weather could be followed up by dampening bounce- back 
effects. On the other hand, fiscal policy will additionally 
bolster the purchasing power of households as the year 
progresses.Deutsche Bundesbank

Underlying conditions for macroeconomic projections
This projection is based on assumptions 
made by Eurosystem experts about the 
global economy, exchange rates, commod-
ity prices and interest rates. They are based 
on information available as at 15 May 2019. 
The assumptions regarding economic activ-
ity in the euro area are derived from projec-
tions made by the national central banks of 
the euro area countries.1 They include fi  scal 
policy measures that have been adopted or 
which have already been suffi   ciently speci-
fi  ed and are likely to be implemented.
Momentum of global economy 
 unchanged, muted outlook for world 
trade
The global economy (excluding the euro 
area) grew only slightly more slowly in the 
fourth quarter of 2018 and fi  rst quarter of 
2019 than predicted in the December pro-
jection. The assumption is still that the pace 
of growth will pick up again slightly in the 
second half of 2019 and then remain largely 
constant across the projection horizon. This 
outlook primarily refl  ects the developments 
anticipated for the group of emerging mar-
ket economies. Here, the assumption is that 
the reviving momentum in several east 
Asian economies and in Latin America will 
cancel out a continued gradual slowdown 
in growth in China. The pace of growth of 
the advanced economies (excluding the 
euro area), by contrast, is likely to ease 
somewhat across the projection horizon as 
the effects of expansionary fi  scal measures 
wane and given an additional cyclical slow-
down.2 All in all, the global economy (ex-
cluding the euro area and weighted by pur-
chasing power parity) looks set to expand 
by 3½% per year over the next two years 
following growth of 3¼% this year.The slowdown in global industrial and in-
vestment activity as well as trade disputes 
are weighing on international trade. In fact, 
global trading volume actually dropped per-
ceptibly in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 
fi  rst quarter of 2019 and therefore fell con-
siderably short of the expectations expressed 
in the December projection. A gradual re-
covery of global trade (excluding the euro 
area) is assumed over the projection horizon. 
Following growth rates of ¾% in the current 
year and 2¾% next year, it is not likely to 
largely match global economic growth again 
until 2021. Unlike the outlook for the global 
economy, the expectations for global trade 
were consequently lowered markedly as 
compared with the December projection. 
Growth in German exporters’ sales markets, 
too, has slowed noticeably in the last few 
quarters. Here, as with global trade, a grad-
ual revival of momentum is anticipated over 
the period covered by the projection.
Technical assumptions of the projection
Crude oil prices initially fell markedly follow-
ing publication of the December projection 
given high global production and concerns 
about global oil demand. Since the begin-
ning of 2019, however, OPEC production 
cutbacks, production stoppages in Vene-
zuela, the US sanctions on Iran as well as re-
cently intensifying geopolitical tensions sent 
1 The projections made by the national central banks 
of the euro area countries were completed on 23 May 
2019.
2 As for the United Kingdom’s planned withdrawal 
from the EU, the assumption remains, as in the De-
cember projection, that no tariffs will be introduced 
before the end of 2020. In the short term, the uncer-
tainty about how the decision to leave the EU will be 
implemented is likely to weigh on economic activity. It 
is likewise thought that the transition to new trade re-
lations will dampen economic growth in the United 
Kingdom in 2021.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
June 2019  
16

crude oil prices sharply higher again. As this 
projection was produced, they therefore ex-
ceeded the assumptions of the December 
forecasts. However, the forward quotations, 
from which the assumptions for the June 
projection were derived, suggest that crude 
oil prices will fall distinctly. After that there 
will be no notable change as compared with 
the December assumptions in the anticipated 
average level of crude oil prices this year and 
next, though in 2021 it will be slightly lower 
than the December assumption. Similarly, the 
prices of other commodities as measured in 
US dollars initially fell further following publi-
cation of the December projection. This has 
a stronger impact on the average rate of 
change for the current year than assumed in 
December. In view of the expected growth 
of the global economy, the recovery that has 
been under way since the beginning of the 
year is forecast to continue throughout the 
projection period with moderate increases.
At its December meeting, the Governing 
Council of the ECB decided to discontinue 
its net purchases under the expanded asset 
purchase programme (APP) at the end of 
2018. It also announced that it would con-
tinue to reinvest the principal payments 
from maturing securities purchased under 
the APP for an extended period of time past 
the date of the fi  rst increase in key ECB 
interest rates. After its March meeting, the 
ECB Council adjusted its forward guidance 
on key interest rates. Interest rates are now 
to remain unchanged not only throughout 
the summer of 2019, but at least through 
the end of this year. As a consequence, mar-
ket expectations regarding a future interest 
rate hike shifted even further into the future 
as compared with the assumptions of the 
December projection. In addition, rates are 
now expected to rise signifi  cantly more 
slowly. On balance, the EURIBOR will be 
largely constant across the projection hori-
zon. By contrast, the assumptions regarding the yield on long- term German government 
bonds still point upwards, but from a per-
ceptibly lower level than in the December 
projection. Based on the technical interest 
rate assumptions, bank lending rates will 
also rise only moderately over the next two 
years. Across the projection horizon, fi  nan-
cing conditions are, therefore, expected to 
be extremely advantageou s overall. Accord-
ingly, the percentage of enterprises citing

ness growth remained at a historically low 
level, according to the economic survey 
conducted by the Association of German 
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (DIHK) 
in the early summer of 2019.
Since the December projection was fi  nal-
ised, weaker- than- expected economic data 
for the euro area as well as the ECB Govern-
ing Council’s extended forward guidance 
on policy interest rates have dampened the 
single currency’s value against the US dollar. 
The euro was trading at US$1.12 in the 
period relevant for deriving the exchange 
rate assumptions, which is around 1¾% 
lower than the assumptions in the Decem-
ber projection. Compared with the curren-
cies of 38 major trading partners of the 
euro area, the euro’s depreciation was 
lower, at around 1%.
Muted pace of growth in the euro area
Following muted growth in the second half 
of last year, economic growth in the euro 
area accelerated signifi  cantly at the begin-
ning of 2019. However, the pace of growth 
is expected to moderate again in the second 
quarter. Given further employment gains,3 
considerably rising wages and good cap-
acity utilisation, domestic demand in the 
euro area is likely to continue to display 
robust  growth as the projection period pro-
gresses. In addition, the currently palpable 
headwind from foreign demand is likely to 
ease off across the projection horizon, thus 
creating stronger external stimuli again. 
Here, exports are expected to grow largely 
in line with the sales markets. Overall, the 
euro area economy is therefore likely to 
grow roughly at potential again over the 
next two years.
Compared with the December projection, 
expected GDP growth in the euro area (ex-
cluding Germany) was revised downwards by around  three-tenths to 1.4% for the cur-
rent year. Looking to the next two years, 
largely unchanged growth rates of 1.8% 
and 1.4% are anticipated for 2020 and 
2021 respectively, which means that the 
momentum is likely to be slightly lower 
than assumed in the December projection.
Considerably looser fi  scal policy
Fiscal policy in Germany will be loosened 
considerably over the projection horizon, 
with the strongest loosening occurring this 
year.4 It will have an expansionary effect 
mainly via the expenditure side. Additional 
spending has been agreed in many areas. In 
terms of the social security funds, this re-
lates primarily to pensions. Central, state 
and local governments are planning add-
itional spending, especially on transport in-
frastructure, childcare, education, and in-
ternal and external security. On the revenue 
side, the income tax cuts passed so far will 
be offset by additional revenue from pro-
gressive taxation. On balance, the changes 
to the social security contributions largely 
cancel each other out. Whereas the contri-
bution rate to unemployment insurance has 
fallen, the contribution rate to the public 
long- term care insurance scheme has risen 
by the same amount (0.5 percentage point 
in each case). While the return to parity 
funding by employers and employees of the 
statutory health insurance reduces mem-
bers’ contributions, the contributions re-
quired of enterprises, the various levels of 
government and the statutory pension in-
surance scheme will go up accordingly.
3 The labour market is increasingly experiencing tight-
ness in Germany as well as several other euro area 
countries. See also Deutsche Bundesbank (2019c).
4 Numerous priority measures in the coalition agree-
ment have now been passed and incorporated into 
this projection. However, in particular, the agreed par-
tial abolition of the solidarity surcharge in 2021 has 
not yet been included (revenue shortfall of around €10 
billion a year). The basic pension currently being dis-
cussed is also not included.Deutsche Bundesbank

on p. 14).7 Compared with the December out -
look, a considerably lower rate of GDP growth 
is therefore expected, most notably for 2019 
(see the table on p. 20). This reflects, in particu -
lar, weaker global demand, which, through 
German exports and industry, has been weigh -
ing more heavily on economic growth than an -
ticipated in December, placing pressure over 
the last quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 
2019 as well as over the remainder of this year. 
Other factors feeding into the downward revi -
sion for GDP growth for the next two years are 
private consumption, the outlook for which is 
now being assessed more weakly, and the 
more subdued pace of business investment.
This means that the current, marked slowdown 
in the German economy, on the heels of a 
period of economic boom, will only continue at 
a reduced pace into the next two years. Ac -
cording to this projection, economic output 
will fall considerably short of potential output 
this year and still slightly short next year. The 
growth rate of potential output for 2019 is es -
timated at 1.4%. By 2021, it is likely that this 
rate will fall slightly to 1.3% due to fact that the 
potential labour supply will then stop growing 
due to demographic trends. The level of aggre -
gate capacity utilisation, which was high in 
2018, will therefore abate over the projection 
horizon. However, capacity utilisation will still 
be higher than the norm in 2021, too.
The latest data on new industrial orders from 
abroad are indicative of weak German foreign 
business in the short term. This was confirmed 
by survey-  based indicators, such as the export 
expectations captured by both the DIHK and 
the ifo Institute as well as the Purchasing Man -
agers’ Index (PMI) for incoming orders in the 
export sector. Gradually rising growth in ex -
ports is expected again in the second half of 
2019. Alongside the latest depreciation of the

partners, this will be attributable primarily to 
the anticipated increasing growth in foreign 
demand. Looking ahead, it is likely that the rate 
of growth in German exports will approach 
that of German exporters’ sales markets, whilst 
initially still lagging behind. At most, certain 
market share losses are to be expected within 
the euro area. In this context, unit labour costs, 
which are rising faster than in other euro area 
countries, will probably have an adverse effect 
on German exporters’ price competitiveness 
over the projection horizon.
Despite the downturn in industry in the fourth 
quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019, busi -ness investment expanded significantly and 
even to a somewhat greater extent than had 
been expected in the December projection. 
First, this was due to one- off effects. The brisk 
commercial construction activity in winter is 
likely to have benefited from the favourable 
weather conditions and there were fairly pro -
nounced catch- up effects in commercial ve -
hicle fleets following the sluggish phase last 
autumn. At that time, the introduction of the 
new WLTP emissions testing procedure had no -
ticeably dampened commercial motor vehicle 
registrations. These catch- up effects are now 
likely to have run their course, however. 
Second, industrial investment, which has been 
notably robust until recently, was probably 
linked not least to the comparatively weak pro -
pensity to invest during the previous economic 
boom. Unlike in previous economic cycles, 
there had been no excessively dynamic expan -
sion of investment activity in that period. As a 
result, there was no major build- up of setback 
potential that would significantly depress in -
dustrial investment at the end of the boom 
phase. Even so, due to the supportive one-  off 
effects petering out, the poor outlook for ex -
ports, and the industrial downturn continuing 
for the time being, business investment is ex -
pected to decline in the second and third quar -
ters of 2019.8 Thereafter, in the wake of rising 
export business, industrial investment should 
again see at least subdued growth. The in -
creasingly unfavourable demographic trends 
– which result in a flatter potential growth path 
for the German economy – will dampen fixed 
capital formation.9 Furthermore, aggregate 
overutilisation will further diminish somewhat 
in the coming years. This is likely to lead to a 
weaker propensity to invest.
Housing construction investment rose steeply 
in the fourth quarter of 2018 and first quarter 
of 2019. This was also helped, in particular, by 
the favourable weather conditions in the first Business invest -

quarter of 2019. Starting from this high level, 
housing construction investment will probably 
then see only moderate growth over the pro -
jection horizon. The cost of construction work 
will rise sharply and at an accelerating pace, 
partly because companies are suffering from a 
lack of skilled workers. Due to demand- side 
factors, too, housing construction investment 
could tend to see a slight loss of momentum. 
Alongside demographic trends, the expected 
fall in immigration will reduce the growth in 
newly established households. An additional 
factor is the significantly weaker underlying 
cyclical trend compared with the December 
projection. It will have an impact on real dis -
posable income, thereby reducing households’ 
additional scope for expenditure.
Government investment is likely to continue to 
see significant expansion. The key areas of in -
vestment will probably be transport infrastruc -
ture, schools and childcare. Military spending is 
also expected to rise considerably. However, in 
real terms, the strong nominal increase in con -
struction investment is likely to be substantially 
eroded by the large price increases.
Based on the trends in the three areas de -
scribed – business, housing construction, and 
general government – gross fixed capital for -
mation will see waning growth overall in the 
current and coming year. In 2021, fixed capital 
formation could grow somewhat more strongly 
again due to the slightly better dynamics in 
business and general government investment 
on average over the year.
The lull in consumption in the second half of 
2018 persisted somewhat longer than expected 
in the December projection. Private consump -
tion then rose sharply in the first quarter of 
2019. As was also the case in business invest -
ment, catch- up car purchases played a decisive 
role here. An additional boost was provided by 
the fiscal measures that came into effect at the 
start of the year. In particular, the return to par -

holds. However, it is unlikely that the upswing 
in the first quarter of the year will continue to 
the same degree over the projection horizon. 
Although additional expansionary fiscal stimuli 
will take effect over the remainder of this year 
and in the coming year, at the same time ag -
gregate profit margins, which have been sub -
dued as a result of the economic slowdown, 
will probably put a distinct damper on other 
income, such as investment income. Further -
more, it is likely that the catch- up processes in 
car purchases have largely been completed. 
Based on the underlying trend, the expected 
labour market developments will cause private 
consumption to experience a moderate up -
surge, which will then lose momentum over 
the projection horizon. Although wage growth 
is likely to remain robust, it will tend to be 
somewhat in decline after deducting inflation. 
In addition, employment growth will recede 
considerably in the coming years. Overall, this 
means that, following another fairly sharp rise 
in the current year, households’ real disposable 
income will see significantly weaker growth in 
the future. However, this will probably be miti -
gated to a certain extent by a somewhat lower 
propensity to save. All things considered, pri -
vate consumption will remain a reliable main -
stay of economic activity over the projection 
horizon, although its momentum is likely to be 
markedly more subdued than in the years of 
the upswing.
Government consumption is likely to rise con -
siderably in the projection period. In this con -
text, stronger growth is expected in tangible 
goods purchases, healthcare and long- term 
care spending, and personnel expenditure.
On balance, aggregate final demand rose 
sharply in the fourth quarter of 2018 and first 
quarter of 2019, even after having fallen slightly 
in the third quarter of 2018. By contrast, 
growth in imports was only relatively muted in 
comparison.10 One explanation for this is that a 
considerable portion of final demand was ap -
parently met by stocks that had been built up 
previously. In the second and third quarters of 2019, the momentum of import growth is likely 
to initially slacken further. In this context, the 
decisive factor is the poor outlook for German 
exports and business investment, the latter of 
which is affected by imports to an above-  
average degree. In line with the anticipated 
firming of demand in these two components, 
import growth will probably strengthen again 
towards the end of this year. The ongoing solid 
growth in exports and the thoroughly robust 
domestic demand give reason to expect con -
siderable gains in imports over the remaining 
course of the projection horizon, too. Further -
more, imports will be bolstered by the fact 
that, despite the mounting barriers to trade in 
recent times, the German economy is likely to 
become increasingly integrated in the inter -
national division of labour over the coming 
years as well. It is therefore expected that the 
import shares of all demand components will 
continue to rise over the projection horizon. 
Due to improved price competitiveness, trading 
partners in the euro area should benefit more 
greatly from the increased demand from Ger -
many than their third- country competitors from 
outside the euro area.
The current account surplus is likely to record a 
marked decline this year. Economic activity, 
which is dichotomous at present with weak ex -
ports on the one hand and robust domestic de -
mand on the other, will have an impact here, 
too. On average over the year, the balance of 
trade will therefore feature subdued real ex -
ports opposed by imports that will still be see -
ing comparatively solid growth. As a result, the 
volume effect will reduce the surplus. By con -
trast, price effects will not play a major role, as 
the cost of imports will rise to a similar extent 
to that of exports. In the coming year, these 
trends are expected to continue, although to a 
considerably lesser extent due to the distinct 
upturn in exports. Over the projection horizon, Government 
consumption

it is assumed that the balance of primary and 
secondary income will develop in line with that 
of nominal GDP . Overall, this means that the 
current account surplus will decrease this year 
by almost ½ percentage point to 7% of GDP . 
As things stand today, it could fall marginally 
further in the coming year.
Labour market
In the period spanning the final quarter of 2018 
and the first quarter of 2019, the labour market 
resisted the economic downturn. In seasonally 
adjusted terms, employment rose by 290,000 
persons, which was higher than the figure as -
sumed in the December projection. Even so, 
the economic slowdown left its mark. For in -
stance, the average working hours per em -
ployee dropped; in particular, less overtime was 
worked. All in all, the rise in the total number 
of hours worked over the final quarter of 2018 
and the first quarter of 2019 was somewhat 
weaker than expected. Registered unemploy -
ment declined roughly as anticipated. How -
ever, the decline also reflects the greater use of 
labour market policy instruments since the start 
of the year.
Leading indicators suggest that unemployment 
will probably not decrease much further over 
the coming months. At 5.0%, the seasonally 
adjusted unemployment rate published by the 
Federal Employment Agency is currently at a 
historically low level.11 The weak underlying 
cyclical trend, which also persisted in the 
spring, will drag down working hours per em -
ployee. Employment, on the other hand, will 
continue to rise, but probably at a slower pace. 
In addition to the current subdued demand for 
labour, especially in the manufacturing sector, 
labour supply constraints also play a key role 
here. Demand for labour remains high in most 
sectors; the number of vacancies has dwindled 
mainly in the manufacturing industry. Nonethe -
less, the vacancy periods in which openings un -
expectedly remained unfilled have also in -
creased continuously up to now.Labour market tightness is likely to remain high 
in the coming years. The effects of demo -
graphic developments are increasingly curbing 
growth in the labour supply.12 The rising labour 
participation rate among women and older 
workers, as well as the greater integration of 
migrants into the labour market, are helping to 
offset an unfavourable age structure and the 
smaller age cohorts of more recent years. Al -
though net migration from abroad has dimin -
ished over the last few years, it is still very sig -
nificant. Starting from a figure of 386,000 
people in 2018, it will probably continue to 
shrink slightly, however. Overall, growth in the 
labour force is likely to fall from just under 1% 
in 2018 to almost zero over the projection hori -
zon.Further rise in

At the same time, demand for labour is ex -
pected to be subdued over the next two years. 
With GDP growth slightly below potential, de -
mand for labour is unlikely to be high enough 
to assume that there will be a significant reduc -
tion in unemployment. To this extent, un -
employment will probably only go down mar -
ginally in 2020 – and probably also in 2021. 
Generally speaking, growth in employment will 
therefore be considerably reduced in parallel 
with the growth in the labour force.
Working hours per employed person are likely 
to stabilise again after the clear cyclical decline 
this year. Over the last few decades, average 
working hours per employed person have fallen 
as part-  time employment has increased. This 
trend largely appears to have come to a halt in 
the last few quarters. If the share of all employ -
ees working part- time remains stable at two-  
fifths, one of the main reasons for a decline in 
working hours over the projection horizon will 
have been eliminated. It is therefore assumed that working hours will remain unchanged in 
the years ahead. However, in contrast to the 
December forecast, working hours are no 
longer expected to be used to compensate for 
what is now only moderate growth in the la -
bour pool in the face of high and rising cap -
acity overutilisation. As a result, parallel to the 
pick- up in employment, the total number of 
hours worked will also grow at only a subdued 
pace and will continue to expand only moder -
ately in 2020 and 2021.
Labour costs and prices
Negotiated pay rates are likely to rise as strongly 
in 2019 as they did last year. On the one hand, 
the new wage agreements agreed in this year’s 
wage round, which are generally still relatively 
high, reflect the pronounced domestic labour 
market shortages. But on the other, the second 
incremental wage increases from last year’s 
wage round, which are often smaller (or wholly 
absent), will gradually take effect over the 
course of this year. Viewed in isolation, this will 
suppress the average annual growth rate of ne -
gotiated pay rates.
Over the next years, too, the conditions for 
relatively high wage agreements are favourable 
given the labour market shortages on the sup -
ply side. In addition, following two weak years, 
it is likely that labour productivity will pick up 
again considerably as of 2020, and the inflation 
rate will rise. However, especially in 2020, the 
average growth rate will be curbed again by 
low phased increases and “zero-  months” with 
no pay rise from previously concluded collect -
ive wage agreements with long lifetimes.13 The

13 Here, “zero- months” are taken to mean months in 
which the last phased increase took place more than 12 
months previously. For example, compared to the previous 
year, negotiated pay rates in the metal- working and elec -
trical engineering industry will stagnate between April 
2019 and the end of March 2020. The only exceptions here 
are the new collective special payments due in July 2019, 
which, taken in isolation, will lead to annual growth rates 
of over 20% in July 2019.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

with first higher and then gradual wage in -
creases is likely to persist. On balance, at just 
under 3% per annum, negotiated pay rates will 
rise as strongly as in 2018 over the projection 
horizon, only easing off slightly in 2020.14
Actual earnings are set to rise at an annual rate 
of 3% over the projection horizon, and thus 
slightly more sharply than negotiated pay rates. 
This year, however, the resulting wage drift is 
likely to be small in comparison to the previous 
years. First, fewer paid overtime hours are being 
worked on account of the slower pace of eco -
nomic activity. Second, owing to the surge in 
costs caused by the return to parity funding of 
the statutory health insurance scheme, enter -
prises are likely to expand wages and benefits 
that exceed wage agreements slowly, if at all. 
Since average annual growth in negotiated pay 
rates is likely to be fairly moderate in 2020, en -
terprises will then probably be more willing to 
grant wage supplements and bonuses outside 
the wage agreements, which will contribute to 
higher wage drift. Raises to the statutory min -
imum wage in 2019 and 2010 should only have 
a small impact on aggregate average earnings 
through wage- boosting stimuli.
Compensation per employee, which includes 
employers’ social contributions on top of actual 
earnings, will grow relatively strongly over the 
projection horizon. It is set to record a particu -
larly sharp one- off rise this year as a result of the 
return to parity funding of the statutory health 
insurance scheme.15 Labour costs will go up by 
almost 3% in each of the years thereafter.
Growth in unit labour costs, which was already 
strong last year, is likely to accelerate consider -
ably this year. The reasons for this include, in 
particular, labour productivity, which is likely to 
be similarly weak to last year. However, the dur -
ation of the dip in productivity also reflects the 
assumption that the robust labour market can 
continue to escape the clutches of the economic 
downturn. Most enterprises appear to see the 
current weak growth as temporary, whereas the 
increasingly gloomy outlook for the availability of skilled workers is of a more structural nature. 
The gradual firming of the economy expected in 
the second half of 2019 is therefore also likely to 
see labour productivity increase more sharply 
again. Unit labour costs should thus rise at a sig -
nificantly more subdued rate across the remain -
der of the projection horizon.
Domestic inflation as measured by the GDP de -
flator is likely to increase again somewhat at first 
before stabilising at an elevated level over the 
rest of the projection horizon. Already last year, 
the sharp rise in unit labour costs was reflected 
only partially in the increase in the GDP deflator, 
and aggregate profit margins were substantially 
compressed. This trend is likely to continue even 
more strongly this year. In the current environ -
ment of increasingly tight supply conditions in 
the labour market and temporarily weak aggre -
gate demand, corporate earnings provide a 
major buffer. However, margins should recover Consistently

again to a large extent thanks to the anticipated 
normalisation of unit labour cost growth in the 
following years. This will also be helped by the 
fact that, as economic activity stabilises, enter -
prises will probably resume passing on a signifi -
cant share of their higher labour costs through 
to their sales prices. The construction sector, 
which is still booming, will make a dispropor -
tionately large contribution to domestic inflation 
over the projection horizon as a whole.
Since the end of last year, consumer prices 
have tended to rise somewhat more weakly 
than expected. Annual inflation as measured 
by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices 
(HICP) stood at 2.1% in April and was thus 
0.5 percentage point higher than assumed in 
the December projection. This was, however, 
attributable to an unexpected rise in energy 
prices and in particular a jump in the price of 
package holidays. The latter is likely to be tem -
porary, since it is probably first and foremost 
linked to methodological changes in the meas -urement of prices.16 Prices for other services, 
including rents,17 and for non- energy industrial 
goods, on the other hand, did not develop as 
dynamically as expected.
Energy prices are not likely to rise much over 
the projection horizon. Crude oil prices are even 
expected to go down slightly, which should 
lead to lower consumer prices for refined pet -
roleum products. However, these could be 
more or less offset by higher tariffs for electri -
city and gas resulting from increased market 
prices. The rise in food prices this year will prob -
ably be dampened slightly by the fact that it is 
taking some time for previous decreases in the 
price of some agricultural products to be passed 
through. The price decreases are not expected 
to last, however, meaning that the effect will 
peter out. The comparatively strong wage 
growth in the retail sector in the next two years 
could thus become more visible in food prices.
Excluding energy and food, the inflation rate 
could climb from 1.3% last year to 1.7% in 
2021. Owing to the further depreciation of the 
euro in the final quarter of 2018 and the first 
quarter of 2019 and the resultant marked in -
crease in import prices, prices for non- energy 
industrial goods are expected to rise more 
sharply in 2019 than was already the case one 
year earlier. It is likewise possible that services 
will become even more expensive on the back 
of the persisting wage pressures that pass 
through to prices with a certain lag. This will 
apply all the more given the absence of any 
dampening one- off factors such as the partial 
abolition of childcare centre fees in a number 
of Federal states in 2018 and 2019. In view of 
the ongoing, albeit slightly easing overutilisa -
tion, core inflation is expected to remain at an 
elevated level over the projection horizon, as

pressures remain high. Here, the recovery in 
profit margins serves to counteract waning unit 
labour cost growth. In the final quarter of 
2020, the proposed infrastructure levy will add -
itionally push up prices.18
Headline inflation is initially set to dip signifi -
cantly in the course of the current year, from 
1.9% to 1.4%, on account of the diminishing 
contribution of the energy component. From 
2020 onwards, however, the countervailing in -
fluence of a growing core rate is then projected 
to outweigh other factors, and the headline 
rate is likely to rise slightly. A further hike up to 
1.7% is anticipated in 2021. Compared with 
the projection made last December, core infla -
tion will turn out to be much lower over the 
entire projection horizon due to the less favour -
able macroeconomic outlook. Because the ex -
pected development of oil prices changed, 
though, the headline rate for 2019 was barely 
adjusted, while it was lowered somewhat more 
than the core rate in 2020 (see table on p. 20).
Public finances
The general government surplus will probably 
shrink markedly from this year onward (2018: 
1.7% of GDP): in 2019 it is likely to stand at 
around 1% of GDP , and is projected to fall fur -
ther to ½% of GDP by 2021, mainly on account 
of fiscal loosening. Moreover, the positive im -
pact of the cyclical upswing on public finances 
is on the wane. This will, to a limited extent, be 
counterbalanced by the future exclusion of 
funds for supporting banks from projections as 
of 2020.19 In addition, interest expenditure will 
continue to fall. On balance, the easing of fiscal 
policy will be reflected in a considerably falling 
structural primary surplus (i.e. excluding interest 
payments, cyclical effects and major temporary 
effects), thus markedly bolstering economic 
growth across the entire projection horizon.
The uninterrupted narrowing of the structural 
surplus has chiefly resulted from the significant 
jump in spending growth across the board, as demonstrated by spending on pensions (not -
ably on mothers’ pensions), which has ex -
panded considerably of late on the back of re -
cent measures. Similarly, outlays on Germany’s 
public long- term care insurance scheme and its 
statutory health insurance scheme are expected 
to rise steeply. This is compounded by the fact 
that investment activity and intermediate con -
sumption are set to rise steeply, with more 
funds being earmarked for areas such as trans -
port infrastructure, schools, childcare, defence 
and digitalisation. By contrast, on the revenue 
side the fiscal stance is broadly neutral. Here, 
the moderate tax cuts passed so far, mostly in 
the income tax regime, will be offset by add -
itional revenue from progressive taxation. 
Meanwhile, the changes made to social security 
contributions will largely cancel each other out.
This projection sees the debt ratio continuing 
to fall at a rapid rate. In the course of this year, 
it is expected to dip below the reference value 
of 60% of GDP agreed upon by the EU (60.9% 
at year- end 2018) for the first time since 2002, 
partly due to the primary surpluses run by cen -
tral, state and local governments. Furthermore, 
government- owned bad banks are expected to 
continue deleveraging their portfolios, using 
the resulting proceeds to repay debt. Last but 
not least, the average interest rate will remain 
clearly below nominal GDP growth, likewise 
pushing the debt ratio down.

18 As opposed to past projections, the introduction of this 
levy is now no longer expected to happen in January 2020, 
but in October of that year. Notwithstanding the similarly 
high degree of relief in motor vehicle tax on residents, the 
levy would still push up core inflation somewhat. The HICP 
is based on the domestic concept, which means that do -
mestic expenditure by non- residents is included in the bas -
ket of goods and is taken into account when measuring 
inflation.

most likely to occur as things stand. That said, 
this projection is surrounded by heightened un -
certainty. In particular, given the ongoing 
downturn in the manufacturing sector, the 
German economy is likely to be especially vul -
nerable to shocks from abroad at the current 
juncture. Additional negative external develop -
ments could intensify or prolong the downturn 
in Germany’s strongly export- driven industry. 
This would increase the risk of the downturn 
spilling over into sectors focused on the do -
mestic economy, a scenario diverging from the 
assumptions of the projection. As regards the 
overall assessment of Germany’s economic 
growth, external downside risks thus outweigh 
external and domestic upside risks, which also 
certainly exist. The same holds true, albeit to a 
lesser extent, for Germany’s inflation rate.
Future international trade relations remain un -
certain as a result of various conflicts between 
the United States and some of its trading part -
ners. Although the current talks could lead to new trade liberalising agreements, there is still 
a risk that protectionist measures will increase 
worldwide. This would further impair global 
trade momentum, which is already sluggish at 
present. The adverse impact of this on Germa -
ny’s industrial sector, which is strongly inte -
grated into global value chains, is likely to be 
large.20 If the prevailing tensions over trade pol -
icy were to permanently damage enterprises’ 
trust in the reliability of cross- border produc -
tion links and investment, the repercussions, 
which cannot be gauged at the moment, 
would potentially be stronger and longer-  
lasting. Additionally, the still- present risk of the 
United Kingdom exiting in a disorderly fashion 
from the European Union could cause strong 
disruptions to the financial system and the real 
economy. Moreover, the uncertainty surround -
ing the Italian government’s fiscal policy stance 
could intensify. This could well have a negative 
impact on financing conditions in other Euro -
pean partner countries, too, as well as on eco -
nomic activity in the euro area as a whole. By 
contrast, a swifter recovery in global industrial 
and investment activity than assumed here 
could result in stronger demand stimulus from 
abroad and thus opportunities for higher eco -
nomic growth in Germany.
Looking at the domestic economy, fiscal policy 
is expected to be loosened further. This would 
shrink the general government surplus, mean -
ing that the growth stimulus would be stronger 
than assumed in the projection. The planned 
partial abolition of the solidarity surcharge has 
not been factored into the projection, for in -
stance. Furthermore, there is talk of introdu -
cing a basic pension, further increasing defence 
and development policy spending in view of 
international agreements, or lending additional Overall, down -

financial support to the planned withdrawal 
from coal production, for example.21
Assumptions regarding future crude oil prices 
have a major bearing on the projection for con -
sumer prices, in particular. For one thing, global 
supply disruptions resulting from heightened 
geopolitical tensions, for instance, could push 
crude oil prices up. For another, weaker global 
demand and the potentially stronger than ex -
pected production of US shale oil could see 
prices fall to a lower level. As things stand 
today, these risks largely offset each other. 
However, the oil price dropped significantly 
after this projection was finalised. If this decline 
persists and the oil price develops in line with 
the latest forward quotations, the inflation rate 
would be slightly lower this year and next, and 
would edge up somewhat in 2021.
In overall terms, the risk assessment for inflation 
rate expectations is also tilted to the downside, 
albeit to a lesser extent than for economic 
growth.22 Admittedly, the fact that domestic fis -
cal policy will probably be more expansionary 
could result in certain additional price pressures. 
The same would be true if a firming of the econ -
omy saw enterprises’ profit margins recover 
more strongly than suggested in the projection. 
Higher tariffs and other protectionist measures 
could put additional upward pressure on the in -
flation rate. Taken in isolation, weaker global de -
mand stemming from, for instance, new trade 
barriers would ease the rate of inflation beyond 
the dampening effect on the oil price. This would 
especially be the case if the downturn in German 
industry were to escalate significantly and 
broadly spill over to the economy as a whole.Risks regarding

The European banking package –  
revised rules in EU banking regulation
To rectify the shortcomings exposed during the 2007-08 global financial crisis, comprehensive 
regulatory initiatives relating to financial services were undertaken in multiple stages.
At the global level, the Basel II regime tightened banks’ capital requirements and introduced new 
liquidity standards. As early as 2013, first elements of the Basel III standards were transposed into 
European law in the shape of the newly enacted Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and an 
amendment to the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV). The banking package now implements 
further material elements of the Basel III framework, which was finalised at the end of 2017, at the 
European level by way of amendments to the CRR (CRR II) and CRD (CRD V). The Bundesbank wel -
comes the fact that the standards are being implemented largely in line with international agree -
ments and that any deviations are intended to take account of specificities of the European 
market .
The EU banking package also amends and augments the new resolution regime introduced in the 
EU at the start of 2015 by implementing the total loss- absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirement 
developed by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) for global systemically important institutions only. 
Furthermore, it adjusts the minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) for 
all European banks. The more stringent new rules increase the bail- inable capital available in case 
of a bank resolution, thus improving resolvability. This reduces the risk of public funds being used 
for bank resolutions and thus creates a closer balance between liability and control.
The banking package is a well- balanced compromise and strengthens the stability and resilience 
of the European banking system. It is to be welcomed that the banking package aims at signifi -
cantly reducing the administrative burden on small, non- complex institutions, without exempting 
them from quantitative requirements. Given the growing complexity of banking regulation and 
the increase in compliance costs, this is an important step towards more proportionate and better 
suited regulation. Building on this basis, the outstanding implementation of the Basel III reform 
package from the end of 2017 should continue to pursue this objective.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The banking package represents another key 
milestone in the process of eliminating the 
regulatory gaps and weaknesses identified dur -
ing the financial crisis. Furthermore –  in line 
with the European Council conclusions adopted 
in June 2016 – risk reduction measures in the 
banking sector continue to pave the way for 
the completion of the banking union.
The new rules implement elements of the 
changes and additions to the regulatory frame -
work agreed by the Basel Committee on Bank -
ing Supervision (BCBS) and the Financial Stabil -
ity Board (FSB). These include more risk- sensitive 
capital requirements, particularly with regard to 
market risk, and the introduction of a binding 
leverage ratio and a binding net stable funding 
ratio. In addition, banks will be required to hold 
a minimum amount of capital that is available 
to cover losses in the event of recovery or reso -
lution, with the intention of avoiding the need 
for government support measures. The bank -
ing package also puts a much greater focus on 
proportionality than has so far been the case. 
These measures will reduce the operational 
burden on small, non- complex institutions, pri -
marily in terms of the requirements for report -
ing, disclosure and remuneration. The banking 
package additionally comprises a series of 
other measures, including, for example, the re -
quirement that third- country institutions with 
significant activities in the EU must have an EU 
intermediate parent undertaking, as well as 
specific details on the scope of application of 
Pillar 2 capital requirements and macropruden -
tial instruments.
In order to implement the adjustments detailed 
above, extensive amendments to the CRR,1 the 
CRD,2 the Bank Recovery and Resolution Dir -
ective (BRRD)3 and the Single Resolution Mech -
anism Regulation (SRMR)4 were required.5Material changes to the CRR 
and CRD
Market risk
Having revised the rules on calculating the cap -
ital requirement for market risk, the Basel Com -
mittee published the new fundamental review 
of the trading book (FRTB) framework in Janu -
ary 2016.6 The FRTB substantially reworked the 
concept and methodology of both the stand -
ardised and the models- based approach as well 
as adjusted and specified the trading book def -
inition.7 At the same time that the Basel III re-
form package was adopted in December 2017, 
the FRTB implementation date targeted by the 
Basel Committee was postponed by three years 
to 1 January 2022.
In January 2019, the new Basel market risk 
framework was endorsed and published in up -
dated and expanded form.8 It contains tech -
nical changes to the FRTB internal models-  
based approach affecting the eligibility criteria 
of a model as well as the type and amount of 
capital backing for illiquid risk factors, technical 
changes to the FRTB standardised approach in -
cluding an altered, less conservative calibration 
as well as the introduction of a simplified stand -
ardised approach in the form of the (newly cali -
brated) Basel II standardised approach for insti -
tutions with smaller- scale trading activities.
The new FRTB rules will be phased in across the 
EU. While the basic rules form part of the bank -
ing package, a number of amendments to the Banking pack -

Basel framework made in 2019 still have to be 
implemented this year by way of a European 
Commission delegated act.9
The first step in the application of the FRTB by 
institutions will simply be a reporting require -
ment. This is to begin one year after the afore -
mentioned delegated act is enacted in the case 
of the FRTB standardised approach, and three 
years after for the models-  based approach. 
However, the capital requirement itself will 
continue to be calculated using the rules cur -
rently in force for a certain transitional period. 
This transitional period for the calculation of 
capital requirements will end when the FRTB 
enters into force. The specific design of the 
capital requirement will be the subject of a le -
gislative proposal to be presented by the Euro -
pean Commission by mid-2020.
As the FRTB will initially be introduced simply as 
a reporting requirement, banks will need to use 
previous procedures in parallel with new FRTB approaches. This will cause added work, on the 
one hand, but on the other, it will allow banks 
and supervisors to gain more experience in the 
use of the new approaches ahead of the intro -
duction of the actual FRTB capital requirement.
Leverage ratio
The banking package also adapts the existing 
EU provisions on the leverage ratio (LR) to the 
revised Basel requirements. The leverage ratio is 
intended to complement the risk- based capital 
requirements and ensure that banks have a 
minimum amount of capital that is independ -
ent of the riskiness of their exposures. Like the 
Basel requirements, in the EU the leverage ratio 
is determined as the ratio of a bank’s regula -
tory tier 1 capital (numerator) and its total ex -FRTB applica -

posure measure essentially comprising all bal -
ance sheet and off- balance- sheet items (de -
nominator). The leverage ratio, which currently 
only has to be reported to the supervisory 
authorities  and disclosed publicly, will become 
a binding minimum requirement in the EU – a 
bank will have to have a leverage ratio of at 
least 3% in future.
If the supervisory authority considers the lever -
age ratio minimum requirement insufficient to 
address the institution- specific risk of excessive 
leverage, the authority can impose an add -
itional leverage ratio requirement under the 
new CRD V rules.
In addition to the leverage ratio minimum re -
quirement and, if applicable, the additional le -
verage ratio requirement, a bank classified as a 
global systemically important institution (G-  SII) 
will be required to hold an additional leverage 
ratio buffer in future. This buffer amounts to 
50% of the risk- based G-  SII capital buffer. The 
leverage ratio buffer is designed to account for 
the greater risks to financial stability emanating 
from G-  SIIs. If a G-  SII does not have enough 
tier 1 capital to maintain its leverage ratio buf -
fer, it will be subject to restrictions on distribu -
tion and must submit a capital conservation 
plan to supervisors.
While the calculation method for the leverage 
ratio is broadly consistent with the Basel frame -
work, implementation in Europe deviates from 
the Basel regime by including a large number 
of specific exemptions for certain types of busi -
ness and business models. Examples are the 
non- inclusion of specific export financing trans -
actions and of pass- through promotional loans, 
as well as reduced requirements for building 
and loan associations.
All changes to the European leverage ratio 
framework deriving from CRR II as well as the 
new minimum requirement are to be applied 
for the first time two years after CRR II enters 
into force. Only the additional leverage ratio 
buffer for G-  SIIs will be introduced in line with Introduction of

Mandates have been put in place for 
the European Banking Authority (EBA) 
and the European Commission to revise 
the EU’s framework on the leverage 
ratio (LR).
In this context, the EBA has been tasked 
with adjusting the technical standards 
for reporting and disclosing the LR. A 
key focus will be on exposures particu-
larly vulnerable to what is known as 
window dressing, which in this case in-
volves banks changing their business ac-
tivities as at the reporting and disclosure 
dates in order to report improved pru-
dential metrics. It has therefore already 
been decided that large banks will in fu-
ture have to calculate such exposures 
more frequently than at the three- 
month intervals currently stipulated.
In addition, the European Commission 
has to assess by 31  December 2020 
whether the LR buffer requirement 
should also be introduced for other sys-
temically important institutions.Deutsche Bundesbank

Net stable funding ratio
The net stable funding ratio (NSFR) establishes 
as a minimum standard the existing general re -
quirement10 for an adequate level of stable 
funding, which was initially implemented in the 
CRR purely as a reporting obligation. The NSFR 
rules published by the Basel Committee in Oc -
tober 2014 are thus transposed into EU law.
The NSFR complements the liquidity coverage 
requirement (LCR) applied in the EU since Octo -
ber 2015 to ensure short- term ability to pay, 
adding the requirement for a stable match be -
tween the maturity structures of assets and li -
abilities over the longer term. Accordingly, the 
sum of available stable funding (liabilities) must 
at least match the sum of required stable fund -
ing (assets).11 The NSFR is based on a time hori -
zon of one year,12 meaning that liabilities with 
longer residual maturities are classed as “avail -
able stable funding” and assets where liquidity 
is tied up for a longer period as “required stable 
funding”.
The NSFR’s objective is to avoid excessive ma -
turity mismatches between assets and liabilities 
and dependence on short- term funding. The 
intention is to limit the risk of the funding basis 
eroding in longer stress situations due to exces -
sive outflows.
The implementation of the NSFR took on the 
EU- specific elements of the LCR (e.g. the defin -
ition and weighting of liquid assets). Addition -
ally, there are selected deviations from the Ba -
sel rules regarding calibration13 and a number 
of specific provisions on certain instruments.14 
On the one hand, these deviations take into ac -
count European specificities, and on the other, 
where the relevant rules are transitional or sub -
ject to a review clause, they are intended to 
give institutions sufficient time to adapt to the 
Basel calibration, which is considered to be very strict. In keeping with this, the European 
NSFR is calibrated less conservatively on the 
whole to begin with.
In the interest of proportionate regulation, an -
other special feature in the EU is the option of 
allowing small, non- complex institutions to 
apply an alternative simplified NSFR in future. 
The simplified NSFR’s main objective is to re -
duce the work that goes into generating the 
data needed for the NSFR reports. This is 
achieved mainly by combining reporting cat -
egories and maturity bands. As a result of the 
recalibration of weighting factors this necessi -
tates in isolated cases, the simplified NSFR is 
stricter than the general NSFR on balance.
Standardised approach 
for counterparty credit risk
Counterparty credit risk (CCR) is the risk that 
the counterparty to a transaction (especially in 
derivatives) could default before the final settle -
ment of the transaction’s cash flows. There are 
currently three standardised approaches to 
measuring the default risk of derivatives trans -
actions for counterparty credit risk: the original 
exposure method, the mark- to- market method 
and the standardised method. Whereas the ori -
ginal exposure method may only be used by 
institutions with a small trading book, nearly all 
German trading book institutions apply the Full implementa -

11 Liabilities and assets are weighted according to their 
long- term availability or liquidity characteristics, taking into 
account the medium- term funding needs from off- balance- 
sheet exposures.
12 A distinction is made between the maturity bands “less 
than six months” and “at least six months and less than 
one year”, particularly on the assets side.
13 In particular, the stable funding requirements for Level 1 
assets and for short- term (i.e. with residual maturities of 
less than six months) exposures to financial customers are 
lowered.

mark- to- market method; the standardised 
method is not used.
CRR II introduces a new standardised approach 
for counterparty credit risk (SA- CCR) to meas -
ure exposure at default, which will replace the 
three existing standardised approaches. The 
Basel Committee developed the SA- CCR to in -
crease the sensitivity of risk measurement and 
to eliminate known deficiencies in the current 
standardised approaches. In particular, margin 
agreements (margining) are taken into account 
for the first time and offset agreements (net -
ting) are given much more adequate attention. 
Moreover, the new approach is applicable to a 
large number of derivatives transactions and is 
simple to implement.
Like the mark-to-market method, the SA- CCR 
uses two components to measure exposure at 
default (see the chart above). The first compon -
ent is the current replacement cost (RC), which 
corresponds to the current positive market 
value of the exposures to a counterparty. The 
second component is the potential future ex -
posure (PFE), which reflects the risk of the con -
tract increasing in value between the default of 
a counterparty and entry into a new contract 
with another counterparty. A lump- sum add- on 
of 40% to cover potentially underestimated risks is applied to the sum of the two compon -
ents.
Here, too, the rules are designed with propor -
tionality in mind. Institutions with a small or 
very small trading book are permitted to use 
simplified variants of the SA- CCR for their cal -
culations, relieving them of the operational 
burden.
Changes to the large 
 exposures regime
The implementation of the Basel framework for 
large exposures results in the following main 
changes. In future, only tier 1 capital can be 
applied as the capital base. This reduces the 
scope to grant large exposures. The previous 
provision, whereby a certain percentage of tier 
2 capital could also be recognised when setting 
large exposure limits (eligible capital), no longer 
applies. Consequently, a large exposure will be 
defined as an exposure to a client or a group of 
connected clients that amounts to 10% or 
more of tier 1 capital (threshold definition for 
large exposures). The limit on large exposures15 
will remain at 25% in future, however, also in SA- CCR takes

relation to the institution’s tier 1 capital. The 
limit on large exposures of G-  SIIs to other G-  SIIs 
will be lowered to 15%. In addition, institutions 
that have applied a credit risk mitigation tech -
nique when calculating capital requirements 
for credit risk must, in future, also apply it when 
calculating an exposure under the large expos -
ure regime.
Further changes
Exception for promotional 
banks
One element of the banking package is that 
certain banks are specifically exempted from the 
scope of application of the CRD V. This includes 
all German legally independent promotional 
banks,16 including the three development banks 
that are directly supervised by the ECB. To date, 
the only German promotional bank to be ex -
empted from the scope of application of the 
CRD was Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW).
When the CRD V enters into force (20 days 
after publication in the Official Journal of the 
European Union, i.e. on 27 June 2019), the ex -
emption for promotional banks from the scope 
of application of the CRD V will become legally 
enforceable. As a consequence, these banks 
will then no longer be CRR credit institutions17 
and will no longer fall under the scope of appli -
cation of the SSM Regulation either. Therefore, 
these German legally independent promotional 
banks named in the CRD V will in future be 
supervised by the Federal Financial Supervisory 
Authority (BaFin) and the Bundesbank on a 
purely national basis. This also applies to the 
three German promotional banks currently still 
under the direct supervision of the ECB. Ac -
cording to Section 1a(1) of the German Bank -
ing Act (Kreditwesengesetz),  the exempted 
promotional banks18 will nonetheless continue 
to be governed by the CRR rules.
However, once they are no longer classified as 
CRR institutions, they will no longer be subject to the scope of application of the SRM Regula -
tion, the Recovery and Resolution Act (Sanie -
rungs- und Abwicklungsgesetz)  and the Re -
structuring Fund Act (Restrukturierungsfonds -
gesetz).
The duty to draw up recovery and resolution 
plans as well as to contribute to the Single 
Resolution Fund (SRF) thus ends. In addition, 
these institutions leave the scope of application 
of the Deposit Guarantee Act (Einlagensiche -
rungsgesetz),  as the latter specifies that only 
CRR credit institutions are subject to the pro -
tection requirement. When the CRD V is imple -
mented, legislators will have to decide whether 
adjustments to German law, in as far as it re -
lates to promotional lending business, should 
be made for the German promotional banks 
that are now exempted.
Changes relating to credit risk
With the CRR II, various rules on determining 
the minimum capital requirements for credit 
risk will be changed. For instance, the 2013 rec -
ommendations of the Basel Committee on cap -
ital requirements for equity investments in 
funds will be transposed into EU law. Accord -
ingly, institutions will, in future, have to deter -
mine capital requirements either by looking 
through to the exposures contained in the fund 
assets or, where this is not possible, based on 
the fund’s investment mandate. Where an in -
stitution lacks the information to do either, a 
risk weight of 1,250% must be applied. An im -
portant novelty is that a fund’s potential lever -
age must be recognised as increasing risk when 
determining capital requirements.All German

In addition, the scope of application of the 
existing supporting factor for exposures to 
small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) will 
be expanded19 and a new supporting factor 
will be introduced for exposures to entities that 
operate or finance physical structures or facil -
ities, systems and networks that provide or 
support essential public services.20 Overall, this 
results in a reduction in prudential capital re -
quirements for the exposures in question. Both 
supporting factors are consequently intended 
to set incentives for expanded lending to these 
areas of the economy. From a banking super -
visory perspective, neither the supporting fac -
tor for SMEs nor that for infrastructure finance 
exposures is unproblematic, as the general re -
duction in capital requirements that their use 
entails does not necessarily also signify that the 
exposures are less likely to default.
Further details relate, for instance, to the rules 
for determining capital requirements for min -
imum payment commitments of institutions for 
guarantee fund products, which are now expli -
citly specified in the CRR. This is necessary in 
order to limit to an appropriate level capital re -
quirements for guarantee commitments on 
equity investments in funds used for old- age 
provision (Riester pension plans). Another nov -
elty relates to the rules for the internal ratings- 
based approach: institutions will, in future, be 
able to disregard in their risk parameter esti -
mates some of the losses incurred in a massive 
disposal of defaulted exposures.
Regulatory own funds
Several changes to the rules defining regulatory 
own funds in the CRR were made. For instance, 
the eligibility criteria of common equity tier 1 
(CET1) instruments were adjusted: going for -
ward, the requirements for CET1 instruments 
will be considered to be met notwithstanding 
an obligation to transfer under a profit and loss 
transfer agreement, provided certain criteria 
are satisfied. For example, the parent undertak -
ing in question must own 90% or more of the voting rights and capital of the subsidiary; in 
addition, the parent undertaking and the sub -
sidiary must be located in the same Member 
State. Moreover, the profit and loss transfer 
agreement must have been concluded for tax -
ation purposes and institutions must have dis -
cretion to strengthen their CET1 capital by allo -
cating profits to reserves before making a pay -
ment to the parent undertaking.
The definition of “available distributable items” 
is adjusted such that all reserves formed under 
national legislation (in Germany, pursuant to 
the German Commercial Code  (Handelsgesetz -
buch)  and relevant company law)21 are de facto 
available to the institution for distribution to 
additional tier 1 (AT1) capital.22 This was previ -
ously not the case.
Finally, a new exemption is included in terms of 
the assets that need to be deducted from own 
funds. In future, prudently valued software 
assets, which in the past have had to be de -
ducted from CET1 capital like all intangible 
assets, will be exempt from deduction. Pre -
cisely what software will be included and what 
concrete conditions will have to be met is yet 
to be defined by the European Banking Author -
ity (EBA) in a technical standard.

above this amount.
20 For infrastructure finance exposures that meet the cata -

tutions may apply a supporting factor of 0.75.

based on it. There is now a clear separation of 
bank- specific supervisory measures and the 
macroprudential capital buffers. In future, it 
will no longer be permissible for the capital 
add- ons resulting from the SREP to include 
components to cover systemic risks; the latter 
are to be addressed using macroprudential 
measures only. In addition, guidelines are put in 
place for determining bank- specific capital add- 
ons (Pillar 2 requirement, or P2R) in order to 
further harmonise EU administrative practice.
Going forward, the minimum requirements for 
credit quality under Pillar 1 are to apply to cap -
ital add- ons. That means that at least 56.25% 
of the requirement must generally be met with 
CET1 capital and at least 75% with tier 1 cap -
ital. The supervisory authority must give rea -
sons if it demands a more conservative capital 
composition.
Supervisors will also be given the opportunity 
to issue bank- specific recommendations to 
hold additional capital (Pillar 2 guidance, or 
P2G). This higher level of own funds should 
allow institutions to cover losses incurred dur -
ing stress periods without breaching prudential 
minimum capital requirements, consisting of 
Pillar 1 capital requirements and the capital 
add- ons (P2R). The results of supervisory stress 
tests are to be used to determine this recom -
mendation.
In addition, the stacking order of the various 
capital requirements is also described. Accord -
ing to this, the own funds that institutions are 
required to hold must be used as follows to 
cover any losses as a result of risk materialising. 
Initially, the additional own funds held based 
on a supervisory recommendation (P2G) are to 
be used, then capital buffers such as the capital 
conservation buffer and the macroprudential 
capital buffers. Further losses are to be covered 
by additional capital requirements (P2R) and, 
finally  , by the minimum capital requirements 
under Pillar 1.In terms of interest rate risk in the banking 
book, another step towards implementing the 
Basel Committee’s 2016 rules was made fol -
lowing the EBA Guidelines published in 2018. 
The EBA will receive mandates to develop tech -
nical standards involving, amongst other things, 
developing a standardised method to calculate 
interest rate risk based on the economic value 
of equity. This method can be used by institu -
tions or mandated by supervisory authorities if 
the internal procedures are not satisfactory. 
However, the Bundesbank believes that the use 
of institutions’ established internal systems 
should remain the norm.
The current indicator for elevated interest rate 
risk (decline in economic value of more than 
20% of own funds) is being tightened. Going 
forward, both a decline in the economic value 
of equity of more than 15% in one of six super -
visory interest rate shock scenarios and a sharp 
drop in net interest income in one of two of 
these scenarios will be considered indicators of 
elevated interest rate risk.Separation of

New requirement to set up 
intermediate parent under­
takings
A new requirement is introduced for third-  
country banking groups that have at least two 
subsidiaries established in the EU and whose 
assets within the EU exceed a threshold of €40 
billion: they must set up an intermediate parent 
undertaking (IPU) in the EU for the EU subsid -
iaries. This requirement means that all activities 
of subsidiaries established in the EU must be 
supervised on a consolidated basis under this 
EU parent. The objective here is to make it eas -
ier to supervise third- country banking groups in 
the EU and to resolve their EU activities. In spe -
cial cases, supervisors may allow structures 
with two intermediate EU parent undertak -
ings.23
Project of an integrated 
 reporting system
Reporting requirements for credit institutions 
derive from the respective prudential or statis -
tical data collection purposes and are, to date, 
issued by the respective regulators independ -
ently of one another. This has meant that data 
for different reporting purposes were, in some 
cases, collected twice, as there were instances 
of parallel reporting methods and contents de -
veloping over time. Against this backdrop, the 
European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and 
the EBA are currently working on initiatives for 
an integrated European reporting system, in 
which existing reporting formats are to be re -
placed by granular reports that can be used to 
fulfil various reporting purposes.
In a first step, the EBA is to draw up a feasibility 
study for an integrated reporting system that 
encompasses both prudential and statistical re -
porting requirements as well as the reporting 
requirements of the resolution authorities.Review of the macroprudential 
rules
Macroprudential instruments will, in future, be 
separated more clearly from microprudential 
powers. In addition, overlaps between the 
macroprudential buffers are to be eliminated. 
There are now no overlaps between the areas 
in which the systemic risk buffer can be used 
and those where the capital buffers for system -
ically important institutions (O-  SII/ G- SII buf -
fers)24 are deployed. These capital buffers will 
therefore have to be used additively, going for -
ward. As of a cumulative buffer rate of 5%, ap -
proval by the European Commission is neces -
sary. Moreover, the scope of application of the 
systemic risk buffer was expanded and ren -
dered more flexible, meaning that it can ad -
dress all systemic risks that are not already 
covered by the capital buffers for systemically 
important institutions, the countercyclical cap -
ital buffer or CRR measures.25 It is now expli -
citly intended that it should, in future, also be 
used for sectoral exposures and subsets of 
these exposure categories, thus allowing sec -
toral risks to be addressed in a more targeted 
manner. The option of using several systemic 
risk buffers for different exposures at the same 
time increases the tool’s flexibility.
The cap on the O-  SII buffer rate of 2% has 
been lifted. As of a buffer rate of 3%, however, 
approval by the European Commission is ne -
cessary. National authorities have more leeway 
when determining the O-  SII buffers than with 
the G-  SII buffer. This tool is therefore currently 
used in very different ways within Europe. The 
EBA will consequently receive a mandate to as -New require -

Investment fi  rms
Alongside the banking package, a new 
European- level supervisory regime for in-
vestment fi  rms (IFs) within the meaning of 
MiFID II1 is also being drawn up. This new 
package seeks to create a simpler and more 
suitable set of rules for these institutions 
(securities trading banks and fi  nancial ser-
vices institutions within the meaning of the 
German Banking Act),2 and its main object-
ive is to take the specifi  c business models of 
this very heterogeneous group of institu-
tions into account. Once the new supervis-
ory regime has been introduced, these IFs 
are to be divided into three groups, with 
specifi  c supervisory requirements applying 
to each group. For instance, IFs whose busi-
ness activities give them a risk profi  le similar 
to that of credit institutions will, in future, 
be categorised as CRR3 credit institutions 
and supervised on the basis of CRR II if their 
business reaches a certain volume. This cat-
egory will include IFs that engage in own- 
account trading and in underwriting. As 
from a business volume threshold of €30 
billion, IFs are to be supervised by the ECB 
under the SSM.4 In this way, adequate con-
sideration is to be given to the systemic im-
portance of these institutions, which quite 
commonly are parts of large international 
fi  nancial corporations (class 1). All the other 
IFs will be supervised outside the sphere of 
application of the SSM Regulation by the 
respective national supervisory bodies, 
based on a specifi  c, newly developed super-
visory regime where the calculation of an 
institution’s capital requirements is geared 
to its business model (class 2). Additional 
exemptions are envisaged in the case of IFs 
with only a limited business volume or busi-
ness model (class 3). This new supervisory 
regime for class 2 and class 3 IFs consists of 
several elements, the most important one 
being the calculation of proportionate cap-ital requirements on the basis of each IF’s 
business model and business volume. For 
example, capital requirements will be calcu-
lated according to the volume of customer

sess, by the end of 2020, what form a potential 
harmonisation might take.
In terms of the method used to identify G-  SIIs, 
the EU will in future deviate from the inter -
national standard. It will introduce an alterna -
tive way to calculate the G-  SII buffer, in which 
transactions within the euro area are treated as 
domestic transactions and thus not considered. 
This deviation from the international standard 
is at odds with its objective of securing a global 
level playing field and is therefore to be viewed 
critically.
Proportionality
Ever since the European Commission unveiled 
its draft CRR II in November 2016, the Bundes -
bank has been comprehensively looking into 
ways of minimising the regulatory burdens on 
small credit institutions without impairing their 
solvency and soundness. A look at the struc -
ture of Germany’s banking sector serves to 
drive home the relevance of this question. 
There are nearly 1,500 smaller institutions in 
Germany, making up around 40% of all such 
institutions in the euro area.
It is therefore a welcome development that the 
principle of proportionality has been taken into 
account at the EU level in the banking package. 
Article 4 CRR has been amended to include the 
category of “small and non- complex institu -
tions”, to which the following criteria apply:
– the institution is not large;26
– the value of its total assets is, on average, 
equal to or less than €5 billion over a four- 
year period;27
– the institution is not subject to any obliga -
tions, or is subject to simplified obligations, 
in relation to recovery and resolution plan -
ning;– the institution has only a small trading book 
and low derivatives business;
– more than 75% of both the institution’s 
consolidated total assets and liabilities relate 
to activities conducted within the EEA;
– the institution does not use internal 
models.28
Moreover, supervisors and the institution both 
have an opt- out clause, i.e. the option to de -
cide that the institution shall not be classified 
as a “small, non- complex institution”.
The principle of proportionality29 is deepened 
in supervisory reporting, in particular. In this 
context, the EBA has been tasked with con -
ducting a cost-  benefit analysis of the current 
European supervisory reporting system, par -
ticularly as it relates to small and non- complex 
institutions. The EBA has a deadline of 12 
months after CRR II enters into force to present 
a report and recommendations on how report -
ing requirements can be simplified, at least for 
small, non- complex institutions. The desired 
objective is to reduce reporting costs by, on 
average, at least 10%, but ideally by 20%. 
Within these parameters, and ensuring that 
supervision remains effective, it is being ana -
lysed, in particular, whether certain reporting 
requirements can be waived below certain 
thresholds and whether the frequency of re -
ports can be reduced for small and non-  
complex institutions. Competent authorities 
will also be empowered to waive the require -
ment for supervisory reports provided the rele -Article 4 CRR 
amended to 
include new 
 definition of a 
“small and 
 non-complex 
institution”Taking greater 
account of 
 proportionality 
in prudential 
reporting
26 Article 4 CRR has also been amended to include a def -
inition of a “large institution”. An institution is deemed 
“large” if it is systemically important, if it is one of the three 
largest institutions in its Member State, or if the total value 
of its assets is equal to or greater than €30 billion.
27 A Member State is permitted to reduce this threshold.
28 This does not apply to subsidiaries using internal models 
developed at the group level and if the group is subject to 
the disclosure requirements for large institutions.
29 The scope and frequency of reporting hinge crucially on 
the complexity of the approaches used to measure own 
funds requirements and on certain thresholds being ex -
ceeded. An inherent proportionality therefore already 
exists.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

vant data points are already available else -
where. In addition, the exchange of data be -
tween the various authorities should be en -
abled to the greatest possible extent.
Disclosure is an additional focal point of pro -
portionality. Since the purpose of disclosure re -
quirements is to strengthen market discipline, 
they are relevant to large, capital market-  
oriented institutions, in particular.
The disclosure requirements will therefore in fu -
ture be graduated according to banks’ size and 
capital market orientation;30 the relief will cover 
both the frequency and scope of disclosures. 
Whereas large, capital market- oriented institu -
tions will have to meet all disclosure require -
ments, all other banks will have reduced re -
quirements. For small, non- complex and non-  
capital market- oriented institutions, the re -
quirements will be reduced to the annual 
disclosure of a very few regulatory “key met -
rics”, such as information on the applicable ac -
counting standard, capital ratios, risk- weighted 
assets (RWAs) and capital buffers.
New legislation in the area 
of bank resolution
One key element of the revision of EU bank 
resolution legislation is the implementation of 
globally agreed rules and the need to align 
existing rules as a consequence. In 2015, the 
FSB published its TLAC standard, which is now 
being transposed into European law. The TLAC 
standard is applicable only to G-  SIIs and re -
quires them to hold a sufficient amount of 
liabilitie s that can be written down or con -
verted into liable capital in the event of a reso -
lution. The purpose is to enable a systemically 
important bank to be resolved without resort -
ing to public funds (bail- out). As the TLAC 
standard was being published, European legis -
lators had, as part of the BRRD, already intro -
duced a similar requirement – the minimum 
requirement for own funds and eligible liabil -
ities (MREL).31 The purpose of this requirement is likewise to force banks to maintain a min -
imum volume of bail- inable liabilities. MREL, 
however, was designed for all European banks 
irrespective of their size or systemic import -
ance. The requirement also has to be set specif -
ically for each institution by the resolution au -
thority, without a default statutory minimum 
requirement. European resolution legislation 
has now been amended to align these two re -
quirements.
Implementation of a minimum 
MREL requirement and intro ­
duction of a new category: 
“top­ tier” banks
Consistent with the TLAC standard, a minimum 
MREL requirement for G-  SIIs will be introduced 
and calibrated at the same level as intended in 
the TLAC standard. The calibration parameters 
are thus based on two variables: a risk- based 
ratio based on risk-weighted assets (RWAs), 
and the non-  risk- based ratio based on the le -
verage ratio exposure (LRE), which represents a 
hard floor. It will be introduced once the bank -
ing package enters into force: the requirements 
will be gradually increased in two stages (see 
the table on p. 44).
Moreover, European legislators have also de -
cided to enlarge the group of banks for which 
a statutory minimum requirement is applicable 
beyond G-  SIIs. The BRRD II (and SRM Regula -
tion II) accordingly created a new category 
known as “top- tier” banks. These comprise 
non- G- SIIs with total assets in excess of €100 
billion. Institutions not meeting this criterion 
can still, under certain conditions, be classified 
by the resolution authority as a top-  tier bank Proportionality

(fishing option)32 if they are considered by the 
resolution authority33 as being likely to pose a 
systemic risk in the event of failure.
A European specificity is the additional intro -
duction of a minimum requirement of 8% of 
total liabilities and own funds (TLOF) applicable 
to G-  SIIs and top- tier banks as from 2024. This 
is not contained in the TLAC requirements. The 
rationale to this is that, according to the rules 
of the European resolution framework, use of 
resources from the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) 
is generally permissible only if shareholders and 
creditors have contributed an amount equiva -
lent to at least 8% of the institution’s TLOF. This 
additional requirement ensures that large, sys -
temically important banks (are able to) fulfil the 
requirements for accessing the SRF, thereby im -
proving the ability of banks to be resolved and 
consequently the functional viability and thus 
the credibility of the resolution regime. The 
highest of the three requirements described above (RWA, LRE and TLOF) ultimately exerts 
binding force on the institution.
As a general rule, the resolution authority de -
termines an institution-  specific MREL for all 
European banks. This means that the resolution 
authority also has the option of imposing on 
G- SIIs and top- tier banks institution- specific re -
quirements that exceed the existing statutory 
minimum requirements. For all non- G- SIIs and 
non- top- tier banks, there will be (as before) no 
statutory minimum MREL requirement.8% of TLOF

32 As regards the top- tier banks for which the fishing op -
tion has been exercised, the provisions in BRRD II and the 
SRM Regulation II differ in that, under BRRD II, the reso -
lution authority, after consultation with the supervisory au -
thority, can determine whether the minimum requirements 
for top- tier banks can be applied to an institution with total 
assets of less than €100 billion, whereas under the SRM 
Regulation II it is the Single Resolution Board (SRB), upon a 
request from the national resolution authority, which clas -
sifies a bank as a top- tier bank.

Creditor protection
Rules protecting retail investors
Over the past years, crisis situations in the 
European Union have shown that including 
retail investors in loss absorption can be an 
impediment to the application of the bail- in 
tool. Thus, the BRRD II1 provides for certain 
protection requirements with respect to re-
tail investors who wish to invest in MREL2- 
eligible instruments. For example, Member 
States can, inter alia, decide to set a min-
imum denomination amount of €50,000 
for the sale of subordinated liabilities.
New creditor hierarchy in bail­ in 
 procedure
The partial amendments to the creditor 
hierarchy were also part of the banking 
package, but had already been published in the Offi   cial Journal of the European Union 
at the end of 2017 in a directive amending 
the BRRD.3 As a number of Member States 
had adopted different national approaches 
to creating the new class of non- preferred 
senior debt, which is subordinated to other 
debt (ordinary senior debt), EU legislators 
deemed it necessary to amend the Euro-
pean legislation.4 They followed the French 
approach in establishing the concept of 
contractual subordination for the new class 
of debt. According to this, non- preferred 
senior debt must meet the following condi-
tions:

– The initial contractual maturity of the 
debt instruments is of at least one year;
– The debt instruments do not contain em-
bedded derivatives and are not deriva-
tives themselves;
– The contractual documentation explicitly 
refers to the lower ranking.
With effect from 21 July 2018, Section 46 f 
(5) to (7) of the German Banking Act5 was 
amended accordingly to implement this 
amending directive. In line with the amend-
ing directive, grandfathering arrangements 
are in place for outstanding German bank 
bonds with statutory subordination under 
the previous rules6 (see the chart on p. 45).
Excursus: Common backstop
A common backstop for the Single Reso-
lution Fund (SRF) was already decided upon 
in December 2013 by the ministers of the 
Eurogroup and ECOFIN. The common back-
stop aims to increase the effectiveness of 
the SRF, amongst other things by facilitating 
borrowing for the SRF and thus ensuring its 
viability.
In December 2018, the Eurogroup agreed 
that the European Stability Mechanism 
(ESM) should provide the common back-
stop for the SRF. This agreement entails 
conditions for a possible early introduction 
of the common backstop, with risk reduc-
tion in the banking sector (including with 
regard to NPLs) playing a key role here. 
Early introduction of the backstop can be 
considered provided that suffi   cient progress 
has been made in risk reduction, which is to 
be assessed in 2020.7
The ESM provides the common backstop in 
the form of a revolving credit line to the 
SRF. It is also intended to replace the ESM direct recapitalisation instrument. The size 
of the common backstop is to be capped at 
the size of the SRF (at least 1% of covered 
deposits; currently estimated at roughly €65 
billion). A political agreement was also 
reached clarifying the principle of fi  scal neu-
trality over the medium term. The repay-
ment of public funds is to be made via 
extraordinary ex post contributions from 
the banking sector within three years, with 
a potential extension of up to two years.
In principle, the creation of a common 
backstop for the SRF is to be welcomed. 
However, any early introduction should be 
contingent on a suffi   cient level of risk re-
duction being achieved. This should be 
carefully assessed in order to prevent the 
mutualisation of legacy risks.

7 The assessment is to examine (at a minimum) the 
build- up of MREL in relation to the 2024 targets and 
the trend in the reduction of non- performing loans 
(NPLs) (aim: 5% gross NPLs or 2.5% net NPLs and ad-
equate provisioning) for all SRB banks.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

With regard to institutions subject to regular in -
solvency proceedings (owing to the absence of 
public interest in resolution), the resolution au -
thority can set MREL at the level of the loss ab -
sorption amount, i.e. the prudential minimum 
capital requirement.34
Amendments to the existing 
rules for setting MREL
The revision of the BRRD will also entail more 
specific rules for setting MREL. MREL consists 
of a loss absorption amount and a recapitalisa -
tion amount, both of which are calibrated on 
the basis of RWAs and LRE. Thus, both a risk-  
based ratio and a non- risk- based ratio variable 
are taken into account for the calibration of 
MREL. Such calibration rules were previously lo -
cated in the delegated regulation on MREL.35 
They will now be amended and prospectively 
transferred to the BRRD.
For the calibration of MREL based on RWAs, 
both the loss absorption amount and the re -
capitalisation amount components are based 
on own funds requirements (i.e. Pillar 1 and Pil -
lar 2 capital requirements). Above and beyond 
this amount, the resolution authority can im -
pose an additional buffer (market confidence 
buffer)36 to absorb potential additional losses 
or restore market confidence.
For calibrating MREL on the basis of the LRE, 
the loss absorption amount and the recapital -
isation amount will each be subject to a re -
quirement of 3% of LRE, or a total of 6% of 
LRE. The LRE- based MREL does not include a 
market confidence buffer.
When setting an institution-  specific MREL, the 
resolution authority can take into account not 
only the two above- mentioned metrics but also 
the 8% TLOF requirement,37 thereby ensuring a 
level of MREL that might allow access to the 
SRF which could potentially be necessary in a 
resolution case.Subordination38
One significant element of the TLAC require -
ments is what is known as the subordination 
criterion. Alongside an institution’s own funds, 
only those liabilities which are junior to certain 
other liabilities (e.g. deposits, derivatives) are 
eligible. Exceptions are permitted only under 
certain conditions.39 Given that the TLAC stand -
ard applies only to G-  SIIs, the negotiations sur -
rounding the banking package raised the ques -
tion as to whether – and if so, to what extent – 
a binding subordination criterion should be 
introduced for all banks.
On balance, a distinction will be made in future 
between the above categories. G-  SIIs and top- 
tier banks will be generally required to use sub -
ordinated instruments to meet the future 
MREL. For all other banks the resolution au -
thority will decide the amount up to which the 
institution- specific MREL will have to be met 
using subordinated capital (i.e. own funds and 
subordinated, MREL- eligible liabilities).40 That RWA calibration:

36 The market confidence buffer is defined as the amount 
of the combined buffer requirement less the countercycli -
cal capital buffer. In the EU, the combined buffer require -
ment can consist of the following buffers: capital conserva -
tion buffer, countercyclical capital buffer, buffer for global 
or other systemically important institutions and systemic 
risk buffer.
37 Use of the SRF is fundamentally conditional on the ini -
tial bail- in of 8% of TLOF for loss absorption and recapital -
isation purposes.
38 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2016).
39 Thus, pursuant to Article 72b(3) CRR II read in conjunc -
tion with Article 494(2) CRR II, G-  SIIs would be permitted 
to include liabilities which meet all criteria other than that 
of subordination up to 2.5% (or, as from 2022, 3.5% of 
RWAs) as MREL instruments. In addition, the “de minimis” 
exception provided for in the TLAC standard has been im -
plemented in Article 72b(4) CRR II; here, the subordination 
criterion is not mandatory provided liabilities excluded as 
“eligible liabilities” within the meaning of Article 72a(2) 
CRR II which are pari passu or junior to “eligible liabilities ” 
make up less than 5% of the institution’s total own funds 
and eligible liabilities (TLOF). This means that, if the amount 
of excluded eligible liabilities that rank pari passu with eli -
gible instruments is limited, an exemption to the subordin -
ation requirement can be made.
40 This discretionary scope will depend to a material de -
gree on the risk of a breach of the “no creditor worse off” 
principle (i.e. a creditor must not be worse off under a 
resolution procedure than in insolvency proceedings).Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

will also be the case for the institution- specific 
requirements for G-  SIIs and top- tier banks in 
excess of the mandatory minimum require -
ments. However, the resolution authorities’ dis -
cretionary scope will be capped.
Outlook
The entry into force of the EU banking package 
represents by no means the end of the process 
of revising European banking regulation. In 
fact, the European Commission has already 
launched work on CRR III and CRD VI. The 
elements of the Basel III reform package41 
adopted in December 2017 by the Basel Com -
mittee on Banking Supervision are to be trans -
posed into European legislation. These include 
the new approaches to calculating RWAs and 
thus capital requirements for credit risk (credit 
risk standardised approach and internal ratings- 
based approaches), the abolition of the use of 
the models- based approach to calculate oper -
ational risk and the remaining new standard -
ised approach, the floor for capital require -
ments (output floor) of 72.5% for institutions 
which use internal models to calculate their 
risk, and the revised procedure for calculating 
credit valuation adjustments (CVAs) in deriva -
tives business.In order to prepare a relevant legislative pro -
posal, in May 2018 the European Commission 
tasked the EBA with assessing the impact of 
the Basel reform package on the European 
banking industry and real economy and explor -
ing potential regulatory options for transposing 
Basel III into EU law. On the basis of the EBA 
report, the European Commission will prepare 
a legislative proposal to amend the CRR. This 
proposal will probably be submitted in the first 
half of 2020.
Mitigating existing risks on the balance sheets 
of European banks and completing the banking 
union remain elements of the effort in Europe 
to deal with the effects of the financial crisis. 
However, the banking package is just one of 
the components of appropriate risk mitigation 
being called for. Harmonisation of insolvency 
legislation and regulation of sovereign risk ex -
posures, which had been left out of the final -
isation of Basel III, are still unresolved. In add -
ition, it is important to deliver genuine progress 
in reducing NPL ratios and building up bail- in 
buffers.Preliminary work

Payment services in transition: instant 
 payments, PSD2 and new competitors
Technological innovations, regulatory adjustments and the increasing digitalisation of daily life 
have permanently altered the payments landscape in Europe, and will continue to shape it in 
future. Technical capabilities for initiating and processing payments digitally have evolved at a 
rapid pace in the past few years. With smartphones playing an increasingly central role in trade 
with goods and services, the aim is to seamlessly integrate the act of payment into the purchase 
process (one- click payments). Smartphones have been a catalyst for the new business models 
developed and rolled out by a growing number of providers, who are capitalising on the use of 
data analytics, new means of accessing payment accounts and the introduction of instant pay -
ments. Fintech and bigtech companies, which both compete and cooperate with incumbents in 
the market for payment services, have attracted particular attention in this regard. These devel -
opments are putting traditional structures and existing economic principles in the area of pay -
ments to the test.
While these new developments generate efficiency gains and create a richer user experience, they 
also result in greater technical complexity and a tendency to operate increasingly within individ -
ual ecosystems. This could potentially lead to certain online platforms dominating the market, 
raising questions on matters of competition policy, for instance.
In Europe, payment solutions have traditionally evolved along national borders, while global 
players have tended to think and act internationally. This has given them an initial edge in Europe , 
too. The challenge for European payment service providers, then, is to create effective pan-  
European payment solutions to rival those offered by their increasingly successful global competi -
tors.
The structural change shaping European payment systems also poses new challenges to central 
banks, supervisory bodies and legislators. If a larger share of payment transactions shifts to inter -
national providers, and value and process chains fragment across national borders, there may be 
repercussions for supervisory mandates as well as implications under competition and data pro -
tection law.Deutsche Bundesbank

How technological develop ­
ments shape payment habits
The way in which people and businesses pay 
for goods and services has changed substan -
tially over the last few years. Various different 
factors are responsible for this (see the chart on 
p. 53), but technological advances have played 
a particularly important role.
First, near- field communication (NFC) technol -
ogy, which makes contactless payments by 
card and smartphone possible, has become 
widespread. Around 55 million of the 100 mil -
lion “girocard” debit cards issued in Germany 
now support contactless payments based on 
NFC technology (as at end-2018),1 not count -
ing the contactless debit cards offered by inter -
national card schemes and credit cards. Indeed, 
all the new credit cards issued in Germany 
since 2017 have been contactless- capable. 
Amongst accepting parties, more than 620,000 
of the 840,000 terminals set up in-  store are 
equipped to process contactless girocard pay -
ments (as at end-2018).2 In December 2018, 
almost 16% of all girocard transactions were 
already contactless.3
Second, new online payment solutions are 
evolving in response to increasing levels of e-  
commerce. This sector is accounting for an 
ever larger share of sales, making up 10.2% of 
all retail sales in 2018.4 Added to this is the 
growth in online sales in the services sector,5 
though the boundaries between digital goods 
and services are becoming ever more blurred.6 
Online purchases are often paid for via special -
ised e-commerce schemes.7
Third, the widespread use of smartphones8 and 
mobile internet is having a transformative ef -
fect on purchasing habits. This is boosting the 
trend towards developing new and innovative 
payment solutions for use both at the point of 
sale (POS) and in mobile commerce (m-  
commerce),9 which also includes in- app pur -
chases.10 M- commerce is a driving force behind 
the ongoing integration of payment methods into smartphones, either via payment cards 
stored digitally in an app, direct debit mandates 
or payment methods integrated into digital 
ecosystems (e.g. platform solutions for e-  
commerce or mobility services),11 which are 
also accepted as a means of payment by third 
parties, in some cases. In m- commerce, con -
sumers prefer to use payment channels that are 
preconfigured, stored on their device and easy 
to use for reasons of convenience. This can cre -
ate lock- in effects in the field of payment solu -
tions, with consumers turning a blind eye to 
potentially  better rivals.
Smartphones increasingly look set to also be -
come a key device for payments, not least be -
cause they are an ubiquitous feature of day- to- 
day life. Today’s mobile payment solutions still 
do not play much of a role at the POS – they 
do not appear to offer sufficient benefits (e.g. 
the integration of voucher schemes or cus -
tomer loyalty programmes) compared with the 
classic means of payment, plus the tried- and- 
tested traditional payment card has made sub -
stantial gains in terms of convenience and 
speed now that it is equipped with the contact -

7 Specialised e- commerce schemes include PayPal, Sofort -

pers who participated in the Deutsche Bundesbank’s 2017 
study on payment behaviour in Germany, 58% reported 
that they use e- commerce schemes to pay for their pur -
chases.

10 In some apps, additional content or services can be pur -
chased, e.g. the user can pay to unlock further features 
within a free app. Such transactions are known as in- app 
purchases.

banking business, too.12 These apps can also 
be used to initiate peer- to- peer (P2P) payments 
to friends or family members, simply by select -
ing a payee based on that person’s telephone 
number (which is linked to their IBAN in a data -
base) from the smartphone’s list of contacts.
On top of this, technological leaps have been 
made in biometrics, in the Internet of Things 
(IoT) and with virtual assistants, and will be a 
further catalyst for change in terms of payment 
habits. Virtual assistants can now be found in 
ever more households and cars and all smart -
phones. In theory, it is possible to use a virtual 
assistant to initiate payments by voice com -
mand, then authorise them by providing a fur -
ther biometric characteristic13 such as a finger -
print, though iris or facial recognition would 
also be possible.14 Biometrics are a simple- to- 
use authorisation method which could render 
passwords and also single- use transaction 
codes obsolete. Biometric identification is also 
gaining ground amidst increasing security re -
quirements for payment transactions, necessi -
tated, inter alia, by the standards established 
by the revised Payment Services Directive 
(PSD2). If payment solutions were to be directly 
incorporated into IoT processes and virtual as -
sistants, this would probably exacerbate lock- in 
effects still further, as it is primarily the precon -figured payment solutions already stored in 
such applications that are likely to be used.
These developments have already helped accel -
erate the decline of cash payments;15 indeed, 
in 2018, the share of sales paid for in cash sank 
below that of card payments for the first time.16 
Two factors are driving this trend. First, digitali -
sation is creating ever more payment scenarios 
in which only cashless payment instruments are 
permitted. Second, there have been improve -
ments in the accessibility of payment solutions 
and the devices used for settling payments. 
Germany’s widely used girocard, for instance, 
has become far more attractive still since a con -
tactless function was added.

chiefly influenced the way in which payments … biometrics,

are initiated. But there has not been any funda -
mental change over the past few years in the 
manner in which the underlying payment in -
struments (credit transfer, direct debit and card 
payment) are processed, nor in the actors, 
intermediaries and infrastructures involved in 
settlement. Yet the field of payment innov -
ations is now occupied not just by the estab -
lished financial sector incumbents but also, to 
an increasing extent, by new players with a 
stronger technological focus, with the result 
that the market environment for payments is 
undergoing significant change.
New competitors in the field 
of payments
The advent of innovative technologies is trans -
forming the competitive environment in the 
field of payments, with inventive up- and- 
coming providers of technology- enabled finan -
cial innovations, known as fintech companies, 
busy devising new digital payment services. 
While the last few years have witnessed steady 
growth in the number of German fintech com -
panies operating in Germany,17 merger and ac -
quisition (M&A) activity now suggests that 
there is a trend towards market consolidation.18 
The firms engaged in M&A activity are often 
looking to expand their own range of services 
and broaden their target customer groups. 
Clearly, tapping into economies of scale and 
scope is no less important for fintech firms 
hoping to prevail in the market for financial 
and payment services. This trend is also evident 
on the financing side – in recent years, invest -
ors in fintech companies have been focusing 
increasingly on the small number of promising 
enterprises, turning a blind eye, for the most 
part, to the vast majority of start- ups.19
Aside from fintech players, global tech com -
panies, predominantly from the United States 
and China, are starting to show interest in the 
provision of payment services in Europe (see 
the table on p. 55). These companies are pri -
marily tech firms, often referred to as bigtechs, that have grown to become market heavy -
weights on the back of digital business models 
in e- commerce, search engine business or so -
cial media platforms, to name but three. They 
act as platform providers, uniting various ser -
vices on a single platform in order to create 
platform- based ecosystems. In entering the 
European market, bigtech players which offer 
payment services requiring authorisation can 
benefit, once approved, from factors including 
European passporting20 and the specific mech -
anisms and economics of payments markets.
They can benefit above all from the two- sided 
nature of the market, which is generally a given 
when it comes to payment services. Bigtech 
firms already come equipped with critical mass 
on the demand side in terms of both customers 
and retailers,21 which makes their platform or 
service attractive to more customers and retail -
ers still.
Aside from this, large platforms can capitalise 
on their broad user bases, capital strength and 
profitability to quickly carve out a share of new 
adjacent lines of business, enabling them to le -
verage economies of scale and scope. One 
major e- commerce marketplace has a wealth 
of information on the behaviour of traders and 
consumers that use its platform, meaning that 
it is well placed to provide them with credit fa -
cilities, for instance.

conditions, access rights and rights of use22 of 
and for third parties, besides establishing its 
own data processing standards.
In addition, these ecosystems are operating dir -
ectly at the customer interface. The actual pro -
viders of payment accounts and cards are being 
relegated to second place, making them more 
interchangeable, and payment business models 
which worked in the past are ceasing to func -
tion. Credit institutions, which up to now have 
been responsible for payments, are increasingly 
ceding direct customer contact to their rivals, 
meaning that they are ever less able to ascer -
tain customers’ wishes.
For the most part, platform- based ecosystems 
are highly user- friendly and incorporate a broad 
spectrum of goods or services. There is no 
doubt that they can also make network effects 
and economies of scale and scope work to the 
advantage of their customers. On the other 
hand, there is an inherent tendency in the 
digital economy towards forming monopolies 
that needs to be taken into account when 
shaping the regulatory environment. There is a 
risk that the market will develop along the lines 
of the “winner takes it all” principle. For this 
reason, regulators, supervisory bodies, anti-  
trust authorities and consumer protection au -
thorities at both the national and European levels need to develop a detailed and coordin -
ated position on this topic in order to ensure 
that Europe’s payments market remains com -
petitive and efficient going forward.
PSD2 paving the way for 
open banking in the field 
of payments
The mounting competition in the European 
payment services market is being intensified by 
regulatory action plans that are likely to cause 
a further shift in the relationship between es -
tablished providers and new players.
As part of PSD2, registered providers of ac -
count information services (AISPs) and licensed 
payment initiation service providers (PISPs) will, 
from September 2019 onwards, be able to use 
an interface to access precisely defined account 
information at the account servicing payment 
service provider (ASPSP) in order to initiate pay -
ments or provide account information.23 This is Credit institu -

Digital identity challenges
Secure electronic identifi  cation (eID) and 
authentication is a central building block of 
the Digital Single Market and essential for 
the establishment of legal certainty, trust 
and security in electronic transactions. One 
major area in which there are particular re-
quirements when it comes to establishing 
the identity of new customers, authenticat-
ing customers and authorising transactions 
is the provision of digital fi  nancial services.
eID solutions are still not very common in 
Germany, however. Whilst eID functionality 
has been a standard feature of all German 
identity cards issued since November 2010, 
this means of proving one’s identity online 
has not yet gone mainstream, not least be-
cause it is generally quite complicated to 
use.
Various legislative changes in the recent 
past (the eIDAS Regulation,1 amendments 
to the Money Laundering Act (Geldwäsche-
gesetz) and the Act on Identity Cards and 
Electronic Identifi  cation (Personalausweis-
gesetz), the Online Access Act (Onlinezu-
gangsgesetz) and PSD2) have created a 
more amenable landscape for eID and 
authen tication tools in the digital fi  nancial 
services space, stimulating the development 
and launch of solutions in this fi  eld.
Financial service providers are not only 
major potential users of eID solutions for 
purposes such as verifying a counterparty’s 
identity under money laundering law – they 
can also be providers of identity services 
themselves, as evidence from other coun-
tries has shown. One possibility would be 
to use the authentication procedures built 
into online banking applications to confi  rm, 
at the customer’s request, their identity, age 
or address for third parties such as online merchants. This way, credit institutions 
would be able to leverage the high quality 
of customer data they have on record and 
use them as a platform for offering new 
services that can generate fresh sources of 
income from retailers, for example.

subject to the payment service user explicitly 
agreeing to such an exchange of data or au -
thorising the transaction upfront. To this end, 
the interface through which the data exchange 
is channelled needs to be configured in such a 
manner that it functions just as efficiently as 
the standard internet portal for online bank -
ing.24 Established financial service providers, 
but also tech enterprises and new providers, 
are at liberty to offer products based on pay -
ment initiation and account information ser -
vices, provided they have the required licence 
and are suitably registered. Payment initiation 
services enable any given payment service user 
to easily and conveniently create a pre-  
completed credit transfer order instructing their 
bank to, for instance, effect payment for an 
e-commerce transaction.
While the arrival of these new services looks set 
to heighten competition for providers from the 
banking sector, PSD2 also offers these institu -
tions an opportunity to carve out a place for 
themselves in the market as providers of in -
novative services. According to a Bundesbank 
survey analysing the banking sector, many insti -
tutions in Germany will be technically equipped 
to offer payment initiation services, e.g. for 
trading clients, by the end of 2019. The vast 
majority of credit institutions are intending to 
offer account information services as early as 
before the end of this year, and some are al -
ready providing this facility. This service means 
not only accessing payment accounts, includ -
ing any held at other credit institutions, but 
also, for example, loan accounts and safe cus -
tody accounts as well, thus enabling the cus -
tomer to obtain the broadest possible overview 
of their finances. This kind of access to such 
accounts is, however, not regulated by PSD2. 
According to the survey, most credit institutions 
plan to use the customer’s account data, sub -
ject to that customer’s express consent, for 
their own credit assessment purposes and for 
sharing information with third parties (e.g. on -
line retailers) upon request in connection with 
consumer credit.Credit institutions in Germany are leaning to -
wards offering the interface required under 
PSD2 in the form of an API (application pro -
gramming interface), a mechanism that allows 
bank data to be used innovatively and that has 
the potential to make banking more conveni -
ent, diversified and straightforward. On the 
one hand, APIs let banks incorporate finance 
apps operated by third- party providers into 
their own range of services, e.g. payment solu -
tions for international credit transfers. On the 
other hand, at the customer’s request, an API 
can integrate their bank data into an app oper -
ated by a third- party provider. From a strategic 
point of view, the banking industry has inter -
ests that go beyond PSD2. The aim is to set up 
a functioning API ecosystem that will add at -
tractive features to banks’ portfolios and pre -
vent the payments market from slowly being 
taken over by new competitors. Against this 
background, a working group operating under 
the auspices of the Euro Retail Payments Board 
(ERPB) and peopled by representatives from 
both providers and users of European payment 
services has got started on a new API scheme 
designed to explore the ways in which, say, 
identification methods, personalised financial 
management tools or specific payment options 
can be incorporated into an API scheme using 
open interfaces. The hitherto commonly fa -
voured strategy of banks – to themselves pro -
vide financial services boasting a high degree 
of added value – is likely to gradually lose its 
effectiveness in today’s digital age.
“New” banks are already out there today. These 
institutions have directly configured their IT in -
frastructures and operating systems in such a 
way as to enable them to benefit from the op -
portunities offered by the platform economy 
and by digitalisation, for instance by purchas -
ing a variety of banking modules from third 
parties instead of developing and running these 
on an in- house basis, or by acting as a provider … banking

of “banking as a service” themselves. This ap -
proach has the added advantage of facilitating 
greater flexibility and agility in responding to 
market trends.
For one thing, this market shift towards open 
banking is likely to intensify the pressure on es -
tablished providers because lucrative segments 
of the processing chain may come under even 
greater attack from new players in future than 
has been the case thus far. For another, how -
ever, open banking also presents a chance to 
establish innovative business models and, 
working together with other providers, tap into 
new market potential. Trust is one particular 
area in which credit institutions in Germany can 
still get the better of tech companies, which is 
a further reason why cooperation between 
credit institutions and fintech firms is becoming 
increasingly common. Such an arrangement 
allows the former to provide their customers 
with convenient, innovative services at the 
drop of a hat, while the latter gain access to a 
large customer base as well as established trust 
and regulatory expertise, amongst other bene -
fits. That said, there are signs that this situation 
may change in the next few years as the per -
sonal preferences of subsequent generations 
evolve and shift.
Instant  payments the new 
standard 
The changes currently underway in the pay -
ments landscape are not solely confined to 
opening accounts up to third parties and the 
growing dominance of API schemes in bank -
ing. Instant payments, in other words, the 
settlement of everyday payments in a matter of 
seconds – almost in real time – are bound to 
contribute to a further dismantling of existing 
market structures in the payments market.
Since November 2017, it has been possible to 
effect cross- border instant payments in euro 
under the SEPA SCTInst Scheme, which was 
called into life by the European Payments Council (EPC) as an extension to its existing 
basic SEPA Credit Transfer Scheme.25 Instant 
payments allow money to be transferred from 
one account to another within just a few 
seconds. Provided the credit institution in ques -
tion offers this service, it can be used by house -
holds or enterprises as an alternative to the 
traditional credit transfer.26 On top of this, it is 
also conceivable that new payment solutions 
and products will cluster around the SEPA 
SCTInst Scheme. These may include mobile 
phone- based solutions for peer- to- peer (P2P) 
payments and other such payment solutions 
for online and in- store shopping.
P2P payments have been the main area of ap -
plication for instant payments in the European 
arena as well. Inasmuch as settlement is ef -
fected in real time, such tools represent the 
electronic equivalent of cash payments be -
tween individuals. In P2P solutions, it is nor -
mally possible to specify the payee by means of 
their telephone number, which is linked to that 
individual’s IBAN via a database on which these 
solutions depend. In Germany, there are al -
ready a number of P2P solutions on the market 
that, to some extent, effect settlement by 
means of instant payment. However, nation -
wide coverage of the German market is still not 
available, as not all credit institutions are offer -
ing this kind of service and the relevant actors 
in the German banking industry have been un -
able to agree on a common solution. The ad -
vantage of payment solutions that function on 
the basis of the SEPA SCTInst Scheme is their 
theoretical pan- European reach. As things cur -
rently stand, it is already also possible to com -
bine the various databases in use in order to 
merge telephone numbers and IBANs, thus

tiate P2P payments via a banking app installed 
on the user’s smartphone.
The immediate finality of instant payments, in 
particular, is likely to appeal to online retailers 
and bricks and mortar retailers alike as they are 
on offer around the clock. This means that 
cashless payments can be settled with no risk 
of default, and without necessarily requiring a 
guarantee model, effectively making instant 
payments an attractive additional option along -
side cash at the POS or an alternative to card 
payments or electronic direct debits. Applied in 
e- commerce, instant payments could be used 
to overcome temporal frictions as, for example, 
purchased goods can be dispatched immedi -
ately upon receipt of the relevant order when 
payment is made in advance. What is more, 
from a retailer’s viewpoint, this model would 
deliver an attractive additional alternative to 
payment by card, direct debit and e-commerce 
schemes, the only prerequisite being the avail -
ability of suitable payment solutions offering 
user- friendly, uncomplicated and secure access 
to instant payments. In particular, the establish -
ment of a link between a request to pay and an 
instant payment could generate practice- driven 
solutions. An EPRB working group is currently 
analysing the various initiatives and options 
now out there on the European market.27
As at 10 May 2019, 1,299 of 1,500 institutions 
in Germany offering credit transfers can now 
be reached for the purpose of taking receipt of 
incoming instant payment orders.28 Since the 
end of that month, the vast majority of these 
credit institutions have actively offered instant 
payments or products based on them. By pro -
viding comprehensive, single-  source payment 
solutions that encompass multiple different 
payment scenarios, credit institutions offering 
instant payments can enhance their competi -
tiveness vis- à- vis new providers from the non-  
banking sector or international credit card pro -
viders. In addition, instant payments represent 
a convenient and secure alternative to crypto-  
tokens like, say, Bitcoin or Ether which, in some instances, make it possible to effect transac -
tions in close to real time, or at least hold some 
promise of doing so.
Outlook for payments 
in  Europe
The triple whammy of digitalisation, regulation 
and competition has been putting established 
payment service providers under noticeable 
pressure to adapt and change. Payment service 
providers from the banking sector have already 
done a great deal to adapt to the new environ -
ment, for example by making greater use of in -
novative solutions such as a digital girocard 
that allows customers to pay by smartphone. 
Some banks have also responded by adding 
more third- party products to their portfolio.
But in a network industry like the payments 
sector, future success will hinge more than ever 
on international cooperation and an ability to 
also establish a common, coordinated market 
at the customer interface (see the chart on 
p. 60). This being the case, payment solutions 
from a single source that can be used in an 
array of different payment scenarios are likely 
to play an increasingly important role. As 
smartphones evolve into universal “do any -
thing” devices, it is possible that payment scen -
arios will converge. In order to hold their own 
in the European market and compete as equals 
with their global rivals in the long run, the 
existing payment solutions will need to expand 
their reach beyond their national perimeters 
and be available across country borders. This 
also reflects the idea underpinning SEPA, which 
is to forge a single market for payments. Paral -
lel to this, the international dimension of trade 
– of e- commerce, say – is gaining more and 
more importance, and the growing degree of 
mobility within Europe is producing a situation … and for pay -

27 At present, two initiatives in Germany are advocating 
the use of instant payments for retail transactions, namely 
the Westhafen dialogue among experts and the GS1 retail 
trade POS instant payment concept (HIPPOS).

where customers are increasingly making use 
of payment solutions not just in their home 
country but also elsewhere in Europe.
Furthermore, there are exclusively national card 
schemes in a few European countries, such as 
the girocard scheme in Germany. These 
schemes ensure that domestic debit card trans -
actions are processed in an efficient, secure 
and cost- effective fashion and, for the most 
part, make do without any burdensome system 
or licensing fees. But international card pay -
ments can only be settled with the aid of inter -
national card schemes, whose share of the 
market, in terms of the number of all card pay -
ments in the euro area, rose from around 50% 
to more than 70% in 2016 within a time span 
of just seven years.29 During that same period, 
almost one- third of national card schemes 
ceased to operate. When payment instruments 
were being standardised by European legisla -
tors, payment cards were not included in this 
process. Regulatory intervention was confined to business models (chiefly in the form of a cap 
on interchange fees for four party payment 
card schemes),30 leaving settlement standards 
intact. Notwithstanding SEPA, private market 
initiatives aimed at standardisation and har -
monisation have thus far not been able to 
bring about full integration of the card pay -
ments market, either. Past private sector initia -
tives designed to link up national card schemes 
all failed for a variety of reasons,31 for instance 
on account of the relatively high investment 
costs. Furthermore, the cap on interchange 
fees rendered the business model less attract -
ive, despite it still being profitable.

that are linked up to the retail or business cus -
tomer’s current account, but only if every sin -
gle European institution switches to real-  time 
payment processing in the near future. It would 
thus be beneficial if instant payments – unlike 
SEPA credit transfers and SEPA direct debits32 – 
could quickly gain a foothold in the market and 
potentially become established as the new 
standard.
To advance the integration of the European 
market, one option would be to use the new 
instant payment channels harmonised across 
the EU to settle, at least, cross-  border debit 
card payments. This would establish a basis for 
the acceptance of national cards throughout 
the SEPA and improve their competitive pos -
ition vis- à- vis international card schemes.
Another alternative currently under discussion 
is to develop a completely new European pay -
ment procedure based on instant payments. 
This could, for instance, build upon the studies 
by the ERPB working group on an API scheme 
and cover various payment scenarios. One con -
ceivable way forward would be to establish a 
kind of European brand for payment solutions 
which shows a payment service user that a na -
tional e- payment solution, for example, will 
generally work in other European countries as 
well. A European payment procedure of this 
type could integrate existing and established 
national procedures –  if available  – and en -
hance them. A further advantage would be 
that this payment procedure could be used and 
accepted throughout the SEPA, and the Euro -
pean market would benefit from the fact that 
no new national payment procedures would be 
required, especially in smaller markets.
Given the outlined developments, there is the 
overriding question as to which role card pay -
ment transactions will play in a pan- European 
harmonised payments landscape. Even though 
cards, which account for more than 50% of 
transactions, are still the most important elec -
tronic payment instrument in the European 
Union today,33 they can no longer be seen in isolation from other access channels to or from 
one’s bank account, but must take on compe -
tition from mobile and e- commerce payment 
solutions. There are currently a number of na -
tional payment procedures – some of which 
are relatively successful, such as a Dutch pro -
cedure for e- commerce and one from Sweden 
for P2P payments. Both procedures are trig -
gered from a current account but work on the 
basis of credit transfers. The counterparts de -
veloped by German institutions are also seeing 
a steady rise in the number of users and retail -
ers registering for connection, but are yet to 
secure any notable degree of market penetra -
tion, especially for e- commerce.
In the digital age, it is currently those products 
that are highly user-  friendly and may be used 
across borders that will make their mark in the 
market. User- friendliness also means being able 
to use the same product in as similar a way as 
possible across a number of different payment 
scenarios. For instance, a solution for P2P pay -
ments that may be used across borders could 
be extended for use in other payment scen -
arios, such as for e- commerce and in- store 
shopping. Such a universal approach combined 
with simple, secure – and possibly biometric – 
authorisation and authentication procedures as 
well as easy- to- use apps would enable mobile 
payments to take off across Europe and give 
the European market’s competitive position a 
major boost.
But debate should not centre solely on the vari -
ous ways in which to design the future Euro -
pean payments landscape. On the one hand, it 
seems rather impracticable – and not very eco -
nomical – to simply replace schemes and prod -
ucts that are successfully established in many 
markets with new European schemes. On the 
other hand, in the recent past, market partici -
pants have invested in a new real- time infra -
structure and will have to continue their efforts Instant

if they intend to build up an open banking eco -
system for the payments market.
A new European payment procedure could 
mean real European alternatives for payers and 
payees. Such a procedure would integrate 
existing national payment solutions and be 
based, perhaps initially, on an existing infra -
structure before migrating to a thoroughly 
modernised real- time infrastructure. The pro -
cedure would also cater for all possible pay -
ment scenarios: online, offline, P2P and mobile 
payments. Furthermore, it would be efficient 
– thanks to network effects and economies of 
scale and scope – and boast secure authentica -
tion, possibly using biometric features, as well 
as high levels of fraud prevention and cyber se -
curity by also making use of artificial intelli -
gence. One other major building block would 
be the strict application of European data pro -
tection principles – principles such as minimisa -
tion, restricted use and transparency when col -
lecting and using data  – as well as enabling 
users of digital payment services to check ad -
herence to these principles. This would invigor -
ate competition overall and also bolster Euro -
pean payment solutions and their providers.
Needless to say, legal backing is required to 
promote such European ideas. In addition to 
giving due consideration to the regulation of 
new standards, such as instant payments, 
which is relatively simple in legal terms, the 
legal framework must leave sufficient leeway 
for business models. In this regard, work should 
begin on revising the interchange fee regula -
tion.34 Policymakers will not be able to embark 
on their reorientation of Europe without high 
investment on the part of the banking industry. 
It is essential to ensure that prices can be set in 
a fair, transparent and cost- oriented manner, as 
payment transactions involve costs and have to 
ensure a sustainable basis for business models. 
An interplay of participants with internal settle -
ment options between the various attractive 
roles as issuer and acquirer of a means of pay -ment should still be fundamentally possible, 
even in the digital age.
The transformation of the European payments 
landscape with a whole host of new partici -
pants also raises issues relating to effective 
supervision and an appropriate legal frame -
work for competition and data protection re -
quirements. To ensure that an efficient, secure 
and competitive European payments market 
can continue to develop, it is essential to clarify 
when firms that have so far thought of them -
selves as technical service providers need to be 
subject to greater oversight and brought into 
the scope of supervision. Moreover, measures 
must be in place to enable international pro -
viders in the European payments market to be 
monitored effectively. The debate should also 
look at the extent to which it matters where 
transaction data are processed and stored, and 
which proprietary solution approaches, if any, 
could inadvertently thwart competition in the 
payments market. Given the growing levels of 
international competition, the definition of the 
relevant market should be discussed, for in -
stance if national providers want to join forces 
to more effectively unite against international 
competitors in the domestic market.
The payment transactions market will remain 
dynamic thanks to the developments resulting 
from digitalisation. Given the current state of 
blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, 
neither are likely to play a major role in the me -
dium term for the further development of 
European retail payments.35 Established pro -
viders are facing a critical decision. They need 
to continue innovating and investing if they are 
to keep hold of their currently rather good pos -
ition in payment transactions. Yet, it is not just 
providers of payment services that are affected 
by the greater fragmentation of value chains

nancial services and banking products are also 
facing fierce competitive pressure. In this light, 
in order to be successful in the European pay -ments market, there is no choice but to take a 
European perspective.

The costs of payment methods  
in the retail sector
Recent years have seen both academics and the public at large taking a greater interest in the 
costs associated with means of payment. As part of its statutory mandate, the Bundesbank seeks 
to hone its understanding of the costs of different payment instruments, and thereby contribute 
to an objective discussion of their advantages and drawbacks. In 2014, the Bundesbank therefore 
published an overview as well as initial estimates of the costs and benefits of cash and cashless 
payment instruments. This approach was built upon to produce the present study, “The costs of 
payment methods in the retail sector”. Focusing on the retail sector, the study looks at a portion 
of the costs generated in the economy by the use of payment media.
The German retail sector processes roughly 20 billion transactions per year, of which just over 
76% were cash payments in 2018. As a percentage of sales, cash payments still account for just 
under 50%. Innovations in the field of payments, and the new payment procedures that they are 
ushering in, are giving consumers an increasing variety of payment instruments to choose from. 
One area in which this is being reflected is the growing number of cashless transactions. Against 
this backdrop, the question of how much cash and cashless payments cost the retail sector is 
becoming increasingly important – because whatever means of payment consumers decide to 
use, they all generate costs. A large part of these costs is borne by retailers.
According to the present study, the total costs of payment procedures to German retailers in the 
narrower sense amount to €5.7 billion per year. Cash payments account for some three- quarters 
of all transactions and generate roughly €3.8 billion in costs. Taken together, card-  based pay -
ment methods (such as girocard, direct debit and credit card) cost around €1.7 billion per year. 
The costs incurred for payments by invoice, finance purchases and voucher payments add up to 
about €0.3 billion.
Cash payments cost just under €0.24 per transaction, making them currently the most cost-  
efficient means of payment for retailers from a transaction perspective. According to the study’s 
findings, girocard payments cost €0.33 per transaction, while SEPA direct debit payments cost 
€0.34. On account of higher transaction costs, credit card payments work out more expensive 
than cash or girocard payments from every perspective and generate costs of just under €1 per 
transaction. In terms of sales, however, card payments and, in particular, girocard payments 
prove cheaper for the retail sector than cash payments. When interpreting the figures, it should 
also be borne in mind that the costs presented are based on average values and that different 
payment structures have to be taken into account. The present survey from 2017 was only able 
to capture a small number of contactless payments. Broader uptake of this relatively new form of 
payment could see the costs of card payments, in particular, change. This underlines the fact that 
the costs associated with means of payment are in constant flux.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
How do Germans pay for their purchases, what 
costs does this generate and how are payment 
habits changing? Through regular surveys such 
as its payment behaviour study,1 the Bundes -
bank helps provide answers to these questions. 
With the costs of payment media having fig -
ured more prominently in discussions over past 
years, in 2014 the Bundesbank published an 
overview and initial estimates of the costs and 
benefits of cash and cashless payment instru -
ments.2 That study described the evolution of 
cash and cashless payment transactions in Ger -
many and abroad, and provided a critical over -
view of previous cost studies at that time. The 
study also estimated the economic importance 
of payment instruments. The authors of the 
2014 study highlighted that employees’ time is 
also a key cost factor, with a large share of the 
costs in the retail sector found to be attribut -
able to the payment process at the point of 
sale (POS). Only a survey would be able to pro -
vide the data needed to assess this time aspect 
in precise terms and put a price on it, however.
With a view to analysing these points in greater 
depth and, in particular, to delivering more 
granular answers to the questions regarding 
the costs per transaction as well as the cost vol -
umes arising for the economy as a whole, the Bundesbank collaborated with the EHI Retail 
Institute to conduct a study for 2017 on the 
costs of means of payment in the retail sector.3 
The work focused on ascertaining precisely 
which factors determine costs. Three cost com -
ponents were identified for cash payments, 
and four for cashless payments. The first cost 
component represents the outlay for cashier 
time. Cashier time refers to the length of time 
spent on a payment process at the POS and the 
portion of staff costs arising from the employ -
ee’s time spent working at the POS. The second 
cost component comprises POS background 
costs, which cover expenses relating to all 
background activities, such as cashing up, sort -
ing receipts for card payments, and depositing 
and re- counting change. In the case of cash 
payments, cash removal and supply costs con -
stitute the third cost component. For card pay -
ments, the third cost component is transaction Payment habits, 
costs and 
changes

3 The study looked at the costs for the stationary retail sec -
tor in the narrower sense. That includes, for example, food 
retailers, furniture stores and drugstores (see the chart on 
p. 68). Stationary retail trade in the broader sense comprises 
establishments with retail elements such as pharmacies, 
automotive accessories suppliers, cash- and- carry supermar -
kets, hair salons, motor vehicle traders and petrol station 
shops as well as trade businesses in the form of bakeries 
and butchers’ shops. However, stationary retail trade in the 
broader sense is typically not deemed to be part of the re -
tail sector and is not taken into account in the analyses 
which follow. See Cabinakova, Horst and Knümann (2019).Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
June 2019

costs. The fourth cost component, reflecting 
the specificities of cashless payments, covers 
terminal costs, including those for maintenance 
and updates to software.
In order to estimate the economic dimensions 
of these costs, the study took account of vol -
ume data from the retail sector, measured the 
duration of payment transactions at retail POS 
and employed findings from in- depth inter -
views with retailers. The costs paying by cash 
as determined were then compared against 
those of the most common cashless methods. 
Breaking costs down into fixed and variable 
costs, running scenarios with altered average 
variables and estimating cost functions and de -
velopments also made it possible to analyse 
changes in payment behaviour. This is particu -
larly relevant considering the growing use of 
contactless card payments.
It should be noted that the following remarks 
offer a partial insight into the costs of payment 
methods. Payment instruments generate costs 
not just for retailers but also for other agents 
within an economy, such as the central bank, 
cash- in- transit (CIT) companies, credit institu -
tions and households. A portion of these costs 
is already accounted for by determining the 
costs borne by retailers. Precisely calculating 
the costs incurred at the macroeconomic level is far from straightforward, however. Informa -
tion on time outlay and other expenditure in -
curred by all actors would need to be broadly 
available, and this is not yet the case. Examin -
ation of the costs arising in the retail sector is 
therefore a first step towards ascertaining part 
of the economic costs and shows that calculat -
ing specific costs is a difficult and very much 
assumption- based exercise. The Bundesbank is 
committed to ensuring that citizens remain free 
to choose how they wish to pay and maintains 
a neutral stance on specific means of payment.
The structure of the German 
retail sector
Germany’s retail sector encompasses around 
355,000 stores, which in 2018 recorded gross 
sales of €430 billion.4 Just under 12% of stores 
fall into the organised food retail category. 
With a sales share of just under 42%, this 
group has by far the highest sales in the retail

is likely to be that these branches include a 
number of large chains with high sales.
In terms of the total number of transactions in 
the German retail sector in 2018, just under 
76% were settled in cash and roughly 23% by 
card6 (see the chart on p. 66).7 The vast major -
ity of all card payments can be attributed to the 
girocard system (14.3%), followed by (SEPA) 
electronic direct debiting (4.9%) and credit 
cards (2.9%).8 Invoice/ finance purchases (0.6%) 
and other cashless options (0.5%), such as 
voucher transactions, figure comparatively 
rarely. Extrapolated for the German retail sector 
as a whole, this amounts to 15.2 billion cash 
purchases, 4.6 billion card- based payment pro -
cesses and a further 220 million other cashless 
transactions.
As a share of the €430 billion in total sales re -
corded for the German retail sector, cash ac -
counts for 48.3%, while card payments make 
up 48.6% (see the chart on p. 67).9 The largest 
share of card payment sales is accounted for by 
girocard (30.1%), followed by electronic direct 
debiting (10.0%) and credit cards (6.9%). The 
share of invoice/ finance purchases amounts to 
2.5%, while other cashless payment instru -
ments represent a sales percentage of 0.6%. 
Extrapolated for the German retail sector as a 
whole, this is equivalent to sales of €208 billion from cash transactions, €209 billion from card 
payments and €13 billion from other cashless 
transactions.
The organised food retail branch alone ac -
counts for around 50% of cash sales and 
around 32% of cashless sales (see the chart 
above),10 giving food retail a disproportionately 
high percentage of cash sales. The same is true 
of drugstores and perfumeries. Besides organ -
ised food retail, a high percentage of cashless 
sales is attributable to furniture and furnishings 
stores as well as clothing, footwear and sports 
shops. This distribution reflects variation in pay -
ment behaviour, which is partly due to differ -
ences in the average payment amounts for 
each retail group.
The German retail sector’s annual sales of €430 
billion is generated in over 20 billion transac -
tions. This is equivalent to around 220 pur -
chases per capita and just under 470 purchases 
per household per year.11 A total of 725,000

(or “balanced”) on a daily basis. Overall, this re -
sults in 34 million cash removals12 per year, 
which is equivalent to around €6,170 per re -
moval13 and to cash registers being settled an 
average of 6.6 times per removal process. On 
average, each store thus has cash removed 
from its premises around 1.9 times a week.14
Payment times in the German 
retail sector
Employees’ working hours are a major factor 
when calculating the costs of payment media 
borne by the retail sector. The payment process 
at the POS accounts for a large portion of these 
working hours. For this reason, a total of 3,125 
time measurements were carried out at the 
POS on 17 days between May and November 
2017 at 15 selected stores in six branches based 
on the results of a structural analysis of the re -
tail sector. According to these measurements, 
paying in cash lasts 22.3 seconds on average. 
Card payments where a PIN is entered last 29.4 
seconds on average, while card payments with 
a signature take 38.6 seconds (see the chart 
above). Each time measurement started as 
soon as the cashier stated the purchase 
amount. The time was stopped when the sales 
receipt and/ or payment receipt was handed 
over, change was handed over or the cash 
drawer was shut. The point at which the cash -
ier was ready for the next customer was the 
point at which the new time measurement was 
started. Only a small number of contactless 
payments were measured in the aforemen -
tioned study, and as such they cannot be con -
sidered representative. A cost simulation that 
takes contactless card payments into account 
was carried out nonetheless (see the box on 
pp. 76 f.).
The payment amount influences how long a 
payment process takes. The present study 
shows that the duration of a payment increases 
as the amount paid rises across all of the pay -
ment media analysed.15 While payments of up 
to €10 generally take just over 18 seconds, pay -ments of over €50 take longer than half a min -
ute on average (see the chart on p. 70). Small 
amounts of below €10 paid in cash even take 
less than 18 seconds on average, while more 
than 32 seconds are needed to pay amounts of 
between €50 and €100. For cash payments, 
the payment duration shows a linear increase 
as the payment amount rises. This is likely to be 
attributable, amongst other things, to the fact 
that customers are more likely to know or esti -
mate the total of smaller purchase amounts 
and have the cash ready for payment. Also, as 
a rule, less cash is needed to pay smaller 
amounts. With medium und higher amounts, 
however, the customer generally has to wait to 
find out the final total, then decide which pay -
ment instrument to use and, if applicable, find 
the appropriate banknotes and coins. Custom -
ers and cashiers also tend to, or are required 
to, check payments involving higher amounts 
more closely to avoid any mistakes or to iden -
tify counterfeit money, for instance.

lesser extent as the payment amount goes up. 
Small amounts of below €10 generally take just 
under 23 seconds, whereas amounts of be -
tween €50 and €100 need more than 34 
seconds. It is only for purchase amounts of 
more than €100 that paying by card with PIN is 
much quicker than a cash payment. Payments 
by card with signature take the longest across 
all payment amounts. While payments of 
below €10 take the shortest amount of time 
(32.5 seconds) for this payment method, too, 
there is no clear linear correlation between 
payment duration and purchase amount. For 
example, amounts of more than €30 but less 
than €50 have the longest payment duration 
(41.2 seconds). A payment duration that tends 
to increase as the purchase amount rises could 
be attributable to the fact that customers and 
cashiers tend to check payments involving 
higher amounts more closely in order to avoid 
any payment errors at the checkout. Neverthe -
less, payment durations fluctuate less strongly for card payments than for cash payments 
across all payment amounts.
Costs of payment instruments
The interviews with retailers from different 
branches and of varying sizes conducted in 
addition to the time measurements aimed to 
determine the outlay of time for upstream and 
downstream POS activities, including change 
supply and cash removal. For this purpose, an 
average staff cost rate and the costs of back 
office activities relating to payment procedures 
were calculated based on interviews with ten 
large (chain) and 20 small (independent, 
owner- operated) retailers. Another objective of 
the interviews was to assess retailers’ costs aris -
ing from external service providers such as CIT 
companies or banks.
Costs of cash and cashless 
payment media
Adding together the respective overall expend -
iture for the three cost components, cash pay -
ments cost the retail sector a total of €3,775 
million annually. Based on the €210 billion in 
cash sales and 15.6 billion cash transactions, a 
cash payment costs an average of €0.24 per 
transaction, corresponding to a cash sales-  
related charge of 1.80% (see the chart on 
p. 73).
Adding together the overall expenditure of the 
four cost components for cashless payment 
media gives the following costs: for girocard 
payments with PIN, the retail sector incurs 
overall annual costs of around €675 million. 
Based on the 2.1 billion transactions and sales 
of €101 billion, a girocard payment with PIN 
costs an average of €0.33, which corresponds 
to a sales- related charge of 0.67% (see the 
chart on p. 78). Debit card payments result in 
overall annual costs of around €535 million for 
the retail sector. Accordingly, a debit card pay -
ment costs €0.34 on average (1.6 billion trans -The payment

Point­ of­ sale processes in the retail sector
At the start of each cash register shift in the 
retail sector, change is usually either deposited 
into the cash drawer or the change that is al-
ready in the cash drawer is re-counted. In 
some cases, additional rolls of coins are de-
posited. If the same drawer is to be used by 
the same cashier who counted its contents at 
the end of the previous day, this step is not 
necessary. Although, in most cases, cash 
registers are balanced individually at the end 
of the day or shift, the detailed processes vary 
immensely from establishment to establish-
ment. The differences depend mainly on:
– the type and scope of the cash offi   ce/ cash 
offi   ce functions;
– the type and scope of the dual control 
principle;
– the type and scope of the two- person prin-
ciple when transporting cash internally;
– whether cashiers share a cash drawer over 
the course of the day or whether each 
cashier has their own cash drawer;
– whether cash is counted at the cash regis-
ter or in the cash offi   ce;
– whether cash is counted at the end of the 
day or the next morning;
– whether cash is counted manually or there 
is single- denomination weighing of all de-
nominations;
– whether there are intermediate cash drops;
– whether exact daily takings are pulled from 
the cash register or only surplus banknotes;
– the cashier’s knowledge of how much 
money should be in the cash register when 
balanced;
– rules on personal liability and cash short-
ages.Where settlement takes place at the end of 
the day, all cash holdings in the drawer are 
counted and added up. This process usually 
takes place either directly at the cash register 
(often after opening hours) or, because of the 
added security, in the cash counting room. 
After that, the branch manager/ cash offi   ce 
confi  rms the closing balance. If there are no 
discrepancies, the cashier pays out their daily 
takings, usually in the presence of a second 
person (head cashier/ cash offi   ce employee/ 
branch manager), and receives a fi  xed or vari-
able amount of change in return. Once the 
cash register has been reconciled, the daily 
takings are removed and a fi  xed or variable 
amount of change remains in the cash drawer. 
There are a number of variations on the usual 
process, stemming mainly from the differ-
ences outlined above.
Depending on the volume of cash takings, all 
cash takings are prepared for removal either 
at the end of the day or after a number of 
days (i.e. merged, re- counted, usually put into 
safebags) before they are collected by the 
cash- in- transit (CIT) company, which initially 
merely confi  rms receipt of the numbered safe-
bags. Cash drops made at intermediate inter-
vals are often packed into safebags in advance 
and stored in the safe in the meantime. For 
this purpose, some enterprises have deposit 
slot safes that can only be opened by the CIT 
company.
Safebags are usually taken to the CIT compa-
ny’s cash processing centre to be opened, 
checked and counted for each of the enter-
prise’s branches individually and then merged 
for deposit and subsequently deposited at the 
Bundesbank. However, some of the larger re-
tail chains do not have cash offi   ces at their 
stores; instead, the CIT company receives one 
safebag per cash register or cashier. Retailers 
with very high daily takings use the Bundes-
bank’s direct deposit process. In this case, the 
CIT company merely transports the cash from 
the retailer to the Bundesbank branch without 
processing it further. The cash is usually trans-Deutsche Bundesbank

ported in sealed P- boxes or containers. By 
contrast, the vast majority of retail stores de-
posit their cash takings themselves, with the 
proprietor or a staff member paying in cash 
holdings to a bank at regular intervals. These 
are usually stores where holdings of cash are 
so low that it is not worth hiring a CIT com-
pany to collect them.
The heterogeneity of point- of- sale prepar-
ation and settlement processes, including 
intermediate cash drops and replenishing 
change, makes it diffi   cult to clearly defi  ne an 
average scenario for evaluating the individual 
processes (point- of- sale preparation and 
settlement, cash drops, ordering change, etc.) 
or function groups (cash register, cash offi   ce) 
which would enable a reliable extrapolation 
for the entire retail sector. This is further ham-
pered by the fact that the quantity structures 
required for such an extrapolation are ex-
tremely diffi   cult to determine or estimate.
The results are therefore more reliable if the 
extrapolation takes cash register settlement as 
the reference variable. This means that the 
times are added up for all background activ-
ities that occur on average during the settle-
ment process or for which a proportion of the 
activity can be assigned to the process in 
question. These activities include the follow-
ing:
– depositing and re- counting change at the 
beginning of each shift, with dual control if 
applicable;
– depositing additional rolls of coins;
– if applicable, preparing a replacement 
point of sale (emergency point of sale), on 
a pro rata basis;
– time spent en route between the cash of-
fi  ce and the checkout area;
– intermediate cash drops for cash registers, 
including time spent en route, generally on 
a pro rata basis according to frequency;– emptying the cash depository/ safe at inter-
mediate intervals, including time spent en 
route – doubled if the two- person principle 
is in effect;
– replenishing change at cash registers at 
intermediate intervals, including time spent 
en route, generally on a pro rata basis ac-
cording to frequency;
– ordering change, generally on a pro rata 
basis according to frequency;
– receiving change, including counting and 
depositing, generally on a pro rata basis 
according to frequency;
– time spent en route between the checkout 
area and the cash offi   ce;
– manually counting daily takings/ weighing 
daily takings by denomination;
– settling the cash register, including count-
ing and depositing into the safe and entry 
into the cash book;
– reconciling cash register discrepancies, 
generally on a pro rata basis according to 
frequency;
– regular or irregular cash checks (cash regis-
ters);
– regular or irregular cash checks (safe);

actions), or 0.97% of the transaction value 
(total sales of €55 billion). Credit card payments 
with PIN result in overall annual costs of €128 
million. Based on the approximately €8 billion 
in sales and 132 million transactions, a credit 
card payment with PIN costs €0.97 on average, 
or 1.70% of the transaction value. Credit card 
payments with signature generate overall an -
nual costs of €319 million. With €17.6 billion in 
sales and 308 million transactions, a credit card 
payment with signature costs €1.04 on aver -
age, which corresponds to a sales- related 
charge of 1.82%.
Total costs of the payment 
methods
The payment procedures above, calculated in 
this way, cost German retailers €5,430 million 
in total per year (see the chart on p. 75). Of 
this, cash payments make up €3,775 million 
per year and all card- based payments con -
sidered (girocard, direct debit, credit card) 
make up €1,656 million, and while similar per -
centages of sales are attributable to the two 
payment media, at just under 50% in each 
case, a significantly larger proportion of the 
transactions was paid in cash. This does not 
take into account sales of €13 billion from in -
voice/ finance purchases/ voucher payments and around €6 billion in sales from other card pay -
ments (store cards, maestro, VPAY). When 
these are included,16 with gross sales of €410 
billion and 20 billion transactions, total costs in 
retail amount to around €5.7 billion annually.
The results show that, in terms of transactions, 
cash is currently the most cost- efficient pay -
ment method for retailers. Looked at in terms 
of sales, the relationship is reversed: in this 
case, girocard payments are the cheapest pay -
ment method for retail trade. Direct debit pay -
ments and credit card payments with PIN are 
also cheaper than cash payments in terms of 
sales. It is striking that the costs for back- office 
activities are relatively high for cash payments, 
whereas for card payment systems, in particu -
lar credit card payments, the transaction costs 
account for a relatively large proportion of the 
costs. These direct comparisons have only 
limited informative value, however, as the vari -
ous payment methods entail different payment 
amounts, amongst other things.Costs of pay -

Cost analysis for cash and cashless means of payment
For cash payments, the total cashier time 
outlay is obtained by multiplying the meas-
ured times (average cash payment = 22.3 
seconds) by the calculated hourly wage of 
€19.50 and the respective annual transac-
tions. This results in total costs for cashier 
times of €1,882 million per year, which is 
equivalent to €0.12 per cash transaction 
and 0.90% of cash sales. The total outlay 
for back- end processing is calculated by 
multiplying the average 18 minutes1 of time 
spent per POS settlement by the hourly 
wage of €19.50 and the annual number of 
POS settlements and transactions. Overall, 
the background costs for cash handling 
thus amount to €1,315 million per year, 
€0.08 per transaction and 0.63% of cash 
sales. For cash removal and change supply, 
with 34 million removal processes annually 
costing an average of €17 each, a total of 
€578 million is spent per year. This is equiva-
lent to €0.04 per cash transaction and 
0.28% of cash sales.
The total cashier time outlay for cashless 
payment methods is also obtained by multi-
plying the measured times (payment with 
card + PIN = 29.4 seconds; payment with 
card + signature = 38.6 seconds) by the 
hourly wage of €19.50 and the respective 
transactions per payment type conducted 
annually. According to the EHI Retail Insti-
tute, card payment terminals are already in 
place at around 85% of tills in the retail sec-
tor,2 which means a base of around 616,000 
payment terminals overall. Taking into ac-
count the limited life cycle of a device, total 
annual costs per terminal of €150 are ap-
plied at the same rate for all payment pro-
cedures.3 616,000 terminals therefore incur 
annual costs of €92.4 million. The terminal 
costs are broken down on the basis of their 
actual use of the individual payment pro-cedures, which means that the same hard-
ware costs are charged for each transac-
tion.
The processing of card payments is not 
completely automated in most cases. It is 
important to consider staff time here, too. 
For example, there are still receipts from 
card payments which when cashing up at 
the end of the day are often archived or 
sorted, as appropriate. Furthermore, man-
ual intervention is required if terminals 
crash, statements from card operators and 
service providers must be checked for ac-
counting purposes and software updates 
conducted. These costs vary greatly de-
pending on the organisational structure. Al-
ternatively, two minutes per day and ter-
minal are applied for payments which are 
virtually paperless (girocard and credit card 
with PIN) and three minutes for payments 
which still mainly involve paper (SEPA direct 
debit, credit card with signature).
The transaction fees with their respective 
components differ among cashless pay-
ment procedures. Only the network oper-
ator fees are relatively consistent: for giro-
card and direct debit, 0.05% of the transac-
tion value is payable on average and for 
credit card payments around 0.06% on 
average. In most cases, this is not a per-
centage fee, but a fi  xed amount which is 
applied for each transaction (e.g. €0.01 or 
up to €0.28). There is also an authorisation 
fee for girocard payments with PIN of 
around 0.19% of sales on average. No au-
1 Cash handling accounts for 17 minutes; measured in 
units of time, 1 minute is attributed to costs for write- 
downs of safes, cash counting machines, cash scales, 
banknote verifi  cation machines, costs for safebags and 
insurance.

thorisation fees are charged for direct debit 
transactions. However, payment defaults 
and the processing outlay for defaults or 
corresponding insurance premiums should 
be taken into account. An average insur-
ance and default risk of 0.132% was calcu-
lated overall, which also includes internal 
processing costs (dunning letters, bank 
charges or similar, where applicable) for 
temporary payment defaults. In the case of 
transaction fees for credit card payments, a 
weighted average fee of 1.33% of the 
transaction value was calculated. This in-
cludes interchange fees, scheme fees and 
Merchant Service Charges (MSC) as well as 
network operator fees.

Contactless payments
Recent times have seen a marked increase 
in contactless payments. These are pay-
ments made by holding a card, smartphone 
or another device equipped with near- fi  eld 
communication (NFC) technology1 up 
against a payment terminal. Verifi  cation, for 
example by entering a PIN, is not required 
up to a certain amount. This threshold is 
currently set at €25 in the German retail 
sector. More than 20% of all card payments 
are now estimated to be contactless, and 
this proportion is rising.2
The contactless method and omission of 
the verifi  cation step are meant to speed up 
the payment process. For example, the card 
is not inserted into the reader when making 
a contactless card payment. However, little 
is known as yet in terms of precisely how 
long the average contactless payment 
takes. Studies to date suggest that – when 
the operation is carried out correctly – aver-
age payment times of between ten and 15 
seconds are to be expected, providing veri-
fi  cation is not required. At present, it is 
mainly credit cards that feature NFC tech-
nology in Germany. However, by the start 
of 2020, the intention is for all girocards is-
sued by banks and savings banks to be 
NFC- enabled, too.
Only an extremely small and, therefore, 
probably no longer representative sample 
of contactless card payments were cap-
tured in the Bundesbank’s cost study in 
2017. This is due to the fact that contactless 
payments have only recently become more 
commonplace. Simulations for contactless 
card payments are carried out, so as never-
theless to consider potential costs associ-
ated with this new form of payment. In 
order to derive an upper limit for the max-
imum time saving achievable, it is assumed 
that all girocard and credit card payments 
so far carried out with PIN shift to contact-less and that no verifi  cation step is involved 
for payments of amounts less than €25.
Around 40% of the girocard and credit card 
payments currently made with PIN are for 
amounts under €25. For these payments, it 
is assumed that the average cashier time is 
cut in half, reducing from just under 30 
seconds to 15 seconds, due to the omission 
of the verifi  cation step. Payments over €25 
still have a cashier time of 29.4 seconds. It 
is unclear to what extent cashier times for 
payments in excess of €25 (contactless but 
including verifi  cation) change as a result of 
contactless payment. Given the lack of em-
pirical data in this area, the average cashier 
time as it stands now is assumed. Based on 
these assumptions, the new average pay-
ment duration for girocard and credit card 
payments previously carried out with PIN 
would then be just under 24 seconds, giv-
ing card payments an average duration 
comparable to that of cash payments. The 
cashier time costs for girocard and credit 
card payments with PIN would fall in this 
scenario.
It is also conceivable that progressive up-
take of contactless payment would result in 
migration fl  ows. It is possible, for instance, 
that relatively small amounts paid using 
cash up until this point would instead be 
paid using a contactless girocard or credit 
card in this scenario. A portion of current 
direct debit or credit card payments with 
signature would probably also be carried 
out using a contactless option. This would 
bring about changes in terms of cost struc-
tures and transaction and sales shares. For 
the sake of simplicity, it is therefore as-
sumed in this simulation that only girocard 
and credit card payments currently carried 
out with PIN shift to contactless.
1 NFC (near- fi  eld communication) is the technical 
standard for contactless payments.

Summary
Payment habits are changing, albeit slowly. This 
not only entails changes for the retail sector 
–  the main sector in which members of the 
German public shop – but also different cost 
structures and total costs to the economy, 
which remain unexamined at this stage. The 
debate surrounding what constitutes an “ideal” 
means of payment in terms of efficiency, speed, 
security and also data protection, to name just 
a few aspects, goes far beyond the scope of 
the calculations outlined here. Using the 
present study, the Bundesbank can calculate 
granular costs attributable to the various pay -
ment instruments in the retail sector, aggre -
gated at the national level, and thereby con -
tribute to an objective discussion about the 
advantages and drawbacks of the various pay -
ment instruments.
The study delivers three key findings: first, cash 
is used in three out of four cases in Germany to pay at the POS. All other payments are made in 
cashless form. Second, card payments average 
around 29 or 39 seconds in duration, depend -
ing on whether the payment involves a PIN or 
a signature. Cash payments are completed in 
just under 22 seconds on average. Third, cash 
is the cheapest means of payment per transac -
tion, ahead of debit card payments and far 
ahead of credit card payments, while, in terms 
of sales, card payments, especially girocard 
payments, are cheaper for the retail sector than 
cash payments.
One of the strengths of this study lies in mak -
ing transparent the cost structures of various 
payment procedures. It provides an overview of 
the points where costs arise – stemming, for 
example, from the payment process, back -
ground activities or various fees. However, 
when interpreting the figures, it should be 
noted that the costs presented are based on 
average values and that various payment struc -
tures must be taken into account.Payment instru -
ments are multi -
dimensional – 
the costs of 
 payments at the 
POS were the 
focus hereOverall, cash payments continue to have 
the lowest costs per transaction. Contact-
less girocard or credit card payments be-
come even cheaper than direct debit and 
credit card payments with signature due to 
the faster payment time (see the chart above). Looked at in terms of sales, the re-
lationship is reversed: contactless girocard 
payments have the lowest costs, followed 
by electronic direct debit, contactless credit 
card payments, cash payments and credit 
card with signature payments.Simulation for contactless card payments: cost overview of payment methods in retail

Cost analysis
The aforementioned cost calculations are 
fundamentally based on average values – 
average payment amounts or transaction 
percentages, for instance. If these variables 
change, different cost components also 
change, and with them the total cost of the 
means of payment in question. For ex-
ample, transaction fees for card payments 
depend on sales or, to be precise, the aver-
age payment amount. Other cost compon-
ents, meanwhile, are generally incurred irre-
spective of the number or value of transac-
tions, such as the cost of purchasing ter-
minals. It is therefore conceivable that 
different payment amounts may see differ-
ent means of payment generating the low-
est costs. It is often assumed that cash pay-
ment for transactions involving relatively 
low payment amounts gives rise to fewer 
costs than card payment, while the oppos-
ite is the case when it comes to higher pay-
ment amounts, with card payment working 
out less costly than cash payment.
When seeking to ascertain the costs associ-
ated with each payment method for differ-
ent payment amounts, it is helpful to differ-entiate between fi  xed and variable costs. 
The variable costs can be further broken 
down into transaction- dependent and 
sales- dependent costs.1 Transaction- 
dependent costs give rise to the same 
amount every transaction, whereas sales- 
dependent costs are also contingent on 
sales or the payment amount. The three 
cost components for cash payments are 
cashier time, background costs and cash 
supply and removal. For cashless payments 
the following components are duly allo-
cated: cashier time, background costs, 
transaction costs and terminal costs.
The chart below shows the costs of a trans-
action depending on the payment amount 
for cash payments and each of the card 
payment methods. Owing to their relatively 
low fi  xed costs, cash payments have the 
lowest costs on average for small payment 
amounts. The costs are higher in the case 
of payments by girocard or credit card with 
PIN; payments by direct debit and credit 
card with signature incur signifi  cantly higher 
costs. Using the above- mentioned esti-
mates as a basis, the costs of a girocard 
transaction are lower than those of a cash 
transaction only when the payment amount 
is €19.42 or higher. Owing to the high 
sales- dependent costs, the costs of a trans-
action by credit card (PIN or signature) in-
crease much more sharply than those of the 
other payment methods and, for most pay-
ment amounts, are higher than those of all 
the other observed means of payment.
When comparing a cash payment with a 
cashless payment method, such as girocard, 
it should be borne in mind that retailers, if 
they accept cashless payments, frequently

In order to increase the informative value of the 
data collected, a range of scenarios were simu -
lated using various variables, including greater 
use of contactless card payments. This type of payment barely registered on the radar when 
the study was conducted in 2017, but is likely 
to gain in importance in future studies.

method. Retailers then generally have no 
say in whether a customer uses a method 
of payment that is either more favourable 
or more costly for them. The costs of cash 
payments should, in addition, therefore also 
be compared with some or all of the costs 
of cashless payment methods. Taking into 
account the transaction percentages of the 
individual card payments, the average costs 
of all card payments per transaction are in-
variably higher than the costs of a cash pay-
ment. Some retailers –  say, owing to the 
comparatively high transaction fees for 
credit card payments  – accept only pay-
ments by debit card at their payment ter-
minals. Considering the transaction per-
centages of girocard and direct debiting, it 
is only at an amount of €51.67 or higher 
that payments by debit card involve lower 
costs per transaction than cash payments. 
Accordingly, payment behaviour in Ger-many, where payment amounts up to €50 
are mostly paid in cash and amounts higher 
than €50 are predominantly paid by debit 
card, appears to be favourable payment be-
haviour in terms of the overall costs.Deutsche Bundesbank
