5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a wholeAccording to initial calculations by the Federal
Statistical Office, overall economic outputcontinued to accelerate in summer 2000,although the increase was not as marked asin the previous months. After adjustment forseasonal and working-day variations, realgross domestic product (GDP) rose a good
12% above the level of the second quarter.
Compared with the previous year, GDP wentup by just under 3
12% after adjustment for
working-day variations, and by 234%i n
calendar-month terms. There was thus a3
14% increase in the first three quarters as a
whole, with a slight revision of the figures forthe first six months also contributing to theupward movement. From the sectoral pointof view, manufacturing continued to set thepace of growth, with sizeable exports againbeing the decisive factor. However, the ser-vices sector, particularly commercial services,also proved to be an important mainstay ofthe economy. By contrast, the situation inconstruction, which has still been unable topull out of the doldrums, remained at a lowebb.
ManufacturingManufacturing nonetheless lost some of its
impetus in early autumn. In October, season-ally adjusted output was just under
12%
down on the average level of the summerquarter. Although this was still no less than6% up on the comparable figure for the pre-vious year, the rate of increase in the preced-GDP in the

6ing three-month period had amounted to
around 734%. Recently, manufacturers of
consumer durables made a comparativelysharp reduction in output, which was prob-ably partly due to cutbacks in the productionof motor vehicles. By contrast, producers ofcapital goods were able to maintain their pos-ition.
After a fairly quiet period at the end of the
summer, orders received in manufacturingpicked up again in October. In seasonally ad-justed terms, new orders were nearly 1% upon the level of the third quarter. They in-creased by almost 9% on the year, whichwas roughly as much as in the precedingmonths.
As has been the case for some time, the main
stimuli during the period under review con-tinued to come from abroad. Orders receivedfrom international customers in October ex-ceeded the high level already reached in thesummer by around 2%. The year-on-year in-crease went up to 17
34%, from 1412%i n
the third quarter. Major contracts in aircraftconstruction and shipbuilding were of par-ticular significance.
By contrast, seasonally adjusted domestic de-
mand in October did not rise above the levelof the previous three-month period. The year-on-year increase was 2
34%, compared with
512% previously. While figures in the capital
goods sector were good, orders received byproducers of durable and non-durable goods,in particular, failed to match their earlier busi-ness volume.Economic conditions in Germany*

7Construction
The adverse situation in construction showed
no sign of improvement at the end of theperiod under review. Seasonally adjusted de-mand for construction work in the third quar-ter was down again on the already low vol-ume in spring. The year-on-year decline inincoming orders increased to 12
12%, com-
pared with 912% in the second quarter.
The renewed fall in business affected all
major sectors of the construction industry.While industrial and commercial customersreduced their orders between July and Sep-tember by 3% (after adjustment for seasonalvariations), demand for residential construc-tion fell again by around one-tenth. Com-pared with the previous year, the loss oforders amounts to more than 20%.
Construction output in October was 6
12%
lower than 12 months previously. It is notpossible at present to make a comparisonwith the previous months because the mostrecent data are already adjusted in line withthe last overall survey; revised figures forMarch to September will not be availableuntil the start of next year.
Labour marketThe labour market continued to develop posi-
tively. According to the calculations of theFederal Statistical Office, the seasonally ad-justed number of persons in employmentrose to 38.61 million in September, whichwas 580,000, or 1.5%, up on 1999. At thesame time, unemployment fell, albeit by lessthan might have been suggested by the in-
crease in employment. This indicates a con-tinuing large influx from the hidden reserve.
The number of jobless persons registered at
the Federal Labour Office fell, in seasonallyadjusted terms, to 3.80 million by the end ofNovember. This was almost 75,000 fewerthan in the third quarter and 255,000 fewerthan 12 months previously. After adjustmentfor seasonal variations, the unemploymentrate remained at its October level of 9.3%.
However, the reduction in unemployment in
November was again confined to westernGermany. In the new Länder the seasonal in-crease was particularly marked, with the sea-sonally adjusted figure rising to 1.37 million.This corresponds to an unemployment rate of17.4%.
In November the recorded year-on-year de-
crease of 65,000 in the number of people inemployment schemes to around 305,000was largely offset by the expansion of voca-tional training; nearly 390,000 participantswere registered for these training schemes –a good 40,000 more than in the same periodin 1999.
PricesAt 2.4%, the annual rate of increase in con-
sumer prices was as high in November as inthe previous month. While, in the energy sec-tor, the decline in heating oil prices was morethan offset by price increases for petrol andgas, the year-on-year rate of increase slack-ened, especially in the case of manufacturedOrders received

8goods. Price movements in services and rents
continued to be restrained.
International oil prices have been moving
downwards since the start of December. Forthe first time since the end of September/early October the price of a barrel of BrentNorth Sea Oil fell back to below US$ 30. Atthe same time the external value of the euroimproved slightly, providing a further easingof conditions from the point of view of Ger-man importers.
Seasonally adjusted import prices, however,
rose steeply again in October (more recentstatistical data are unavailable at present).The year-on-year increase remained at 13.4%.Excluding energy, the figure was 6.8%,which was mainly due to distinct price in-creases for intermediate goods.
By contrast, the year-on-year increase in in-
dustrial selling prices was still comparativelymoderate in October at 4.6%. If energy com-ponents are excluded, the rise was 2.1%. Atthe end of the period under review, capitalgoods were, in fact, being sold at the sameprice as 12 months previously.
Public finance
Federal cash trendsIn November the Federal Government posted
a cash surplus of slightly over 31
12billion. In
the same month last year, it was still runninga deficit amounting to an ample 38 billion.

*The transactions recorded here as cash receipts and
cash expenditure comprise payments into and out of
the accounts carried by the Bundesbank for the Federal
Government. The cash receipts and cash expenditure
differ from those shown in the official financial statis-
tics primarily because these transactions are recorded
not at the time they are entered in the budgetary
accounts but at the time of the actual inflow or out-
flow, and because transactions on behalf of the Euro-
pean Union (which are not entered in the Federal bud-
get) are conducted through the accounts of the Federal
Government. — 1Including special transactions. — 2De-

9an appreciable rise in receipts, which may be
attributed, in part, to the fact that some ofthe proceeds from the auction of UMTSlicences were transferred to the FederalGovernment’s accounts for the purpose ofredeeming debt. The cumulative cash deficitrecorded in the period from January to No-vember came to 312 billion, compared with
slightly more than 344 million for the same
period in 1999. While expenditure decreasedby just over 5% from last year’s figure, re-ceipts grew by 6%. In this case as well, thefact that some of the UMTS proceeds havebeen recorded under the cash position playeda role. However, the development of the cashposition cannot be used as an indicator forbudgetary definition data since this definitiondoes not include UMTS receipts used to payoff debt directly. Owing, in no small part, tothe trend in tax revenue, which continues tobe positive, the Federal Government budgetmay end the current financial year with asomewhat smaller deficit than the plannedamount of just under 325
12billion.
Public sector borrowingTotal indebtedness of the central, regional
and local authorities, at just under 3
12billion,
rose only slightly. While the capital marketwas being tapped for 37 billion net, money
market debt was cut by slightly more than36
12billion. This sharp decline was due
almost entirely to restraint in Federal borrow-ing. At the same time, the Federal Govern-ment expanded its capital market debt byalmost 32 billion. While the net sale of Fed-
eral bonds (Bunds) yielded just over 34 bil-
lion, loans against borrowers’ notes were re-deemed to the tune of slightly more than 32
billion net. On the whole, Federal Govern-ment debt dropped by 34
12billion. By
contrast, the Länder Governments greatlystepped up their borrowing, increasing theirlevel of indebtedness by almost 34
12billion.
They procured short-term cash advances andbonds worth just under 32
12billion for each
debt category, but they also cut down some-what on their aggregate stock of borrowers’note loans. Net borrowing by the ERP SpecialFund amounted to almost 3
12billion while
the „German Unity“ Fund paid down debt toa somewhat lesser extent. The local author-ities’ indebtedness is likely to have risen by3
12billion in October.

source of funds having been a primary issueof five-year special Federal bonds (Bobls),with proceeds amounting to 36
12billion. In
all, almost 310 billion worth of debt was re-
deemed, Bobls again occupying a prominentplace, along with Federal savings bonds. As aresult, net borrowing on the capital marketcame to just over 3
12billion. Since money
market debt had been reduced by an add-itional sum totalling 32
12billion, the Federal
Government’s overall debt fell by almost32 billion.
Securities markets
Bond marketSales in the German bond market picked up
in October. Domestic borrowers issued bondsto the market value of 376.4 billion, com-
pared with 357.1 billion in the previous
month.
1In terms of value, more than three-
quarters of the issues were denominated ineuro. Net of redemptions, and after takingdue account of changes in issuers’ holdingsof their own bonds, net sales, at 319.6 bil-
lion, were significantly higher than in Septem-ber ( 32.9 billion). It was almost entirely
longer-term paper (with maturities of morethan four years) that was sold. Foreign bondswere placed in the German market to thevalue of 35.8 billion net. On balance, only
bonds denominated in euro and issued bynon-residents were sold. Net sales of domes-tic and foreign bonds yielded a total of 325.4
billion in October, compared with 313.8 bil-
lion a month before.More than one-half of the amount raised by
selling domestic bonds accrued to credit insti-tutions, which received 311.5 billion net
from sales of their own bonds. Specifically,other bank bonds and bonds issued by spe-cialised credit institutions were launched tothe extent of 311.7 billion net and 30.9
billion net, respectively. The outstandingamount of mortgage bonds (Hypotheken-
pfandbriefe) and of communal bonds (Öffent-
liche Pfandbriefe), however, declined by 30.7
billion and 30.4 billion, respectively. In Octo-
ber, industrial bonds amounting to 31.0 bil-
lion were sold.
In October, the public sector increased its in-
debtedness in the bond market by 37.1 bil-
lion, mainly owing to net fund-raising by theFederal Government totalling 35.6 billion.
30-year and ten-year Federal bonds were soldto the value of 34.1 billion net and 31.8 bil-
lion net, respectively, and five-year specialFederal bonds to the tune of 30.8 billion. The
outstanding amount of Federal Treasurynotes and Federal savings bonds remainedvir-tually unchanged.

issue volume in October, at 30.3 billion, was
smaller than a month before ( 31.1 billion).
After deduction of redemptions, the out-standing amount decreased by 32.4 billion.
On the buyers’ side of the bond market, do-
mestic non-banks were in the forefront in Oc-tober; they purchased bonds and notes total-ling312.6 billion (net). At 310.2 billion, do-
mestic bonds issued by private borrowers pre-dominated. Bonds issued by non-residentsand bonds issued by the public sector werebought, in the amount of 31.9 billion net
and 30.4 billion net, respectively. Domestic
credit institutions enlarged their bond port-folios by 37.1 billion, 33.8 billion of that
sum being accounted for by foreign paperand33.3 billion by domestic securities. In Oc-
tober, foreign investors purchased Germanbonds to the extent of 35.6 billion (net).
Equity marketIn October, domestic enterprises placed new
shares in the German equity market to themarket value of 31.6 billion, compared with
31.4 billion a month before. Foreign equities
were sold to the extent of 311.1 billion. Al-
together, therefore, sales of shares amountedto312.7 billion.
Domestic non-banks bought equities worth
312.3 billion in October. On balance, these
funds were mostly invested in foreign paper(310.6 billion); domestic paper was bought
to the tune of 31.7 billion net. Foreign invest-
ors and domestic credit institutions purchasedshares amounting to 30.3 billion net and
30.1 billion net, respectively.
Investment fund certificatesThe amount raised by domestic investment
funds came to 35.9 billion in October, com-
pared with 34.7 billion in September. On bal-
ance, funds open to the general public soldcertificates to the value of 33.0 billion. As in
the previous month, share-based funds re-ceived the major part, at 33.3 billion. Mixed
funds and pension investment mutual funds(Altersvorsorgefonds) received 30.5 billion
and 30.1 billion, respectively. The outstand-
ing amounts of certificates of open-end realestate funds and money-market funds de-clined by 30.2 billion and 30.4 billion, re-

counted for by mixed funds, and 31.0 billion

increased their holdings of domestic and for-eign fund certificates by 34.1 billion and
32.5 billion, respectively. Altogether, they
purchased investment fund certificates worth36.6 billion. Credit institutions invested 31.2

residents bought domestic fund certificatesto the value of 30.7 billion.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account – the combined
outcome of foreign trade, services, factor in-come and current transfers – ran a deficit of31.2 billion in October compared with one of
33.4 billion in September. A significant rise in
the trade surplus was the main reason for thissmaller deficit.
According to calculations by the Federal Stat-
istical Office, the trade surplus amounted to36.3 billion in October compared with 33.6
billion in September. Even after seasonal fac-tors have been eliminated, there was still adiscernible increase in the trade surplus (from33.8 billion in September to 35.5 billion in
October). This was due mainly to an unusuallysharp rise in the exports of goods. In season-
ally adjusted terms these showed a month-on-month increase of 7.9% in Octoberwhereas in September they had declinedslightly. If September and October are takentogether, there was a 4.1% rise over the pre-vious two-month period. The seasonally ad-justed value of imported goods likewise in-creased appreciably (by 4.7%) in October com-pared with the preceding month. In a two-month comparison the increase amounted to3.5%. Much of this increase, however, is dueto the rise in import prices.
The deficit on invisible current transactions
with non-residents fell slightly from 36.9 bil-
lion in September to 36.8 billion in October.
In the case of service transactions with non-residents the deficit in October was slightlylower ( 34.3 billion compared with 34.9 bil-
lion in September). Factor income recorded asurplus of 30.5 billion whereas in September
there had been a deficit of 30.5 billion. By
contrast, the deficit on current transfers in-creased (from 31.5 billion in September to
33.0 billion in October).
There were net outflows of funds as a result
of both securities transactions and direct in-vestment during the month under reviewwhereas credit transactions produced net in-flows. Net capital exports from portfolio in-vestment alone amounted to 36.6 billion in
October compared with 39.8 billion in the
previous month. There was a general down-turn in cross-border portfolio activity, how-ever. For example, German residents invested313.3 billion net abroad during the period
under review, which was approximately one-

13third less than in September. Heaviest de-
mand was for foreign shares ( 34.9 billion),
bonds and notes ( 34.0 billion) and invest-
ment fund certificates ( 32.6 billion). Pur-
chases by non-resident investors on the Ger-man market declined at the same time, how-ever ( 36.7 billion in October compared with
310.2 billion in September). Most of the
funds invested ( 35.8 billion) went into bonds
and notes, especially Federal bonds.
Net capital exports through direct investment
amounted to 34.7 billion in October in con-
trast to net imports of 32.2 billion in Septem-

billion from their foreign parent companies.
German enterprises and individuals trans-
ferred 35.6 billion net abroad in non-
securitised credit transactions by non-banks.They increased the balances which they main-tain with foreign banks and which they hadrun down considerably in the previousmonth; they also reduced their foreign liabil-ities slightly. By contrast, general governmentimported a modest amount of funds ( 32.4
billion) even though the Federal Governmentmade use of only a small part of the bank bal-ances it had built up abroad in September inconnection with the proceeds from the UMTSauction. Credit transactions by the bankingsector, most of which can be seen as a reflec-tion of all other payments abroad, resulted innet capital imports of 37.2 billion in October.

15Subsidy trends in
Germany since thestart of the ninetiesThe purpose of state subsidies is to
remedy the outcomes of market pro-cesses. In a market economy such inter-vention has to be continually justifiedand critically examined. Not only con-siderations of institutional policy butalso the ongoing constraints on publicfinance and the high level of taxes andsocial security contributions make itimperative to grant such aid as restrict-ively as possible. In principle, this needfor fiscal policy discipline is widely rec-ognised. Yet the attempts to imple-ment it are met with resistance. Thesituation is made even more difficultby the fact that there is no clear defin-ition of the term subsidy. Depending
on the definition used, there are notonly differences in the levels of subsid-ies granted but also in the scope fortheir reduction. Monitoring the effect-iveness of subsidies is hampered by thelarge variety of instruments deployedand the differences in their impact,which is sometimes difficult to quan-tify. This issue is analysed in the follow-ing article, which also outlines the im-pact that the trends in state financialaid and tax concessions have had onpublic finance since reunification.
Defining the term subsidy
Basically, the term subsidy implies that some
economic sectors and regions are treatedmore favourably than others, which are re-garded as “normal” and therefore serve as

16the benchmark, in that the favoured sectors
and regions receive state aid in order to pro-mote economic activity. Despite debate overdecades, however, there is no standard defin-ition of the term. For example, a rather nar-row definition is used in the Subsidy Reports,which the Federal Government has to publishevery two years in accordance with section 12of the Stability and Growth Act and which, inessence, serve as a basis for this article. Bycontrast, the Kiel Institute of World Econom-ics, to take another example, puts the volumeof subsidies granted much higher (for detailssee the box on page 17 as well as the charton this page).
Problems of definition arise in the first place
because state aid is provided not only in theform of grants and tax concessions – the twomost important types of subsidy. In principle,it also covers soft loans, other revenue for-gone, guarantees and regulatory measures.
1
State shareholdings in enterprises, where thegovernment forgoes a customary market re-turn on its invested capital, are not the leastimportant of these. In contrast to the FederalGovernment’s Subsidy Reports the EuropeanCommission, when monitoring subsidies inaccordance with the EU Treaty, regards suchcapital injections – as in the case of West-deutsche Landesbank – as aid.
Further problems arise with respect to defin-
ing subsidy recipients. Subsidies are aimed atthe business sector. Naturally, there are alsostate benefits which are granted to house-holds to lower the cost of acquiring certaingoods. Grants of this nature likewise have aneffect on the sectors concerned and conse-quently are ultimately comparable to direct
payments to enterprises. One example is thetax grant for home buyers, which benefitspersons who are building or purchasing ac-commodation for their own use. The grantingof housing allowances, too, might ultimatelybe seen as an indirect subsidy to the housingsector, but in this case the social purpose be-hind the benefit is even more important.However, this example shows that the distinc-tion between subsidies and other forms of ex-penditure – such as payments for social pur-poses – is not clear-cut.
Finally, differentiating between the private
sector and the core public sector also presentsDM

17The term subsidy is variously defined
Special concessions which the Federal Govern-
ment grants to various sectors or regions inorder to influence their economic activity arethe subject of the Federal Government’s
Subsidy Reports. Government responsibilities
such as social policy and the improvement ofthe infrastructure are not taken into accounthere. Not only private enterprises are con-sidered, in principle, as possible recipients ofsubsidies but also individuals if the benefit isaimed directly at influencing part of the econ-omy. The tax grant for home owners, for ex-ample, is included. However, housing allow-ances, which are considered to be a social bene-fit, are not. Federal enterprises and the Treu-hand agency are not included in the SubsidyReports because these are not bodies outsidethe Federal administration for whose subsid-isation the Federal Government is account-able, pursuant to section 12 (2) of the Stabilityand Growth Act. The subsidy aggregate com-prises tax concessions and financial assistance.The latter includes loans, which are listedwith the respective amounts of the outlay in-volved in each case. In its Subsidy Reports theFederal Government concentrates on meas-ures affecting its budget. The value of subsid-ies has been put at just over DM 41 billion for1998. In addition, the Federal Government re-cords tax concessions to Länder Governmentsand local authorities and shows, by way of in-formation, the comparably defined financialassistance given by the Länder Governmentsand the subsidies provided by the localauthorities and the European Union. Theloans granted by the ERP Special Fund arealso included in the subsidy aggregate eventhough the interest rate subsidies to the fundare already recorded as a subsidy in the Fed-eral budget. In 1998 total subsidies as definedhere amounted to just over DM 117 billion, or3.1% of GDP.
The definition of the term subsidy used in the
National Accounts is generally somewhat nar-
rower. Only “current unrequited paymentswhich general government or the Institutionsof the European Union make to residentproducers”
1are recorded in this case. This
means that some of the current grants to hos-pitals and expenditure by the Federal LabourOffice on job creation measures, which are
not included in the Federal Government Sub-sidy Reports, are posted here as subsidies.
2
However, tax concessions and benefits paid toindividuals are not taken into account. Theexclusion of investment grants as capitaltransfers (DM 54 billion) is also significant.Loans are recorded in the national accountsas financial transactions instead of as expend-iture and are therefore not deemed to be as-sistance. The total volume of subsidies as de-fined in the national accounts amounted toDM 80.8 billion, or 2.1% of GDP, in 1998.
The Kiel Institute of World Economics prob-
ably uses the term subsidy in the widest sense
of all.
3In principle, the institute defines as
subsidy recipients not only the group of bene-ficiaries recorded in the Federal Government’sSubsidy Reports but also all state providers ofmarketable services which do not cover theirexpenditure fully by charging specific fees.Owing to the repayment requirement, how-ever, loans granted by the ERP Special Fundare not included in the subsidy aggregate.The Treuhand agency is included. The tax con-cessions are taken from the Subsidy Reportsand – with the exception of the savers’ tax al-lowance, in particular – are augmented bythe items which, owing especially to the sizeof the group of recipients, the Federal Gov-ernment has shown in a separate annex sincethe sixth Subsidy Report instead of includingthem as subsidies. The exemption of medicalservices from turnover tax and the special al-lowance for church tax payments are of par-ticular importance here. When so defined,the tax concessions amounted to just underDM 74 billion in 1998 compared with almostDM 45 billion as defined in the Federal Gov-ernment Subsidy Report. Notably as a resultof the extended inclusion of state-owned ser-vice providers ranging from the railways tohospitals, not to mention the active labourmarket policy of the Federal Labour Officeand the housing allowances, financial assist-ance amounted to just over DM 229 billion in1998 with the result that the total volume ofsubsidies, using this broad definition, came toDM 303 billion, or 8% of GDP.

18problems. Financial assistance to public cor-
porations and other public organisations iswidespread. Where these undertakings are incompetition with private enterprises, suchpayments have likewise to be seen as aid.Consequently, the European Commission in-cludes public enterprises in its subsidy con-trols as a matter of principle. The Institute ofWorld Economics records grants to theatresand museums as subsidies, too.
The actual extent of benefits can diverge
significantly from the payment flows record-ed in the public budget. While it is still rela-tively easy to determine the subsidy elementin the case of grants and tax concessions, thisis more difficult in the case of, say, special de-preciation allowances, loans, guarantees, par-ticularly lucrative public contracts and regula-tory measures which provide protectionagainst competitors and have therefore like-wise to be seen as preferential treatment. Aneffort is made in the case of subsidised loans,for example, to record a fixed portion of thetotal volume as aid.
2
Determining the effective budgetary cost ofsubsidies is not unproblematical either. Whilethe recording of grants is straightforward,estimates are necessary in the case of tax rev-enue lost as a result of granting tax conces-sions. When loans are granted, the final out-lay incurred is unknown. Loan repaymentswould have to be offset against the borrowedsum, but these are to be regarded as “old”cases and therefore do not affect the subsidypolicy of the reporting period.
3Loans from
public institutions such as the Kreditanstaltfür Wiederaufbau (KfW) that are outside thecore budgets are recorded in the Federal Gov-
ernment’s Subsidy Reports only via interestrate subsidies. This makes it clear that the of-ficially declared subsidy amounts can reflect avery varied degree of promotional assistance.In contrast to their treatment in the FederalGovernment’s Subsidy Reports, loans aretherefore not included as subsidies in whatfollows but are simply shown as memo items.
The Federal and Länder Governments are the
main providers of subsidies, but local author-ities provide subsidies, too. The EuropeanUnion also grants financial aid although, withthe exception of expenditure in the contextof agricultural market regulation, this aid isrecorded in the Federal and Länder budgets.In addition, public promotional banks, not-ably the KfW, grant subsidised loans. In thefirst half of the nineties the Treuhand agencyalso disbursed large amounts of funds to fos-ter the restructuring of the east Germaneconomy.
Justifying subsidies
State aid in a market economy always has to
be specially justified because it may lead tochanges in relative prices which have a dis-torting effect on the economy as a whole.Granting subsidies is justifiable only if un-
2For example, in its eighth survey on state aid in the
European Union, which appeared this year, the European
Commission fixed the aid element of amounts lent at
15%. Before 1995 the aid element had been set at 33%
owing to the higher interest rate level. In actual fact it is
the difference between the subsidised interest rate and
the normal market rate that ought to be recorded in each
case.

ciation allowances and the utilisation of guarantees.Establishing the

19desirable market outcomes regarding re-
source allocation or income distributionmight arise unless the state intervenes.
Market failure is to be expected, for example,
in the case of those services that bring posi-tive external benefits beyond their marketvalue. As no one can be excluded from enjoy-ing these external benefits, it is impossible tolevy a charge that would cover the cost ofproviding them. Preservation of the country-side is a case in point.
Bearing in mind both the public and private
costs caused by massive and permanent shiftsin demand or shocks on the supply side, itmay be desirable to cushion the pressure toadjust in regions that are badly affected. Forexample, there could be a large-scale exodusof labour and firms if absorption capacity isexhausted owing to a localised concentrationof crisis-ridden sectors and the downturn ul-timately threatens to escalate. Regional aidmay help to prevent this “de-industrialisationby default”. However, the pressure to adjustcan only be cushioned in such crises, andtherefore aid must always be restricted to alimited period and gradually reduced over theallotted time. If not, there is a risk that theregion’s own ability to overcome future crisescould be diminished. In that case it could be-come permanently dependent on subsidies.
Frequently, subsidies are also justified as “start-
up aid”. For example, special problems inopening up new markets may be citedbecause sufficient capital cannot be raisedowing to the uncertainty surrounding sales op-portunities. However, it is doubtful whetherthe state is better than a profit-oriented invest-
or at recognising the potential success of anew product and therefore the wisdom of pro-viding initial funding. Moreover, the rapidly ex-panding market for venture capital alreadyconstitutes a market-based source of assist-ance in this area. In the case of young firms,however, acquiring funds remains a problemespecially as a result of their lack of collateral.Limited state aid could help to overcome suchteething troubles.
4
If for the reasons mentioned a subsidy is con-sidered to be essential, its aims have to beprecisely defined so that it is possible to moni-tor its effectiveness. Such controls are neces-sary to enable a constant check to be madeon whether the subsidies are still justified orwhether alternative measures with a bettercost-benefit ratio are called for. If such con-trols are not made with sufficient care, thereis a danger that aid will continue to be pro-vided even though there is no longer any jus-tification for it.
Subsidy trends
In terms of the definition used in the Federal
Government’s Subsidy Reports (but excludingthe loans that are recorded there) and in thecomments below, the aggregate aid whichwas granted by the Federal and Länder Gov-ernments, the local authorities and the EU in1991 in the form of financial assistance andtax concessions amounted to DM 88 billion,

20or 3.0% of GDP .5These figures include aid
for eastern Germany,6which was increased
substantially in subsequent years. By 1993 aidhad grown to almost DM 94 billion. It thendeclined slightly to DM 93 billion in 1995 inview of the reduction in the promotionalmeasures in force for western Germany.
7In
1996 the total rose sharply to DM 100 billionalthough this was due to the fact that, fol-lowing a ruling of the Federal ConstitutionalCourt, the aid granted by a special fund topromote the use of coal for generating elec-tricity could no longer be financed through aspecial levy on electricity consumers (the“coal penny” levy). Instead, grants, initially ofDM 7.5 billion, are now paid out of the Fed-eral budget and have been shown ever sincein the Federal Government’s Subsidy Reports.The main reasons for the further increase inaid to DM 101 billion in 1997 are revised esti-
mates made in the Subsidy Report and a sub-stantial increase in the assistance provided forhousing. By 1999 the subsidy volume hadfallen slightly to just under DM 100 billion.Although it had been greater over the entireperiod than in 1991,
8its share of GDP de-
clined by12percentage point to 212%.
If the aid given by the Treuhand agency9to
enterprises in eastern Germany and the pay-ments made by the Federal Government forthe agency’s successor organisations are alsotaken into account, the aid granted rose fromDM 104 billion in 1991 to almost DM 124 bil-lion in 1994. After the Treuhand agency hadbeen dissolved at the end of 1994, paymentsmade to finance its work were reduced fromalmost DM 32 billion to about DM 1 billion.In 1999 the subsidy total as so defined wasDM 101 billion.

5Various sectors also received loans of just over DM 3 bil-

ERP Special Fund granted loans of DM 11 billion, and the
KfW authorised loans of DM 30 billion.
6In 1989 the volume of subsidies had amounted to DM
70 billion. The ratio to GDP , however, remained virtually
unchanged.
7Even so, the trend was distorted by a change in the re-
cording method in 1995. In the case of financial assist-
ance, payments for regional economic support and for
transport were reclassified. A substantial part of the re-
duction of almost DM 3 billion in financial assistance
from the Länder Governments in that year was probably
due to this and therefore does not imply a reduction in
subsidies.

promotion of coal to generate electricity.

Sub-sidies paid in western Germany were reducedfrom DM 59 billion to DM 48 billion between1991 and 1995 primarily as a result of the ex-piry following reunification of the promotion-al measures for the areas bordering the for-mer East Germany and of the substantial aidfor Berlin (West). This notably entailed thegradual reduction of the grant paid to em-ployed persons in Berlin (West) up to the endof 1994 and the reduction of the turnover taxconcession there up to the end of 1993 aseach of these fiscal measures had resulted inlost tax revenue of DM 3 billion in 1991. Inother areas, by contrast, there was no appre-ciable reduction in subsidies on the wholedespite the serious funding problems follow-
ing reunification.
Aid began to grow again in western Germany
in the second half of the nineties, rising toDM 61 billion by 1999. This was due not onlyto the inclusion of the coal subsidy but also toa sharp rise of almost DM 8 billion in tax con-cessions, notably those to promote housingconstruction, to finance exemptions from the“ecology tax” and to limit the income taxrate on business earnings. Financial assist-ance, by contrast, declined by just underDM 2 billion although this was due in part tothe transfer of financial items from thegovernment core budgets to off-budget ac-counts.

Two distinct periods can likewise be seen inthe trend in regionally classifiable subsidies ineastern Germany. Aid rose sharply until 1996(from just under DM 19 billion in 1991 to al-most DM 34 billion). Tax concessions, whichconsisted primarily of grants and special de-preciation allowances for investment in theeast, accounted for the bulk of this rise.

10In its 12th Subsidy Report Hesse, for example, points
out that since 1999 the grants for the construction of
flats for low-income groups have been almost fully met
from a special off-budgetary fund. In 1998 financial as-
sistance (including loans) of just over DM 450 million had
been recorded under this item. In its financial assistance
reports for the years 1996 to 1999 Rhineland-Palatinate,
too, mentions the outsourcing of functions, which prob-
ably explains the reduction in housing aid in that state by
just over DM 200 million in 1999. There has also been a
further reduction of just over DM 400 million since 1997

23tripled to almost DM 18 billion between 1991
and 1996.
Since 1997, by contrast, aid has declined sig-
nificantly (to DM 26 billion in 1999), primarilyas a result of the diminishing importance oftax concessions. The progressive curtailmentof special depreciation allowances up to theend of 1998 was the major factor here. Evenso, this entailed only a partial real reductionin the investment incentives applying to east-ern Germany because the special depreci-ation allowances were replaced by invest-ment grants. On balance, these have beenproviding more or less the same degree of in-centive but with far smaller short-term taxshortfalls because, in contrast to what hap-pened in the case of special depreciation al-lowances, enterprises no longer have to bearadditional burdens at a later date. Anotherreason for the decline in tax concessions wasthat wealth tax was abolished in westernGermany in 1997 and trade capital tax a yearlater. Neither of these had been levied in east-ern Germany, and so this had been tanta-mount to a subsidy there.
A sectoral breakdown of the subsidies grant-
ed by the Federal and Länder Governmentsand by the EU shows that these are concen-trated heavily on agriculture, housing, trans-port and coal mining. Between them, thesesectors received about two-thirds of the aidgranted in 1999.
Food, agriculture and forestry received aid
amounting to almost DM 25 billion in 1991.With the inclusion of eastern Germany in theEU’s agricultural market regulation scheme,the volume rose appreciably to just over
DM 28 billion in the following year but subse-quently declined again and has been stable atapproximately DM 20 billion since 1994. In1999 the EU’s expenditure on market guaran-tees predominated, at just over DM 12 billion.This expenditure is now primarily an incomessubsidy and varies according to the size of theagricultural business. It is paid as compensa-tion for income losses arising from price re-ductions which had been implemented from1992 to curb production incentives andthereby check existing surpluses of manyproducts. Expenditure on export subsidiesand storage also plays a role here. The mainreason for this expenditure is that the guaran-teed minimum prices of many agriculturalproducts are still above world market prices.

24As in the case of national aid, there is consid-
erable need for reform here.
Agricultural subsidies include aid for the pur-
chase of diesel fuel amounting to almostDM 1 billion a year. Supplementary assistanceis also paid to farmers working less favouredareas such as mountainous regions. The EUpays a grant, which is topped up by the Län-der Governments, for this purpose. In add-ition, the Federal Government makes a granttowards farmers’ accident insurance. Thisamounts to just over DM
12billion and holds
down their insurance premiums. However,the other aspects of agricultural social pol-icy,
11which include, above all, grants to the
farmers’ pension and health insuranceschemes and which, in the end, likewisebring financial relief to agricultural busi-nesses, are not shown in the Subsidy Reports.This additional expenditure amounted to justover DM 7 billion in 1999.
Housing subsidies
12grew fastest by far in the
nineties. These benefits doubled from justover DM 14 billion in 1991 to DM 28 billionin 1999. The increase was primarily due tothe tax concessions which were granted tohome buyers and which grew from just overDM 7 billion to more than DM 19 billion.Until 1996 this sharp rise had mainly takenthe form of growing tax shortfalls as a resultof the special allowance under section 10e ofthe Income Tax Act. The effective level of thisallowance depended on the marginal tax rateof the respective home buyer. The loss of rev-enue associated with this tax break increasedwith the sharply rising level of investment inhousing until the mid-nineties, a trend thatwas partly due to reunification. A flat-rate tax
grant for home owners, which is deductedfrom the beneficiary’s income tax liability andis independent of his individual tax rate, re-placed the special allowance for new applica-tions from 1996. In principle, this changeshould have had a largely neutral effect ontax revenue. Even so, tax shortfalls caused bythe promotion of home ownership continuedto grow, mainly because the volume of in-vestment began to expand again from 1997.A contributory factor, in addition to the de-clining interest rates until 1999, could be thatthe positive stimuli on the lower-incomegroups and families with children which re-sulted from the change in the form of thepromotion scheme had a greater effect thanthe negative impact in the upper income seg-ment where greater use had been made ofthe previous assistance scheme for homebuyers. Growth levelled out again last yearowing to the abolition of the deduction tocover preliminary expenses.
13Since the year
2000 tax shortfalls have been checked by thelowering of the income tax threshold forqualifying for the tax grant for home owners,which came into force at the beginning of2000, and by the downturn in construction.
Financial assistance for housing ceased to ex-

large part of these funds is used for buildingpublic housing estates. In 1999 the FederalGovernment alone spent DM 2 billion on this.It also grants interest subsidies to the KfW,which uses these funds to encourage borrow-ing to modernise dwellings and reduce heat-ing costs.

Throughout the period under review subsidiesamounting to approximately DM 5 billion ayear were granted to the transport sector.The turnover tax concession which is grantedto regional public transport played an import-ant role in this. In addition, the Länder Gov-ernments provided financial assistance to thecost of travel for schoolchildren and students.Transport subsidies do not include FederalGovernment aid to rail transport in the formof investment grants or interest-free loans,
payments to maintain regional public trans-port and the grants to the Federal RailwaysFund, which uses most of the money tofinance former railway officials’ non-contributory pensions. At almost DM 30 bil-lion, these benefits far exceeded the volumeof subsidies officially recorded in 1999.
Of the many subsidies paid to the remaining
sectors of trade and industry, not only themeasures to encourage investment in easternGermany but also the financial assistance tocoal-mining are of considerable importance.Expenditure by the Federal Government on1991

26the latter15declined by DM 1 billion to DM
212billion between 1991 and 1995. The cok-
ing grant, which reduces the price the steelindustry pays for domestic coal to that of im-ported coal, accounts for the largest share ofthis subsidy by far. In 1996 the coal subsidiespaid out of the Federal budget increased tojust under DM 10 billion as a result of theaforementioned inclusion of the assistancegranted to promote the use of coal for gener-ating electricity. They then began to declineslightly, amounting to DM 8.5 billion by1999. This was partly influenced by the “coalcompromise” which was agreed in 1997 andwhich sets fixed promotional budgets until2005, by which time these, in the case of theFederal Government, are to fall to just underDM 4 billion. As a result of pressure from theEU to restructure the support schemes, assist-ance to enable mines to close will play agreater role in the next few years.
Other trade and industry sectors still receiving
large subsidies at the beginning of the nine-ties were the aircraft industry and shipbuild-ing. In 1991, for example, subsidies paid outof the Federal budget for aircraft manufac-ture amounted to almost DM 1.4 billion. Inview of the increasing success in selling Air-bus aircraft, aid for the sector had been virtu-ally discontinued by 1998. Federal aid forshipbuilding has also been significantly re-duced. At the end of the period under reviewit amounted to just under DM 0.3 billion,which was one-half of the subsidy level in1991.
The exemptions from the extension of energy
tax and its progressive increase since April1999 will have a relatively strong impact on
the overall trend in subsidies for trade and in-dustry in the next few years. Prominent ex-amples are tax concessions for the producingsector and for agriculture, which have to payonly 20% of the normal rate of electricity taxand of the increase in mineral oil tax rates forheating purposes. The aim of these measuresis to safeguard the competitiveness of energy-intensive sectors in Germany and, conse-quently, to avoid the transfer of productionabroad. In 1999 exemption arrangementsprobably resulted in tax revenue lossesamounting to approximately DM 3 billion.
16
There is likely to be an almost three-fold risein this amount by 2003 as a result of the fu-ture increases already approved.
The tax rate limit on business earnings intro-
duced in 1994 also played an important role,leading to tax shortfalls of just over DM 4 bil-lion in 1999. To limit the additional burdenthat the trade tax is having on such earningsthe top rate of income tax has been reducedby 8 percentage points. In 2001 this measurewill be replaced by the off-setting of trade taxagainst the income tax liability. This reformwill result in a further sharp rise in tax revenuelosses. Considered strictly in income taxterms, this measure is tantamount to a con-cession, but looking at the total tax burdenon business profits, it may be regarded as a

27reduction in the additional tax burden com-
pared with other forms of income.
Regarding the other forms of aid, the tax ex-
emption on wage and salary increments forworking on Sundays, public holidays and atnight is of particular importance. It is esti-mated that tax shortfalls as a result of thisprivilege totalled about DM 3.5 billion in1999. Turnover tax concessions due to alower levy on certain goods and services areanother major factor in this category.

Problems of subsidy controls,and outlook
The Federal Government’s Subsidy Reports
list the aims of the subsidies but do not definethem precisely enough to enable a sufficientlyaccurate analysis to be made of the effective-ness of their application. This makes it diffi-cult to evaluate their cost-effectiveness.
18
If the effectiveness of subsidies is inadequate-ly monitored, there is a general danger thatthe use of subsidies could spread. Recipientgroups benefit greatly from the aid grantedand resist any attempt to reduce it. As long asthe unproductiveness of a form of aid cannotbe unequivocally proven, those vested inter-ests dominate the political process at the ex-pense of the majority, who, individually, areonly marginally affected by the additionallevy burden resulting from a specific subsidy.This set of circumstances encourages the ex-pansion of aid. This leads to a rise in the gen-eral levy burden, which, in turn, curbs eco-nomic growth. The strict monitoring of sub-sidies is therefore essential because of the as-
sociated pressure to justify measures. How-ever, this monitoring should not only coverthe degree of success in achieving objectivesbut should also take account of the funds ap-plied and the negative macroeconomic reper-cussions associated with the subsidies.
In view of the desired reduction in subsidies,
the monitoring of aid by the European Com-mission is growing in importance. The author-ity granted by the EU Treaty to avert impedi-ments to economic transactions betweenmember states is being interpreted increas-ingly more liberally so that it now puts furtherlimits on the granting of aid. Not only privateenterprises are being monitored; capital in-vestment and the offsetting of losses by pub-lic corporations are also being scrutinised. Aidwhich does not conform to EU norms has tobe refunded with interest by the beneficiaries(see the box showing the European Commis-sion’s subsidy controls on page 28). This couldlead to the recipients of subsidies losing inter-est in grants and allowances that weredubious under European law, thus encour-aging the reduction of subsidies.
17In this context it is difficult to understand the defin-
ition used in the Subsidy Reports. While, for example, the
reduced VAT rate for cultural and entertainment services
as well as for technical services in dentistry is recorded as
aid, other concessions are not taken into account. This
applies both to other tax concessions (on, for example,
food) and to all special tax exemptions. These are either
not recorded at all (for example, tax exemptions on hous-
ing rents and on banking services) in the Subsidy Reports
or are shown only as a memo item (Annex 3). While indi-
vidual EU member states are free to decide whether they
take advantage of the concessionary options laid down
in the Sixth EC directive on value added tax harmonisa-
tion, the tax exemptions allowed can be reduced only by
an amendment to the directive.

marks on financial management as far back as 1996. See

28Subsidy controls by the European Commission
Subsidy controls by the European Commission
make considerable inroads into the economicpolicy sovereignty of the EU member states.These controls are part and parcel of the Com-mission’s task, in its capacity as the guardian ofthe treaties, to safeguard the orderly function-ing of the single market. Accordingly, far-reaching powers in the fields of cartel law, mer-ger control and state aid (subsidies) are assignedto it in the section of the EU Treaty on competi-tion. According to Article 87 (1), state aid whichfavours certain undertakings or the productionof certain goods is forbidden, in principle, inso-far as it affects trade between member states.This applies regardless of the type of subsidy orof whether a favoured enterprise is participatingin intra-Community trade. It is sufficient forthere to be an economic advantage whichwould entail a competitive disadvantage forenterprises domiciled in other member states.The Commission is not required to quantify thedistorting effects on competition in individualcases but, instead, can use the general character-istics of state aid programmes as a basis for itsdecisions.
1
A number of exceptions restrict the significanceof this subsidy ban, however. Agriculture is vir-tually exempt from the rules on competition (Ar-ticle 36). Among other permissible exemptionsare subsidies aimed at assisting economically dis-advantaged regions as well as those for promot-ing culture, small and medium-sized businesses,research and development, employment andeducation as well as the environment and re-structuring. Public or publicly controlled enter-prises which provide services of general interestlikewise enjoy a special position (Article 86 (2)).
Under the control procedure (Article 88) the
member states are required to inform the Com-mission before granting any new aid or reorgan-ising existing aid (notification). The measuremust not be implemented until it has been ap-proved by the Commission or until the (relativelyshort) period allowed for its rejection has ex-pired. If the Commission has doubts about thelegality of a subsidy, it institutes the major inves-
tigation procedure set forth in Article 88 (2),which encompasses opinions from those directlyinvolved and from other parties. The Commis-sion’s final decision consists in either discontinu-ing the procedure or in pronouncing a negativeverdict which declares the aid to be unlawful.The member state concerned is required to recallany unlawful aid already granted (including in-terest from the time it was granted) from thebeneficiary enterprise. An appeal to the Euro-pean Court of Justice against the Commission’sdecision is possible. However, this has no post-poning effect on the obligation on the part ofthe member state concerned to retrieve the aidpaid. Even if the decisions taken by the Court ofJustice do not always favour the Commission,the Court tends to support the Commission’sstance on subsidy restriction.
It is important for the effectiveness of subsidy
control that third parties – as a rule non-benefi-ciary competitors – can also ask the Commissionto investigate state aid or seek an injunction di-rectly in the national courts.
Decisions taken by the European Commission
and directly affecting Germany include thoseagainst subsidies for production plant owned byVolkswagen in Saxony
2and the capital injec-
tions made by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia to Westdeutsche Landesbank.
3In
the first case, only part of the aid was unlawfulbecause, in principle, aid granted to compensatefor the economic disadvantages caused by thedivision of Germany is permissible. The extent ofthe increase in production capacity thereby as-sisted, however, was seen as distorting competi-tion in the light of total production capacity inthe European car industry. In the second case,the Commission held that North Rhine-Westpha-lia, as the creditor, was not charging a market-related rate of interest, and this was consideredto be giving Westdeutsche Landesbank, owingto the significant improvement in its own capitalbase, an inadmissible competitive advantageover other banks.

29General fiscal policy requirements are also
tending to reduce the volume of subsidies.Despite the achievements over the past fewyears, there is still enormous pressure on gen-eral government to consolidate its budgets. Ifgovernments are to meet their obligationunder the European Stability and GrowthPact to achieve a budget close to balance orin surplus in the medium term and, in add-ition, to lower rates of tax and other levies,public expenditure must be strictly controlledand tax concessions reduced. The strict cri-teria which should apply to granting subsid-ies, as discussed above, are another reasonwhy the call for a vigorous reduction, espe-
cially in the principal recipient areas, remainson the fiscal policy agenda. The coal com-promise of March 1997 is a major step in theright direction. According to its medium-termfiscal plans, the Federal Government intendsto reduce its total financial aid to approxi-mately DM 13 billion by the year 2004 (com-pared with just over DM 21 billion in 1999).By contrast, there could be a rise in the vol-ume of tax concessions, partly because of thegrowing importance of exemptions from en-ergy taxation which is to continue rising until2003.

31The price effects of
deregulation andprivatisation in theproduct marketsIn recent years, broad areas of mains-
related public utilities in Germany havebeen gradually deregulated and, inpart, privatised following the imple-mentation of the EU single market pro-gramme. Behind these developmentsis the perception, which is gainingground, that product markets whichare free from government constraintsand rigid conditions are, in the longrun, best able to supply ranges ofreasonably-priced goods that meet cus-tomers’ needs. That also benefits thelabour market. The first step was the re-lease of telecommunications from thegovernment-controlled or -organisedmonopoly system; it was followed bythe energy market, with electricity andgas. A further step is pending in thearea of traditional postal services, withthe abolition of the letter monopoly.The opening-up of water supplies, ofrail-related transport and of local pub-lic transport is also under discussion.
In the market for telecommunication
products and services, burgeoningcompetition has resulted in sharp pricefalls. In the electricity industry, someestablished suppliers have reducedtheir prices substantially. In the gasindustry, deregulation may likewisehave significant effects on prices. Thepresent article traces major develop-ments in the aforementioned indus-tries, and describes the associated pricechanges, insofar as they are currentlydiscernible.

1generally consti-
tute an element that is foreign to the system.As a rule, they engender substantial econom-ic (opportunity) costs, on regulatory and allo-cative grounds. According to this underlyingperception, deregulation and privatisationenhance macroeconomic efficiency. More-over, the potential of technological innov-ations can be exploited more effectively if theweb of government constraints is at leastthinned out and cut back.

Since about the mid-nineties, the propensityin Germany to open up hitherto largely closedmarkets has gained ground. Major consider-ations were included in the Deregulation Re-port drawn up by the Federal Economics Min-istry, in which attention was drawn to rele-vant measures and plans for a number of sec-tors, ranging from the railways and local pub-lic passenger transport to genetic engineer-ing. Telecommunications were an initial focusof deregulation efforts since, in that sector,strong growth stimuli were to be expected,not only for telecommunications itself, butalso indirectly for the rest of the economy.Notably the Commission of the EuropeanCommunities advocated the opening-up ofthat market sector, in order to avert competi-tive distortions in the single EU market.
3In
1993 the Council of the European Union de-cided to liberalise public voice telephony byJanuary 1, 1998. At the end of 1994, theground was prepared for the deregulation ofthe telecommunications infrastructure. InGermany, that paved the way for the three-
stage reform of Deutsche Bundespost.
In the field of mains-related sources of en-
ergy, too, the European Commission impart-ed a strong stimulus to deregulation and en-hanced competition. After thorough prepara-tory work, which started back in the mid-eighties and was aimed at creating a singleEuropean market for energy, the Green Book“Towards an energy policy of the EuropeanUnion” was approved in 1995. At the be-ginning of 1997, the EU Electricity MarketDirective, which required member statesto issue appropriate implementing orders andamend their legislation as necessary byFebruary 1999, came into effect. In Germany,the Act against Restraints of Competitionwas thereupon amended early in 1998 andthe legislation governing the energy sectorwas restructured. Since then, but for a fewexceptions, the ground rules of competitionhave governed the German electricity mar-ket.
In addition, the liberalisation of the gas indus-
try was initiated by the EU Gas Directive dat-ing from autumn 1998. In the middle of thepresent year, the business associations con-cerned, chaired by the Federal EconomicsMinister, agreed to shape access to naturalgas mains in a non-discriminatory fashion,

33and to define general rules for the use of
those mains. To enable households and smalltraders to benefit from the opening-up of thegas market, what are known as “load pro-files”, i.e. specific consumption patterns, areto be defined before long. In the view of theEconomics Ministry, that could be in less thanone year.
Right up to the end of the period under
review, it has primarily been European ini-tiatives that have triggered deregulationschemes, in the sense of deepening the singleEuropean market. Only recently, the Euro-pean Parliament has spoken out in favour ofa progressive liberalisation of rail traffic in theEuropean Union. According to that sugges-tion, member states are to be required toopen up their rail networks to foreign railwayoperators. It is also planned largely to privat-ise local public passenger transport.
But most of these projects have so far only
been statements of intent, and are likely totake concrete shape, or be implemented,only in the next few years. For telecommuni-cations, data transmission and electricity gen-eration, however, initial conclusions can al-ready be drawn. From the standpoint of thecentral bank, it is primarily the effects of de-regulation on prices that are of interest.
Telecommunication market
Deregulation in the telecommunication sector
began with the splitting-up of the formermonopoly enterprise Deutsche Bundespost.In several stages – known as “BundespostReforms I, II and III”, in 1989, 1994 and 1996
– the three business fields “Yellow PostOffice” (letter and parcel post), “postal bank-ing” (post office giro and post office savingsbank) and “Grey Post Office” (telecommuni-cations) were formed and granted organisa-tional and financial autonomy. The deregula-tion process in the field of the Yellow Post Of-fice, and particularly in that of the Grey PostOffice, is being supervised and managed bythe specially established Regulatory Authorityfor Telecommunications and Postal Services.The function of this official supervisory bodyis “To foster competition and ensure appro-priate and adequate services throughout Ger-many...”.
4For the telecommunication sector,
the principal issues are market access and thelicensing of new competitors, the safeguard-ing of a minimum range of services and ascale of charges. Added to these are regula-tions on access and on interconnections inthe telephone network, which hitherto hasmostly been the property of the old monopol-ist, even if new competitors are now pushingforward. This list of functions reflects the factthat the telecommunication market is not byany means fully liberalised as yet, and thatthe Regulatory Authority has a key role toplay in strengthening competition.
As early as the first stage of deregulation in
1989, the market for telecommunicationequipment was decontrolled. However, it isdifficult to reconstruct how the consumerprices of those goods responded after theending of the postal monopoly. After all, the

34official statistics added such products to the
price survey only upon the recalculation ofthe index with the base-year 1995. Anyway,it can be said that the prices of telephone andtelefax equipment (including repairs) havepractically halved in the past five years. Thedecline in the market has actually been some-what steeper if it is borne in mind that therate of value-added tax was raised from 15%to 16% in April 1998.
In the field of voice telephony, Deutsche
Telekom lost its monopoly position early in1998. Its privileged position in the area ofnetwork infrastructure was relinquished backin autumn 1996. Initial licences for mobilephones were awarded to Telekom’s competi-tors at the beginning of the nineties. Thatmeant that the market was largely openedup, and many new competitors began tocompete with Telekom. According to theRegulatory Authority, around 300 Class 4 li-cences, which relate to voice telephone ser-vices, and over 500 Class 3 licences, relatingto transmission lines, had been issued by themiddle of the present year.
Owing to the mounting competition, some
perceptible price adjustments occurred. Theyhad started at the beginning of the decade,when, with the splitting-up of Deutsche Bun-despost, the cross-subsidisation of generalpostal services by earnings from long-distanceand international phone calls came to anend. In the wake of deregulation, fewer andfewer such earnings were available to sub-sidise local calls, since the profit margins onlong-distance and international calls, in par-ticular, were squeezed. Moreover, massiveproductivity gains were recorded, for one
thing by Telekom itself, and for another as aresult of the emergence of new suppliers inthe market.
As regards price movements for telecommu-
nication services at the consumer level, newdetailed figures from the official statisticshave been available since 1995. At that time,the price survey was adjusted to the changedconsumption pattern. Since then, both thenew suppliers in the fixed phone networkand in the mobile phone sector have beentaken into account. (For details, see page 35.)According to the figures, in the mobile phonesector prices have dropped by around three-fifths during the past five years. The adjust-ments in the prices of international calls weresimilarly pronounced. The price reductions forlong-distance calls within Germany fell only alittle short of that, although they suggest thatthe price cuts were all the smaller, the shorterthe distance of the calls was. Local calls at theconsumer level have actually become muchmore expensive since the middle of the pastdecade, in several steps. Last autumn, accord-ing to the official statistics, they exceeded thelevel of 1995 by almost one-quarter. Thatowed something to the introduction of theturnover-tax liability on telephone servicesfrom January 1, 1996, which superseded theformer lump-sum payment by the Bundes-post to the Federal budget, and which is acomponent of consumer prices.

more, Telekom has adjusted the charge leviedfrom public telephone boxes. In addition, the

accordance with “Laspeyres fixed-base approach”.
“The object of that approach is the measurement
of ’pure’ price movements with a constant quantity
component over a medium length of time”, nor-
mally encompassing five years. At the end of each
such period, “there is a fundamental revision of the
index, with the ’basket of goods’ also being up-dated”.
1
If – as is not unlikely in the case of deregulations
and liberalisation measures – rapid and strong
changes in consumption patterns or in the supplier
structure occur, the fixed-base approach poses the
risk of a distorted presentation of the inflation
rate. 2That is so if new low-price competitors are
not taken into account, or if the traditional sup-
pliers adjust their prices only after significant losses
of market shares have taken place.
If such changes in the market are not taken into
consideration, the inflation rate is initially shown
too high, and later, after the old suppliers have re-
duced their prices, too low. Moreover, the old sup-
pliers are sometimes able to stabilise their market
shares even when a positive price gap vis-à-vis their
competitors remains. Frequently, after all, a change
to a new supplier involves costs, the requisite mar-
ket overview can be obtained only with appreciable
effort, or the quality of the new services is lower be-
cause, for instance, capacity bottlenecks arise. Only
in ideal circumstances does the price difference ob-
taining between the old and the new market
players precisely match the monetary equivalent of
such a difference.
By way of example, the impact of different index
approaches on price measurement can be illus-
trated by means of a model calculation. As a simpli-
fication, in the initial period prior to the appear-
ance of the new competitors in the market, a ficti-tious price is entered at which the demand it ac-
counts for is virtually zero.
As is to be expected, a distinct difference in the out-
come emerges between the Laspeyres index andthe Paasche index. The Fisher index, which constitu-
tes a combination of the Laspeyres and the Paasche
indices, can additionally illustrate the significance
of the index method in intertemporal price compa-
risons, especially during periods of pronounced de-
regulation effects.
Because of the deregulation of the telecommunica-
tion sector, the Federal Statistical Office has devised
a new consumer price index for telecommunication
services that takes due account of the new condi-
tions and better reflects the increased complexity of
price movements in that sector.
1The weighting
pattern was derived from data supplied by Deut-
sche Telekom AG for 1996. Since January 1999, the
prices charged by the new telephone companies for
domestic calls and, since January 2000, also those
charged for international calls and for connections
to mobile phone networks, have been included. For
domestic calls, an average price covering severalsuppliers has been computed. The upshot of this
has been that, firstly because of the structural effect
and secondly on account of price cuts by Deutsche
Telekom AG, the new index has worked out sub-
stantially lower than that of December 1998.

braucherpreisindex für Telekommunikationsdienstleistun-gen auf Basis 1995 (Recalculation of the consumer price in-

36charges for connection and basic charges
have recently been running about one-tenthabove the level ruling in mid-decade.
According to calculations by the Regulatory
Authority for Telecommunication and PostalServices, in mid-2000 a domestic Germantelephone call in the fixed network cost be-tween 85% and almost 90% less than in1997, the last year prior to the complete lib-eralisation of the voice telephone service. Thespread reflects slightly divergent develop-ments at different times of day. The prices re-late to the most favourable supplier chosenfor the call (standard rate without discount,“call by call”). International calls have alsofallen dramatically in price. For instance, a callto the United States in July 2000, utilising thecheapest offer, was over nine-tenths cheaperthan at the end of 1997. For calls tothe United Kingdom, the price advantageamounted to about 90%; for calls to France,Austria and a number of other countries, theadvantage was hardly smaller.
But the findings of the Regulatory Authority
probably overstate the price reduction, inas-much as they assume the extreme case of theexploitation of all possible advantages, whichis hardly representative. Firstly, the scales ofcharges are meanwhile very diverse, from theviewpoint of the consumer not easy to takein, and subject to frequent changes, so thatongoing careful monitoring is necessary. Sec-ondly, any change from one company to an-other may entail some special administrativearrangements, which often acts as a deter-rent.1995 = 100, log. scale

37Judging by the data from the official statistics,
the price cuts in the telephone sector haveperceptibly dampened overall consumer-pricemovements in the past few years. Excludingthe telecommunication sector, i.e. excludingtelephone and telefax equipment and exclud-ing telephone, telefax and telegraphic ser-vices, the rise in the consumer-price indexof all households between 1995 and todaywould in the aggregate have been about
12percentage point larger. Households’ ex-
penditure budgets have likewise benefiteddistinctly from the price reductions. The na-tional accounts show that private individualsspent around DM 48
12billion on communi-
cation in 1999. For lack of any more detailedsubdivision, this sum includes postal servicesand private courier services as well as tele-phone services, but that probably does notdistort the picture unduly. In 1995, consumerexpenditure in the communication sector wassome DM 10 billion lower. In real terms, i.e.at 1995 prices, expenditure in 1999 exceededthe level of the base year by over DM 20 bil-lion, or distinctly more than one-half. Thus,on account of the sharp price reductions, theincrease in spending remained perceptiblysmaller than the simultaneous marked expan-sion of consumption. In many cases, the pricecuts presumably triggered additional de-mand, and thus greatly fostered the rapid ex-pansion of new products in the market. Thisis also suggested by the fact that, in recentyears, communication has been among thefastest-growing sectors in the German econ-omy.
There is also major potential for price reduc-
tions in the field of local calls in the fixed net-work, known as the “last mile”, in which
Deutsche Telekom continues to have a dom-inant position in the market. The use of thecable network, which hitherto has chieflybeen employed for television transmissions,to transmit telephone calls has frequentlybeen discussed; radio connections have alsobeen contemplated. Moreover, some researchactivity has been directed towards the useof domestic electricity mains for communi-cation purposes. The Regulatory Authorityhas required Deutsche Telekom to grant com-petitors “unbundled” access to subscriber-connecting lines. “Unbundled” means thatan outside company can rent from Telekomthe “last mile” for a customer changing to it-self from Telekom without having to resort toadditional connection engineering.
Electricity market
The deregulation of the electricity market
started only a few years ago. Under the im-pact of the deadlines set by the EuropeanCommission, the sixth amendment of the Actagainst Restraints of Competition was passedearly in 1998; it was followed in the spring ofthe same year by the restructuring of thelegislation governing the energy industry. Inthis way, the legislature ended the electricityindustry’s exemption from cartel law, andmade it subject to competition. The areamonopolies which had existed until then, ran-ging from large supra-regional public utilities,via regional suppliers, to municipal power sta-tions, have now been broken up. Permissionto conclude licensing agreements with exclu-sive terms has been revoked. On the question

38of access to the electricity mains, which is a
matter of particular importance given the ne-cessity of a network and the fact that electri-city cannot readily be stored, the legislatureopted for what is known as “negotiated net-work access”, i.e. access on a contractualbasis. In contrast to the telecommunicationsector, no particular supervisory authority wasset up in order to introduce and safeguardcompetition. Instead, the government is rely-ing on agreements between electricity produ-cers, network operators and consumers. Twosuch agreements have now been signed; themost recent has been in force since early2000. It includes provisions on network ac-cess, scales of charges and the consumptionpatterns of households over time.
The institution of open markets at the same
time fosters the setting-up of electricity ex-changes. At present, Leipzig and Frankfurtare exchange centres. In this respect, Ger-many is following the example set by othercountries, in which such trading platformshave existed for some time. Europe’s largestelectricity exchange at present, the Scandi-navian NordPool, links up the countries ofNorway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark. Ap-proximately one-quarter of all the electricityconsumed in that region (other than in Den-mark) is traded daily through that exchange.
Competition in the German electricity sector
has increased perceptibly as a result of de-regulation. The previously earned monopolyreceipts have been reduced, and profit mar-gins have narrowed distinctly. That appliesparticularly to the major electricity producers,but less to the local suppliers at municipallevel. Some of them have admittedly lost
their autonomy, and have been sold tosupra-regional public utilities. Others, how-ever, have amalgamated into larger units andnegotiated better delivery terms from theirelectricity suppliers. They have benefited fromthe fact that they own the local networks,and thus the connections to households(comparable to Deutsche Telekom, with its in-fluence over the “last mile”). In some cases,there has been opposition to the transmissionof “outside electricity” to households thathave changed to new lower-priced suppliers.Only when competition-law proceedings hadbeen held before the Federal Cartel Officeand court rulings had been issued was anopening of the market possible.
Hitherto, households have taken little advan-
tage of the option of changing to a lower-priced supplier. According to press reports,only 2% to 3% of final consumers haveavailed themselves of that option. Firstly (assurveys have shown), this is because manyconsumers fear delays in processing their ap-plications, faulty invoices, or even “shady”suppliers. Moreover, not a few householdsfind it difficult to gain an overview over thedifferent scales of charges of the greatly en-larged number of suppliers. Secondly, manyof the traditional regional electricity suppliershave now started to offer lower chargesthemselves. In particular, some municipal sup-pliers that do not generate any electricity oftheir own are taking advantage of cheap in-puts from major electricity producers and arepassing on at least part of their lower pur-chase prices to their customers.

39According to the consumer price index for all
households, in autumn 2000 electricity pricesat the consumer level were just as high as atthe beginning of 1998, when liberalisationbegan. It would, however, be wrong to inferfrom this that deregulation has so far had noeffects at all on prices at the consumer level.Rather, it should be borne in mind that, sincethen, several government measures havebeen taken which have pushed up prices.Specifically, those measures were the raisingof the value-added-tax rate from 15% to16% as from April 1, 1998 and tax burdensin the context of the ecological tax reform.An electricity tax at the rate of 2 Pfennige perKilowatt hour was introduced with effectfrom April 1, 1999. On January 1, 2000 thattax went up by a further 0.5 Pfennig perkWh; further increases by 0.5 Pfennig eachhave already been approved for the yearsfrom 2001 to 2003 under the Act Continuingthe Ecological Tax Reform.
The object of the additional energy taxation is
“[to raise the price of] energy in moderatesteps in order to provide an economic incen-tive for taking advantage of existing energy-saving potentials, for resorting increasingly torenewable energy sources and for conservingfinite resources.”
6Altogether, between 1998
and today, the cost of electricity to house-holds has risen by an estimated one-tenth asa result of tax measures. Against the back-ground of international commitments to re-duce the level of CO
2emissions, further cost-
enhancing measures have been taken veryrecently. For instance, under the RenewableEnergies Act, the minimum remuneration forelectricity generated by wind power, by solarpower, by water power, or by means of tip
gas, mine gas, sewage gas or biomass, andfed into the mains, was raised dramaticallywith effect from April 1, 2000. Moreover,under the Act to Protect the Linking of Powerand Heat, which came into effect on May 18,2000, the protection of such generation for alimited period was introduced, especiallyamong municipal public utilities. The increasein the cost of electricity that has been reflect-ed recently in the consumer price statisticsowes something to all these provisions.Whether and, if so, to what extent, theagreement reached between the FederalGovernment and power station operators ona gradual withdrawal from nuclear energywill have any impact on electricity prices isnot clear at present.
Enterprises have benefited distinctly more
than households from the price cuts in thewake of deregulation. According to the offi-cial statistics on industrial producer prices,electricity prices in that sector in Octo-ber 2000 were about 17% lower than at theend of 1997, although government interven-tion exerted an impact in that area, too.Specifically, customers with special contracts,who normally consume large quantities ofelectricity, were able to negotiate better-than-average supply conditions. In that case,the statistics show a fall of about one-fifth inprices. For industrial enterprises as a whole,price reductions of around 13% wereregistered. In agriculture, by contrast, ratesdropped perceptibly less, at only 2%, al-

40though this development was rather more
favourable than that among households. Afeature common to all customers was thatthe period of declining prices now seems tohave tapered off, and has latterly given wayto price rises.
Gas market
Much as in the electricity sector, the prime
stimuli to deregulation in the gas industrycame – as mentioned above – from the Euro-pean Union. In May 1998 the Council of En-ergy Ministers adopted the EU Gas Directive,in which a gradual opening-up of the marketsis laid down. Thereupon the German legisla-ture safeguarded the right to unimpeded net-work access, as part of the Act Against Re-straints to Competition. Moreover, the gas in-dustry was subjected to the general provisionsof cartel law, and the special provisions thathad applied until then (under which area mon-opolies were admissible) were revoked. Thatmeasure was intended to ensure unimpededaccess to natural gas mains, and to permitthe free construction of such mains. Underthe auspices of the Federal Economics Minis-ter, “ground rules” for the transmission ofgas and the level of charges were agreed in avoluntary accord between the associations ofsuppliers and customers, which rules cameinto force in the middle of this year and willbe effective until the end of September 2001.Hitherto, however, only large-scale customershave been able to take advantage of thataccord since the “load profiles” needed forinvoicing households have not yet been com-piled.

41existence of an open market, statements
about the price effects of deregulation in thismarket segment are not yet possible.
For the pricing of gas, it is fundamentally of
significance that the main area of use of thissource of energy is the heating market,where it competes primarily with lightheating-oil, and partly also with district heat-ing, coal and electricity. For that reason, andbecause of the heavy investment required ingas mains and gas storage capacities (suchinvestment pays for itself only in the longrun), following the advance of gas in the six-ties and seventies, gas prices were coupled tothe price movements of crude oil or lightheating-oil. Another reason why this develop-ment was obvious is that many producerssupply oil and gas alike, and, in principle, theprices are coupled to each other via a heatequivalent. In connection with deregulation,it follows from this that the level of the rawmaterial price is largely fixed. On the otherhand, room for manoeuvre exists, apart fromthe profit margin, in transport, storage anddistribution costs between the numerous sup-pliers, which are often controlled or licensedby local authorities, whose areas are trad-itionally distinguished from one another bydemarcation contracts.
The coupling of gas prices to heating-oil
prices implies that the sometimes sharp fluc-tuations in oil prices are also reflected in gasprices. Very recently, for instance, there havebeen some sharp price rises in both sectors. Ifinternational oil prices go down again in thecourse of the coming year in the light of anincreasing supply, gas prices will likewise re-1995 = 100, log. scale

presumably be difficult to distinguish deregu-lation influences from oil-price effects. Takingthe example of electricity, it has already be-come evident that distinction is possible onlywith the aid of ancillary calculations under
specific assumptions. Relatively precise com-putations are possible in the telecommunica-tion sector.

44Electronicbankingasasegment
ofelectroniccommerce
Electronic banking (referred to hereafter as
“e-banking”) isa key s egment of electroniccommerce (“e-commerce”), which, in turn,encompasses all types of business transactedthrough electronic networks. Electronic chan-nels are used for both business-to-businessand business-to-customer transactions, suchasordering goods , delivering s oftware or pay-ing for such transactions. E-banking is con-sidered to be a segment of e-commerce tothe extent that banksare involved in the con-duct of business transactions via electronicmedia; other non-banking financial productsand services (e.g. insurance), not to mentionproducts and services from other sectors ofbusiness, may be sold electronically as well.
1
In other words, e-banking is not a bankingproduct; rather, it describes the way trans-actionsare conducted. Nowadays , in fact,banksare involved in e-commerce in a varietyof ways, including cooperation with Inter-net service providers (ISPs), the issuing ofe-money or the execution of payments.
Since the current importance of e-commerce
and its growth prospects have been exhaust-ively analysed in various studies (see, for ex-ample, the chartson page 45), they will notbe discussed in this article. Nearly all researchon this subject suggests that e-commerce willhave a huge potential for growth in the com-ing years. Most of these forecasts, though,presuppose the existence of secure and effi-cient settlement systems.The terms“PC banking”, “online banking”,
“Internet banking”, “telephone banking” or“mobile banking” refer to a multitude ofwaysin which cus tomerscan acces stheirbanks without having to be physically presentat a bank branch. E-banking may be under-stood as a catch-all term which covers the dif-ferent ways of transacting banking businesselectronically. At the moment, the attentionof banking supervisors is focused on theincreasing digitalisation of retail business.Wholesale services, most of which is beingconducted electronically, isgoverned by otherbusiness and prudential requirements and willnot be discussed in this article.
“PC banking” isthe term us ed for banking
business transacted from a customer’s PC.The exchange of data involved, for instance,in the transmission of orders for credit trans-fersto the bank iseffected via phone lines(either analog – by modem – or using anISDN adapter). Basically, there are two typesof PC banking.
The first type is online banking,
2in which
bank transactions are conducted withinclosed networks. The customer needs special-ised software provided by his bank. This typeof PC banking could already be found in Ger-many in the early eighties(known then asthe

ment systems”, as well as in a discussion paper of the

(5/99), “Network money asa medium of exchange”.
2Often, for simplicity the general public and some of the
relevant literature use the term “online banking” to
mean Internet banking aswell. The term “online ac-

fice). The second type is Internet banking,which German bankshave been offeringsince the mid-nineties, although the onlyproduct they were offering at the time wasinformation. Unlike closed networks, Internetbanking permitsthe cus tomer to conducttransactions from any terminal with access tothe Internet.
Mobile banking isa vivid example of how the
linesbetween the variousformsof e-bankingare becoming increasingly blurred. Thanks tonew transmission technologies such as WAP(wireless application protocol), portable ter-minals such as mobile phones, personal digit-al assistants (PDAs) or small hand-held PCsare providing bank customers with access tothe Internet and thuspaving the way to Inter-net banking. Asa res ult, Internet banking hasbecome more than just a form of PC bank-ing.
The general tendency, encouraged by mobile
commerce, isfor the Internet and telecom-munication sectors to converge, giving banksa further – wireless – access channel for con-ducting banking business. However, the useof mobile terminalsiss till in itsinfancy. Theslower transmission speed of the WAP stand-ard and the limited amount of informationavailable are just two of the factors inhibitingthe use of those terminals.
This has led some pundits to dismiss WAP as
merely an interim standard which, in themedium term, will likely be superseded bythe much faster UMTS (universal mobile tele-communication system) standard. The large

Business considerations behind
e-banking
Commercial banks which successfully meet
thechallengesposedbytechnologicalchangewill find a multitude of new opportunities toexpandtheirmarketposition.First,thedigita-lisationoftransactionsmakesitpossibletore-duce costs and increase efficiency, althoughextensive investment in information technol-ogy (IT) will initially be required. Whereassome years ago ITadvances were mainly ex-pected to cut internal business costs, today
the goal is to use technology to make theentire range of business operations more effi-cient.
One ancillary effect of technological progress
is the continuingtendency towards increasedstandardisation of bankingproducts andservices. This trend, known as “commodisa-tion”, may have positive implications forbanks in the form of potential efficiencygains,althoughcustomerloyaltymaywellde-creasefurtherinthewakeofintensifiedcom-petition.
Second, Internet banking, in particular, will
allow credit institutions to make further in-roads into new fields, acting, for example, ascertification authorities
3on electronic mar-
ketplaces. This reveals one of the positivesides of increasingcompetition. By cooperat-ing, for example, with ISPs, telecoms, soft-ware manufacturers or other non-banks, fastand flexible banks may take advantage of“cross-sellingeffects” to offer personalisedsolutions to their customers and so will bebetter able to capitalise on existingcustomerpotentialandtowinovernewcustomers.Electronic forms of

47Third, bankscan reach out to new and at-
tractive customer segments. According to acurrent market research study,
4nearly one-
third of domestic residents between the agesof 14 and 69 log on to the Internet at leastoccasionally, and this group is increasinglyusing the Internet in order to conduct bank-ing transactions. This customer segment is ofparticular interest to banks since Internetusers, as determined by the study, have anabove-average level of education and arelocated, more importantly, in the higher-income brackets.
Fourth, exploiting the potential of the Inter-
net – by participating in portals
5, for instance
– will facilitate cooperation with partnersfrom the banking and non-banking sectors,to whose websites links can be set up. Out-sourcing makes it possible for partners tofocuson their core competencies .
Finally, within the limitss et by data and con-
sumer protection requirements, the electronictransaction of business opens the door fordata mining in order to detect payment pat-terns, for instance. This, in turn, enablesbanksto offer one-to-one banking s ervicesonce they have established such databasesand developed data mining strategies; in thistype of banking, customers are offered per-sonalised products and services based ontheir customer profiles.

48According to a new market research study,7
already 39% of German Internet users are
engaged in Internet banking or online bank-ing. Another 27% of Internet users said theyhad seriously considered the possibility ofe-banking on their PCs. The trend towardsgreater use of the Internet has also been con-firmed by figurespublis hed by the FederalStatistical Office
8on the amount of new in-
formation technology equipment to be foundin households. This hardware is being usedmore and more for logging on to the Inter-net. On the whole, the share of householdswith Internet access has more than doubledover the last two years and is currently justshy of 30%.
The productsand s ervicesnow being offered
electronically are still restricted, in the main,to those areas which lend themselves to
being sold electronically thanks to their highdegree of standardisation (account-keeping/payments, securities transactions and infor-mation gathering). Other services or transac-tions which require more personal consult-ation, such as mortgage lending or assetmanagement, will probably continue to besold for the most part through banks’ branchnetworks in future. This makes it necessaryfor banks to maintain both sales channels.The vast majority of Germany’s banks arepursuing this multi-channel strategy, whichacknowledges customer preferences. Owingto the potential increase in expenditure, theprofitability of some banks will suffer if banksare not equally successful in using electronicmarketing to extend their s alesactivitiesor toopen up new markets and solicit new cus-tomers (see also “Business considerations be-hind e-banking”, page 46 f.).
Clicks-and-bricks banks, which integrate
Internet/online-based sales with branch-based sales, have the advantage of beingable to make use of an existing customerbase. In addition, such established institutionshave a brand name with a solid reputation onthe market and a stock of goodwill that newcompetitors must first earn. However, parallelsales channels, as explained above, entailhigher administrative costs.

49In addition to pursuing the two-pronged ap-
proach combining bricks-and-mortar oper-ations with electronic sales channels, somebanks have established what are known asdirect banks. They have deliberately soughtto avoid maintaining a costly and labour-intensive network of branches by providingtheir s erviceselectronically 24 hoursa day,seven days a week. These “direct banks” dif-fer from one another in the brand name used(sometimes without mention of the parent in-stitution), the range of products offered andthe degree of personal consultation. Directbanksare under cons iderable competitivepressure, especially owing to the high degreeof market transparency which technologicaladvances have made possible.
Direct brokersare a s pecial type of direct
bank. They specialise in cost-effective secur-ities management, mostly without personalconsultation. Until just a few years ago, thefact that there wasrelatively little privateownership of stocks in Germany kept retailbrokerage from achieving a major break-through. Now, though, in the wake of thelarge waves of privatisation and the early suc-cess of the Neuer Markt, and with reform ofthe system of old-age provision pending,change seems imminent. At the end of 1999,the four largest direct brokers in Germanyhandled 13% of German stock sales. This issomewhat less than the corresponding figurefor the United States(16%).
9A pan-Euro-
pean comparison shows German direct banksto be ahead by a wide margin: all five ofEurope’s largest institutions are German.
10Recently, some institutions have branched offinto other European countries. Moreover,some direct banks, through cooperationagreements or acquisitions, are seeking togain a toehold in other business areas, suchas the insurance or investment business.
If individual banking groupsare compared in

that those institutions, often specialising inbrokerage, have benefited from the dynamicgrowth of securities markets over the pastfew years and the nascent “shareholder cul-ture” in large segments of the German popu-lation.
Characteristicsofe-bankingrelevantto
bankingsupervisors
With business processes becoming increas-
ingly digitised, business models, and, withthem, the risk structure of credit institutions,are changing. The following characteristics ofe-banking are therefore at the centre ofbanking supervisors’ interest.
E-banking ...– transcends sectors and national borders:
owing to the virtual nature of electroniccommerce, the transaction of bankingbusiness is no longer confined to nationalborders. Much the same applies to therelationship between bank products andnon-bank products. That means super-visors will need to cooperate even moreclosely with foreign supervisory authoritiesthan in the past.
– dependson IT: the s ecure and efficient de-
ployment of ICTwill become a crucial stra-tegic factor in the success of electronicbanking. Every stage in the value-addedchain, from development through produc-tion to the marketing of financial prod-ucts, is dependent on IT. Most importantly,thisdependency, coupled with the innova-
tive momentum of the Internet, will in-crease the strategic and operational riskfaced by banks.
– isdynamic: the innovation cyclesfor new
productson the Internet are becomingshorter and shorter due to the rapid paceof technological change. In some cases,the technology behind some products isalready obsolete well before those prod-uctsare ready for marketing, or thos eproductsend up no longer marketabledue to changed customer preferences.
– iscus tomer-oriented: technology and in-
creased market transparency will reducethe previousas ymmetry of informationbetween the bank and its customers.Thus, the existence of the Internet is caus-ing the balance of power on the marketto shift towards customers. Customers arebecoming ever more mindful of thisfactand are expecting not only price advan-tagesbut als o that their e-banking pro-vidersgive them a very high quality ofservice (e.g. round-the-clock availability,short answering times, ease of handling;see chart on page 49).
– enhancescompetition: s everal factors
have conspired to induce this effect. Thegreater ease with which prices and prod-uctscan be compared hasenhanced mar-ket transparency; the market entry bar-riersfor new competitorshave beenlowered; the spatial and temporal con-straints on competition have been re-moved; Internet or online banking cus-

51tomersdis play little brand loyalty; and
e-banking customers are focusing evermore on costs and profit margins.
The change in consumer behaviour and the
competition-enhancing effect of e-bankinghave affected the banks’ risk situation andprofitability, necessitating surveillance bybanking supervisors.
E-bankingrisks
Apart from the above-mentioned opportun-
itieswhich IT innovationshave afforded tobanks and other financial services providers,banking supervisors are primarily studying therisks involved in e-banking. E-banking is caus-ing a shift in the weighting of existing riskcategories towards those risks arising fromthe increased use of IT.
Strategic risks result from (bad) business deci-
sions taken by management. Specifically, thedanger of not being able to keep up withrival technologies is the source of the greateststrategic risk. Technology is so important fore-banking operationsthat there isa corres -pondingly great need to invest in new tech-nologies. Innovators assume most of the risk.It is often impossible to foresee whether anew product will survive on the market orwhether a project can be successfully broughtto conclusion. Failed IT projects can raise theamount of misallocated investment; thus, in-stead of reducing costs, e-banking wouldhave precisely the opposite effect.Therefore, some institutions are pursuing the
strategy of imitation. Such banks not onlysave costs on IT development but also havethe advantage of knowing that a technologyhasproved to be feas ible and that the markethas shown initial signs of acceptance. Amajor disadvantage of this strategy is that ifcircumstances cause the technology to beentered into production too late, the marketsegment could already be occupied.
The specific manner of conducting customer
relations in e-banking presents a key strategicchallenge to a bank’smanagement, s ince, forexample, greater market transparency causesconsumer loyalty to sink. This effect is aggra-vated by what are called “aggregators”,which can prepare individualised compilationsof Internet offers in a single web site. ThisPrudentialsupervisoryaspectsof

52would greatly undercut the value of the sell-
er’sbrand name. Als o, thisclearly limitsbanks’ opportunities for cross-selling.
The rapid pace of innovation in e-commerce
isrequiring banksto make e-banking s trategydecisions as quickly and intelligently aspossible, since technological innovations orchanges in customer tastes caused by “wavesof fashion” often make radical adjustment in-evitable. Frequently there isno way of pre-dicting which technology and which termin-als (e.g. mobile phones, television sets, PDAs)will ultimately prevail.
Missteps in the planning and implementation
of strategy entail considerable risks. The re-sponsibility for these decisions, and also themanagement of these risks, rests with seniormanagement. That being the case, all thatsupervisors can do is to monitor awarenessamong senior managers of the risks as well asmanagement’sability to judge them accur-ately and to respond adequately.
Operational risk in the narrower sense en-
compasses all risks originating directly in busi-ness operations. Important sources of oper-ational risk include technical malfunctions orhuman error, IT problems, fraud and inad-equate organisational structures. If operation-al risk is not managed efficiently, this couldresult not only in financial losses but also indisruptions in banking operations (e.g. a callcentre cannot be reached, or a host system isdown). Operational risk is by no means new;however, the increasing use of IT in recentyearshasbeen making it more and more con-spicuous.The effectiveness of the security infrastruc-
ture, asan important as pect of that oper-ational risk specific to e-banking, is of overrid-ing importance to banking supervisors. Thereisthe threat of data theft through eaves drop-ping, hacking, sniffing or spoofing, or of datacorruption, destruction or misuse. Denial ofservice attacks are another source of risk. In adenial of service attack, servers are floodedwith fake queries, thus overloading the sys-tem and preventing authorised users fromconducting further transactions. Recent inci-dentspoint to another very real threat: a tar-geted virusattack by hackersor crackers .
In spring 2000 major IPOs were fraught with
capacity constraints. The call centres and theIT systems of the institutions involved wereunable to cope with the flood of transactionorders. Owing to a lack of accessibility, somedirect bankswere ordered by the Federal Se-curitiesSupervis ory Office (Bundesaufsichts-
amt f“CZßZr den Wertpapierhandel, orBAWe) to
ensure that the systems would be able tofunction even at peak capacity. Recently,BAWe declared that in the meantime the in-stitutions had improved their accessibilitymarkedly and, in so doing, had successfullycomplied with their obligation to properly dis-charge the securities services they provide.

53misuse of data and about insufficient security
iss till the greates t barrier to the furtherspread of Internet banking, credit institutionshave taken comprehensive measures to re-duce ITrisks and are constantly striving to up-date security standards. Thus, some directbankshave formed a tas k force to exchangeinformation on the risks to banking businessposed by the use of the Internet and to for-mulate strategies to avert them. This May, theCentral Credit Committee (Zentraler Kredit-
ausschuss, or ZKA), approved version 2.2 of
the multibank Home Banking ComputerInterface (HBCI) standard, which integratesfurther business transactions – for instance,in payments and securities business. Thisinterface specification is designed to ensurethat data are transmitted securely over theInternet between customers and banks (en-crypted and secured using a digital signature)regardless of the terminal used.
The fact that not enough customers have
chip card readers is one of several reasonswhy the HBCI standard has so far not becomewidely accepted. Even then, the HBCI stand-ard alone cannot guarantee absolute security,since the real Achilles heel in ITsecurity is thecustomer’s PC or customers’ careless use ofsecurity media (for instance, a customer mayleave hischip card in the card reader althoughhe isnot conducting an HBCI banking trans -action). If a hacker succeeds in breaking intoa customer’s PC using a “Trojan horse”,
12he
may also be able to access that customer’se-banking information. The most recentattacksby hackerson major indus trial corpor-ations’ internal data show just how real andhow dangerousthistype of manipulation is .Like the security infrastructure, the outsour-
cing of IT services, such as software develop-ment, back-office operationsor the market-ing of financial services, contains a certainelement of operational risk. On the one hand,this shift towards outsourcing is to be wel-comed, asit can enhance efficiency and en-ables smaller institutions, with corresponding-ly low budgetsfor IT s pending, to offer high-performance e-banking applicationsaswell.
On the other hand, the very dependence on
third parties such as software providers whichoutsourcing fosters may increase operationalrisk. Also, the banks’ new partners may pos-sess the necessary technical expertise in thetechnology sector but might not be sufficient-ly knowledgeable of the complex, bank-specific risks. Thus, the possibility of banksoutsourcing risky operations without the ITservice providers being fully aware of thebanking risks involved cannot be ruled out.Furthermore, the complexity and thustheoutsourcing risks are increased in those caseswhere bankshave chos en to work with dif-ferent IT partnerswhich are completely inde-pendent of one another.
It is also important for banking supervisors to
bear in mind that the variousnew formsofcooperation between banksand providersof technology are causing completely newbusiness relationships to develop between

54banksand non-banks . Therefore, banksmus t
choose and monitor their partners carefully,and they continue to bear the total responsi-bility for banking risks, even after having out-sourced certain operations.
A further aspect of outsourcing which re-
quiress pecial attention iscompliance withservice-level agreements. Such agreements,for instance, set specific time limits for resolv-ing problems and also ensure regular updatesand bug fixes.
Outsourcing is not a new banking risk, yet
the volume of outsourced operations and thescope of the individual outsourcing agree-mentshave reached unheard-of proportionsin e-banking. The degree of outsourcing per-missible under prudential legislation will bespelled out in a Federal Banking SupervisoryOffice (FBSO) circular, a draft of which hasbeen sent to all banks.
13In it, the FBSO will
explain whether, and if so, under what cir-cumstances the outsourcing of activities com-plieswith the Banking Act. The Germanbanking industry has so far been very circum-spect as far as outsourcing decisions are con-cerned since the banks themselves do notwant to become dependent on individual ITservice providers.
Legal risk derives from the fact that laws gov-
erning the validity and enforceability of elec-tronically concluded agreementsare onlynow being drafted in many countries. In Ger-many, where thisarea hasbeen regulatedfrom a very early stage by the SignatureAct,
14the draft of a Law on the Framework
Conditionsfor Electronic Signatures15toimplement EU Directive 1999/93/EC of De-
cember 13, 1999 was already passed by theFederal cabinet on August 16, 2000.
Generally speaking, the regulatory ap-
proachescontinue to vary from one countryto the other. The resultant uncertainty isheightened in those cases where cross-bordertransactions involve countries where thecredit institution has no physical presence.Additionally, a lack of familiarity with foreignlegal systems leads to risks regarding con-sumer and data protection issues.
Prudential jurisdiction over cross-border busi-
ness activities is also subject to legal uncer-tainty, ashasbecome painfully evident ine-banking. To some foreign banking supervis-ory authorities, the solicitation of customersin their jurisdiction already constitutes a bank-ing operation for which a licence isrequired.Thus, a version of a bank’s website in a cer-tain language could already be construed as abanking transaction requiring a licence in allcountrieswhere that language iss poken.Other authorities, by contrast, only considerthe transaction of business as an operativeaction for which a banking licence isrequired.Consequently, the lack of legal certitudecauses banks to run the risk of violating for-eign laws.

dering crimesin e-banking placesbanksunder a special obligation to comply with duediligence requirementsby verifying the iden-tity and the trustworthiness of their custom-ers(“know your cus tomer”).
Banking business is especially sensitive to
fluctuationsin confidence. Therefore, reputa-tional risk, particularly in a relatively new fieldof business, represents a special challenge forbanks. Customers’ confidence in their bankcan be shaken if the bank is not able to pro-vide secure and trouble-free e-banking ser-vices. The same is true if services such as re-sponding to inquiries or processing orders arenot performed at the speed that customershave come to expect in the “Internet Age”.
Moreover, the impact of a bank’sIT malfunc-
tionson the general public isa feature s pecif-ic to e-banking. For instance, if a bank’s web-based transaction system breaks down, theusers of the service are affected immediately.This sets e-banking systems apart from trad-itional back-office host systems, with whichcustomers do not come into direct contact.
On the downside, banking supervisors must
analyse not only individual risks but alsomacroprudential implications (systemic risk)of e-banking. There isno dis puting the factthat e-banking has changed the risk structureof the banking sector, by, for instance, in-creasing operational risk. Moreover, bankingsupervisors will have to react more quickly inorder to keep up with the torrid pace of in-novation on the Net.On a more positive note, e-banking opens up
new sources of profits to the banking sector,since banks can achieve cross-selling effectsby, for instance, joining forces with non-banks. In addition, the competition-enhan-cing effect of e-banking may encourage as ort of hous ecleaning asfar asthe s tructuregoesby, for ins tance, forcing a bank tostreamline its branch office network. On thewhole, e-banking isbecoming a more andmore important segment for macroprudentialanalysis, and should be given closer scrutinyin future; however, at present this segmentwould not appear to pose any exceptionalsystemic risk.
Prudentialsupervisoryinitiatives
Banking and financial supervisory agencies
have recognised, in the light of the risk situ-ation described above, that they must act in aforward-looking manner to ensure that elec-tronic banking transactions remain secure infuture, too, and to instil in broad segments ofthe public confidence in the applicability ofnew technologies. In their national and inter-national activitiesalike, they mus t take painsto ensure that the risks peculiar to e-bankingcontinue to be monitored adequately while atthe same time taking care not to hinder tech-nological progress unduly. To that end, thesupervisory standards must incorporate tech-nological considerations to a greater extentthan before and must, above all, be readilyadaptable to market developments. Further-more, it must be guaranteed that the pruden-tial strategy is implemented without in-hibiting competition or innovation. Banking

the financial sector in the field of e-banking,asthey are in other areasof prudential s uper-vision, if they are to keep abreast of newtrends. Consumers, too, will be expected totake on greater responsibility in their use ofelectronic media – especially as regards thesecurity infrastructure. In that respect, the“enlightened and responsible” citizen is anessential complement to prudential supervi-sion.
Prudentialsupervisorystandardsfor
e-bankinginGermany
The Banking Act stipulates that all enterprises
which conduct banking business or providefinancial services commercially require a writ-ten licence from the FBSO. It doesnot matterwhether these services are rendered electron-ically or via a traditional branch office. Asaresult, all institutions in Germany which con-duct banking business requiring a licence – in-cluding direct banksand direct brokers– aresubject to routine banking supervision. The“Generally accepted principlesfor computer-aided accounting systems” (Grunds“CZZ5tze ord-
nungsgem“CZZ5ßer DV-gest“CZßZtzter Buchf“CZßZhrungs-systeme, or GoBS)
16adopted in 1995 also
cover e-banking business. However, no spe-cialised prudential requirements that addressthe specific risks of e-banking business existat present.
Given the aforementioned risks and the ex-
pected rise in the volume of e-banking busi-ness, it does not seem appropriate simply totransfer this prudential strategy – devised fora bricks-and-mortar bank – to cyberspace.
For this reason, German banking supervisorsare developing a new strategy tailored to thespecific risks of e-banking.
To that end, among other measures, “min-
imum requirementsfor the conduct ofe-banking activities” must be formulated, inwhich the examination of the ITsecurity infra-structure will play a major role. Moreover, anyprudential standards for e-banking should listfundamental requirementsthat an IT s ecuritystrategy may be expected to meet. Thatwould entail, for instance, requiring the bankto explain itse-banking s trategy and how itfitsinto the bank’soverall bus ines ss trategy.Furthermore, the bank should provide a de-tailed description of the basic features of itssecurity strategy, which would include identi-fying individual risk-relevant components,analysing each component’s risks and usingthese analyses as a basis for developing anddocumenting work instructions. Beyond that,bankss hould be able to indicate the levelof customer education, i.e. how well-versedcustomers are in the correct use of securitytechnology. The general security strategyincludesthe training of IT s taff and the fillingof key positions. Another security strategyrequirement should be that banks provide adetailed rationale for their outsourcing policy.
In addition to these general security strategy
requirements, which, in a sense, define the

However, it will not be enough to conduct
these efforts at the national level; additional-ly, banking supervisors need to cooperate atthe international level when responding tothese challenges.
Internationalcooperationamong
supervisors
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
attachesgreat importance to developing har-monised approaches to the supervision ofe-banking. In keeping with this emphasis, aworking group was established at the end of1999; in cooperation with other supervisoryboardsand the financial s ector, it began bytaking stock of ongoing developments on themarkets and in the supervisory arena with aview to identifying problem areasand to de-termining where supervisors needed to takeaction. The result has been to isolate twomain areas to which banking supervisors willbe paying particularly close attention: first,the adaptation of the Basel Committee guid-ance for risk management to cover the risksspecific to e-banking; second, expansion ofthe current Basel Committee guidance toallow for cross-border cooperation among
supervisors.
17
The Basel Committee is of the opinion thatthe change in the banks’ risk profile causedby e-banking call for an adjustment of theinternational regulatory framework for pru-dential supervision. At this early stage in theframework’sdevelopment, the point isnotto adopt specific regulations or even to de-fine technical standards. Instead, a dialogueshould be held with industry with the aim ofdrafting prudential supervisory recommenda-tions that will set the framework for a soundrisk management strategy. At the outset ofthiswork, the initial emphas iswill be placedon technical security and outsourcing.
As the work in Basel progressed, it soon be-
came evident that the cross-border nature ofe-banking transactions would pose a specialchallenge to banking supervisors. In a seriesof papers, the Basel Committee establishesa framework for cross-border cooperationamong supervisory authorities. These guide-lines, which were translated into Europeanprudential supervisory law by means of EUdirectives
18– and later into German law – are
still in force and, in principle, are applicable toe-banking activitiesaswell. However, thisregulatory framework wasconceived at atime when the technical meansof gainingsuch direct and swift access to foreign mar-kets without simultaneously establishing aphysical presence did not yet exist. This is

58closely correlated with another problem: not
only banksbut non-bank providersof finan-cial productsaswell are capable of s ellingtheir productsacros snational borderson theWeb. The linking of banking business, whichrequiresa licence, to other bus ines sactivitiesfor which no licence isrequired makesbank-ing supervision an even more complex mat-ter.
The fact that the internationally accepted li-
censing terms for banks in the various legalsystems are sometimes based on dissimilardefinitionsof conceptss uch asthe “conductof banking business” (which may differ fromone country to another) may give rise to legaluncertainty concerning the jurisdiction ofsupervisory authorities. Besides this, the im-plementation of national legal regulationsisbeset by what are mainly practical problems:for instance, it is very difficult to prevent en-terprises domiciled in a third country whosesupervisory authority does not cooperatewith the local banking supervisory agencyfrom acquiring access to the home country’s
market or to govern such access. With this inmind, the Basel Committee will study theexisting framework for cross-border cooper-ation among supervisory authorities to deter-mine whether any amendmentswill be ne-cessary to cover e-banking.
The trend in e-banking hasconfronted na-
tional banking supervisory authorities andinternational supervisory fora, like the bank-ing sector itself, with great challenges, thescope of which cannot yet be entirely fore-seen owing to the rapid pace of technologicalinnovation. However, it isbecoming increas -ingly clear that banking supervisors will haveto devote more attention to the use of IT bycredit institutions and its implications thanthey had in the past. In the end effect, thetrend towardsa more qualitative approach tobanking supervision – having prevailed inother areas of prudential supervision – willcontinue to increase here as well.
